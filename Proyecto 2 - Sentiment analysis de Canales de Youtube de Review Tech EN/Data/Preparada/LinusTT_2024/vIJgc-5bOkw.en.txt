Brian is an all-around cool guy he runs a nonprofit summer camp raises three kids with his wife and just look at him wholesome but spending all that time on other people means he hasn't had any time to work on himself and because of that his setup is bad except what this looks great are you lying to me no no the other setup's over there oh oh my God what happened here it's not that bad it's pretty bad man don't worry Brian I'm sure that the setup doctor has a plan I'm sure he
does sorry guys yeah I'd be there if I could um no worries uh reys and I were super confident and I'm sure that nothing will go wrong I'm like stressed out I didn't know that I would have such a visceral emotional reaction some stuff might go wrong but the gain will be worth the pain we got big plans bad cable management it's disease and someone's got to cure it that's why lonus became the setup doctor brought to you by ug green backing up your files has never been easier than
with their Nas sync dxp 4800 plus Nas no matter your skill level the dxp 4800 plus allows you to quickly store up to 112 terab of data learn more and get 20% off for Black Friday until December 2nd by checking the link in the description hi my name is Brian I am one of the directors at a summer camp and I've been doing this for 12 years or so we have three kids who are under the age of eight and we have busy lives so that's my space that I go to work on things and not a lot else I go in there and I
tinker and I leave and I don't spend a lot of time making it look nice I do want to know like what is this this is my first computer how old is this thing this computer is age yourself yeah age yourself this computer is probably like 20 something years old I mean it it it looks it no no no not at all it looks young and spry capable but enough about your old computer what is this new computer this is 10 years newer than that one is okay new new to you I guess this is like our Home Server AKA
this is your server of backup hard drive I don't know if You' follow the channel too much but you know that like we have servers lonus has servers and they break all the time and they're closed but this way if it breaks I can fix it the camp I work at is nonprofit so we can never ever afford Tech so we just inherit people's old computers and then put them in our office and use them but less than 10 years old less than 15 some of them are less than 10 years old that's that's
pretty good it seems like you got a lot of stuff you got like a power supply a like was that an oscilloscope or that's a multimeter yeah the oscilloscope is over here but I don't know how to use they're like handheld now how old is this stuff uh very old my dad gave me this he he's an electrician oh okay he built and designed this from scratch for me so wait what yeah he built he made that see see look it's Brian that's so cool just looking at this place one thing I think that you lack is small
organization we got lots of big shelves but you also just have like a CPU just out and about when it's organized I come in and I go I don't know what to do now okay well we're going to fix that we're going to we're going to teach you how to be organized many have tried and many have failed this series is all about  I'm worried because there's so many I'm like stressed out I didn't know that I would have such a visceral emotional reaction One keyboard uh uh uh two keyboards uh uh uh I put the third
one in there three keyboards uh uh uh that's Ram is DDR it's not ddr2 it's just DDR would you like a Pentium oh my God how old is that logically this doesn't really make sense to me but now that we've removed the stuff from it it looks smaller it does actually look way smaller um that was my problem the desk was just too small okay I'm going to be real with you Brian that is not the only problem here's what I see you have a lot of stuff but no suitable place to put it
all which is why it's all over your desk so to remedy this we're going to build storage into as many parts of the setup as possible new desk withdrawers walls those are going to get pegboards we're going to move your floating shelf over to make room for get this bigger shelf and this table on the left is going to turn into a rollable flex space with get this storage oh and we also threw in a ton of extra goodies for you all right boys let's get to it or rather you guys  it that's very heavy by the way
nothing's too heavy for me ah okay we're good I only I only scraped  skin proba I have these drawers here and then oh yeah we got we got all the space we need now that we know that everything fits we're going to start doing some drilling great is this shelf only held up with like two screws or something uh three okay perfect hey I put a level on top to level it and never took it off never took it off all right we're done the cable we done yeah thank you so much Brian your cable
management upgrade is done it looks so much better in here you good you can tell from the cinder blocks how level the floor is yeah this is um just don't look at the corner don't look at don't look at the lines yeah Brian can you explain this networking situation to me this is our router the Brown Line comes from a building over there which the internet comes from outside of that and then the blue line goes into our house and there's a Wi-Fi rotor and a switch in our house and that goes to the places
the plan is we're going to leave this kind of as it is we might do something to py it up a little bit and we can leave this up there yeah you don't have good Wi-Fi in here though because your actual wireless router is on the other side of this concrete brick okay so I think we can deal with that cuz I think we can get you a small router for like they'll just put on the same network that big old power bar is that going to go under that depends on what you want to do it cuz I I also understand that
like you want to have easy access to just unplug and plug stuff and if that plug is there then I think we could put the power under and then and then that can be like your modular your permanent plugs are under here and then when you need an extra thing you can just put it in the top yeah that s great scus that's the Ikea Peg boards the reason I went with these is because on like thingiverse or printables there's just tons and tons of custom 3D printed stuff that works exactly with this so if you
have to hang like anything that you ever could imagine somebody's probably made a plan and you already got that 3D printer on your desk you'll be able to easily print some stuff didn't you actually do any print any stuff I did oh they probably in a bin over there it's almost like it's almost like we planned this I'm not going to say the thing I was about to say I'm not going to do was gonna say let's get Pagan I definitely drilled the holes for where the uh for where the things are not the so I've
watched all the videos where Elijah puts extra holes in so I now let the homeowners drill holes in their wall is this part of this no this is a computer test bench that we just grabbed for you so instead of having to swap parts in and out of a chassis you can just have functioning Parts on here take whatever you want out of the computer test on here or plug anything in and it'll save you a lot of time and uh look a little bit cleaner while re is going to keep working in the workshop I'm going to
come in here and help cable manage this setup now it looks pretty clean on the top so good job thank you underneath though you don't look under the we could use a little bit of work you know so we're going to just tidy some things up for you and uh make sure that works using our handy dandy magnetic Cable Management arches have you seen this stuff I'm sure big fan he watch the first doctor video too feel free to look through it this is our big huge supply chest we brought
more than we'd ever need are these your headphones uh yeah those are my headphones yes how do they they work fine they don't even well they don't work when they don't play music through them oh I see I mean like they don't even sit on your ears they like well they sit on my ears do they probably basically we just made a big massive tool kit full of every possible length of like every type of cable cuz a lot of what solves your cable management problems is just having the right length
of cable it's not necessary a lot of times you just want to do what you can with what you got but having the right length makes your life a lot easier we just took the paper off of the magnetic plate that we're going to put on here that's about where we want it to be now it's held in there now we're going to just quickly take our screws and put them into the back of the desk don't worry Brian said that this is okay just like that we'll take all her cables put them in and boom Oh it's so
nice and then because they're not like velcroed or tied down or anything if he wants to adjust his monitor or move it these will just pull through nicely should probably vacuum under there but outside of that it'll be really easy cuz there's no cables in the way what's funny is I did vacuum up to the cables yeah oh wow hey look at that that's up safe and secure it's absolutely 100% never going to fall this is amazing this looks so much better already it actually really does so excited for you
and just like that so we we chose a white a white tabletop it only comes in a that size in white but that doesn't matter because we have an LT mod mat that's going to be nice and cover most of the top got everything you'd ever want to know about computers I will never wonder what size a fan is ever again that's great I will say that we don't go back so far back as to have respects for DDR but we do have three onwards so that's good where you want it I don't know if this is where I want it
so it's okay where it is uh yeah I think you're good come up Reese we we'll move it later if we want thank God so I guess it's kind of time to start putting stuff back getting your setup organized so you can take your screwdrivers that's a LTT screwdriver specific one it's designed exactly for us and then we got a bunch of extra hooks so whenever you if if you ever need like one more thing to hang yeah you can just go print them off for like 5 10 cents each like they're cheap
perfect this is your this is your server right this is my server yeah what do you got in there for like a CPU and Stu uh this is an i52400 oh yeah guess what yeah we're upgrading your whole server too oh that's amazing with this new ug green Nas sync dxp 4800 plus so it's a 4bay Nas system but on top of that you get two pcie gen 4x4 slots for m.2 mvme storage and a 5 Core 12 gen Intel Pentium gold 8505 that provides great performance and thanks to the easily accessible back panels you can upgrade
your ddr5 sodm should you find that the included 8 GB isn't enough you can even use the operating system of your choice or take advantage of ug Green's own software which has awesome features like AI categorization of your photos which runs locally on the nas of course and with support for Docker containers you can run pretty much anything you'd want you have an SD card a USBC a USB 3.2 port and on the back you have even more you got 10 gig ethernet a 2.5 gig Port more USB HDMI and then an easy clean
filter for the fan that is behind the back PL amazing this thing is sick you I'm honestly very jealous of you I kind of like this I am jealous of me and look at how much smaller it is yeah well I mean but this yes you're right it's much smaller what we going say what we going to say this has a certain appeal to it but this is very pretty it has a certain yeah uh it has a certain appearance like I want to put this one in my house you can put this anywhere it's is pretty my
wife you know what else is nice ug green has a phone app that you can use to access this remotely it's super easy works really really well as well as it automatically sets up on your network to be remotely accessible it was the easiest setup Reese you set it up right I plugged it in yeah oh yeah mean it like just worked I could access it on the network what we're going to do is that we're going to be able to toss it up here make sure you toss it keep it up yeah it's light too
we're going to try and use the power bar keys that we normally use for power bars but these uh these keys are a bit too bit too thick so we decided to use the power brick holders stra them to the bottom and they're good to go it's actually a bigger power bar so the bigger magnets will actually kind of work our favorite uh I got you a new router like a little if you wanted Wi-Fi out here this just plugged into your router sweet so I figured we just toss it up here tidy this area up a little
bit make it a little bit less Ugo or hide it behind the ug green nass or something yeah I just don't see how this is a good place to put this in this in this exact scenario do you just put it against the wall like with a like the the double-sided magnet part you know what I'm saying that might be it I do want to give it some slack yeah so that if you need to like pull the nass a little bit otherwise it has a I mean it has a barrel Jack is it yeah yeah that's no problem then we'll do that we'll
magnet it to the wall I also got you speakers seriously yeah oh that's awesome so that you can listen to Tunes yeah these are amazing edifier r280 DBS they are great simple budget speakers bookshelf uh they're powered these ones have Bluetooth so you can connect it to your phone or whatever if you have it with your laptop however you want to do that as well as it has speaker wire and uh just RCA they're great great budget speakers there wow that's fun is that all the slack we
got how much more do you need like literally like an inch oh I don't know if I can do that oh oh oh and we're in that wasn't at the cost of a hideous wire just on the wall up there was it yeah no are you saying that because it's true or cuz that's what you think I want to hear  sounds great it sounds amazing heck yeah oh this is going to be so perfect on your desk when if you have a when we have a little like that's so ad little cute little guy we can have a little charger on your
desk you can place your phone but if you're on the go there also a magnetic battery pack does the same thing but  kickstand all right it was a long day but we're finally made done and holy cow  better all right I can't wait to see how this turned  out dude you guys do your best work when   supervise look at this there's barely any cables under there but everything's nicely managed if you need to like hook up your computer you just pull those out we got the new desk tons of storage that
pegboard he's got our new modmat got the mag safe charger there we got your new speakers so you can jam out while you're in here and this new shelf that holds all of your computers so neat and tidy yes if you do and I know you know it's easy to fall into Old Habits you're not going to right no no everything's going to be clean forever everything will be like this yes at least in here I don't care what you do any other room but this one needs to stay clean for you I won't
even use it that's perfect that's what you want and if you do decide to use it and make it messy eventually you have this nice little extra movable table that you can bring on over if you need a little bit extra work space or for anything else and it's got even more storage in there I mean it's still obviously a functional space you know like there's a lot of kind of stuff on the shelves but at least he's got enough shelves to put everything on it's amazing what a Difference Maker a little bit of
organized storage can be this is great yeah great job you guys doesn't it feel good it feels great this is amazing thank you oh yeah and also we got your ug green Nas how can we forget about them thanks again ug green for sponsoring this video whether it's a Nas or a portable battery bank or just a cute little charger they got something for all of your charging needs check them out in the link in the description especially the nas the NASA is really really cool I'm very excited about it
thanks for watching if you liked this video why don't you watch a previous episode of the setup doctor it's just as fun and it's pretty dang cool and REE is in it and everyone loves ree look at him hi and thank you Brian for having us out here yeah thanks for coming in doing this for me I really appreciate it bye bye thank you thanks you green
