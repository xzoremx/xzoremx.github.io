I pulled the trigger on a late night impulse buy again and this time it's a fully automatic Orbeez shooter I settled on the unlocked pistol V2 it comes with a 700 round magazine which I found fits almost 700 rounds a pair of safety "glasses 2,800 BRS of their gel ball" ammunition and a kind of scary charger it looks like a regular USB micro b but it's 7.4 Volts for the integrated lithium ion battery so don't plun this into anything else load them into the magazine pop it in flip off the safety
and then now just like when I was a kid the only problem left is who am I going to play with except unlike when I was a kid I can afford a whole box of them all  match it doesn't actually hurt that bad from a distance but I could tell if you're closer it probably sinks face at this price though I'll let you be the judge
