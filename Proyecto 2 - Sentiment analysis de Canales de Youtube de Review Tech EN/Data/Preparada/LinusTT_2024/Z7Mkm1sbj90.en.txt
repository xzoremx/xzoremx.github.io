to the W show had a great CES this year saw a lot of cool stuff I'm back I flew back I was supposed to be back midnight instead I was back at 2:30 in the morning so I um pretty tired but had a great show ready to talk to you guys about all the cool stuff we saw also wow what is this uh crap there was a topic that I wanted to do oh yes open AI rejects the New York Times lost suit that we talked about last week says that copyrighted material is necessary to llms therefore we had to use it yeah
that's going to be our headline topic today we'll have a little bit of discussion about that what else we got Luke video games are no longer the biggest entertainment medium in Britain really wamp wamp for all of us really to be completely honest so yep uh also valve cracks down on fan projects those are what you picked what else what else would I pick I wouldn't have guessed I was thinking maybe the oh the eBay one's Biz wizard what even is that one oh it's bizarre like eBay eBay
people like harassed people like mailed them animals and stuff because yeah no it's a whole thing well yeah well they settled like it's a thing who yeah we'll talk about that they  settled  okay we got to talk about that the show is brought to you today by Wicked cushions check out Wicked cushions at the link down below or check them out on your face well your face sorry my face or yeah yeah uh Dan Dan got some too but um he doesn't get to have them yet you don't get to check out my face yeah
we'll do this we'll do the sponsor we'll do the sponsor read later and then we'll we'll give him his why don't we jump right into our first topic today which is open ai's defense against the New York Times lawsuit they publicly called the copyright claim against them meritless and disappointing yes according to open AI the only way the times could have gotten chat GPT to produce verbatim sections of their copyrighted text that it was trained on would have been by manipulating the
prompts with the specific intent to get that kind of result what meanies what what mean people open AI has also recently stated that it would be impossible to create a useful llm without some amount of copyrighted material because most forms of human expression are either copyrighted or extremely  meritless and also disappointing I did I didn't do anything wrong because I had to do it I had to do it yeah if I hadn't done it otherwise how would I have built this business and made all
this money if I didn't steal the plutonium I couldn't have made the bomb right so now we've got the bomb and what you want me to apologize for taking the plutonium that's meritless I mean I I'm sorry I kind of I kind of okay I set this up as the headline topic and I made it like the title of the stream and everything cuz I was kind of thinking be able to Riff on this for a while but it really does seem kind of open and shut doesn't it uh your honor um you know given that the desired result was for
him to be dead uh I'm afraid there was simply no way to do that without killing him therefore this murder trial is both meritless and if I could speak frankly disappointing and we know guys we know that them saying meritless and disappointing we're at different points in time whatever we're we're yes it doesn't matter clearly laughing the point is that open AI clearly has no actual defense whatsoever or or this is Sam Alman playing 5D chess coming up with the worst possible argument that he
can up front so that the New York Times lawyers will go all right well why don't we knock off for yeah why don't we knock off for a month lunch and uh we're just going to cruise into the courtroom say uh yo your honor they're the bad guys and everything will be fine and we're going to win this thing like maybe they have some kind of some kind of Ace up their butt crack that is incredible it's   nuggets I was like where is he where is he possibly going with this one well
there's certainly no diamonds there I'll tell you that for sure oh man oh boy they should probably they should probably use chat GPT to come up with a better defense oh oh no that would be really interesting man I love that I'm trying to think of like oh like I know  I like you can't possibly charge me with corporate Espionage I mean if I didn't take the current stuff everything else is everything that's that's not currently under NDA is old like I I come on I'm going to ask chat GPT what its
legal defense is in this situation and see what it says okay I'm very excited for this it's going to take me a sec uh in the meantime hey guys it's really good to be back we're going to be talking about a lot of AI stuff that we saw down at CES we actually only did a handful of ltts we did some of those sponsored ones before the show um we've got a couple of ones that I'm really really happy with the one from the Intel Booth today if you haven't watched it go watch it it's awesome uh it talks a
little bit about Thunderbolt 5 um a little bit about this cool new feature called Thunderbolt share uh the title for that video is 100% not clickbait um that whole room was under NDA until I went in checked it out and I was like please can we talk about this and there was a process and they pretty much got the business unit head in the room with me a couple days later and I kind of made my case I kind of went look I have this idea in my head for a piece that I want to do on
connectivity uh because frankly what am  lake so let's talk about moving data around really fast which is something that Intel is really flipping been good at what I want to talk about is Thunderbolt 5 I want to talk about Wi-Fi 7 which is it anyone else just is anyone else's jaw on the floor over how Wi-Fi 7 snuck up on us Wi-Fi in general seems to be moving very fast Wi-Fi 7 came out of it feels like absolutely nowhere my first real like oh I am very interested in this technology happened when I was
on set holding a Wi-Fi 7 access point and a Wi-Fi 7 device watching them transfer speeds at it speeds in excess of 2 3 gbit per second I'm sitting here going what the heck are you freaking kidding me a w a Wi-Fi upgrade that actually upholds the promises it makes about next gen performance this is incredible uh so I made my case look I want to talk about moving data around really fast and I feel like Thunderbolt share is really critical but I need you guys to answer some deeper questions
because the first time I was in there even when I wasn't going to be making a video about it yet I was like okay but like how what's the data path and they're like we can't tell you any of that um I still had to do a little bit of educated guess workk so its early days all of the software is in Alpha super cool go watch the video uh but the other really big one that I'm super proud of is we did a video on kind of the the evolving situation around uh connectors on the back motherboard so
Asus BTF uh MSI project stealth I think they call it and then gigabyte project no project Zer I can't remember I think gigabyte's project stealth MSI project zero um and then there's now an ecosystem that's developing for these products Corsair has two cases that natively support these rear connector motherboards and we kind of fleshed it out into a full LTT by tearing down the demo PC in corsair's booth and then rebuilding it as the video kind of talking about there's one key thing I
missed and I feel stupid for not mentioning it in the video now but um how there will be some challenges moving this to 100% adoption no matter how good it is no matter how many industry Partners support it and that's that it adds a bunch of clearance on the back of the motherboard especially with stiff connectors like front usb3 especially front USB 3 type-c um that just isn't there on budget cases that that want to be as as narrow as possible in order to save on materials
so that's that's something I didn't cover but other than that it's it's pretty thorough that one's going to be really good and then the other kind of big production that I did on the floor like not a short circuit like a full LTT was a Roundup of I think we ended up hitting about 10 AI booths and I'm talking AI duct taped to a bicycle AI duct tape to a computer mouse uh like what's AI integrated into a monitor what what would an AI monitor be luke I challenge you to tell me cuz he
wasn't at the show this year so this is all going to be fresh for him cuz it's not like he you know pays attention to Tech news or anything he's got the W show for that yeah I saw the rabbit um and I do want to talk about that yes we'll definitely talk about the rabbit but I don't know like picture picture quality profile settings changing dynamically with content yeah I know you're not even close so we'll talk about that in a bit all right in the meantime I've stalled long enough Luke what did chat GPT
suggest for open AI defense it suggested six different approaches wow something that I think is actually quite interesting is that one of them actually somewhat lines up with what happened uh which is public interest uh argue that the development of AI has significant public interest benefits like advancing technology Education and Research which might be considered in the context of fair use wow okay what else has it got well it also says fair use in general transformative use minimal use public
interest no direct copying and precedent and legal ambiguity no direct copying says emphasized that AI that the AI model doesn't store or reproduce verbatim copies of the text but generates new original content based on the patterns learned during training okay so there's some more plausible defenses in there yeah other than sorry your honor we had to do it otherwise how would we have achieved our goal yeah what what do you even mean yeah I mean some of them are basically
that with extra steps but I think they more or less all are but it is what it is all right well yeah good luck good luck with that you guys what do you want to do next um let's see here okay it is going good uh What other main ones do we do you want to just jump into CES I I I'd love to yeah let's just do it yeah let's jump right into CES um okay we'll talk about I think let's let's talk about the rabbit R1 this ended up being a surprise hit and uh i' I've got to say I am still surprised um
their video has 3.7 million views up in here uh what no stop I don't not what do you stop not right now comments turned "off 3-day old video 7.4 4,000" subscribers 3.7 million views 3 7 million views uh this launched as a uh it was as a Kickstarter is that right or some kind of some kind of crowdfunded device I can't remember no I don't think it did I don't think so no it didn't I think it just launched for sale basically it's a $200 palm-sized device co- co-designed with teenage engineering
"that sold out its first batch of 10,000" units in just 24 hours and the second batch sold out a day later and I would forgive you for asking asking I'm sorry what is it exactly it is part of this is from our notes an emerging class of devices that are essentially dedicated hardware for AI assistant so the first example that we've talked about on the show of this which is the Humane AI pin is $700 and seems to be um not especially functional um so that's the one that has the little
projector so that you can uh see a of virtual screen on your palm I mean we don't know yeah does anyone have one yet the Humane pin not that I'm aware I don't think so right yeah there's another one called the tab that I have to confess I have never heard of and I wouldn't have clicked on this headline  headline Sor replace God superpower tamagachi also what is up with these ads can't even see anything uh cool any who uh thanks Fast Company um and then of course there's the rabbit so the R1 runs
rabbit OS and doesn't have apps instead it's large action model so kind of like large language model in this case it's it's a model of of actions uses Computer Applications like a human does so the product demo showcases common use cases like ordering food but in theory you can manually train it to do any task by explaining what you're doing as you record your computer screen that's actually pretty interesting so theoretically if you show it how to um buy Tide Pods because you're a hungry
Millennial then it would be able to open a web browser navigate to you know Amazon or whatever website is good to get oh everyone's pointing out you saw ads I don't know what they were for that's that's pretty good I I you only saw them because you literally yeah you literally could not see the thing you needed to see if you gave me if you told me I could have a million dollars if I could tell you what those ads were for I would have to give up the million dollars I have absolutely no
idea that's pretty good okay I do occasionally see them but in this case honestly I don't know what they were you could see the content yeah I have no idea um okay what are we supposed to be talking about right now right right right so you could you could show it how to how to kind of navigate through the cart through the checkout process and place an order for you which um raises some concerns for me I mean giving a device sort of that will hopefully do exactly what I want it to do this kind
of access to to logged in applications and services to to to take actions on my behalf definitely gives me a little bit of unease um but assuming that it actually works as well as it should I mean it's basically Auto hotkey but with AI if you kind of think about it which raises a question like oh why not just make this an app founder Jesse Le explains that a because you get more clout this way it's true and B not wrong because opening a phone app to make it do things on other apps that you have
installed seems kind of awkward uh Riley says okay look hey Riley added something to the do Riley does help with the do I just mean got a little commentary thing here uh I appreciate the vision of a device that changes what it looks like to do computer phone stuff instead of hunching over a screen tapping little buttons while ignoring people around you uh you just tell your little Tamagotchi Pokey decks to do something and it does it it totally could have been an app um but maybe it shouldn't be an app says
Riley and you can't deny the cool design the last line from Riley is a huge part of it for me Teenage engineering was a part of this therefore this killed I think that's where a lot of this lands it looks really cool it looks super cool and I think in an era of the most boring rectangles we've ever had um with as much touchscreen things as possible having physical stuff push to talk mic flip the camera around thingy physical device it's an actual thing that I can have I think a lot of people
are gravitating towards that dbrand apparently has a skin coming because of course they do um on that note yeah another example of that that was from our AI Roundup video that I walked into thinking was stupid and walked out of very close to wanting one was this uh AI voice recorder so what it does is it just transcribes voice to text and then at the end it or or then it transfer sorry first it records audio then it transfers the audio to your phone it transcribes it Voice to
Text style then it creates uh like a like an index of the main topics whether it was a meeting or a phone call or a job interview or whatever it was and stores it which is like okay don't you have otter or some other some other you know uh large language model assisted uh voice recognition and transcription software for your phone don't you isn't there an app for that but bear with me here I kind of went okay why does this need to exist and they said well a number of reasons first of all the
iPhone does not support call recording why call recording is not supported on the iPhone is I don't know because you I guess you know Apple things or something I I don't know but it's not and one of the modes that it operates in is specifically designed to to tune the microphones for recording calls so having it sitting on the back of your phone it it goes on with Meg saafe having it sitting on the back of your phone means you can be on a call you just hold a button till it buzzes
you are now recording the call so in many places so to those of you freaking out about this in many places it is legal with single party consent so just your own consent to record a call uh including here and there have been I got to say numerous times in my life when having a recording of a phone ation would have been extremely helpful either because the other party didn't remember because the other party misre misrepresented it or because I didn't remember what took place on the call and
what everyone had agreed to it would have been great to be able to go back in time and go okay what did actually what did actually happen where did this miscommunication happen I'm sure we've all been in that spot before you hold it for longer it buzzes twice and the call recording ends uh it'll do I think it was 30 hours is RA rated so who knows but it's rated for 30 hours of continuous recording and it's like this thin it's like it's it's crazy thin it just kind of sits on the
back of your phone and you can put it in like a little wallet seve share power with the phone or something uh no no no it just has a little tiny little tiny battery in it and it uses Pogo pins to to charge but just with a standard USB connector um and then there was yeah and I kind of I kind of came away from it going yeah so now I have the ability to not drain my phone's battery with an additional app I don't have to Fumble with an app on my phone I can record calls on a phone that doesn't out of the
box support call recording and if my phone is dead outright I can still record stuff copy the audio files onto my computer or sync them with my phone later and and i' and I've got it I can still record a meeting or whatever the case may be and you know what it's the kind of thing where not everyone's going to need that but people who do need it just having it that's freaking awesome so I I so yeah I I walked in going well this is silly this could just be an app and I walked out going yeah
the app is like the that's like the crappy version of this you know and those guys that's where that's where I got my wires crossed those guys just raised like millions of dollars on Kickstarter so that yeah that's that's so interesting so we're all going to external devices I know right what the heck was going into the phone and now we're bringing back the talk boy 2024 is the start of things coming out of the phone I I mean I guess I think most people are still going to use the Consolidated device but
I mean do you know how many people I saw walking around the show with pointand click cameras really yeah and I don't even necessarily mean obvious media you know who are holding you know a little mirror lless or something you know a and and you know a shotgun mic with a dead cat on it or whatever I'm I'm talking people just you know taking pictures and it's actually very nice not being on your phone all the time even if you're doing things that you would normally do with your phone 100% cuz like you're
taking pictures you're sitting there but notifications are popping in whatever else is happening you're draining your phone's battery you're doing all this kind of stuff it's like uh I definitely have some concerns about privacy with devices like this the uh the recorder is powered by chat GPT ah cool so yep hopefully if you're using one of these you don't work at a three-letter agency but that's honestly that's a big thing with um I mean it's been been a big thing with llms this whole time but with
both the rabbit and this uh and and I mean theoretically the AI pin and the tab or whatever as well but like okay so I can record actions uh what if I start doing my time sheet with rabbit yeah that's some external device accessing company documentation and put inputting something that's like a legal process to a certain degrees that affects compensation that is like directly it's actually a huge deal money yeah cuz you would totally do that look look at look on his face 100%
he's not even going to pretend to deny it but on the security side it's like actually too big of a deal I would love to do that yeah but like I no no it's like there's a lot of different Chrome extensions that can help you with like email that can help you with all this other kind of stuff and then you look through what you have to share with the Chrome extension it's like it's a little scary maybe I better just learned to type faster maybe no yeah exactly yeah yeah uh I think a big
one that we should talk about is the bike with chat GPT did you see that  no that was the product that inspired the the sort of round up of silly AI integrated products at CES and believe it or not when I walked out of the booth I wanted one not because I would actually use it I'm not actually going to buy one man you getting sold on things at CES that aren't monitors or computers is actually weird I got sold on this thing hard it's a bike it well it's an ebike okay with
200 k range wow yeah so this thing you could like commute from the BBS on it yeah like incredible range okay and it's not just a bike with chat GPT bolted to it it's a bike with an API that can interface with other products that have apis and it's not some like vaporware nonsense thing this is their second generation and the product fundamentally already exists and is already being used in useful ways so actually speaking of ways uh one of the Integrations that they have is with I
forget what it's called but this mapping software that's really popular in Europe for cyclists okay um because apparently Google Maps for for cycling is just just trash in Europe and there's this other one that everyone uses or something like that and so buddy at the booth basically goes yeah so right now we support J chat GPT 3.5 I think is is what they're on right now so you basically just press you hold this button and you say um I am I'm in city is this it no oh wait yes that looks a lot like
the display yeah yeah that's it yeah okay but no the models were different that's why I got confused cuz the models are not cord they're they're something else okay yeah so they're new products uh but yeah yeah that's the company though and so so basically the demo is okay um chat G I'm chat gbd I'm I'm looking for somewhere to eat uh plot a course to here and through the API access to chat GPT it can handle the like language interpretation and and voice to text and then through the API
integration with this mapping app it can set a course and through API integration with apple Health it can monitor your heart rate off of your Apple watch and dynamically adjust the motors to help maintain your flipping heart rate as you're going up and down random like stay zone two the whole time and I'm sitting I looking at this thing going so this is basically it has all the right it has all the control of a stupid stationary peltin stupid thing in your living room but all the actually being
outside and a bicycle if you're commuting somewhere going to get groceries or whatever else you're like actually doing something and all the and all the range of a freaking you know moped this is this is something I've been interested in with all of these with all of these devices but someone in someone in Philippine chat Doo just said imagine how it'll [Laughter] hallucinate sorry I can't do that his heart rate is really low make it work so yeah what's cool about it is just that it has an onboard is
essentially it's it's a smart bike you know two years ago it would have been called smart bike and three or four years ago it would have been called 5G bike of the future do Wonder like and and seven years ago eight years ago it would have been called iot bike yeah you know so to an extent it's just a new name for fundamentally the same idea which is which is global connectivity right between all of our devices and and the services that we use but the AI the chat GPT element of it is kind of what
ties it together because realistically biking is not exactly a uh a handsfree use case yeah so being able to use my voice kind of important so that that's what I was going to kind of ask is is I've been wondering how a lot of these devices are going to beat beat the hallucinations and I'm kind of wondering if this one might be beating it by actually limiting how much the Chachi BT side of this is actually even doing cuz like if it's if it's changing how much the motor is helping you based on your
heart rate mhm chat GPT doesn't even need to be involved with that at all it would be at no point that's a completely separate probably all it's doing is using its voice input if anything um like a lot of the different not ways it's it's some other one whatever it is yeah whatever mapping integration they have um it it's very likely it's not even using jat GPT to do anything with that um so what is it what is it actually using chat gbt for for uh Voice to Text essentially yeah as far as
I can tell you can also just like ask it questions and interact with it if you want to right right like you can cycle through different standard yep and I mean people are raising all kinds of great questions okay right Linus but what happens when they brick this thing then you have an ebike with 200 km range hopefully I mean yeah um or or hopefully they open it up or or you know something uh and like Linus would you really want you know some Network to have your freaking heart rate and and where you are and
all the food you ate and no but a lot of people won't care yeah and for them cool bike bro you're already giving a lot of that information in a lot of these situations which doesn't make it right doesn't make it good but ah yeah but it makes it it kind of is what it is um got another question here from someone in float plane chat Andra speaking of things L was sold on getting that doesn't include  uh oh that okay no I'm not sure where you're going with that I thought you were asking about the monitor so we
uploaded the short circuit of the product that I was talking about that gave me a bigger gaming Advantage than anything I've probably touched in the last 10 or 15 years and what's that um it's the 360 HZ OLED gaming monitor now look I what game are you playing Halo infinite you got it at 360 FPS um not quite 360 but really high okay and you don't it's not necessarily about that it's it's about the motion Clarity of this display I have talked in the past about the about the limited rate of return as you go
from or the the the the the reduced return going from 60 to 120 then from 120 to 240 then from 240 to 360 or even 480 HZ right like the the the difference between all of those it becomes less and less and less and less but the low persistence the image Clarity the motion Clarity of this display is incredible like dude I couldn't miss and this is this is over this is over two different sessions with the monitor because first I recorded the you weren't just like on one day I
recorded the video that was sponsored by Samsung display on the panel Tech we uploaded that to LTT uh during the show actually did really well and it was like it was your perfect sponsored video because Samsung basically went um we have money to Market this uh we think it's really really great so here's our bag of marketing money um we'd like you to thank these Nobel Prize winners for the amazing research and development that they've done to make this technology possible um please um discuss
you know some of the advancements that we made in our like pico freaking um inkjetting process for you know increasing the pixel density and um otherwise see you later so we we pretty much just made the video we would have made anyway yeah and included some Shadows that are cool anyways and included some Shadows that were cool anyway and uh I got an opportunity to check these things out before I would have gotten a chance to which I love anyway so it was it was it was an ultimate kind of win-win-win and
part of that shoot was over two different sessions so first while we were doing the shoot and then after the shoot I actually got like on a little bit as well with no audio I was sitting there putting together like five kill streaks then things got really interesting because I was just on the LTT Benchmark account that time which is not ranked at all right so and I'm not saying that my personal account is super ranked up or anything either but it is ranked like I am it was pretty good at
one point yeah yeah it's been a long time though yeah yeah but but it it's it's a lot it'll it'll matchmake me with different people than the LTD Benchmark account so during the short circuit I was signed into my account because we had some issues with our Microsoft credentials for LTT benchmarker or actually it was for um whose was it I think it was ploofs it was ploofs account cuz he was the one who was working on the other monitor the previous day or something like that so I
was left signed into my own account and same thing both on camera and off camera dude I just I couldn't be stopped and the thing is you're probably watching that going man I've seen you know I've seen comp compilations that are like so much better than this right but that's that's the thing I'm not that good you guys have seen me play video games many times over many years and it's not not about it's not about just the hurts because you can make a very strong argument for there being a certain
number of hurts past which there there could not possibly be any perceivable difference to a gamer because our reaction times are measured in milliseconds so if the difference between Min are getting slower yeah the difference between one Monitor and another is 2 milliseconds or one millisecond or a fraction of a millisecond you're not going to you're not going to notice that right but it's the constness of the input that you're getting and the a better ability to track a moving object which we've talked
about before and also said there's a limited return on that continued investment but that combined with the motion Clarity yeah is what really changed the game for me because every single frame is a crystal clear image now what's interesting or further interesting uh what's also interesting is that Nvidia is working on their own approach to solving this that does not involve OLED and that they claim it's hard for me to tell because I didn't have them side by side but but it's
really good but they claim gives even better low persistence like even better motion Clarity than this 360 HZ OLED and that's um shoot I forget what they're calling it but that's on in the short circuit video where we do an we do the world's first unboxing of the 480 super uh so we we get through kind of the the super lineup and then we move over to their new g-sync demo and basically what Nvidia has figured out Pulsar that's it what Nvidia has figured out is it called gsync Pulsar or Nvidia Pulsar what
nvidia's figured out how to do is combine variable refresh rate with backlight strobing or essentially what on an OLED would have to be like black frame insertion so with with backlight strobing to eventually like shine a snapshot of the most clear still of that frame at your eyes then turn off the backlight while the pixels are all shifting so this is on an IPS type display and so you do get some overshoot artifacting um so I talk in the video about how the character model and the text above their
head kind of has a ghost in front at the Leading Edge right interesting um because you're seeing the beginning of that transition oh that's really I wonder if subconsciously if you're going to detect what way things are moving that way but the well that's not new that's not new what's new is just that the the image the main image is super clear and that you can do it with vrr now which they couldn't before because I mean man like think about that backlight strobing with variable refresh rate
means that you have to drive the pixel change differently according to the different color shifting between because all the transitions are different speeds then you have to drive them at different voltages depending on for how long that frame will be displayed cuz it could be different from one frame to the next like what but it looks like they've cracked it uh I do think personally just having seen some of those motion artifacts that I would prefer the OLED approach even if
the motion Clarity isn't quite as good but Nvidia seems to think that for Competitive Gaming their solution is going to be the better one um but you know it all remains to be seen this'll be locked in gsync um so you'll have to have yeah you'll have to be on Nvidia yeah I mean yeah that's the goal yeah that's that's that's what Nvidia is all about make sure you get get g g g get get in that ecosystem so I I was I was blown away man Samsung display is crushing it right now and that alien
wear 360 htz whatever plof says about the the the bigger 240 HZ one I uh you guys got to do some blind test well we can't CU they're different sizes so we so his his is 4K and uh 32 in 31 and a half inches or something like that the one that he likes better and 240 Herz and the one I like better is the 1440p 360 HZ 27 in and there's like there could be a number of reasons that I was Finding that one better it's obviously going to run at higher frame rates so I'm going to have
less latency from that in addition to the monitor refreshing more frequently uh pl's a better gamer than me like it's not close he's he's a significantly better gamer than me so maybe it's one of those things where I need every Edge that I can get um I also found that having not gamed on a small monitor like not like really tried you know like it like it just started it just started happening so well I was like like I got kind of into it um and I haven't really done that in a long time like my monitor
at home's 38 42 in or something like that so I haven't used a small monitor in a while and there's a reason that competitive Gamers use them you can you can see everything yeah I don't I don't like first of all I actually like 1440p as a resolution for a desktop monitor I don't I genuinely don't think I even want beyond that like I've I've seen the comparison I don't think I care I care more about like panel quality stuff like that in a TV sure yeah whatever but I'm talking monitor um and Beyond 27 in I
find starts to become like just unreasonable for gaming um yeah there's other people in the chat that are you see again in FP plane chat says yeah 27 in for me is The Sweet Spot yeah I agree I know PL plays a lot of more Scenic games as well though and when you be for that if you're not talking competitive you're if you're talking immersion forget about it and if you're if you're 27 in like is like looking out through a submarine port hole uh you know at the world compared to you know
like a giant Ultra wide or something like that and if you're trying to lounge and like get immersed sure 100% um but I don't know I that's I think that's one of the reasons why I like 27 in is because it's kind of on the maximum threshold I would say of the competitive side so you get a little bit of both I find of course the topic we're supposed to be talking about right now is AI at the show so why don't we talk about the aiit what the heck I would like you without looking at chat what's
the point I would like you to try to get it I genuinely have no idea it has some kind of neural processor in the monitor itself okay I will give you a hint it is nothing to do with image quality yeah that was the only I tried to dive on that um nothing to do with image quality nothing to do with image quality you like change inputs by speaking to it that's a cool idea no no not even a little okay um does it have anything to  no would you like another hint yeah okay it's from
MSI well that's a hint what does MSI do okay it's from it's from msi's gaming division can you control like After Burner profiles or like launch games no can you change RGB profiles um there's an RGB element okay is it like uh whatever MSI software thing on your desktop and you can  no really run a note of ideas he's so frustrated this is great okay why don't I tell you before before you look before you look at anything why don't I tell you the RGB element and then I'll see if
you can guess the rest okay sure okay so um using using their AI I processing that is built into the monitor it's not like a like an external soft piece of software you run in your computer so it's it's in the monitor is it wait just one sec does this have to be web connected then no I don't think so so it's local I believe so okay that's kind of neat all right okay so so using that um it has like an RGB light bar at the bottom of the monitor that can that can mirror your health bar 
Legends this poor brain is just completely broken over there's just so many things that it's so unnecessary for it to be done this way oh this isn't the only product that I feel like that about to be very clear um do you just control what information the light bar is doing through the thing so here's what it does okay it monitors elements on screen yeah and like because there's no there's to my knowledge okay there's no API ability to do that so yeah so it monitors a certain thing and
so it's yeah you tell it hey look here and if it looks like this or like that or like that change the light bar Behavior like whatever so it would be a way for you to have like a flashing notification if you're and and that is honestly could be very easily used for cheating um okay we're getting there all right okay would you like to know what it does what oh I thought we just figured that out oh that's what they a light bar does for now okay would you like to know what the
monitor does what does the monitor do so the demo they had running see the smile on his face right now it's about to be gone yeah I'm sure the demo they had running was monitoring the mini map area and anytime an opposing hero approached your viewport it would pop up a a a circle with an arrow indicating on the screen where they were on the screen completely independent of any software running on your PC so as far as I can tell completely impossible to detect cuz it's drawn on top of the image coming from
yeah wow uh I wonder if anti-cheats are going to have to use like uh Hardware detection antiche and just ban those screens they don't do much anyways but you yeah but you can you can spoof the edid of a monitor very easily yeah yeah there's no way that'll help we are going to have to have flipping a camera you're going to have to have a dedicated camera it doesn't always solve the problem like plugged into your computer pointed at your freaking screen and your hands doesn't always solve the problem well if
it's pointed at your hands and your screen there's still ways it's it's going to be better it yes you will be able to so they're going to have to have their own AI that checks for any motion or any key press that doesn't correspond to what's happening are there are um cheating softwares out there that are designed for when your chat asks you to point a camera at the screen um um it has a mode for that yeah but what about the the hands too yeah well they they don't they won't be aim hacking at that
point in time I don't actually think aim hacking is super popular these days cuz it's easier to detect than a lot of other F I just I think a webcam pointed at your hands and the SC I mean continuously oh yeah I don't mean sometimes I mean like the anti-che software is continuous video feed continuously monitoring the video feed wow yeah like that's she that's the only solution at this point it's it's an actual cheating monitor that's amazing I um yeah multi multiplayer games right
now are just plagued completely plagued with cheaters um tarov because I like talking about tarov when it comes to cheaters because there sure do be a lot of them and it's a really brutal game to have them in um they just did a band "wave of 11,000 players and people were" responding to the Tweet of this bandwave with screenshots of like extremely obvious cheating still going on and like there's one where it's like uh the flea market in the game which is like effectively like an auction house or a
or a trading post or whatever you want call Market or a flea market yeah interesting we definitely needed some alternate names for that well no no like I'm saying it works the same way no I know it's just a continuation of that thing you did last week where you were like what's a word for whatever I don't know maybe that word you just said I can't remember what it was me neither um oh man yeah yeah um yeah there's you can see people's profiles on there so you can see someone
like oh this person's like level 12 and they've sold like billions of Rubles worth of stuff on like yeah probably not um I don't know it's a thing precedence  it anyways so yeah I thought you'd be I thought you'd be pretty ticked off yeah that's sick yeah cheating monitors especially because that cheating has I think I I would wager that cheating has probably been the worst in the first person shooter space Shooters in general probably I don't know I mean I think it's pretty bad everywhere in it yeah
there's map hacking in like top down games like StarCraft one like have like map hacks like if you could just see you remove fog of War everything that's like an insane advant but don't think have been popular I know one of the ways this this actually seemed really smart to me I think this was League of Legends I don't remember who it was one of the ways that they helped push against map hacking is the server oh I might say this wrong if you're interested in this look it up
because I'm probably going to say some part of how this works wrong but I I I'm going to try um the the edge of your fog of War if another player isn't within a certain distance of it the server will not tell you where they are so you you actually can't map hack the whole way interesting but if they are with you could map hack a little bit yes and then have a monitor that can check from your mini map then you could get an extra another big one for this for me in my opinion uh
yeah rocket League cheating in rocket League yeah there there are ways to cheat in rocket league but I think it's a little bit more blatant um what was I going to say yeah something that's crazy about this is the monitor notification could probably linger so if someone just like barely comes on screen for a second and you know you're playing so you're not staring at the mini map 100% of the time you might not have seen it the monitor notification is going to be bigger and could probably persist for
more than that like one second so yeah I don't know that's rough so cheating has been around since the beginning but I strongly believe it's worse now than it ever has been my reasoning for that um is the barrier of Entry is zero right now the barrier of Entry right now is a credit card that's it you don't need to know anything back in the day you kind of needed to know what you were doing you kind of you had to work to find them now there's like ads on YouTube like it's it's crazy now
it's blasted in front of your face constantly uh there's no barrier of Entry at all you just have to pay for it um it's it's never been easier to just get another copy of the game either a lot of games are yeah that's another barrier right like there's there's another layer on top of it um and yeah I I think it's it's it's just very rampant right now so the solution is in-person gaming events yeah or beauty contests yeah bring LS back uh speaking of lands I I told chase
today it's going to be it's going to be another probably four or five months before the Badminton Center is built so I was thinking we should do another land at my place maybe like a bit lower key hope I don't get sick for two months this time yeah uh maybe just just the basement this time nice but um oo okay I talked to high sense okay this is not an AI top good Lord we could talk about CEs probably for the entire show never do any merch messages never do any other topics sick um I talked to high
sense about getting handson with their 110 in and they're apparently going to work on it this thing is wild double the peak brightness of the TCL which you saw who "double 10,000 nits Peak" brightness double the local dimming "zones of the TCL you saw 40,000 dimming" zones which I mean it already wasn't really a problem I I didn't see the the classic black desktop background white mouse cursor scenario but in watching a variety of different movies uh it didn't seem like a
problem and uh what what else is there that's I mean that 90 uh Porto in floatplane chat bro wants a flashbang yeah more like a flash the whole time yeah oh uh oh Dan Dan's messaging me um oh speaking of um speaking of things that we could do the whole the whole time uh without talking about um merch messages let's do some merch messages oh is that what he no that's not what he messaged me about uh Dan I don't know I don't know what it  new uh oh I I don't know uh uh oh it should redirect it should
redirect it should be fine yeah nope I just don't know what it is I can send it to you no I was just using Google login before uh yeah it was using both but I I can send it to you can you just okay well fine whatever uh the point is merch messages are the way to interact with the show don't send a super chat or a twitch bit send a merch message all you got to do is go on LTT store.com and in the cart there'll be a little box whenever we're live where you can leave a merch message you can send a
little popup for you know your friends or your mom who's watching be like hi Mom or you can have producer Dan read your mer merch message and either forward it to someone at the company who can help find an answer for you respond to it himself or curate it for me and Luke to address later in the show so Dan's going to show you guys how it works by firing over a couple of merch messages to us and I'm going to try and get my bloody dashboard open and it will be I sent it to your email that should
be on that laptop and it will be  Flakes do you want me to read you one or do you want to get logged in first seriously that's the password well gee I guess I don't blame myself for not remembering that I didn't said it skill issue uh okay let's see but it is bad we should change it at some point don't forget you can just close those tabs and Scoot right down to the curated close those tabs yeah just click on incoming um the thing at the top he's so bothered I like to scroll you know what
I'm not going to do it there you go got him okay all right hit me Dan sure I've been using an LG OLED TV for a few years now and have been thinking of upgrading for someone wanting a larger display  TV so it's tough right I was using a TV as my monitor for a bit there I even went as far as getting my hands on the service remote for the LGC whatever C1 I think was what I was C C10 I was running something at the time um which ended up upsetting some people cuz they were like
man now that lonus is talking about the service remote like how to edit the the the the the dimming timeout and stuff like that now LG is going to lock that down I'm just like guys I can't not  like then it will then people will know about it like it you know I H I don't know like on the one hand like I'm sorry that really sucks it's not the first time that we've covered I I don't remember but there have been times where we've covered something really cool that was like kind of underground and like
patched out and then it's and then it's gotten patched out um which I like sucks but I'm that's that's what we're supposed to do is like cover cool stuff anyway the point is even with the service remote tricks there were compromises running a TV as a monitor I suspect the newer ones would have less compromise because now LG is competing against much improved Q quantum dot uh mini LED backlit competitors and they're competing against Samsung's QD OLED that is not as sensitive to being overdriven
as LG's W OLED so they're probably going a little bit more aggressive in terms of how hard they're driving things and uh you know how much of the screen they'll allow to be be white before it just is dimmed beyond recognition but um even with that said I think I would probably lean towards getting a monitor especially because there are so many monitors out there that are TV sized if you're into that sort of thing but have the Creature Comforts that are associated with plugging a monitor in
you know running display port so you potentially having higher refresh rates available to the than what you can push over HDMI 2.1 um having multiple multiple inputs so display port HDMI um I think most of them don't really have anything more Legacy okay so that Point's a little less valid but having a having an OSD like an onscreen display that is uh more designed for for desktop use that's easily accessible like there's there's just there's things that are nice about having a monitor instead
of a TV on your computer hi lldd hope you're well question we always see the cool stuff from a show like CES what's a piece of tech you've seen at a show that you felt was a huge disappointment there's tons I mean yeah um it's usually like half the show let me yeah let me put it this way I think we made about between 20 and 25 videos this year presenting at CES were  companies I mean some of them are just things we don't really cover but a lot of it ends up being not really
what you would expect yeah it is also a buyer show um so you'll get stuff like back when I frequented CES which I actively dislike Las Vegas so I'm happy I don't anymore but um back when I frequented CES half the show would be phone cases which you'd think like why like why do all these Tech reviewers and and news people want to cover phone cases well they don't but there is buyers there yeah it's a networking show yeah yeah so it's it's a show for multiple types of people speaking of
disappointments at the show let's talk about something that didn't disappoint  show AI steak  know poor Dan they claim it'll do three Stakes  cooked to Perfection look at this this poor head it's going to explode how how did they do this you might ask yeah actual like machine learning so what so what they do is they they punish the model or that they they punish it for taking any longer than it absolutely has to so for every second that it takes it gets punished and then it gets punished
based on user feedback on the quality of the meal and so they've gotten it far enough that it should be pretty darn decent but then what's really cool is that they use machine learning to tune it to your preferences so it knows how thick the meat is it knows what kind of cut it is you you enter that and then you basically go yeah I want it done medium rare and it'll cook it medium rare and then you will fill in feedback and go that was basically blue that was disgusting and it'll go oh okay so you
actually like your steak done well uh let me deal with that for you and it'll and it'll cook it well the next time according to your preferences yeah uh they talked about this part isn't done yet but they talked about having the ability to have the device know where it is and go okay yeah I'm in Texas so like medium is blue you you know versus I'm in so to account for kind of regional differences and preferences Regal preferences steak chicken uh it'll do some veggies it'll
do Burgers uh they have a pizza adapter for it so it's like SV version too the there is no water involved yeah I I mean but it's it's supposed to be like easy to Smart kitchen gadgets and the heating elements move they're on Motors and reach temperatures of up to 1600° F wait so this is like a a box they cook vertically so you put them in this like clamshell thing slide it in vertically like a server blade and then it it like it like Cooks the steak then Sears it you can tell how much sear you want then
like pulls off lets the juices kind of you know do their thing there's a drip tray the whole thing you just pull off the the tray things they're magnetic so you Huck them in the dishwasher theoretically you could cook a steak dinner how thin were these steaks that they cooked in uh about like that they didn't actually cook anything at the show so I want a review unit before I'm going to accept you know everything they said as gospel truth but I also do understand how machine learning could be
useful for this application oh for sure if I tell it like hey that's not how I like my state cook and it goes okay right so we had it nailed down for kind of the thin Cuts but these thicker cuts it seems like we're going to have to kind of fine-tune this or that man it's kind of cool and I would not think it would be possible to cook steak that fast like just how do you heat up the inside of it that fast I don't know they did they say you can you can cook it to any degree of Wellness within that
amount of time that I don't know probably not I didn't ask that yeah cuz you can sear the outside of a steak that fast sure he is so not convinced does chicken though I am highly sus now we've got now we've got they sayen I'm just highly Su but it do chick I'm just highly sus I'm highly sus too it's interesting though it is Def that is definitely interesting cuz honestly like that's a real use case for it and cooking takes a lot of time and not cooking is really expensive at
least here there's so many variables I know there's some like in like in Taiwan and and stuff like it's actually fairly if you know where to go and stuff it's actually quite affordable to eat out for more meals meals because the restaurants are kind of like built for that almost and and yada y y y but around here it's not structured that way eating out for every meal is incredibly expensive tree fingers says I'm a chef and I can tell you with through years of experience trying to rush Stakes it doesn't work
like that you can't just blast it with tons of heat it Cooks outside in I know yeah I know I know yeah this is why I'm sus but they they I think are willing to put their money where their mouth is I think we're one wolf thinking full plane chat why did the chicken cross the road because the AI Grill was hallucinating [Laughter] again oh man oh no yeah it's like one in every 100 things you put into the AI oven just comes out completely black it's like charred I mean I was
telling you about my existing oven so that would be no worse than what I have already fair enough um I just trying to think what else was uh there was one that was a major disappointment there's an AI mattress that I kept asking okay what makes it Ai and it's like well we have an algorithm and I was like right but what makes it Ai and they're like our algorithm right but your algorithm what's AI about it uh it's it takes inputs and then makes adjustments I'm like that's not AI that's actually not what that
means uh we're supposed to do a couple more topics now I guess according to Dan we are doing topics we're talking about CEs no this is still the first topic of the show Luke it's it has it's one major topic with many micro topics it's the second one uh yeah micro Rapids sorry what they are micro rapid topics okay all right all right why did you pick a next main topic notable non- aai demos um really okay I'm interest I think CES is interesting it was a big TV show this year yeah and for a long time I was
really bored by what was going on with TVs yeah they were making them thinner and it's like I feel like you haven't cared about TVs since the one that you just got basically oh my God who cares yeah I don't care all so what it's thinner it sits it sits on a thing by the wall annoying to carry around because it feels more fragile like it it's like it's ridiculous and like especially what LG was doing with their oleds for a long time where they'd be like like this thin at the top and then
have a giant caboose who do they think they are my wife she doesn't have a giant Caboose I just mean it's all relative um oh my  is the point is the the whole thinness war never made any sense to me what were what were we trying to achieve with I liked it at the beginning sure I mean because TVs were like big chunks sure I mean going but going from here to here was a lot more meaningful than going from here to and from here here like the TV that I've got in my theater room right now the T
it's like this thick and who cares do you notice that when you're watching content on it no no of course not because that's ridiculous and then there was the the bezel war that was kind of kind of before that kind of at the same time as that to a degree having thinner bezels I would say is a benefit but I also think that there's a certain point you where it probably doesn't matter that much and for I I you know I think for for a show piece if you want to have like a bezeless TV or something like
that you for an art display or something sure yeah absolutely but in your general you know $3.99 at best most people aren't going to Care $799 $12.99 I I don't think I don't think you need that at at a certain point and then there was the resolution war 1080p yeah not the be all and end all but it's fine for most things and 4K is to the vast majority of people out there IND discernible from from retina resolution and so you know for years at CES we were looking at you know world's first uh you know however
many pixels per inch world's first 8K display world's first and I'm trying to remember we definitely saw ones that were higher resolution than 8K and we're kind of asking ourselves okay forget about the content let's assume you know upscaling gets perfect and we can watch any kind of content on this unless I get unless I get this and it was impressive it's not like I wasn't like wow this is really cool scaling is not perfect by the way it was it was cool but unless you were getting you
know this close or you were trying to read a newspaper on your TV you know there wasn't there wasn't a clear there wasn't a clear use case for it right and I don't feel the same way about the brightness War because once you've experienced good HDR didn't I I'm I'm going to put this out here before you go into the topic CU I do think it's actually fairly important I've experienced HDR a few times I notably like didn't really like a lot of the examples that I saw because the certain
bright parts of the screen would be so bright that they're like annoying to look at I did not experience that with the really really really bright SDR at your place really did I did we watch any HDR stuff and did you feel that way about the HDR cuz I thought I threw on my we did and it was also fine okay um so like I there there have been implementations of this that I have not actually liked at all but more recently trying that TV it was very good so well done HDR yeah
freaking awesome because because that's what the world is like and it's not about having a super bright image that's not right if that's what you've seen before then it's not being handled right by your device or it's not been mastered properly yeah um um but we are nowhere "near even now even with the 10,000 nit" uh TV that I was talking about from high sense we are even now not at the point where it is it is similar to you know standing in the sunset um so I was I was
talking to Andrew one of our camera guys about this when we were in the bus line for the shuttle after looking at the high sense TV and I went okay dude actually here here like look look look look with me we were we were standing outside the convention center and was kind of approaching Sunset and one of the uh one of the hotel towers that was like a glass tower was kind of catching a reflection of the Sun that was like it was it was it was dazzlingly bright but not where you would be you know
uncomfortable it was just like you know the world that has a sun that shines on it and sometimes it reflects off of things and I kind of went okay Andrew how many knits do you think we would need to get there because it's something that our eyes can can process and it's something we're going to have to achieve if we want HDR content to be like looking through a pane of glass into the world and he was like you know hard to "say but a lot more than 10,000 which is" one of the reasons why and I I I agree
like it was it was it was bright but it was natural and we're not quite there yet and that's one of the reasons that I am into the brightness War bring on on "15,000 nits bring on 20,000 nits not" because every element on the screen that is you know white should be blasted at "20,000 nits into your face but because" key onscreen elements where you're trying to capture you know the the the the the glinting of the sun off the top of the waves or um or you know a reflection in uh you know an A Polished
uh Knight's armor or something like that um in order to to accurately reflect that pun intended you need incredible incredible brightness um and I think that what we're going to see is we're going to need ambient light sensors on TVs that are really good like we've had ambient light sensing on TVs for ages the problem is that in the past in a lot of cases and I haven't I haven't f with them in a long time because before they would always just trash the image quality I don't like I I I I I'd hate it
they're pretty good on phones these days though so maybe they've improved a lot on TVs but we're going to need that because you're going to be sitting in a dark room and it's going to hit you with "you know 20,000 nits your eyes won't be" adjusted for it and that's going to be a problem but we're going to need perfect blacks and we're going to need like crazy crazy high peak brightness in order to account for all the different environments where the TV might be used in order to really get that experience
and make it feel more lifelike cuz that's what it does it increases immersion did I fire up Lord of the Rings when you were over as a demo Fellowship yes yeah I was trying to think back did did we look at any of the like outside boat scenes okay yeah like specifically the one where they go by the statues doing that compared to any other display that I've watched that on it was so much more natural and now you're telling me okay I can have "another 5,000 nits to to to Really make"
the the the sun feel like sun yeah not white Bring It On I'm I'm here for it yeah absolutely I'm excited yeah um okay what what what am I supposed to be talking about right now oh yeah right things that were not AI yeah so Samsung's microed um the wall is better than before they weren't really giving any specs which was extremely confusing not only did they not have any displays up but no one at the booth knew anything um they knew sizes that's it it's basically it uh I was like
one thing you forgot to mention about that Grill the AI powered Grill is that it's "$3,500 oh yeah it's not" cheap yeah I I I could see it being like if I was to consider buying one it would be for like smash JS like for the bad new center yeah so it'd be like uh you know we're we're going to have a little Cantina not Cantina um more like a cane than a Cantina like a cafe like a little like you'll be able to get like muffins or like whatever like you know kind of things from Costco probably um yeah or
or maybe a steak right like if we could make a steak in in 90 seconds or whatever and then Grill some veggies in another if it can do a steak in 90 seconds I'm sure it can do veggies in like if you could seconds I me if you had a a rice cooker there yeah a steak that can cook in 90 seconds and yeah some veggies yeah then like I see no reason why why a small commercial not really a kitchen but like canteen I mean if you were going to buy an oven for this uh canteen to cook
steaks in anyways you're going to be spending a pretty substantial amount of money a lot of like uh what would you call it my brain wants to say Enterprise but I don't think that's what I'm going for commcial Comm yeah there you go commercial grade like kitchen Hardware is really expensive um and okay apparently it's 3 minutes for a ribey which people are saying is still Stupid Fast yeah I have no idea if it even is commercial grade to be clear maybe it's not rated at that for that kind of like Dy cycle
yeah yeah maybe this is a is a personal Appliance for just bougie like Executives or what I don't know but I definitely want to check it out I want to know if there's any validity to what they're claiming super interesting yeah yeah trying to think of like what else we saw that was really stand out I mean PC industry-wise there there wasn't much like that uh I mean AMD launched new am4 processors which I think is pretty cool um I got a little bit of inside baseball and sort of where these are coming from
which I don't think was off the Record but it felt like too much detail for the video um so the 5800 X 3D they've been producing for a couple years now right and in that time they've had a lot of dyes that uh die not die but didn't quite make the grade for 5800 x3d so why do we have a cheaper x3d cuz uh hey I mean waste not want not right so 250 bucks gets you a chip that doesn't hit the same clock speeds but AMD is claiming though we haven't validated this yet that a lot of what
gives the x3d its strength is the cash itself is the is the latency advantage of the cash and you don't necessarily need more core clocks speed for that so they're saying that gaming performance should actually be quite similar to the 5800 x3d so I'm I'm pretty excited for that because there's this enormous install base of am4 systems out there and if all they've got to do to be able to keep up with the latest generation gaming gpus mostly right like okay not "quite as good as a 7,000 series or x3d"
7000 series for that matter or a 14th gen or whatever but to mostly keep up the current gen GPU is pop a $250 chip in there they're going to get some money back for the chip they just took out just flip it on eBay or whatever else that's really compelling and I I I'm here for it I like to see it uh I just thought it was really cool that we were seeing extra support for that platform I mean realistically amd's main focus was "their 8,000g series chips which are" "pretty much 7,000 chips but the top two"
have like a neural processor on neural Processing Unit in them that AMD didn't really have any clear idea of what anyone was going to do with yet like there's no real software that runs on it at this time that that that a general consumer would care about uh but theoretically you know workloads will come and it's much more efficient to offload to that compared to even using the GPU on them and it's the GPU that's really special because they had demos obviously they were using frame
generation and upscaling and all that kind of stuff but they had demos where they were running AAA games at like 60 frames per second like balers Gate 3 running on an on integrated Graphics that's pretty nuts I I I I you know back when we first started putting gpus right on the CPU package you know back when Intel first launched their like 700 series core processors um Lindfield I was like yo I don't want this give me more CPU compute why are you wasting dpace on this crap now I'm
now I get it if we if I'd known that this level of integration was going to give us AAA gaming yeah at low you know 1080p if you're lucky right it's run running at a lower resolution upscaling to 1080p um but if i' had known integrated Graphics was going to reach playing AAA games at all I probably would have been a lot more on board with it it's freaking awesome and it finally buries that category that you and I have both been trying to kill for the last 10 years the entry Lev E-Waste graphics card
yeah I get it and it's been it's been close some buy them I get it but like please please stop please stop please stop onboard Graphics is literally a better option and okay sometimes you have an older machine that you need to put better graphics in I get it don't buy an entry-level card I used get get get a used card that you could also just plug into it and would also be cheap okay don't just stop ah oh man oh boy here comes chat oh no I have a gt510 okay all right oh no really I use
an entry-level card to prop up my 4090  pillar I like my computer to be an analog for society look look look look look raging aaru 1660 super is not the problem I've never had an issue with that I'm talking like GT 1030s stuff that is just manufactured waste um yep yep yep why don't we jump into oh here hold on notable Nona okay I already talked about Wi-Fi 7 being amazing there's the new AMD card with 16 gigs of vram I can't man nvidia's lineup once again seems to be just purely
designed to upsell you to the next one I talked about this a fair bit when they launched the 4060 Series right you've got the 4060 um 8 gig the 4060 16 gig and the 460 TI I think it is or is it that no the 4060 and then the ti both had 8 gigs and then the 460 TI 8 gig or 16 gig that's right where the 4060 was like dog slow and then the ti was fast enough but didn't have enough vram and then the ti 16 gig was way overpriced you know like it was just like entire lineup is just designed to
extract more money from you it's like it's like so blatantly obvious they just won't they won't quite give you enough at every stage like it used to be you could get kind of you know what was pretty much the whole experience um and like you could overclock it a bit and you could like get to that level like they they are so careful to make sure that that one cannot be as good as that one and you are leaving something critical on the table and I felt the same way with the 470 super 480 uh
excuse me 470 super 470 TI super and 4080 super lineup the 4070 super has 12 gigs of vram it is a  card with 12 gigs and I get it it has a 192-bit bus so if they wanted to strap more RAM to it they would either have to do some kind of like you know some of it would run at half of the bandwidth or something something or they would have to double it entirely they'd have to do 24 gigs of vram had wi buses for a long time though well that's what I was going to say is uh I mean you could also make
the argument that it is a $600 card with a 192bit bus that is equ would be equally outrageous yeah not that so very long ago yeah um then you step up to the 47 ETI super which has 16 gigs of vram which is which is nice but is an $800 graphics card then there's the 480 super which is a great 4K High frame rate gaming card I was playing the new um the new Call of Duty Call of Duty Modern Warfare can we just again again again again can we not name things like this I freaking hate it um so I played the new
Call Of Duty Modern Warfare and even without upscaling nonsense it was I shouldn't say nonsense cuz it's getting really good even without upscaling it was over 100 FPS at 4K like it looked great it just looked great and with all the Tom Foolery it was like over 200 like like 220 230 240 like somewhere in that range um so I was playing that on the 4080 which is 480 super excuse me which was awesome and it got a $200  "$1,200 so the one kind of reasonably" priced one it's like well well hey look
at that Achilles tendon right there you know um don't no don't worry about the knife just here give me your foot give me your foot you know right cuz we're we're in the era where the PS5 and the Xbox series have 16 gigs of potential available RAM and so it's no secret that game developers are going to be trying to utilize that as efficiently as possible so there's the there's the potential for games to need that kind of vram um especially if you're on PC where you're going to be running at a higher
detail level than what is necessarily going to be available to a console that's running what is essentially last gen GPU technology now so even if those consoles can't dedicate their entire 16 gigs because it's shared right to vram on a PC it it is very clear that that is going to that those kinds of overruns are going to happen and they have already been happening so they they released this card for $600 that is not designed to last for this generation properly um and then
it's you know it's 800 bucks to get one but by the time you're spending $800 well I don't know I guess you might as "well get the, one that can do 4K 120 I" don't and I'm supposed to feel like this is a good deal because the nons super "was 1,200" I it's tough he's he's he wants an out that's why he started searching for things on the table he doesn't like the situation that he's in I just want to talk about something else anything else uh well let's not do the union thing
then because I think that's that's a sad story right yeah let's just talk about it okay actor Union ok's AI voiceovers steam ok's AI game content sag Afra the US actors Union has announced what they called a groundbreaking agreement with AI voiceover company replica Studios for actors to license digital versions of their voices for interactive media projects for at least the next year according to the union the agreement will ensure Fair negotiation and the ability for performers to retain Ain
control over what additional Works their voices are used in several prominent video game voice actors expressed dis disapproval and questioned why they hadn't been consulted in an FAQ sag after claimed that the deal was approved by a union Committee of actors who frequently work in the gaming industry and because the deal was with a single company it didn't require a full member vote so the union says that it's important to be involved in the early stages of the Technology's development
as this will allow them to push for fair compensation so in a nutshell voice actors are upset with this deal because they wanted more they didn't want you know Fair compensation for their voice likeness to just be aied they wanted to do their jobs they wanted to voice act um because their previous body of work is not necessarily an enough to just extrapolate what their future you know um characterization of or what their future performance could be and that's fair enough yeah as for the position of
the Union they're basically like this is coming deal with it essentially is is how I read this and I I got I got to tell you I um one of the things that Nvidia wanted us to include in our booth coverage for them um that I basically was like no uh was a demo that you've probably read about or or or even seen um that that other places have covered um where you would you walked into a virtual bar this was yeah the chick at the bar demo I think I saw some of this so there's two NPCs having a
conversation Over the Bar as you walk in I'm not sure if that is is large language modeled um and with AI generated voices or not not but if you walk up you can interact with the barkeep in any way you want essentially using um I forget if it was chat GPT based but it was some kind of large language model and have natural I use this in extreme finger quotes uh natural conversations um there's there's a lot of issues I have with this so first of all I told in video like look I've had enough controversy last
year I don't need 2024 to be the year of line of promoting voice actors losing their jobs I just am not going to talk about this for that alone but also here are my concerns um a it's not nearly as good as other Media made it out to be like you know the AI voices in the finals yeah I wouldn't even say they were that good because in the finals you're not expecting it to be natural right it's an announcer it's an announcer which is is kind of a style pres yeah whereas you know if you were to talk to this
bartender about uh and and they expressing concern over your over your dead dog and you're on your way to like you know John Wick someone or something right like there's there could be it's a video game yeah sounds very plausible who knows there could there could be any tone to this conversation and it was it was not that good um so that's that's a concern because I get it like I can see where we're going with this and I do think that we'll probably get there at some point
where the idea is that you know all the all all the you know people who are getting laid off in the games industry right now can start Indie Studios and create gigantic worlds populated with vibrant characters using AI you know like I I I I get the kind of the pot of gold that's supposed to be at the end of this rain blow right um where the games industry is is struggling so hard right now but it's not even like it's not that and I I I do feel that other coverage either you know they kind of got lucky
on the prompts or they just I don't like they don't talk to people something I don't know I felt like some of the coverage of it just was not representative of the state of the tech right now and then the other thing for for me is that I just um I felt like it was a little I felt like it was kind of toned deaf coming back to the state of the games industry right now like as I was sitting here next to Luke I I was I I found another uh round of layoffs in the tech industry it wasn't game
specific but there's been at least a couple rounds of games industry layoffs this year or or this week uh Unity was that this week or last week uh CRA I'm not sure I know like basically all of this has been 2024 yeah I think I think Unity might have been last week AC3 production says it was this week uh yeah Unity did 25% this week um there was at least one other one I think that was also games industry this week and you know for my part I'm just sitting here going it would feel kind of ton deaf to
do show coverage right which is generally more positive in tone for us like we're we're not evaluating it I don't think there's any reasonable expectation of like a like an object rigorous evaluation we're showing forward looking technology demos and you know it's supposed to be exciting I'm not excited right now oh twitch twitch was another big one which isn't oh Discord right Discord Discord was the one I saw while I was sitting here there's been so many um and so it just
felt icky um to be to be like you know hype Manning uh hey look how no one's going to need oh and it also had uh like real time synchron a of the animations so you know hey who's going to need you know anim animators or yeah uh or voice actors let's go and you know what on paper it sounds good like any small team of four people could build a giant open world game or whatever but I  what might be a controversial take oh boy I don't think we need more games right now oh yeah I actually do agree 
and if anything I think the the just astronomical volume of games and and The Limited attention that people can possibly have for them and and the potential for these kinds of tools to make them samier than they already are oh yeah could be a bad thing for gamers do you want to talk to uh average white dude with beard AI model in this game or do you want to talk to average white dude with beard AI model in this other game it's like I think it's going to be fatiguing yeah yeah and like if you're
going to spend the time to really tune one of these models like Lucian lechance uh uh an incredibly well-written character from Oblivion um trying to get chat GPT to act like him perfectly when you can't just tell it to act like him because he doesn't exist yet you're trying to craft this character um I think is going to take so long that you might as well just have a good writer um and a good voice actor and just get it taken care of that way Avon fox says lonus hates games something
something hot dog dogs hot dogs I was like oh where is this going that's funny yeah pretty much I don't know man like there's but then on the other hand okay look there's okay one of one of the games that I love um is called freelancer and that's a game that toward the end just runs out of money obviously they run out of the ability to to continue to kind of expand this world and and and create more missions and contact and content and I um and so you know I look at tools like this and I go
oh man that that would be they would have been able to do it you know I so freaking I don't know I don't know yeah I think it's good for some things and it's bad for others it's very divisive um just like this divisive segue to our sponsor for the show hey the show is brought to you today by Wicked Christians yeah uh we go cracks are not good for For You especially when you see them on your headphone cushions but don't worry Wicked cushions offers crack-free comfort for all types of
headphones Lin is to show the W design ear pads for the camera oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah they uh they have little custom like w show logo designs on them these are super cool oh uh oh I'm I meant to disclaim this these were made specifically for us and are not for sale sorry everyone but yeah these are these are flipping awesome I've got a little package of them that I guess I'm allowed to give Dan now that we've actually done the spot for Wicked cushions um their highquality cushion Replacements are
made with sports fabric material to keep your ears cool and cozy and if you're still feeling too hot to handle they've got your ears covered with their WC free gaming ear pads It's a combination of a dual layer cooling gel to keep your head cool even when your team is feeding I I I love Dennis being frustrated by that cuz he's going to be the feeder on that team no offense Dennis oh their earpads are available for a wide variety of headphones and headsets just check out their site at
the link down below and you can quickly navigate to the right model also installation is super easy and you can get it done within minutes with their instruction videos starting at $24.95 their earpads come in various colors and "designs plus with over 25,000 reviews" and a solid 365-day warranty also known as one year there's no need to keep suffocating your ears in those old dirty cushions give Wicked cushions a shot give your headphones a new life we've got them linked down below all right Dan you ready
ready one nice two nice success it was bound to happen eventually I'm looking directly into the light good catch thank you uh I want to see if uh i' I've had the same headphones for like a million years um and the last time I looked I think Wicked cushions only supported the PC series of Sennheiser Headphones like PC 38x and stuff like that but now when I look at Sennheiser on their site they have a bunch of options so maybe I can find something that'll work it's um it's
possible that even if they don't list the exact model it might be compatible anyways yeah I kind of doubt they would actually list my model of headphones considering they haven't been making them in a very long time um but it would be the PC 28x pads fit all the HD 500 Series 2 oh oh yeah no I think you should be good cuz you have the 558 I think 595s oh 595s yeah uh 598 oh my good 595 yeah you're supported which one 595s yeah this one right here you're good to go 595 I will actually buy these
uh we it goes not quite to mine it goes all the way to hd599 comp ability sheet that makes a lot of sense but no support for the hd600 that's fine yeah well that's the  them well yeah 595s sick and they're the cooling ones okay I'm getting those oh you got to you got which one though which one are different styles I want the cooling one at the very least yeah yeah they've all got the cooling gel but do you want '90s black o or do you want black camo or regular black it's got
look how cool that looks I love it that's sick yeah that looks freaking awesome okay no no judgment if you like the black C or the regular black or whatever but I'm a '90s boy so I that's pretty yeah that's pretty irresistible I've had I've had yeah the same headphones for years and the original ones the original pads like failed and kind of broke yeah so I got replacement ones but they're just junky they're bad I've wanted new ones forever so yeah I think this is a business you and I
talked about like a thousand and we don't do ited cush ising it so that's great oh man we came up with a killer business idea today just like randomly we were working on our review for the fair phone I was talking to Jordan about it like I gave him all my notes the lab gave him all his notes and then we were having like a three-way meeting um just kind of talking through okay kind of what's the angle going to be here how are we going to do the intro what's her title like that kind of stuff
Elijah's yelling at you don't spoil the idea no no i't spoil the idea I know it's ours we need it um but it's it's pretty it's pretty cool because um unfortunately the review of the fairphone is not going to be super positive ah yes and so we were kind of thinking about you know alternative Solutions and we came up with something that's kind of neat um but that's all I have to say about that for now what do you want to talk about next oh the eBay thing oh oh three right right there's a thing um okay yes Dan
please eBay thing yeah then we'll do the eBay thing sure uh Hi D I have a problem with Google workspace they set a hard deadline after which I lost access to my data with no further support data destroyed by Google is real little guy versus Google Vibes yeah okay so I curated this out of uh the the potentials um I don't really 100% know what's going on and we're not Google so we can't really say anything I've never heard of this I don't know but I'm going to unfortunately use you as a good
opportunity to talk about 321 storage oh um try not to have one copy of your data U because yeah zero is much better try not to have one I mean if you don't have any then you're not going to feel bad when it's gone so that is a form of strategy yeah that's a that's that sucks I don't know what's going on there deadline after which you know what you know what they did recently is they shut down old Gmail accounts so maybe that's but it's a workspace so you pay work I don't really know what's
happening in the actual message I can't really tell what's actually going on mean if they set a hard deadline then I guess the deadline is passed but I mean there's a reason that everything I care about is on my Nas yeah um as long as I am able to can keep those those probably was fre work space people are saying h i I did ever take part in that I heard it was like a thing though oh yeah Elijah is saying they removed the free version of Google workspace last year and gave people time to upgrade or
migrate and I guess that's it it's over didn't make it that's rough but yeah Luke's right 3 two one multiple copies yeah three copies across at least two different locations and what's the one uh I think it's supposed to be more than one format oh okay sure yeah that makes sense in my opinion the format matters less than all the other yeah I don't think that's a huge yeah three copies two locations I feel pretty good at that's what matters the most oh it's one ring to rule them all one is offsite uh I
like mine I don't think that's it two is types of media ah yeah yeah two different types of media and one of them being offset okay yeah thanks guys but basically the types of media ones kind of multiple copies yeah yeah one offsite that's good all right Dan hit me LL and Big D can you talk a bit about displays why is a necessary is power draw and heat really that big of a deal I dream "of a greater than 1,000 nits sustained" regardless of window percentage mini or micro LED OLED I don't care well
a um that's that's the auto auto brightness uh auto brightness dimming nonsense so yes power draw does matter and it's for more than just you know energy star efficiency ratings and stuff like that there's there's only there's only so hard you can you can drive these things and I think that in the same way that GPU manufacturers try to limit the power draw of power virus applications like fermar uh I don't think TV manufacturers actually want you pushing because when you when you display you know all an
all-white um like an like an all-white window or an all-white screen you're essentially driving every single subpixel at maximum power and that is going to that's it's going to like microwave you at a certain point and I don't mean that literally I mean we were we were at a demo in um in Samsung displays Booth so take it for with the grain of salt that you need to take it with uh but what they had was their cutie OLED next next to LG's wed and this was they said both current gen and the scene
that they had was uh a candle burning in the middle of the display I would say it was probably about a 10 to 15% window yeah maybe maybe 10 maybe 10% so I saw a bright candle burning uh down the middle of the Monitor and they had thermal cameras pointed at both of these displays now I don't know for sure that they didn't have an insulating material on the back of the LG display like I can't I can't prove that but assuming Samsung display had any Integrity whatsoever it was two
of the same image playing at the same luminance level on an LG they didn't say it was LG but it was obviously LG because it was wed and nobody else makes that so on an LG TV and a Samsung TV and the lgtv was running so hot that I couldn't touch it um I'm trying to remember the exact temperature but it was it was over 60° and they claimed that if they left it running for long the surface of this TV was was wow could burn you yes and they claimed that if they left it running long enough it could reach like
in excess of 70 or 80 and so in response to your to your question you know why can't we just drive a 100% that's really dangerous to be clear not not just for like burning yourself but for burning your house like kids yeah stuff like that um so to to to answer your question why can't we just drive the whole panel at 100% brightness it's because we can't um there there's actually uh fun Rabbit Hole to go down uh incredibly bright LEDs and how to deal with how much heat they generate oh
yeah they have to be like water cools and stuff crazy it's actually like pretty cool DIY perks did a great video where he builds himself an artificial sun and he gets into the whole like like like physics of how the lens has to be different so that the rays are are parallel rather than like this and blah blah blah blah blah it's a whole it's a whole thing it's a great video go go go check it out um but one of the one of the things that uh he had to do was deal with cooling the bloody thing uh we also
saw that at oh what are they Kronos I want to say um Chronos camera let me let me just check this yeah yeah yeah yeah Chron Technologies these guys uh we did a we did a tour with these guys a number of years a stop uh we did a tour with these guys a number of years ago and uh they do high-speed cameras which if you guys are familiar with know you'll know need a ton of light in order to perform their best so they have a controlled room with zero flicker uh LED lighting where they can do test footage and and
test their cameras and those lights are like DIY water cooled because they're you know big Geeks and watch our Channel and stuff and there there there are there are Peeps um but it's super cool and I can't remember if that ended up in the tour or not but it was definitely one of the highlights for me was seeing their water cooled water cooled LED lights so that they can get it bright enough in this room to shoot High frame rate um footage very cool wow yeah see that's super cool I love stuff like
that csmith apparently did it too all right Dan hit me last one I got for you hey dll we use RFID RFID name tags for computer access in healthare all the time what do you think about this being more popular in the consumer space Also AI in the ER is crazy for Diagnostics um for computer access and Healthcare I mean yeah I the thing about the computer space is our devices are not shared the same way they are in a corporate or educational or uh or  it's like you know okay like I'm trying
I'm thinking back to our home PC when I was growing up right like there was one computer in the house because you know everyone didn't have their Chromebook for school and their phone and you know and a gaming desktop maybe in the room or whatever right you're like Windows XP login with all the profiles yeah exactly yeah what value would there have been to me having a name tag with an RFID chip in it to log into that yeah you know very very little um I think that there's probably cases
where there could be use for it you know like Public Library okay I need to use the internet at the public library I use my RFID Card but with the ubiquity of of cell phones and mobile network connectivity I I I absolutely recognize that there are people who still rely on public libraries for internet access but I think that it's a lot less common than it was in the in the early 2000s public libraries do a lot of other cool stuff though yes but I'm just talking about like the computer lab at the public
library for internet access that was a huge thing like when I was a teenager and now is definitely not as much of a of a necessity for for as many people um like consumer consumer RFID access like I can think of very few things that those two sentences go together with yeah you know door locks and stuff like that but that's not really um not it's not like computer access um I you know I I would be super down for to have an RFID chip like in my finger or something like that so you know yeah someone in
fulling chat mentioned that biohacking yeah just like every time you know or if it's in my palm and then there's just like um just you know an app on my phone that when I'm holding it it's just like always authenticated for everything and just as you know tied into my password manager and uses that um what's it called again huh what's that what's that thing called again the rabbit uses the rabbit R1 to just automatically enter passwords whenever my you know my my RFID chip in my hand is present or
something like if we could if we could automate stuff like that man that's that's that's gamechanging for for Consumer um but it's not multi-user access so I wouldn't I wouldn't need it for that  I've got one installed in the back of my hand between my thumb and forefinger yeah I'd be I'd be super down I'd be super  terrifying I'm not sure I you know what I have to I have to admit I'm not like hyper familiar with the Bible or anything like that but I'm not familiar um with any kind of
um issue with oh people are mark of the beast okay hold on a second now I now I got to Google this Mark of the Beast RFID chip in your thing okay the Beast coming out of the sea is like a leopard with feet like a bears okay now hold on just a minute here what's stamped image of The Emperor's head on every coin of the Roman Empire okay this is clearly    Beast all right uh Mar put on the forehead of those who worship I don't know dude I'm totally lost yeah I'm not yeah I'm I'm I'm
clearly going to need a little bit more okay hold on hold on Elijah's got me hey  prophet okay Revelations 1315 here we go and I was allowed to give breath to the image of the Beast so the image of the Beast might even speak and CA um yeah I think this is not happening today um why don't we do another topic eBay pays $3 million to avoid prosecution and this one's a doozy they have agreed to pay a $3 million penalty the statutory maximum you should have seen the look on his face he hadn't read
this yet this is a wild story dude the statutory maximum in order to settle criminal charges in a cyber stalking case where several former eBay employees harassed a pair of married e-commerce bloggers who critically covered a litigation issue involving the company so basically bloggers said something mean about eBay because of a litigation issue issue that eBay was having so eBay had several employees who harassed them in 2019 seven that's actually more than what I would consider to be several
seven employees including eBay's former senior director of Safety and Security what began sending David and Ena Steiner harassing messages as well as disturbing packages including live Co caches and spiders a pig fetus a funeral wreath and a book about dealing with the death of a spouse is this is this a movie about serial killers or like what the fck is going on here pornographic Publications were sent to a neighbor's house under David Steiner's name and furthermore three of the employees flew from
California to Baston sorry I probably butchered that with the intent of vandalizing the couple's home breaking into their garage and placing a tracker  car this is wild this is not this is not alleged all seven of them have since pleaded guilty and Buddy the senior director of Safety and Security is facing 5 years in prison imagine being the director of Safety and Security specifically D this is some Mafia level this is crazy um this is crazy two other members of the eBay SE Suite who were
implicated in the matter were not charged including then CEO David wenig who instructed eBay's then Chief Communications officer Steven wymer to take Ena Steiner down after she criticized his outsized compensation wymer then instructed um I don't know Jim B director of Safety and Security guy instructed him that he wanted to see her burned down and to do whatever it takes   what our discussion question here is like I don't even know what our discussion question do how is it even  years
I would hear a story like that and go that's fake all right you know grain of salt right like that's for a bad TV show that sounds that sounds exaggerated you know um and a lot lot of the time an outlandish claim like that probably is exaggerated or even an outright fabrication but clearly clearly people are people are fing crazy like that is that is messed up right there what are you doing what is wrong with you you know so it's pretty obvious that even if someone is making claims that seem
just beyond what any reasonably functional human would would do right it's possible the fact that they pleaded guilty right I mean that's that's how this works right like they're they're they're innocent until they're proven guilty yeah you're like STP I did it unless it's under like some form of duress or whatever but I'm assuming that's not the case I mean all seven of them really yeah well I mean I mean it depends did did did the prosecutors go to their houses send them fetal pigs put
trackers on their cars like is that what the F this isn't the gogs they probably were well-minded like I mean you you would kind of you would kind of like this is what I would expect from organized crime eBay is not just some random this it's not like man this was like yeah this was in like the early days of eBay when they had some like weird people  ago what you know like you hear these crazy stories about the you know the beginnings of the gaming industry or whatever and it's like yeah there was
there was cocaine everywhere and right this was four years ago yeah  caught I I don't know by mailing dead animals in the posts maybe like which is a crime for sure yeah like I it sounds it sounds so improbable that if it wasn't for the fines happening and the and the admissions of guilt I still would say you know there's probably a bit more to this story you know it's a plea deal or it's this or it's that it makes you wonder you know the kind of just outlandish stuff that has gone on over  know pretty
wild oh okay uh J Christ 08 says um I forgive you for having the mark of the whatever and if I recall correctly they hired a pi who found out that it was eBay because they were tailing them one  unreal um that was just their username by the way they weren't actually Jesus unless they were I mean Rose once what's who's to say he couldn't rise again okay so this all all this kind of stuff broke in like 2021 but I I'm assuming the they they got their settlement now I don't know there's like news
articles about it oh it's that eBay is paying the penalty I think yeah so they're they're getting there yeah that's wild I I just I hadn't seen this  unreal wow man it's a good thing they weren't in Canada because then having them tailed might have been you know violating their privacy do you you see that Wild Thing how uh yeah uh Quebec police said hey you can't just like upload footage of porch Pirates taking your stuff because that could be a violation of their privacy because
they're innocent till proven guilty it's like yeah I guess they could have been just protecting that package from someone else but like yeah I know right they're like yeah you need to report does Canada have uh filming on property laws you can film it but they're saying you can't just release it publicly you should give it to the police cool can dobly nothing about it that's stupid that is actual that is actual clown level stuff right there yeah very cool uh speaking of very cool should we do our
announcement do we have an announcement yeah yeah oh are you pregnant yeah you don't look as pregnant as you did a  good early stages something earlier he's doing really well so I can like tease  now Luke's on a journey people in chat  glowing all right what is it is it something to do with this weird like letter thing that we both have we could do this though okay but no let's do the announcement let's do the announcement what's the announcement I have no idea what you're talking about the pants oh

pretty stoked about these uh we're also giving a last chance here reminder to pick up our CES 2024 team t-shirt sales end January 13th um this mainly came about because we've had a bunch of people complain in years past that we wore these shirts in the in all of our coverage of CES that weren't freaking available on the site and so this time we were like okay fine then if you if you want our cool team event coverage t-shirt then fine you can have one too all you have to do is pay for it
um so those are those are going to be these are a pre-sale uh all shirts will be printed following purchase and then um we're going to ship them here you go by the end of this month nice okay uh this is yeah this is a digital reference only but that's exactly what it looks like I'm excited about these because the onesie is made similarly right yep yeah that's also our underwear material and my my girlfriend takes the onesie I don't I'm not a huge fan of wearing onesies but I find the material on that
and this and the underwear to be very comfortable but I don't like yeah I don't like being in a onesie so having this for lounging at home will be great there's one last thing uh we have deals on remaining stock of Wan hoodies short circuit hoodies and swacket we apparently found some additional inventory buried at the warehouse and they're 50 bucks each until they're gone this is the last chance to grab any of these three items they will not be restocked okay um so that was what was
that Wan hoodie short ciruit hood and swacket that's not to say we will never do another kind of similar style thing ever again those but those ones will not be returning as far as we know um Never Say Never but it is almost certainly not going to happen we have what I believe is actually a legitimate question uh from Angelus 0000 um how much do these stealth sweatpants uh or new lounge pants show off package they're very soft material so probably a decent amount I mean I can put them
on I don't think it's against Twitches terms of service okay in all in all seriousness though I mean we've got uh We've we've got you know pictures on the site of people wearing them so oh yeah yeah there you go I I if you're going to wear them without underwear then a lot then you're going to have some you're going to have some meat print but these are a bit of a looser a bit of a looser more relaxed fit so they're not going to be super tight but uh I pant if you if she swings if you would show in a soft
pant you'll probably show in these yeah  know what are you going to do apologize   who oh man this one uh this one I think is going to make some people sad let's go into it um Wacom and Wizards of the Coast admit to using AI art um you know it's not quite as bad as it sounds I think okay Wizards of the Coast first denied then admitted that AI was used in the creation of a recent promotional image for magic of the Gathering uh the image showed telltale signs of artifacting associated with AI
generation leading to uproar among fans and artists according to a post from Magic of the gathering's Twitter account the art came from a vendor uh who like likely used AI features in an industry standard tool like Photoshop leading to AI artifacts in an image that was primarily created by a human being Wizards of the Coast promised not to use AI in their art back in December following similar backlash to an image in a Dungeons and dragon Source book which used some amount of AI generation
the company now says they will apply similar standards to art for marketing materials Wacom on the other hand creators of the digital drawing tablets faced similar questions over image in its own marketing materials a dragon with similar artifacts and nonsensical anatomical details the company has since apologized and stated that the art was purchased from a third party and and it evaded its AI detection tools during the vetting process according to the verge the image likely came from a vendor who
posted the art to Adobe stock without tagging it as AI yeah where's this tail coming from exactly yeah that's a how did that how did that Dodge the AI detection stuff I mean man if I wasn't if I was just glancing at it you won't notice immediately but if they have a process for detecting AI stuff but like if this is supposed to go up the dragon's spine you know why does it end up here like it's that to yeah it's it's obviously AI now that we're looking at it like why would the tummy have scales and then
have like like this like it's just what is what is going on right now yeah you know but if we're not paying attention if we're just reading this yeah there's like a dragon sitting there or whatever I like I get it um FL play chat has very fun take on what's going on there um yeah  on is it uh Tech layoffs time I guess this one is this one only really pointing out oh this one's only pointing out a few um um but honestly if we tried to point all of them out we'd be here for an hour and we'd probably miss some
because probably more have happened since this was written so it's probably fine i' said probably a lot uh twitch has announced the layoffs of around 35% of their staff considering the 400 employees laid off from Twitch in March this means the company has fired nearly half of its original staff um of the staff that was around at that time uh in a blog post CEO Dan Clancy called the layoffs an attempt to rightsize Twitch which he says will still uh was still far bigger than it needs to be despite
ongoing sustainability efforts this is crazy like I think is Twitch done like you know the big new feature that they announced alongside in video where um even smaller streamers can support multiple resolutions by them doing it themselves the transing themselves by Nvidia and streaming software companies working together to do all the encoding client side and then just allow twitch to ingest the various resolution streams I actually think it's pretty cool it is pretty cool but twitch
talking about this as a feature is like okay I so I don't I don't I don't disagree with you and I understand that this might be unpopular but uh the fact that I think it's like over 99% of streamers on Twitch are getting effectively no viewers like 3 to zero um it costs a lot for them to do all that which is the reason why they haven't had access to transcoders this whole time so creating a method for them to get it is actually cool I understand people are upset about this but the fact of the
matter is Twitch is not profitable hasn't been for a long time um they got to do some stuff you know and like just expecting expecting more money all the time with them carrying more weight all the time doesn't work when they never made money in the first place but that that last bit is the the fact that this whole thing is just obviously unsustainable yeah so building new features basically amounts to figuring out how to offload more of your processing to your users it's like okay yeah good luck
everybody so I I agree it's super cool and honestly if we could support it on float plane I'm sure we would it'd be sweet yeah it' be it'd be awesome like if you could just use you know obs and encode at 240p 360 480p 720p 1080P and oh for streaming yeah for streaming oh no no no I was thinking vaud for a second yeah no but if you if your car if if and this is basically Nvidia like unlocking functionality that already existed on their professional cards just more anden streams which which is good which I
fully support I would like them to just unlock all of them because another nice thing they're all on there that comes with some yeah frustration I guess yeah yeah yeah so that's that's twitch Google laid off about a thousand people Discord laid off 170 people also about 17% of its staff and the laundry list of companies just goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on Tech and gaming just got ravaged you mentioned um they haven't stopped getting ravaged since basically the I I don't know what sort
of the kind of the end of the the lockdown period essentially yeah yeah uh you mentioned ah game engine Unity Unity yeah Unity got hit really hard yeah is it really Unity if all the people are scattered to the high winds hey got them um lay offs got 25% of their staff it's rough there's there is a huge list of companies that are taking like 10 to 25% staff hits I was I was talking in the in the uh in the executive staff meeting a few weeks ago about how like we need to we need to
change our messaging internally a little bit to be reflective of how hungry we're going to need to be this year it's It's Hard Out There hard out there and so you know everyone's going to be every money is not really flowing like it normally does yep and so you know if we want if we want to be sustainable we want to not do layoffs we have to understand that we need to work harder for every view we need to work harder for every screwdriver sale we need to we need to we need we got to get hungry um and I
think that's that's probably something that and will craft into sort of a more wow uh a more comprehensive message and kind of kind of work with everyone on and get the you know all the managers to work with their teams on but like like  do we've weathered storms before but it's yeah it's time to get this is starting to look really bad yes between the way that money is not flowing freely anymore with interest rates being what they are with the way that you know it's it's it's a funny thing like you know oh
inflation like you know not bad anymore it's like right but but all the inflation that like happened it didn't go away like everything is still more expensive yeah so I mean did did your hourly wage go up to match it before okay so then this problem hasn't gone away at all just because inflation's leveling out that's like actually not how that works um it's it looks rough so out there handyman um as he tends to be was handy again with yet another link um layoffs.fyi I've heard of this site
uh I I think I clicked on it as like a middle click Mouse wheel into another tab at home but never actually ended up looking at it you can filter so click the drop down due 2024 yeah 5686 employees from 37 companies laid off this year it's been 12 we're 12 days in we're not even two weeks in sheesh dude yeah Google is a fifth of them almost a thousand twitch there's twitch okay I have no idea what branch is but I'm sure it's something a fair amount of these I have personally heard of yeah you can filter by 
um all right rough Etsy laid off a bunch of people 11% Intel 31 I don't know what Intel tidle tidle laid off 10% of their Workforce rivian lost some Cruz 24% "Spotify 1,500 I forgot about that" one oh here hold on why am I sort by this oh what oh man yeah I I guessed and I did the wrong one Spotify 1500 that's wow VMware "2,837 now this is every year now" um wow rough uh and another bad news valve has cracked down on a couple of fan projects recently uh they asked the developer of
portal 64 a Dake of portal playable on the Nintendo 64 to list the project on GitHub likely to avoid legal action from Nintendo and the company likewise served GitHub with a dmca takedown for Team Fortress Source 2 a project aiming to Port TF2 to the source 2 engine a valve explicitly allows the creation and distribution of games based on its IPS in the steam subscriber agreement including games like black Mesa which can be purchased on Steam but notably the creator of Black Mesa received
explicit approval from valve Gary Newman creator of Gary's Mod speculated that valve may have taken action simply because the game wasn't derivative but a full copy of their existing game including all of their assets um discussion question here is is valve right in enforcing a certain boundary around their IP is this a fair line to draw I mean I I do think it's it is reasonable it's just more that valve has always been very permissive and so this may be coming as a bit of a surprise to
these folks and it's a little frustrating that given that I've been aware of at least portal 64 for quite some time that they didn't say something earlier on in the process that's kind of all I really have to say about it yeah yeah uh video games no longer the biggest entertainment medium in Britain okay you you thought this one was really interesting for some reason I just video games have been the biggest entertainment medium for a long time and  think being on the top is actually
pretty important in regards to you know gaining eyeballs interest affordance all that type of stuff um so affordance isn't that a thing I love your words isn't that a thing affordability I think is what you're looking for affordance the quality or property of an object that defines its possible uses or makes clear how it can or should be used okay  improperly in 2023 video I think you mean unproperly oh no um in 2023 video games were surpassed for the first time in over a decade as the UK's biggest
entertainment medium in terms of Revenue games are still growing as an industry increasing year-over-year by 2.9% uh I wonder what the population is increasing by I suspect it's similar or even higher however video game content grew far faster at 10% compared to 2022 oh driven primarily by streaming knon whatever that is uh head of publishing recently theorized that part of Gaming's recent struggles is due to a boom in the sheer volume of new titles as a result of overinvestment during the
2020 pandemic he further stated that there's simply too many games for customers to be able to play steam saw a record total of over "14,000 game releases in 2023 though that" was in part pushed by amateur game devs it is every year though um it's also partially in part of like uh just AI dialogue games that were just crapped out um yeah kind of kind of a rough one what I'm missing in the notes here and I didn't see in the Rock Paper Shotgun article and I'm going to check the
gamesindustry.biz one is uh what is now the number one is number one yeah yeah I don't actually I don't see that uh blah blah blah blah blah blah okay yeah no I don't I don't see it so maybe maybe someone knows like music um movies video streaming I like I I I don't actually know but hopefully someone can let us know that um in other news framework has been hacks sored oh no framework has disclosed uh and I need to disclose my investor thing I I didn't have it in the stupid Asus sponsored CES
videos uh oh I forgot uh oh sorry I'm still I'm still I'm still invested in framework uh framework has disclosed a data breach following a fishing attack against a thirdparty accountant working for keting Consulting the attacker used an email impersonating framework CEO to convince the accountant to share a sensitive spreadsheet associated with outstanding balances for framework purchases framework has already notified customers whose personal information was leaked including full name email and the
balance owed the company reportedly became aware of the breach yesterday morning roughly half an hour after it happened framework says that keing Consulting employees with access to framework customer information will be required to complete fishing and social engineering attack training uh discussion question says disclosure disclosure disclosure are you confident in the way framework dealt with this issue uh I'm going to I'm just going to recuse myself so we'll have um Dan and
Luke discuss it while I go to the bathroom laptop uh computer information leak don't do that  price really you guys that's the best you can do well our  what uh discussion question is L is an idiot is that on there no that would be sick if it was uh um I I think it could happen to anybody right yes that's kind of my take on this is uh we like we as a as a company whenever we do web entity stuff The Forum float plane everything else we've done we're taking this idea forward with the the lab's website we
try to take and retain as little of your stuff as possible while still being able to do the things that we need to do which does involve taking some of your stuff when it comes to information uh we need to be able to you know um figure out if we're serving you video properly uh we need to know some of your account details so that you can like recover your account if you need to and have your own personal account and those various different types of things um but watch history for like a service of how
how much how long did you watch this video for I know that's very popular on YouTube and stuff like that too yeah we've got that as well um like we we capture that type of data um but not only is it possible that this type of thing could happen to us it did quite a while ago uh some of the Forum information we don't know how much we think a very small amount but we don't actually know so we just told everybody um but some of the Forum information was was broken into was hack Zord um and
yeah also on the Forum we tried to have as little of it as possible that you didn't want to be there um like there was uh there was things that were highly elective you know um like you could but those were public on your profile so I don't think it really counts anyways this also doesn't look like it's uh negligence you know they had a they had a spreadsheet that was that I guess had lists of names like did it have their credit card information on the spreadsheet no balance it's just P
personal information right uh I mean we've seen lots of other hacks and things like that where they get a hell of a lot more information PL text password passwords emails addresses this is just names and money I think yeah yeah and it was a proper fishing attack again like like when you look at uh we we we just looked at a website that was um people that have been laid off but there's have I been pwned That's a classic yeah um have I been pwned is still around I'm jumping
it up right now uh 740 pwned websites "with 100,000 what is that 12 billion" pwned accounts this stuff happens all the time um the jumping on here and seeing the like yeah recently added breaches uh halfway uh leandos I don't know what that is leond do.tv there's a lot of users there um you guys know you're the wor constantly why I throw your chips across the room mean guy we did our best I think we did good once you left oh oh yeah I just immediately uh immediately serious it after you left
the room we can't be showing you up here L yeah yeah no we like it I don't know I'm not saying it's definitely not a good thing but like at this point in time if you're putting information at any point in time really but if you're putting information on the internet um you should know that there is a chance that that information can get hacked leaked Etc um and be prepared for the inevitable eventuality of it happening to some site that you have that information on you don't necessarily
know which one it's going to be you don't know how you don't know why you don't know if you'll be included in the pile of accounts that do actually get um some amount of data taken from them whatever um but it's like it's going to happen um as much as you can that is very good um early quick disclosure is very important in these situations because users as much as everyone tells them not to they're going to have the the same password across different uh platforms so if the password is leaked which it
doesn't sound like it was in this case but if a password is leaked they need to be able to respond very quickly and change that if other sensitive information is leaked um payment information etc etc etc it's good for them to know if even just their name or something like that is leaked maybe I don't think having association with framework is going to be a problem but maybe having association with whatever service that is uh could be bad for them for some reason K her J1 says learned my
lesson from the Ashley Madison breach so that's an example of what you were just talking about yeah yeah association with the service but just in general you don't necessarily know why it might be important to your users so don't mess around with it tell them as soon as you can um is Ashley Madison still a thing I have no idea apparently it is yes life is short have an affair they even still have the same tagline why change it the original extramarital dating site 50 million members there's
no way those are all real yeah yeah some tiny fraction of those going to be real yeah so I don't know uh it sucks but it's funny cuz extra marital sounds like like super extremely extremely marital yeah I am in a hyper marital relationship who knew that inflammable meant flammable you know jeez yeah so I think that's all there is to say on that um are we done should we do more of these or should we just jump into after dark we can do more of these there's some more I want to talk about LG's washing
machine oh yeah where's that very bottom I want you to read this one cuz it's going to be fun I know this one actually oh that's a shame um I was definitely keeping up with this one um an an an LG washing machine user recently found that his Appliance was using 3.6 gigabytes uh a day he joked that it was a uh download DLC downloadable laundry Cycles very funny uh but also found that he couldn't disconnect the machine from the Internet only switch it to a different Wi-Fi signal eventually he
blocked the machine via his router uh amazing so this isn't like it grabbed a big update this is  encrypted something something what the no idea but it's amazing someone found that it matched uh I think it was like Evon lines uptime or something um which like I mean I can't look through the Twitter thread because I'm not signed in and the site basically doesn't work anymore if you're not signed in um but yeah people were trying to like kind of theorize what it was doing with
obviously basically no information and it was very funny that it basically followed Evon lines up time but like I seriously doubt that means anything um but yeah yeah just having a ton of junk in  great you know what's great wo after dark yeah I'll do it % waited for him to move a bit it's 8% I know it's 8% I fell see Luke this is why we don't have to document anything cuz we all just know that's how it works right I didn't know yeah but Luke knew yeah but Luke won't always be here
because I'm going to be the one to win the streak I don't know about that yeah it's going to be it's going to be me I'm going to win how do you think that's going to happen I mean I moved a flight for this I have moved multiple flights and multiple vacations for this I have taken three Wan shows in 2023 were while I was on vacation and I did it anyways as of yesterday I've made it even more to do this remotely so now there's no excuse I don't know if anyone's winning  War um yeah we've already accounted for
me to be on W show during my trip to Japan good that's required it's mandatory y we we now will have both been in Japan and doing W show there you go the latency is really bad yeah the latency is pretty rough um yeah all right Dan hit me all right let's see what we got hey D it was awesome being able to chat with Matt from procurement on your CES on the CES show floor obviously there was a ton of AI products this year but what stood out to you that didn't lean on AI there's a whole section about that yeah
we kind of talked about this earlier in the show I mean um notable non- AI demos if we if we made a video about it it stood out to us I watched Adam's video on these cool flip back VR controllers so cool so it frees up your hands to do stuff and then you just flip them back and yeah right oh yeah I wasn't that into every if they get the haptics of that is haptics the right term the no it's not but I understand what you mean ergonomics the feel yeah yeah but I feel like there's a better
word I don't know if they get that right that could feel amazing mhm tactility says awkward chips that's that's not bad yeah um so that that was pretty cool um I wasn't that into some of their accessories they have a little BR nor cone with a little spit absorber so that you can be less loud when you're in like VR chat I don't know I mean if you have a roommate that you're bothering or whatever I guess but I don't know just okay I don't think I need the spit collecting mouth cone
please I'll avoid that one I think I'll pass on that one too oh man hello Danny and the Jets was recently out to dinner with co-workers at a sports loungebar and they had a super checks didn't get a chance to play but it looked amazing which model do you have lonus I have a super checks from the '90s so not a super Check Pro and not an original checks it's a super checks hi wanf fam. dll lonus spoke a few weeks ago of a badminton racket gift that happened to Land Based on
preferences what are your racket specs and how do you get high-end rackets in Canada um I have a strong preference for head heavy overall light rackets um so so they're heavier at the head end versus the bottom um and that's a little bit better for attack it's a little bit better for generating power when you're driving or smashing um not that kind badminton rackets are not involved in that and as for the overall lightness I find it helps with defense uh just to be able to to move the head faster in order
to hit the shots back over um so it was an asox 99 was the one that um that I quite liked and then I right now I'm actually a nanoflare 700 guy so I have a handful of those that I keep strung up I forget what the rest of your question was oh I don't know yo Pro Shop uh they're they're they're local um but they also have a web shop their shipping super expensive cuz they ship in Canada so I mean I get it just how it is yeah H yeah it's hard to get down to Richmond when they're open though so I I tend to have
to order from them online does the Canadian government subsidize shipping no yeah a lot of governments do actually yeah people are chanting envelopes oh right envelopes uh yes I don't I have no idea what this is yeah I guess we'll open them they're from origin PC yeah and they look kind of holiday and they're sitting on the wow set I have no context for this whatsoever I think they're Christmas cards and they just showed up late that's my theory I have no idea happy holidays from origin PC oh wow
they didn't even write anything on them okay sick thanks guys now we know what was in them go ahead Dan hey guys lonus my big screen VR headset has finally got a label and is ready to ship how has your headset held up so far any dead pixels or such no oh shoot that reminded me of something for a previous merch message they were asking about cool stuff that wasn't AI micro OLED displays that used like Silicon deposition rather than inkjet printing to achieve crazy densities I'm talking 3500 pixels per
inch crazy bright there's this company um imagine hold on hold on hold on imagine Samsung acquisition Samsung acquired them uh they were in the um yeah yeah imagine um they acquired them for around $218 "million and oh man so they had a 10,000" nit micro uh I believe OLED I believe it was micro OLED display um that one didn't have the same density cuz it was done using the older um like printed style of uh manufacturing but these these new like like deposition ones they're not as bright yet but they're
saying they'll have like a fifth of the power consumption and once they can get the brightness up man these things are going to be flipping crazy for AR and VR displays and stuff like that I'm very excited yeah that's wicked cuz like that that level of pixels per inch like I'm not going to care in most scenarios but when it's strapped right in front of my face yeah for sure okay lmg southy in the chat says oops maybe shouldn't have left those on W set LOL who is lmg souie souie I'm assuming the guy that
works at the door selfie what does that oh is this just is it a handle yeah oh okay all righty go ahead Dan uh yeah sure yeah yeah hello Luke Dan and Tech tips men my favorite part of LTX 2023 was the live W show with the land Center coming does that mean we may get some more live W shows in the future with how close it is I feel like we would just do W here and then drive over yeah not not to be that guy sorry but it's honestly way easier we'd save a lot of Dan's time oh my God you would
yeah oh my God yeah in in and less stress for opinion in the uh in the sake of saving an enormous amount of time and honestly for the people that aren't there probably making the show better we would just do it here and then drive over after I could put it up on a  though maybe I mean maybe but people are probably also just going to want a game and uh yeah I don't know you're out of land you should be gaming yeah yeah yeah hi w.do bought a 550x to upgrade my am4 to make it a Home Server only to find
out am4 lacks support for Windows Server as AMD Devil's Advocate can you make up a reason that other than just go to buy Epic no um I I actually didn't know that is that on Microsoft or is that on AMD probably AMD I would think um I know that server has very specialized qualifications for drivers and things like that right yeah sort of um like a lot of stuff will just run if you can convince it to install um like there used to be uh like like files that you could just add new versions of Windows
to and it would just install and like probably work perfectly um I uh are you are you sure that you can't just force an install people are saying they didn't know that in chat um when 10 and 11 drivers will work fine 99% of the time people are saying like yeah if you just if you just run if you just run the Windows 10 and windows 11 install or will it just work cuz that was my  time okay hey din Duke and Lan I am running for US House of Representatives in 2026 we need more Tech literate people in
government see Tik Tok hearings if you could make or repeal any laws what would you guys do oh man I thought this one might be interesting one issue is we're not Americans so yes we don't really I would definitely I would definitely start to look at liability for um personal information sharing like it should it should if you did it on purpose it should basically be the end of your company if you said you wouldn't um like you I I I just I I don't really um I don't really understand why it's
just this constant game of you know wrist slap and go back to doing it and wrist slap go back to doing it yeah um I'm also I'm also super not into the uneven handling of antitrust in the US like they the way they went after Microsoft and then just didn't go after other people sat on ass for 30 years 25 years or whatever it works out to just has made no sense to me um not that them going after Microsoft was necessarily bad or wrong but if you were going to do that you should have treated the other 
hi lldd question for lonus I'm a new dad the son is 4 months old that's not really a question do you have any advice on how to juggle being a father husband and working it gets very overwhelming some  videos strap in baby um I mean it gets easier year uh the first 6 months is from what I've seen so far the hardest at least until you get to teenage years which I've heard are very challenging but I'm not there yet um just that level of dependency is is really really tough I'd
say I'd say the biggest thing is um be be consistent set expectations um set expectations with you know the kids um if you say you're going to do something do it and you know be realistic if you're not able to do something you know be upfront um if you say that something needs to be done then hold to it until it is done because otherwise it's just going to be a fight every time and you know it's the it's the same with the spouse you got to negotiate you got to you got to compromise and it's the same
with work you've got to set expectations like look I I can't I can't be there uh if if the answer is you know well then you're not going to be eligible for this promotion then you need to set expectations with yourself and understand that you have a balanced life that is not going to be 100% % focused on career and that's that's the choice  it hey L LD as a recent purchaser of a Chevy Volt I feel like the car is way ahead of its time what's your favorite piece of tech that felt ahead of its
time and held that feeling long after  Volt easy hey lld how's uh God that is it's usually his example to that question it's only example it is fair uh great it's his it's the best example yeah that car is like five six years old the one that I was driving I would still choose it over the vast majority of what's sitting on the lot today if I was shopping for a car it's probably what I would get hey lldd how uh how does Mac address do in terms of value to lmg and the ability to cover app Apple products
given your relationship with them I think I think so like basically does having mac address get you more access to Apple products no um I think that I think they might have gotten an email or something at some point maybe gotten on a call at some point I I'm I'm not that involved in the relationship management side with  idea sorry I snorted um yeah oh sorry uh Dan it's helpful if you leave the one we're talking about up and don't archive it yet so that I did oh I don't
see it no it's archived someone archived it I didn't oh all right must have been me normally I normally I leave them up anyway yeah I like to refer back down to them no you're good you're no no no no I'm looking at it now I'll be more mindful um how feel the MAC address Channel doing in terms of in terms of value to lmg I mean I I think it's been a really interesting um study case study for us you know can we build a channel that isn't just covering PCT Tech with a slightly different phas
from a different perspective or with you know kind of a different spin um and okay yeah Macs are personal computers as well but uh I think it's I think it's got a really unique identity um and I think that there's a lot that we have learned there's a lot that has gone really right um there's also a lot that's gone wrong you know it's not uh I think you might have noticed you know the the release schedule is a little bit erratic um and that's there's no single point that we can that we can look at
and go okay well you know here's here's the problem um so there's a lot that's good there's a lot that's not as good there's a lot we've learned and no I I it hasn't helped my personal relationship with you know anyone at Apple that's for sure hey dlll with a baby on the the way in March any Tech advice for a new parent maybe the best thing you had for your kids when they were infants just a basic baby monitor was all we needed we didn't go video or anything like that I I wanted to mention
kind of the baby monitor thing uh don't don't don't just don't get an Internet connected one maybe yeah yeah yeah let's go with that I want I want to say get the lizard but I don't think that would be safe the lizard baby monitor as in as in a monitor lizard I that face please don't kill me uh LTD must guard its Competitive Edge but I but would lonus ever host classes or content on its guidelines or Lessons Learned for writing uh people management or workflows Tech adjacent tips always
interested me the L show I mean I'm an open book guys you can you can ask ask me anything in a merch message and assuming you you know buy enough stuff then I'll no no it's not how it works actually but um yeah I I don't consider that to be a Competitive Edge guarding thing you know I've always taken a very similar approach to Mr Beast where my advice might not be as good as his you know he's clearly been more successful than I have in terms of attracting eyeballs to his content um but I I I'm open with it
if anyone asks me anything I'm always happy to give the best answer I can sometimes people ask questions that I can't answer like Hey lonus how do I stand out I'm like I don't know yeah how do you stand out yeah there is there is limitations to the format as there is with pretty much every format but um we talk Lots about sort of business philosophy which um you know sometimes does great for us and other times I feel like bites Us in the butt uh like I think our I've talked a lot about how I
think our our overall approach to transparency ends up harming us more than it helps us yep we're not going to change though I it's just it's it's part of the DNA like it or not um as for like writing and workflows like I I actually I shared a little while ago our our uh laws of writing good videos like that's that's it that's that's what we do you can that's a formula that you can take and you can apply for sure I don't remember which wo it was in but there's that site that you
can search wo transcripts or something like that so you could probably you could probably find it um Colton's been wanting me to do a course like a like a formal course forever we wouldn't even have to publish it on a third party site like skillshare or whatever we could just publish it on float plane but I just um I haven't gotten around to it and a big part of that is I just I don't know I feel like people really want to know that like I I'll I'll tell you just I don't know ask me
and we'll we'll get it sort we'll get it sorted out hi A.D um hold on this is the same one as before at conventions like CES is it difficult to deal with people coming up to you um it's mostly can be kind of depends on timing and I find personally yeah it it's mostly like context I think that um no disrespect intended but a lot of the time um you know the Tech Community is my people and sometimes we are not always the most socially aware um like okay okay this is great uh this video is
not up yet but there's um our our video on back to front motherboards in the Corsair Suite der bow showed up and started recording a bit where like obviously I was going to be in his video and it took me a full probably 5 minutes before after I had like appeared in his thing to realize is that I should probably invite him to be in ours that I was in the middle of shooting not because I meant any disrespect or because I didn't want him in the video focused I just hyperfocus right like I
just so I I so I realized before he left and I and I uh and I like kind of quickly came up with a way that even though my content was scripted I had spent the first couple of hours in the suite researching writing and um and on the teleprompter so it's all written by me but it's scripted and I kind of figured out a spot where I could throw in sort of a a natural looking uh conversation with him and uh fortunately I caught him before before he left but he could have easily left and I would
have just rudely not reciprocated again not because we're not cordial or not because I didn't want him in the video just because I was completely oblivious and I can I find that sometimes my peeps can be a little oblivious if I'm walking briskly no I don't have a lot of time um and it's you know if you can if you can if you can walk in selfie you know cool yeah let's let's do it let's do it brother but like um you know don't don't try and do a product demo for me like it's it's cues like that that
you know or if if the conversation seems over you know yeah like you're not saying anything anymore and I said you know  CES take off you know yeah and it's like I'm not you know mad or anything it's just and I get it it's it's just it can be a really high nerves moment it can be a lot to deal with um  so yeah it's fine um like I you if I didn't if I didn't like the attention it's not like I couldn't just not go to conventions it's not like I couldn't just not do this career anymore like
obviously it's all right like I you know I like seeing the community out there I'm sure at your channel size you could request that booths are like vacated while you're there oh absolutely um I'm sure that you could move more Ino I tell people not to yeah yeah like they'll they'll ask like do you want everything roped off I'm like no I don't want things roped off I want it to look like I'm at a freaking trade show I'm at a trade show am I not yeah most people have enough of a clue to not walk up in
the middle of a rolling camera it still happens it does happen yeah I even had people say like I know you're in the middle of a shot but I just wanted to say hi and I was like cool like if you're another Creator and we have some kind of an existing relationship by all means had that happen and and it was good and I've done that to other people in fact I I popped into Tex video which he might have cut out because I made some comment about Epstein's flight list or something I'm not sure poor Roby dude
why why are you like this oh yeah you come do it to us but if I see you I forget why it was like um oh man what was what was the logic it was like well now that now that you're associated with me you're going to you're going to get dragged down and into my you know ASM of cancellation so something like it was something like that yeah that's rough great yeah he's [Laughter] great I support you any who uh let's see at that one out of the way I have been an electrical engineer for over a year
now but I'm not sure I actually enjoy engineering particularly for a company that's just trying to drive profits any advice don't work for a company then because that that's what they do yeah so I I they're not profitable they don't exist and if they don't exist your job doesn't exist so I was I was going to plan on being a little bit nicer about it but effectively get the exact same message through um or do your own thing and you might not have the capital right now you know or you can start small you
can start on the side you know build a company that runs the way you want it to run but those are your only options you can work for someone else and kind of deal with some of their or you can take your ball and go home company has to make profit or else they won't be able to pay you but you might also be able to look around and find another company who's like mission statement or drive or whatever better aligns with things that make your soul happy or whatever absolutely find find a mission that
speaks to you yeah so like if you if you're working at a company that's like yeah we don't care it's just money we just want money which there's a bunch of those um and you might like that but if you're working in a company the fingernails from babies if they made our cars go faster you know like there's companies like that there are legit that sounds like an exaggeration but they're nothing surpris me after that eBay thing oh there's way worse though oh man yeah anyways um but you might be able to look
around you might have to take a little bit less money because companies doing that are very likely um you know I mean they're not hunting profits as hard so they're very likely doing things that are less profitable therefore they' very likely have less money um but if you can accept the the hidden cash you might be able to work somewhere that um Mr worldwide asks is making a company really practical as an electrical engineer well it depends what kind of scale you're trying to operate on I mean
you absolutely we we bought um bought no they might have sent them but they sell them for sure to other people but we got these really cool uh custom pcie gen four risers I think they were were they Gen 5 compatible I don't know they were really cool basically there's like a guy who makes these PCI Express extenders that we used in our oneu gaming systems for the for the land Center uh We call we called uh we called them out in the video but as far as we can tell it's a
guy who designs these things and sells them probably an electrical engineer or electronics engineer which I actually did not know was a different thing until probably like six years ago five five five or six years ago when I um started playing badminton with an electronics engineer who got upset when I said when I introduced her to someone else as an electrical engineer she's like um actually and I was like oh I might deepest most sincere apologies I thought they were just like different sides of
the same coin I thought it I thought it was the same get that a lot yeah because I bet you most people think they well she runs a pet store now so I don't even know what her issue is it's like you don't even do any Electronics engineering I still earned this I mean one of my family members is a fully qualified lawyer passing the bar and everything he realized I don't like being a lawyer and now he plays Billiards professionally poker and he sells jet skis so like weird weird man
he's like bar pass and everything fully qualified lawyer like I want to play poker so it be you that's fantastic smart people tend to find ways to do stuff he been very successful yeah yeah but yeah anyways you're going to be somewhere that cares about profit or you're going to be working at a nonprofit and some not for profits are  extremely profit focused just in a different way so yeah um maybe start shopping for another job it might be more based at uh based around the the
place that you're currently working in theer yeah all right has any Mega Corp like Microsoft with the recent login issue ever responded to you chastising them on camera for annoying long term yeah oh yeah including Microsoft including Microsoft I would say Microsoft's response was pretty good every time I saw it I don't think they've actually fixed the modern standby thing though so oh well that um as for that login issue in the recent short circuit man freaking hilarious that stupid Loop login issue
on um Halo infinite if you if if you're trying to switch accounts it'll be like I don't know the password uh forgot password can't do that switch accounts and it'll just it'll just loop around you you I can't get out of it unless you can log into that account or you go delete some stupid like credential saved in credential Manager in Windows freaking ridiculous how about this how about just just none of this that that's an option I mean bought the game on Steam you know
who I am um yeah any like I there might be some reason why this is bad or something but because you have to log into the stupid thing I am logged into whatever the Xbox account I'm I'm logged into all the various Windows gaming junk on my computer cuz I was trying to trying to somehow get forsa multiplayer to function without uh falling apart completely uh which I wasn't successful at um why why can't it just grab the login from that the teams one that we talked about last week is probably the
one that makes me the most angry when it logs me out which I never asked it to do and then I need it to go away right now and you can't close it it'll just keep reopening until you reauthenticate also there's a there's a bug in teams where if you click it'll it'll prompt you for uh text for SMS or phone call and if you click it right away or something it like doesn't work until you like close it and then click it or something do do you know the one I'm talking about yes I
I've ran into that yeah like that's been there for years a long time yeah yeah like it's like it's like people at Microsoft don't use their own software anything like that should be solved within a week if they're using the software based on just how avoidable and how obnoxious it is this was like probably five years ago so it's been quite a while um but I knew a team at Microsoft that used slack this was a long time ago no idea if that's still a thing all right hey Luke how do you feel about EOD
filing being removed from tarov oh also your thoughts on tarov right now as a whole cheers guys uh I guess yeah I don't know the EOD being removed from tarov thing I I don't know if I care um what is the EOD thing end of day it it's uh Edge of Darkness I think it stands for U and it was just like a fancy expensive version of the game that you could buy that like you had more storage space in the game and things like that um yeah I don't know if it really matters um as far as my understanding goes a lot
of the cheaters just bought non EOD accounts anyways and that the only thing I I really care about with the game um in regards to that I guess would be anything they can do to reduce cheaters um and they're not doing enough so I don't really care if they turned off EOD or not if they still haven't you know done a lot for cheaters um it also gave you access to all future DLC like Arena okay uh they've released one thing since they launched EOD they launched EOD what like 8 years ago or something
and there's been one thing for for $20 why so I'm going to save $208 years from now like I don't know personally them turning off EOD I don't think it matters for the community at all maybe someone disagrees with me maybe there's some reason and whatever um the current wipe I am actually playing it uh there are a bunch of Cheaters still uh they're very easy to find they added a thing where you can view the profile of the person that that uh killed you um and you can see they're like KD how old
their account is uh all these other various things um which is very interesting except it combines this is not going to make sense to either of these guys but it combines your your PMC and your scav stats together in that view um so cheaters can uh tank their KDs by just going and dying on a scav because you can't view their PMC specific stats which is just like I don't know the these things that are just annoying there's still still very easy ways to detect them like viewing uh
their account on flea and stuff like that there is a lot of really great things in the current patch this has been a very fun wipe to play I don't know if I'm going to end up playing the whole thing or not um there's some things that are already feeling pretty painful like the the armor changes they have actual plates in the game now that you can take in and out of um like armor carriers and whatever else that is cool uh except it's like super bugged in a bunch of different ways CU of course it
is um you can see PMC specific stats yeah I think that's for yourself I don't think that's for the other people um maybe I'm wrong about that I know you can see that for yourself you can see scav PMC and overall combined but I think for other people you can only see their overall uh vaulting is a great addition to the game they did some changes to recoil which feel fantastic they did some changes to uh ammo that's found in raid and and what ammo you can put on the flea and that all actually
seems to be an improvement to me different changes to The Hideout including Hall of Fame and the weapon rack both seem fantastic um bunch of different things that feel better the game's still riddled with cheaters hey take take that back I used to be a hatchling back in the early day did you play I did yeah right when it came out it was like the new hotness right yeah but I never got to the point of meta that you did which is very interesting to see to be perfectly honest yeah I I can't I I wish I could I
wish I could fully permanently quit  because yeah boy is it a frustrating game to enjoy but I hate those I keep I keep coming back do I want another one yeah hey lldd Sal lonus review of the pixel 8 on short circuit and has made me consider swapping back to Android I saw that the photos look great in the video how much has Luke's experience reflected this oh um I'm not so much of a photo Taker and my feelings on phones are going to be very boring to you if you want reviews out of them um I mostly
just want it to get out of my way and it has successfully done that to be honest um my main complaints would be about the form factor I kind of wish I bought the smaller one but that's also becoming less of an issue over time cuz I just don't really care that much um I have had no issues with bugs which is nice um it seems like a very good phone I don't know seems like a great phone I just my amount of cares for phones these days is not super high what do you think of the current
state of the internet where everyone is mostly going on like five big platforms and websites blogs and forums are visited not that often by average people I mean I think it was better before Google search got so much worse like I feel like um that really does seem to be the core problem yeah they will It's a combination of them trying to give you the result right under your search query rather than clicking through to actually you know read anything or give a visit to the site
that the information was pulled from and um and just generally being less useful like man is it ever full of ads and sponsored posts and just it's like it's hard to even remember how good it was before um yeah I know there's no there's no doubt that it's a huge problem and we saw this with with the Reddit Uprising that ended up being not even an uprising at all  um seems like we're in kind of like a lockin for the first time of the inter there's certain sites that just seem
like they will like never go away oh with my pixel no I've had no issues with people are people are saying um any Wi-Fi dat connection issues no not at all um and I've actually been I've been playing a ton of Pokemon go so I can get out for walks um I think it was last weekend I walked I think it was 16 kilomet on Saturday Alone um and have had zero issues whatsoever so yeah know no problems there it's been it's been honestly in regards to bugs and issues like that it has been
Flawless zero problems in that regard at all in your aw 2725 DF review you uh shocked with how much better you were tracking in Halo were you aware that Halo added a assist for Mouse do you think this is a good thing for the future of FPS games I was not aware um I'm honestly not that big into it for future of FPS games but what I will say is that I went home and played some more alien some more alien some more Halo infinite at home and was not playing as  that hi w. dll mind-blowing seeing
Thunderbolt share assuming it's specific to Blue CPU and GPU but do you think this will be the push Intel's gpus need what are the implications for the industry and businesses um I think this is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of what this could be used for um especially if Thunderbolt gets to the level of ubiquity that I would like to see it at um as for being specific to Blue CPU and GPU actually I do not think that is the case it's software based so right now it's only for Thunderbolt
certified computers um I think it is not impossible that eventually Intel could gift this to USB if the same way that they did the Thunderbolt 3 specification in the first place um as for the GPU though that is not Intel specific you could have a different GPU in the system no problem and Thunderbolt share would work exactly the same way it does now theoretically it's all Alpha right now though lonus was buying the TCL 115 in TV the only time you felt buyer remorse um I don't actually have any
buyer remorse that's I guess I'm just a really good actor uh it was it's mostly a hook for the video it's an excuse to talk about high senses um potentially better TV but here's the thing High sense's TV is not out Samsung's TV will probably cost many times what the TCL one did High senses TV is also smaller and I'm watching content on my TCL right now I'm actually stoked on that purchase it's a wicked TV it's like kind of amazing I freaking love it honestly the story attached to it is super cool yeah
yeah the fact that it's like my smuggled TV um and you know before you before you call me out on this I don't think I don't think a throwaway line in a video like doing show coverage of another TV that has better on paper specs where I say so this is what buyers remorse feels like is I don't think it's dishonest I think it's just one of those things where it's like I'm I'm I'm playing a bit of a character sometimes in videos um and I could I could see someone being frustrated that they bought a TV in you
know December um and then forgot about CEs in January when all the cool new stuff is going to get announced but no I'm I'm not I'm not upset hey w.png how have you sorry I forgot my rule how how hey w. have you all been able to enjoy tech for what it is and uh not like instantly start thinking about how you would script it into a new video no even me oh that's hard and I've been out of it for years I still see stuff and go like video idea like it's it's just that's interesting it's drilled
into my brain hole do you still get the same like rush cuz you just went video idea like does it still feel like that kind of yeah and then I'll I'll literally like sit there and try to break down like okay am I just excited about this because I like this thing or does this fit like the audience that we have blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah start analyzing it l looks really proud actually I I'll often fire off ideas like that to different writers on the team the amazing and
sometimes they either end up becoming a video however long later or they don't I don't know hi W dll it's 6:00 a.m. in Denmark and my so is annoyed I got out of bed just to send this message what are some dreams or wishes that you have for yourself or loved ones any long-term goals perhaps I want my kids to be able to find a community I talked about this a little bit before how I'm deeply concerned that their entire peer group is going to move away from the Vancouver area and they're
going to be left with nobody that they grew up with and I got to say for me um hanging around with people I grew up with honestly hasn't been that big of a deal like I I don't miss it that much I'm kind of not really a people person anyway um but there are times when I'm like oh man yeah it would have been cool to stay connected um and I would I don't want them to miss out especially if they are more people personally um I also want Ivon to be able to cut back I um just because I subject myself to this
forever doesn't mean that she should be subjected to this forever I think that um there's been a little bit of a renewed conversation around YouTuber burnout over the last couple of weeks we saw Tom Scott hang it up we saw Matt Pat hang it up um and you know people people have asked me before I've had a lot of conversations about this actually it's like you know um how you know how do you keep doing this or like I'll talk to people who are relatively new to the game and they'll be like yeah yeah I
could do this forever I'm like yeah well pace yourself um this career is a it's a destroyer um it's it's it's a ton of weight you know just having that constant um scrutiny right you can't you can't go home from work and ignore everything yeah and especially once you reach a certain level which you know obviously was the goal right is to you know to win the game to to get good uh but once you reach a certain level like you um I I always feel watched in public you are yeah and it's yeah that's not
like weird paranoia because anyone who build who's ever built a computer basically uh and no not really but when I walk around somewhere like a CES or  Buy yeah like when I'm driving down the street I'm like can I pick my nose right now you know right like I uh yeah yeah Jay is stepping back for health that's another one so it's yeah it's tough um I I I want Ivon to be able to cut back that's  goal yeah hey dll how do you guys stay organized to-do lists uh efficiency calendar management zero
inbox calendar Management's huge for me uh and teams and SL both supportive feature where you can send yourself personal messages uh I used to do the thing that I got from lonus which was I would email myself all the time um but sometimes in certain scenarios the ideas would be flowing quick and I'd be kind of spamming myself with emails and it would bury other stuff so I prefer pming myself on chat applications that support it which are the work ones luckily and both of them so I do that now I don't
send myself emails anymore I do sometimes technically and I don't know how I would Define the difference there but sometimes it makes more sense to me to send an email to myself than to send a chat message I I can't communicate the difference but I I do understand it  whatever and let's see hey D what is one non-tech skill that you are proud of having what is one non-tech skill you wish you had I enjoy playing musical instruments but I always wished I had more visual  skills that's a good deal on a Wan
hoodie I guess they used the uh credit   who that that was a merch message yeah yeah yeah U I think we're both trying to think of any Tech non any non-tech skills I have I do like three things I play badminton which I'm okay at I do this and I hang out with my family you're a really good husband ah yeah I'm great at sex there you have it slash  skill how'd you know that was a tech skill got my robotic Dingle I just assumed you  CES didn't I do that one year I think I did that one year I think I actually did
that one year really I got a little weird with it with CES content some oh yeah yeah that might be true I'm pretty sure I did that one year though moving on should we just move on uh I'm I'm pretty quick at folding laundry nice you know nice one of my chores outside of tech skill that I have have no idea um skill that I wish I had I I have always kind of felt this way I wish I had faster reaction time I don't think my reaction time is particularly bad but I think Reaction
Time applies to kicks my ass at like everything so like whatever so many things in life yeah all right well now I feel bad why cuz you beat me at like everything you also beat me at a bunch of stuff super checks we're going to play Super checks tonight and you're going to smash you beat me two weeks ago yeah it's not purely reflex based though is it no but reflexes improved so many things yeah so many things so many things so many different games actually oh wow he is slow I just didn't dodge that that was
Archangel of death that made me do that in float plane chat I got a mug here reflexes you can do a mug do a mug can DOD a ball I might Dodge that one um I I don't know I think I think they apply to I think far more games are really just who has better reflexes than people actually realize no no no no no I do not I do not win at Super checks because of my I'm not saying that I just mean like I can't even think of a game that you just win from reflexes strong disagree I think
you might be underestimating how much reflexes play a role in a game like super checks oh no no I absolutely agree with they play a role but I think that you could have much lower I think you could have much higher response times and do a lot with cutting down angles because as we've talked about super has a significant amount more of strategy and skill component than a lot of those types of games sure but like what games name a game he's got nothing the The Standard air hockey one no way tons of that is
reflexes sure but tons of it is also Precision yeah what a huge amount of the defense in that game is reflex if you play good enough shots you don't need defense so so reflexes can't be more than half of the game worse statement than my statement well your statement's terrible conad is trying to say badminton o yeah no I don't think so to be honest I think badmington probably takes this might be a really hot take that you might disagree with I think badmington might take less reflexes than
most people think when they watch it and I think it takes more strategy and planning and pre-positioning and stuff like that so it's a huge part of it is preparation yeah if you start swinging when you're defending especially at a high LEL if you start swinging for the defensive shot when your opponent strikes the shuttle you are too late you have to be swinging already and then they strike then you reposition then you hit um so yeah reflexes is not enough not even close you have to prepare ahead of time
and I mean I'm sure any baseball hitter will tell you the same thing it's like it's not part of it is like is is mental like it's it's got It's trying to read the other player it's like you can't just rely on reflexes so so raging ozaru said so bad drivers are more likely to have bad reflexes I don't know about that I think I'm getting hamburger hot doged right now pretty hard just just putting that out there just saying you're just completely getting rid of skill component to everything Luke
that's that's this is my point though is I think people are taking it that way which is literally not at all what I said um chewy says uh our community manager says part of its mental of its  steroids oh my goodness um jeez wow yeah yeah Bas okay all right what else we got I'm going to stop talking about it now but yeah I wish I could I wish I could yeah I think all of us understood see watch He's preparing that's what's  time Terri terrible tried to volleyball header it uh that's um not
volleyball try to football yeah yeah there we go good job got to play some footy Hi D maybe that's the skill I actually want yeah you just you just want to hit things with your head maybe I want to have not hit so many things with my head oh that's right hid.exe pronounced x e thanks for being awesome at Luke do you think there is a benefit in iil certification if looking to Pivot careers into it uh I would look at it jobs that you want or think you would be able to get based on your previously
existing uh experience in education slash the experience and education that you will gain before you start looking uh and look into what they need certifications can be good but what certifications different companies want can vary quite a bit a decent amount of them might not even necessarily be looking for any or if they don't list any they might still see certifications and see it as a benefit even though they're not listing it um the things that people look for is quite varied I
personally really like seeing home lab when I'm looking for people for it stuff uh it varies a lot so I can't really necessarily say yes or no I don't think it would hurt but I also think there there there might be better ways of doing so it it's it's not a bad thing it's a good thing um could just get into that Workforce now and be gaining experience which might be even better and maybe you get the certification while you were on the job maybe if that not possible maybe go get the CT it
ranges hey L DD uh who has given you the best tech advice that you weren't expecting sorry who is this lonus Duke and Dan I guess so or uh ldd so that would be DUS Duke and Lan oh I've had that a couple times I think that's the new one DUS I like that uh who's given you the best tech tech advice that you weren't expecting wasn't planning on buying this but let's go they got to swack it um I AR I archived I curated this but I couldn't think of an answer so the best tech advice you weren't expecting the
hard part usually I'm usually expecting Tech advice from the kinds of people who can give me Tech advice like sure I've gotten lots of great Tech advice from Wendell but like you walk into a room and you should be expecting Tech advice from wend so you know I can't think of what it is the first person that jumped in my mind was wend yeah I know I just I like stealing your answers for things but I was like yeah it's too expected I think I have one though uh is little man your son oh uh there was a I don't
remember what it was it was something either to do with Discord or Minecraft and he was like uh I think they were having some trouble with something and I had been asked to look into it and I was like I don't know anything about Minecraft and he ran up and just fixed it and I was like wow yeah he does know his mcraft nonsense pretty good yeah and this was like two years ago I think yeah I'm pretty sure Minecraft is the only reason he knows how to type but he can like touch type like oh okay for me it
was MSN Messenger for him it's Minecraft got it works actually it was the palace if I'm being 100% accurate the palace is why I learned to type and the reason was because people's uh messages were fleeting oh so was you had your avatar sitting next to each other and as far as I could tell I I don't remember it anymore but it was maybe there was a way to see the history for the room whether there was or wasn't it was definitely beneficial if you wanted to keep up with the flow of conversation um especially
because I I'm a multi message sender so I will I will Tee It Up and then I'll follow with like a punchline as two messages so I got to be quick if I want to do do that before they get a chance to respond to the first thing I said so it's I don't know it's a stupid thing but yeah I can definitely type um but yeah no he he can type and it seems to be because he doesn't have voice chat with randoms so he uses text chat a lot in game that makes sense got that lead speak yeah and that's it for the show we
