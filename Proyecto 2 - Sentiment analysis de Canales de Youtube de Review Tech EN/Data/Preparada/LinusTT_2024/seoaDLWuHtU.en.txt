it sucks when you buy into the latest technology only to wait years for the content to catch up and if you have an HDR display you know exactly what that feels like obscure anime old TV shows cult classics great movies the studio just didn't love enough forget about it now there are solutions to convert SDR to HDR like this one from Aja but "$2,000 I could get an RTX 2060 for a" tenth of that price on eBay and according to Nvidia it can do the same thing which means they finally did it
what Intel and Microsoft failed to do 20 years ago Nvidia has given the home theater PC its killer app but there's got to be some kind of catch okay but does it Spike power consumption like RTX super resolution it's got to look awful right is it full of artifacts like when dlss first came out you're just going to have to wait to find out what line is uh fine can I at least tell them about our sponsor okay pulseway make remote monitoring and managing your it systems easy with instant alerts Auto
remediation and realtime updates all from one platform anytime any place on any device start your free trial today with the link down below when Nvidia recently announced their new Nvidia app we assumed that they would move the RTX video HDR toggle into that alongside the beta that now works with games but instead no it is still buried in the old Nvidia control panel but the good news is that toggling it is as simple as click on click off plof suggested we start with Wicked City an anime from
1987 that looks like it's from 1987 this is pretty low bit rate dude anyway that's not what we're here for we want to see how our HDR toggle is going to  oh well that really is something isn't  that flatness in the clouds in the sky yeah it just gives it so much more depth kind of brightens up the whole image which I think looks good here yeah it looks really flat with HDR and all of a sudden it's like you see more detail too right this won't be the last time we touch on this but that may not be the
artist's intent that may be the artist's intent but as a viewer I know which one I would choose even I like this one better too and I tend to stick with artist intent right just like kind of a p this is even better okay hold on a second I haven't even toggled yet but  pop just looks kind of brighter and Bluer here it's lifting up some of the low lights which has the benefit of allowing us to see more details but honestly in the bar scene I feel like it's taking away from the mood a little
bit yes and that's kind of my issue with doing up mapping especially with some of these dark scenes the original Gray is Smokey and hazy and kind of gloomy whereas this is is bright it's very colorful yes poppy next up we've got Phil Tippets Mad God a stop motion film from 2022 that suffers from the long night syndrome and doesn't have an HDR  moment okay that is wow those lightning flashes though with the HDR toggle on he huge difference first lightning flash eh eh okay it's
on that's lightning now the color changed a lot here yeah the background went to like a blood red on off on that's changing the colors a lot yeah see I don't like that oversaturation it changes the mood of that scene right it really does however the effects boy does it ever make them pop oh yeah that looks good so you can see you can really see when it toggles you don't even have to check it's like oh yeah yeah yeah yeah I just need every movie to have a proper HDR grade because it's clear even with
this faux HDR how it could look without HDR the specular highlights on a slimy monster they don't look like slime they just look like I don't know smooth yeah tell me this though okay you've never seen the original grade how pleasing is this to the eye it's colorful I like it do you like it well I don't know what the heck's going on in the scene I like the Colors oh the highlights so much better just look at it you can really make out that detail right in the center of those
specular Reflections looks like a Shining Light we're off to a really great start aside from some minor quibbles about color saturation and the the mood there's no question that I would choose RTX video HDR over vanilla for everything we've seen so far except everything we've seen is two pieces of cont content and none of it included live action here's the thing a compelling use case for this Tech like with their RTX super resolution upscaling is streaming so whether you're
watching someone game or drop expensive technology on your screen now you can make just about everything pop a bit more and as you're about to see it's not all sunshine and rainbows here's a recent video that we didn't upload an HDR or did we ah the sunlight glinting off the garage door back there oh wow it really messes up some things like white  wow some of this is okay I mean these are people that I know obviously this is Maria and alade it actually adds a little bit more lifelikeness to them
like look at Maria particularly oh yeah    images would you take oh definitely the HR all right let's find some sweaty greasy looking people here you know what in this case um yeah you're definitely getting a little bit  glisten just gives it a bit more depth it doesn't feel in an unnatural way yeah I mean he's sweaty as hell and there's a ton of Lights in that oh those lights just kind of yeah I like it it's a weird fallof cuz you're going from like pure white to like the shine around it that's
what the court lines look like I'll tell you that much they don't look like that okay the towels a bit much that's a shiny towel yeah the court actually they look unnatural yep that's clearly not right if we weren't toggling back and forth and we weren't thinking about it I would feel like those Court lines have almost a reflective element to them yeah in person they don't honestly the only thing that's standing out to me is that towel in the left corner that towel is like unnaturally bright
God's towel I like it I just don't want to have to use the Plex web interface in order to enjoy it with my media library so if this worked with the app or was built into the Shield or something like I'm ready right now I'm mixed I think watching it now I've kind of grown into it but I don't know I still have to look at more things for me to like decide and it's going to be the same for you but what I will say is aside from some quirks it works pretty well however we haven't compared it to proper
HDR mastering yet our reptile brains just being tricked by more brightness and color just like if we were shopping at a Best Buy to find out we're going to use some of our own footage from my giant TV video I've been told that one of these files is HDR and the other is SDR masquerading as HDR using nvidia's tool that's fake oh they're not going to tell me yet it's good but it's fake you're right I know I'm right yeah in some ways the image is a little more pleasing but look at this I'm
pink whoops it's too bad I wanted it to be perfect but obviously a properly graded piece of content is going to pop where it's supposed to like this content behind me looks almost identical but is also going to retain the natural look of someone who is back lit and not for lit whereas I'm just I'm just lit why am I so FL flush was like drinking James looks better here though and that's interesting is NVIDIA making assumptions through the selection of their training data about properly lit people so is
this kind of like you know taking the the studio mode of your selfie camera and applying it to any content that you watch in fact now that I'm lit properly it's far less noticeable see in this dark shot I look more lifelike whereas this is more reflective of the fact that I have no light on me damn that is really close this is a very impressive example if I didn't know that that's a bit too much Brown for my couches I would probably take that image you're right it's very close like the
display is look basically the exact same here I actually think that the pinpoints on our light sources in the room look a little more convincing in the Nvidia version of course we're not using exactly the same display so there is a little bit of variation there but there's some banding here there like very little banding there oh you're right well spotted I didn't see that that's ugly oh wow interesting now that I know what I'm looking for this is a much more egregious example of what Brandon just
pointed out where that brighter object was clearly manipulated in a way that lost some of its original quality look at this compared to this there's a subtle difference and glow on the track from maybe the  this I'm still very torn looks pretty good handled this white background actually really well yeah I noticed Nvidia they do a good job for the most part at recognizing when something's like a white screen and not like blowing it up some of these look more lifelike on the f one which is very
interesting so how the heck are they doing this the first step is they expand the color gamut from srgb to srgb using a transformation matrix and I can practically hear you saying SC RGB I wasn't familiar with it either it's kind of a weird color space but their use of it here makes a lot of sense just like it makes sense to go with a Honeywell PTM 7950 thermal pad for your next build now available for a reasonable price from a reliable source LTD store.com srgb is compatible with regular srgb but
uses 16bit floating point to calculate a massive dynamic range compared to 8bit integer on srgb all while using the same white and black points so in total you end up with 281 trillion possible colors compared to the 16.7 million of srgb now when I say possible colors that's cuz we can't actually see a lot of them making scgb completely overkill for actually displaying anything modern panels don't have 16bit control over their pixels let alone the ability to reproduce trillions
of colors but what it's great for is internal rendering and mathematical computation so with that background in mind RTX HDR kind of works like dlss upscaling where Invidia is taking an image blowing it up then using machine learning to fill in the gaps it's the same idea here just with color and light so to train their model they analyze a ton of content ideally in both HDR and SDR then they take that converted srgb frame they apply their D noising algorithm and then they convert it to
bt2100 HDR using that AI model to Output a finished frame that brightens or dims specific spots in a scene or saturates colors to help them appear more Vivid ideally without it looking like a Best Buy demo it's really cool it also isn't really new windows 11 Auto HDR has been doing something kind of like this for SDR games for quite a while now often with decent results as long as you've completed Microsoft's calibration process it's also been a thing on the Xbox series X for a few years and it can
really make those older games pop all of a sudden bright flashes are hitting about a thousand nits and they actually flash instead of just Whiting at you of course all of this assumes that the display that you're using can reach that luminance level and display it accurately I've complained a lot on this channel about the HDR displays that are more like HDR R because while their vase is certified and they can interpret an HDR signal their backlight and panel technology just aren't good enough to
make much of a difference compared to watching something in SDR with all of that out of the way then what about games where the competition is tighter for nvidia's new hotness to investigate we've grabbed a couple of the latest QD OLED panels and we've upgraded our modest home theater PC with a second near identical computer for our second monitor by the way we'll have links to all of this stuff down below if you're looking for PC parts or maybe a new monitor oh look at that green that
saturation on the green okay here let's look at shiny boy here oh yeah yours look so much better okay hold on let me just CLI oh okay or we can shoot the shiny oh okay yeah well the shine still looks good even without oh come on it still looks pretty decent yeah it's all relative decency is relative flash on the Fireballs from the imps not even close what we're comparing right now is real HDR to SDR but that's not what we're supposed to be comparing why don't you go ahead and turn on RTX HDR yeah I
can actually see the appeal of the RTX HDR version of this yeah if you're into a really poppy contrasty look it's great and guess what most people people tend to prefer whether it's correct or not I know they want brightness they want contrast they want color and that's kind of what we're getting here I I honestly I'd probably turn it on even here I think it looks a little better than the uh actual native Doom HDR setting I mean the native Doom HDR is pretty good though it's pretty good man that is
really poppy though it's fun you know yeah there isn't a major impact on the visibility of dark regions or anything like that okay what's next Windows Auto HDR versus RTX HDR oh okay uh this does not look very good no no I I agree no it just doesn't have that Poppy contast it doesn't even look as good as the HDR implementation yeah it doesn't like the Nvidia one is taking it even further this one is like not taking it as far it's very dull like look at the the candy that pops out of the enemies is
not glow like this stuff looks okay the flashing but that looks decent in SDR anyway yeah this does not look a lot better than SDR to me if at all right I don't think I would turn this on in this game anyway it does make a lot of non HDR games pop a little more especially games who never got like they're older like 2010 and earlier than that for example I play a lot of DOTA with Windows HDR turned on yeah and uh not much you know but when you like get the big match accepted uh screen there's
like all these flashes of light and it looks pretty good but uh I'm going to probably turn RTX hdr on at home what's in convenient is that every game's implementation is going to either be best with auto HDR or best with RTX HDR or best with the games native HDR and switching between those is sort of a pain in the but oh yeah there this took a while to get working perfectly right like some games for example don't allow you to calibrate the brightest Point  display you're going to end up with all
these blown note clipped messes RTX HDR   son oh man it's such a small part of the scene but it makes such a difference it really does interesting and okay okay okay it's catching these lights on the little rad oh shoot oh balls I forgot this game is really hard yes um muzzle flashes wild yeah those muzzle flashes almost look like Stormtrooper  bright okay not going to lie pretty cool it's actually really not that overdone either though no man that glinted off the water too BL what's the I can't
remember I can't remember I haven't  years I keep expecting to like slide if I you know Sprint and Crouch no no man pre-s slide era old game just like super resolution this is pretty cool Tech but it comes at a cost it doesn't use up nearly as much power as the upscaling tool but it does consume a not insignificant amount and it's still in beta so there are some bug bears for example the video HDR doesn't work on DRM protected content at least not yet and the game HDR doesn't work if you
have dual monitors at least not yet I have a wild theory that Nvidia is basically waiting for Nintendo to launch the switch 2 before they will launch the shield Pro 2 and all of this software development is happening very rapidly right now because they're gearing up for the release of The Shield Pro 2 I mean think about it the original switch and the original Shield Pro actually very similar in terms of hardware and Nvidia has seemingly been due to release a successor to that damn thing for years
and man with some of the recent advancements we've seen RTX HDR super resolution I can see the shield Pro 2 being a killer box not just for watching video right I mean you know obviously this is great for that but think about it for streaming in games man deblocking all those compression artifacts just converting to hdr on the local side so that they don't have to send all that additional information over your internet connection I'm excited and I'm also excited to see more solutions for using
HDR displays with content that doesn't necessarily natively support it even if it's not perfect today and hey back to what we were talking about before if I'm wrong about the shield Pro 2 maybe at long last the home theater PC will be a thing again and you will all Ru the day you mocked me for keeping my Windows Media Center Edition remote Ru it I say just like you'll Ru asking me about our sponsor manscaped if you're feeling a little overgrown trim your Hedges the manly way with manscapes
