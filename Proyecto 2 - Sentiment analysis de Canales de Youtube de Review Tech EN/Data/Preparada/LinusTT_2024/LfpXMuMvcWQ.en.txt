this PC is the same price as a PlayStation 5 and competes or in some cases even wins in just about every game we tested including some Sony first party titles but how is that even possible I mean gaming consoles dominate computers in price to Performance don't they well sometimes it's no secret that Sony and Microsoft are willing to sell their Hardware at a loss in order to lock walk you into their ecosystem of accessories subscription services and software all of which are sold for a profit over time
then this chips away at your initial savings but even with that in mind I totally get why people go for it when this thing launched $500 barely got you a decent GPU let alone a complete gaming box of course there's no denying the power of the Sony exclusive machine no PC could ever hope to compete with that model at least not for the first couple of years but technology marches ever onward and with competition and the used Market heating up again it is finally possible to match the price and performance and
budget of a PlayStation 5 with a gaming PC and ours is going to be powered by SE Sonic who sponsored this video Even though this is a secondhand power supply that'll make sense later first we have to answer some big questions if our goal is to match the PlayStation 5's spec we need a ryzen 7 3700x with eight Zen 2 cores and a 6600 XT rdna2 GPU but guys we don't want to match it look at the title we want to beat it that means making smart choices in the name of real world performance even if they might
come with some compromises like this one we've gone with the AMD ryzen 5 5600x and it's got two fewer cores than the PlayStation 5 however it's Zen 3 architecture makes it the budget King when it comes to gaming right now and it's only 65 Watts meaning that the stock heat sink that's included with it should be fine to keep it cool that right there that's savings and it means we don't need an OP power supply in order to drive this thing boom more savings now it's worth noting that for a
few bucks more you could jump up to a 57 or 5800 X but uh we are on a pretty tight budget making our $500 Target even more challenging is the fact that we wanted this to be a build that you could replicate at home this isn't scrapyard Wars this is a guide so we targeted prices that you will probably be able to find in about a week whether it's on eBay or elsewhere if you're patient and have a little luck on your side there are better deals to be had out there David found this PPP for just over
$70 just remember to follow our guidelines for Marketplace bargain hunting if you want to avoid getting scammed we're going to have that video linked down below the nice thing about going for amd's am4 socket is that there are three whole generations of motherboards that you get to pick from but we noticed a few things you're going to want to watch out for first older generation boards turned out to cost almost the same as the newer ones but had a much higher risk of income
compatibility with newer chips so make sure you double check the manufacturer's website second for the difference in price a series chipsets are a no no you're going to want to go B series in order to retain important features and get what is typically higher build quality even if it costs a few more dollars so b550 and b450 ended up being the sweet spot where we found multiple candidates for around $40 including our ASRock b450m Pro 4 it's got four ddr4 dim slots for our 16 gigs of gskill
trident Z 3600 megat transfer per second ram and it's even got respectable IO including USB type-c now it's not all roses b450 is limited to PCI Express gen 3 rather than Gen 4 that means that our system could struggle to get maximum performance out of future gpus and even today this is a compromise next to one of the ps5s most most advertised features it's rock and fast SSD our 1 tby Samsung 970 Evo plus runs at only about 35ths of the speed of the PlayStation 5's storage but it's a
reputable name brand drive and with most PC games being optimized for SATA ssds or even hard drives there will be next to no impact in our gaming performance at least for now so smart compromise or dumb cut let us know what you think in the comments below speaking of cuts we ended up saving some of our money by using the kind of case that might have some ragged edges on it but can be found for free or for just a few bucks on a local Marketplace uh David this thing is huge
hell yeah definitely Advantage PS5 which with debrand dark plates comfortably fits in an LTD backpack LTT store.com your mileage may vary here we got lucky is um and this was a pretty sick case before the trauma but your goal is to pretty much find someone who's dumping old office PCS or gaming skeletons like this for next to if not zero if you're patient you can often find ones with some cooling fans already installed in them to save a few more bucks the only big thing to watch out for is ATX
compatibility and clearance for any longer components a Dremel can often solve compatibility issues but you might not have one on hand fortunately we won't need any of that for our x650 gold power supply from today's sponsor seic this particular unit came out almost 15 years ago but is still going strong and what's really cool is that even if you are buying secondhand C Sonic stands behind their products hard they actually have a transferable warranty meaning that all you need to do is ask the
seller for the original sales invoice and you're covered for the entire original length not only that but they recently upped their warranty on newer units from 10 years to 12 years absolute Chads now let's talk GPU this one it's going to be a little spicy but hey is the spice of life right we've gone with the Intel Arc a77 I know I know guys but compatibility has improved a lot and it's got 16 gigs of gddr6 memory all to itself instead of having to share with the CPU now people are starting to
catch on to this thing and by the time this video comes out prices may have gone up a bit but we had an opportunity so we seized it also we kind of wanted an excuse to see how far Intel has come for ourselves after a couple years of driver updates it is worth acknowledging at this stage that we could have gone with a 6700 XT or a 3060 TI at this   sorry let's game we're going to assume you have some kind of peripherals to use so we didn't Factor those into our budget but otherwise what you're looking
at is an Apples to Apples comparison between our PS5 and our PS5 killer we hope these uh fans don't work to kick things off we're going to be playing Doom maternal a game that runs at 120 FPS on the PlayStation 5 albeit at a lower resolution scale so we've set our PC to run at 4K but 68% resolution scale and I got to tell you this is not looking good not right dude this is basically unplayable what kind of frame rate are you oh W I'm 120 baby something is wrong ah there's your
problem right there on the p side you might have to do a little bit of configuration with the most important one being enabling above 4G decoding and resizable bar support particularly Intel Arc does not perform its best without rebar enabled oh yeah that is more like it oh yeah 1% lows of0 115 FPS it is amazing what a difference just making sure everything thing is configurated properly can make dude was this really 500 bucks though yeah man Intel Arc not so bad after all huh it's hard
to do an Apples to Apples comparison here because the image quality in the settings menus are not necessarily directly comparable but what David and I can do is we can skip this cut scene and just oh I mean that's interesting my field of view is so much wider than yours I can change that uh o I don't have hdr on though oh let's turn that on okay my screen's not pretty but what about my PlayStation pretty freaking nice do you like my PlayStation I'm the wrong person as I like this case okay hold on we're
going to figure this out one sec I can't think of anything more windows than having HDR issues so a huge advantage of playing on my PlayStation if I plug in an HDR display it's like hey let's calibrate you're done I once had a computer that had such a bad HDR issue that it was easier to reinstall Windows and figure out the issue I'd call you a liar but I believe you 100% what I promise is true the next thing we discovered is that HDR support on Intel Arc is a little bit
spotty it turns out AMD and Nvidia have proprietary implementations for how the game calls for HDR to be enabled and Intel well doesn't support them it uses the standard direct X implementation so there's no denying that HDR is going to look better than SDR in any game that supports it that really pops however now that we've got rebar enabled performance is looking pretty darn good and I'd say who's got the edge when it comes to image quality it's pretty close it's really close look at this cluster of
rocks the geometry and the detail and the texture is looking I think the textures are a little bit better on this but the geometry detail is about the same okay how's it feel though here we go the fact that I'm using an HDR display right now and not getting an HDR image is a bit of a downer but most people do not have HDR displays I'm getting anywhere from 115 to 120 FPS I don't have frame view open I should open that I had frame view open one of the previous times before we were diagnosing
the HDR thing and I'm getting 1% lows in the neighborhood of around 110 115 FPS it's really respectable here's something you've definitely got the edge in loading times yeah but with that said this is a lot of PC for the money it's pretty impressive I would not be surprised if we managed to put together something like this as a one-off you know we negotiated everyone into the ground but the fact that we were able to find with pretty good consistency Parts like this available for this price it's
PC gaming back oh 100% is the render scale at 100% yep so this is actually better image quality than a PS5 cuz the PS5 will be 1800p upscale to 4K mhm and we're hitting 60 is I mean pretty respectable once again I couldn't help noticing this game looks a lot better in HDR though yeah those colors look a lot more vibrant this is freaking smooth one of the big things that Intel has struggled with with Arc is while their average frame rate might be good the 1% lows are 1% very low here I'm not getting that
kind of stutter this is a very very smooth experience and what does that game run at in performance mode 60 60 yeah okay it's not a perfect 60 it'll drop from that frame rate once in a while but it's a little more steady than this PC one but with vrr I think I would choose that extra sharpness I was kind of surprised every time I tried upscaling it lowered the performance so uh let's go qu that's 1440p I think yeah my 1% lows are still the same given that I probably wouldn't bother
but this is my first experience with Intel xcss in quite a long time and it looks really good yeah does it look better than FSR hard to say I'd have to look at up side by side but it's I don't see anything obvious that's jumping off the screen at me like oh yeah they're upscaling looks looks ugly even distant text super sharp come on PC let's go oh oh my gosh your your video did load  oh see who makes it in game first what oh probably who ever developed the bo oh wow okay that's not fair that's not
fair though that's true oh wow what happened device driver h a driver D I literally installed it today oh all right 20 frames per second that's lower than it was before I also set it to 4K native oh yeah don't do that okay but HDR is working in this game hey there we go I hope this is a 30fps game on PlayStation oh no okay why is it crashing so much no it's got this it's got this I believe I believe it has the power of PC the power of PC compels you nice game for God of War it runs at
1440p on the PS5 so we're doing some upscaling here but what we can't figure out is what the heck is going on with HDR it's not in display it's not in graphics oh wait screen calibration really you guys I think this might be the first game that does look good new game yeah I read that the hdr on the PC version of God of War supposed to look a little better in spite of this being a generation older TV than this one it does I think it does actually look a little better how's the details and everything
it's pretty similar I think it's a little less on PC oh this upscaling looks a little better in the fine hairs of kratos's beard yep it's a little softer there I got to be looking for it though at TV distance I wouldn't notice they looks so similar other than that this one's a little more pop uh what's your FPS 60 me too let's go okay go yeah and go yeah this is so satisfying and go yeah get it Gros and go crap no I messed up the last most important one we're going to have links by the way
to everything that we use down below and on that note if you're buying on eBay congratulations you've got great buyer protection so make sure that you use it by testing everything that you buy before the return window is up run some stress tests you know mem test for Ram and CPU memory controller Prime 95 for CPU compute firmar for your GPU and for extra credit push all the components at once which will help stress test your power supply on a related note by the way marketplaces can have better pricing
because they don't charge the same seller fees but they don't have any buyer protection and unless people happen to be Bros you are not get getting your money back for faulty Hardware that means that you always want to test the parts before buying them and if the seller is being weird about showing you the parts working skip them just save yourself that die roll there's plenty of fish in the sea also always visually inspect the commonly damaged areas like the pins on a CPU or on a
motherboard there's no denying the results though David this is a little less sharp but I also think I have a little bit more Headroom it's hard to compare cuz this one's locked at 60 uh I'd be curious to see if we unlocked it what kind of numbers we would hit but that's console baby you get what you get this actually seems like a good time to bring up that uh we uh casually didn't include a controller whereas for that $500 price point or even lower if you don't bother with the
disc version of the PlayStation 5 you get one of the best controllers on the market arguably one of the best controllers like ever am I going to get another one that has HDR working looks like it you know what that's smoother though that's I was about to say yeah I'm pretty sure you're in 30fps mode here cuz that looks a little that looks a little sharper though yeah I can really see it in the Stray hairs here oh yeah to be clear this is very playable this is not bad but this is definitely a little sharper
let me see what I can do to fix that up a bit over here in terms of settings I'm running pretty much at Ultra but what I haven't maxed out is my render scale so I'm going to try rendering at 80% rather than 70% of 4K The Last of Us is the kind of game that 30 FPS is pretty acceptable to me are there any crucifixes nearby cuz uh I think we're going to need one it's a cinematic game as long as I'm over 24 I'm fine look ocara time 20 frames a second greatest game of all time what can I say
you've got the edge frage quality I think these fine stray hairs are not quite looking as good I also so wonder your set on ultra settings if maybe there's like some Shadow things we could bring down in like some kind of optimization that would help boost you back over the edge after some more playing around we ended up needing 70% render scale in order to get 30 FPS consistently and Last of Us Part One should be noted we could absolutely hit higher frame rates if we were willing to
compromise on visual Fidelity but that wasn't the point of this exercise the point of this exercise was to get a an as good or in some cases maybe even better experience with the same budget and what did we spend overall we spent $475 we got $25 of wiggle room right but we also conjured peripherals we didn't pay for a controller and realistically we don't have a warranty on pretty much any of our parts we also had to put in the time to Source all this stuff and put it together including the risk of
running into broken Hardware incompatibilities we had some games that because of our choice voice of an Intel Arc GPU didn't run as well whether that's crashing or limited support for HDR so full credit to Sony and Microsoft for that matter this generation of consoles I would say has retained its better value than a PC status for far longer than I anticipated and it may be another year even two years before we can beat them with a brand new machine but I also think that credit to David by
