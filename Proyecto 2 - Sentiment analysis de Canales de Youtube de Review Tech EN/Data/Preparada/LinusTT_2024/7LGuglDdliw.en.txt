W show hello uh bit of a downer week this week uh Gordon ma uh legendary PC Hardware journalist has uh excuse me Gordon ma um has has passed away at 58 um so we'll be talking a little bit about that his family's got to gofund me because you know um late stage Healthcare in America um can be real challenging yeah um so that's a that's a real Downer uh we'll also be talking about the honey controversy that broke this week uh turns out honey has been doing some stuff that is not sweet uh what else we
got this week we talk about lonus on Colin and Samir and we're going to talk about a favorite moment moments of 2024 oh well well that sounds at least good yeah  oh the show is brought to you by jump Cloud MSI and uh oh sorry I got totally uh Bamboozled by myself boot. Dev boot dodev right and of course uh it's brought to you by our chair partner secret lab our skin partner dbrand and our laptop partner LG uh so why don't we jump right into Mr Mr Gordon um unfortunately I suck at professional
networking and while I did have the privilege of meeting Gordon on a number of occasions we weren't particularly close but it's a funny thing because you know just like anyone else that I kind of cut my teeth go away phone it's buzzing in the mic uh anyone else that I kind of cut my tech teeth reading you know the Ryan shouts and the Anan L shies of the world um you know Gordon means more to me than I probably did to him right um yeah you know like we did a video a little while ago building a
Maximum PC dream PC from when I was in high school like that that was Gordon's Jam read those yeah um yeah so I'm going to I'm going to read the thing that our team prepared just cuz that makes it a little bit easier um Gordon ma executive editor of PC World passed away at 58 which um sorry I'm already going off script seriously 58 like 58 is the new 48 honestly and it seems way too uh way too soon um after a battle with pancreatic cancer um insert obligatory cancer I don't care how early
it is in the video apparently beeping too early in the video is bad for the algorithm but I think we can make an exception here yeah um a pioneering figure in Tech journalism Gordon had over 25 years of experience particularly in covering computer hardware and chips he was known for his investigative rigor sharp wit and strong personality which resonated with both his colleagues and the Tech Community uh Gordon's career began in journalism as a police reporter for the Contra Costa Times in 1997 he
would join Computer World and later Maximum PC where he became famous for his passionate often humorous commentary and deep technical expertise he was the driving force behind maximum PC's dream machine project and its consumer advocacy colum Watchdog later Gordon joined PC World where he continued his in-depth coverage of PC Hardware he began his for into video with hardcore Hardware series and the full nerd podcast uh he was actually shockingly good on camera for one of the traditional like written
people like he I was not a given I can't no oh it was not a given like multi-talented guy it's very few people that made that switch but he seemed as natural on camera as he was on a written page which is pretty incredible um Parky in the chat says never heard of him I guess I'm too Zoomer I promise you that you've read something Gordon wrote or read influenced by yep Gordon I I I promise you and the reason for that is that um so much so many of the formats so many of the um of of of the styles that
were started while he was there have become just common place it's kind of like saying um yeah I've never um oh man I'm trying to think of like a of like a a a really like a trend setting movie or show or something like that it's okay it's like saying yeah I've never seen a bit from I Love Lucy it's like you have you just don't know it because all the characters recast and the script was retooled slightly um but like Lucille Ball was a was a trend Setter yeah um anyway Gordon's work in Legacy in the
tech journalism space marked by both his Technical knowhow and Larger than Life Persona earned him widespread respect and admiration can confirm Gordon was committed until the very end publishing video Hardware reviews as recently as November 6th during the end of his treatment wow I give you my personal line of Sebastian promise that I will not be working up until a couple of months before my passing if I find out that I have a serious illness I will peace so fast that you guys won't even remember I was
ever here um that is an unbelievable level of commitment and uh and actually super admirable because you have to you have to know that anyone who you know stays at it is fighting hard oh yeah you know having that uh having that confidence that things are going to be normal someday um and just pushing for his family I'm sure yeah if you'd like to hear more about about Gordon um there's Pages there's a page full of heartfelt tributes on PC World as well as lovely videos from tech
tech potato AKA uh Dr Ian cutris who is one of the one of the folks that I grew up reading a lot as well U as well as Gamers  um there's a whole bunch of discussion topics here but I think that um the best thing to do right now uh Dan can you go ahead and get the GoFundMe linked in the uh in the chat uh let's just hurry up I'm just I'm just looking at this for the first time this is actually incredible uh massive shout out to the community for stepping up here um why don't we just finish it off but there's
no reason that you can't exceed a goal so um Dan can I just give you the company card and can you do that off camera absolutely okay thank you uh it's the one that I am kind of pulling out here uh no that's this one uh um I don't know you'll find it thanks Dan um whoa AC3 Productions says Falcon Northwest uh donated "25,000 massive shout out Kell what an" ABS what an absolute Chad um kelt's super cool he's the kind of person who as far as I can tell doesn't really need to um doesn't really need to
like oh sorry oh yeah yeah go ahead and use that one that's fine thanks Dan um Kel's the kind of person that as far as I can tell doesn't really need to like build gaming systems anymore if he doesn't really feel like it um I wish I'd gotten to I wish I'd gotten to know Gordon better I I am like I said I'm terrible at networking and I have a tendency to just go to trade shows and stuff and just go completely head down in my work and it's stuff like this that um makes me kind of regret that um
yeah did you get a chance to meet him at least I met him twice yeah okay uh just just finish it off they have a goal um let's just make sure they hit  um  yeah all right well on that note uh why don't we why don't we move on to sort of the other uh the other heavy topic for this week which is of course um honey so first of all uh big shout out to Mega leg for um for the work that was done reporting on uh what honey and actually well parent company PayPal has  to this is is truly a very professional
podcast video podcast whatever this thing is thank you for that Luke yeah  relief your job is to laugh at the comic relief you're the laugh alarms I think that's my only standard alarm for this week that I didn't pause for the week cuz I was out that's my like leave for wano alarm and then wano was early cuz I have a flight to catch brilliant um yeah so massive shout out to to meal leg for the work that um that he put into digging into what exactly Honey's been doing um so I've got I've got a few
things to kind of discuss first of all the only point from meal legs video that we were aware of three years ago when we halted our honey sponsorship was the affiliate code ripping uh we heard about that from some tweets uh like this one  Barnacles um we also saw it covered um on our own Forum here we go so there was that was not that was not really um news that part of it um but you know obviously as a as as creators we saw that and we were like hey um that's not really cool yeah
uh but we didn't really we didn't really think that other than you know any creator friends um that it was something that impacted the general consumer so it wasn't something that really merited a  um okay thanks Dan uh were you were you live for that they heard you or no oh okay Dan said he's done and the goal is done but guys please um I'm sure that the goal is really helpful uh but I'm sure that any little bits um could any little bits could could help um yeah I don't think uh
GoFundMe looks like it's real time so I'll have to wait a sec for that to come through but okay thanks Dan okay anyway affiliate code ripping bad affects creators doesn't affect the end user uh we we were not the only ones who knew about the scam though here's a video from 2020 I actually didn't watch this one but I don't know I the whole thing for me with this is that Mega leg did reach out to us for comment and my general position on it was uh yeah we we dropped these guys three years ago um this all
came out like the the affiliate ripping stuff everything we knew about came out years ago um very interested to see the video on all the other stuff I don't really know what exactly it has to do with us I am a little confused at still as to what exactly um it has to do with us um anyway back when we dropped honey we had a call with their executive team it was clear that they had no intention in uh intention to revise their business model away from the affiliate code ripping uh so we decided to end our
sponsorship agreement with them um if we'd known about any of the more end user Centric issues discussed in Mega legs video such as purposely not giving users the best deal possible because of behind the scenes Partnerships with companies we very probably would have raised more alarm Bells but we had no reason at that time to believe that honey was anything other than what it claimed to be which was a coupon finding service that took an affiliate cut um many in the industry stopped working
with honey without an LTT video being made so I think that one characterization of this whole situation that we were the only ones that knew we knew and didn't tell anybody is um bizarre we were publicly informed by other people and then acted on it also we publicly posted on our Forum that we dropped them and gave the reason for it we've also never really been like people have tried to draw parallels between this and yui but yui's a tech company that had huge end user problems
yes like this this is that's a totally that's something that we do that is something that we have done always and yui had major implications like immediately right now for user privacy yeah um whereas honey uh it's it's in in some ways it's like more Insidious uh but in other ways it's um it's less immediately damaging than like hey an unencrypted feed of like every camera that our company has old like that's there's there's bad and then there's like really really really really really
bad and also in our realm um as for karma why we took a sponsorship from Karma they assured us that they didn't do any link yoinking which when we tested it seemed to be true uh we only worked with them once we did four sponsor spots on three videos and then I guess didn't work with them anymore um as for the landing page that uses our likeness toote OTE honey we no longer have any direct contacts that are working there but we're working to have the page removed hopefully we can uh
speaking of yui ankor still uses our likeness um and with these really large and in some cases overseas companies it can be very difficult to get stuff like that fixed um Ikes orange says lonus people think that because the video sort of implies that only you knew so people are misinterpreting that I mean I I think I don't think it sort of implies I think our prominent featuring in the video uh leads people there I I don't really understand that I don't really uh I don't really I don't really get the 
um I I don't really I don't really know what people are expecting me to say about it other than yeah we we like heard about it in the news same as apparently basically everyone else given how many folks stopped working with them in the 2020 2021 time frame and um yeah yeah cool um SE Surfer says it's also arguable that LTT was by far the largest channel and thus had the platform to motivate wider change it's arguable it's very difficult to argue I mean given that Mr Beast was the number one honey
promoter I think that if you were to make the argument that LT is bigger than Mr Beast then um Not only would that be a difficult argument you'd be kind of a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] idiot so like I I don't know dude  cool yeah should we move on like I don't really I don't I don't have a ton else to say on this I think like I yeah honestly when I was when I was I watched the video and I remembered us dropping honey but didn't particularly remember the reasons after some people brought up the the old
video that you had mentioned and a couple other things I like vaguely remembered that U but I wasn't really a part of video stuff at that time so like I don't know this I The Situation's bizarre dude like I am a victim here I was surprised by I don't know if people noticed that yeah like as a creator for whom uh affiliate revenue from Amazon was uh in 2020 7% of our business team's Revenue um like this had a significant impact on our business and absolutely it would have impacted other creators too and
they are victims in this but it doesn't change that anyone who affiliate who relied on affiliate revenue and and who had it skimmed by Honey was victimized by honey we were compensated at least partially by a lot of the yeah a lot of the people that were sponsored by them were which was like the internet at that  like guys and then the Carmen now thing looked bad working with them one time that that's that's something that stood out to me quite a bit during the video was that it was assessed in its currenc
State because you you obviously can't go back and assess it from the past um but that gets tough because you don't know like what you guys were saying they they assured that it didn't work that way you tested it okay cool they can change it on you they could have changed it on you immediately after the sponsor spots went up well yeah I don't know I don't know we don't know when it happened I don't know that was it was all could have happened years later like who knows
um yeah um Voit says for me it felt like honey was quietly dropped as a sponsor with no messy breakup could have been any reason um but as you said back then you only knew about the affiliate ripping which isn't too bad especially for users yeah exactly it's really bad for creators yeah it's really bad for creators but it was also being blasted from the rooftops at that point in time yeah like I don't know maybe Mega leg is living up to his name it's like at that point in time
it's also like not really our story to break like if other people are already reporting on it and it's getting around a lot um yeah I think it's blowing up so much right now because of the um the downsides for users yeah I I could see that yep um not sure yeah so cool moving on yeah positive things yeah yeah can we do that you want to talk about the Colin and Samir um no maybe 2024 why don't we talk about RTX 5090 oh because we don't know the price yet so we can still kind of have fun and
we could pretend that like anyone will be able to afford an RTX 590 do do you guys want to play pretend for a little bit sure okay I would I would like that though uh cool I still have both kidneys so I'm good nice nice not for long Dan yay new images have leaked of a populated RTX 5090 PCB and it looks full oh my goodness wow that is dense with two s's that is wild so there's your allegedly alleged 32 gigs of gddr 7 Rams there is all the vrms and then there is all the rest of
them look at this thing do you have a comparison to the 490 do you have both up uh I I don't I don't have the 49 link to it in the do oh is there a link in the dark oh incredible okay and the 490 was already a dense M Jama cuz remember the whole like through PCB cooling thing um wow so that's what that's a 4090 uh credit to wccf Tech for uh posting that I don't know if they're actually the original poster of it oh here's the blank one I don't know what it is but there is something about a blank
unpopulated PCB with just all the pads that just is like yeah right like damn like damn like damn damn you know like damn uh Dam we're losing it today yeah so I slept about 3 hours last night just so you have some idea like I'm dude I'm I'm barely I'm barely functional today so the the the room of the 590 is that it has 21760 Cuda cores compared to the 490s "16,384 pretty big jump the memory goes" up to 32 gigs uh which you would have needed like you know beyond 490 in the past to
have which almost certainly means it has a 512-bit memory bus which is that combined with going to dddr 7 it's like what 16 modules of memory um power stages 29 versus 490s 23 PCB 14 layers compared to the 490s 12 and the MSRP probably too much for all of us I don't know dude I don't know look at this look at this $15.99 us I see only three question marks that to me indicates indicates and they might have typoed we definitely yeah they might have forgotten a decimal so we could be
looking at a single dollar we could be looking at one $1 wow as low as $1 Luke very nice um as low as $10 I I think it could happen I think it could happen discussion question is what is your max limit on price assuming performance is good compared to last gen okay so here's the thing I think I've talked about this a fair bit but it Bears repeating because Nvidia Waits 2 to three years between releasing gpus now so uh some of you probably don't remember or weren't around for this but
when I saw the pricing of the 40 series yeah I made a solemn oath I swore that I would not upgrade to it I have kept that promise yeah my VR machine is still running a launch 380 okay okay my uh personal rig is still running the 7900 XTX from the Radeon Challenge and my like Land Machine in the landan room is still running a um uh it's a it's a 3080 yeah it's a it's an EVGA 380 so is there a price point for this hold no no I'm not done yet I'm not done yet I have an egpu for my uh Rog flow x13
"3080 my entire life 3,000 series enjoyer" "is 3,000 series and below for NVIDIA" yeah and then on the oh yeah technically I have one more machine I have a little remember those little ack like mini desktops I think so yeah with used an mxm module yes okay so I have one of those in my family room upstairs for just like playing casual games on the TV up up there sure 1080 still still going strong 1080 gang represent um so I have no 40 series in my life so with that said I'm coming at
this from an alternate angle I have a different perspective on the 50 Series because I've seen a lot of people like flip the math out going well this isn't worth it as an upgrade they're asking way too much money but my upgrade is from a 3080 class card or a 7900 which is which is not on par with the the 490 it's more on par with like a 3090 TI yeah right if we're being honest if we're being honest especially if you want to look at R Trace games then it can even fall down below that and R
tracing is now mandatory in some titles yes no that's that that's true Tomb Raider or not Tomb Raider uh well guy Tomb Raider yeah Nostalgia Tomb Raider there we go yeah um donates to a museum Tomb Raider great looking game by the way you have you played great circle yet oh okay oh my it's so beautiful nice it looks incredible worth the requirement uh well that uh more complicated discussion no more spicy takes more complicated discussion yeah um so my upgrade is much greater and my amenability to spending
way too much money is much higher because I got three good years skipped a Jen out of my 3080 okay so is there  limit I'm afraid to say anything because I really want one and if I say something you want a 4090 480 if I say guys if it's over this price then I'm going to skip this "generation i' still be on 3,000 then I'm" "going to be stuck on 3,000 for another" like three more years five total years yeah yeah and then six and then 6090 nice is going to arrive and it's going to be it's going to be like
"$4,000 and I'm going to be like and if" "it's over $3,800 I'm not buying and I'm"  forever oh man maybe maybe at that point in video or Intel will be so good that you'll be fine that's a lot of years from now "6,000" series massive respect to what Intel has done with Arc battle mage got a lot of work massive massive respect and and and they're catching up to Nvidia in the ways that I think matter more for the future that makes sense so there they're they're still when we look at die siiz to die siiz
comparisons they're behind on raster when we look at performance per watt dude they're behind but when we look at what Intel is doing on the software side their driver team is doing the work on the tech side their AI performance even though the support for it is not great yet good yeah their R tracing performance good yeah they're very forward thinking which is good yes so so all that's great but let's face it they are not going to have a 59d competitor they may not have a 69d competitor they
just got to release an an SLI competitor enough and then just put like four of them in although let them virtualize them we do need a reason for pcie Gen 6 like let's do it um okay no no no no no no no no no no but I I think for I think at at mainstream price points I I I I hope Intel is going to just crush it just give us a give us we'll see how rough 50 60 coming out is okay whenever that happens I the the price I've seen  US yeah that's the price that I've seen rumored but that goes back far like I
haven't seen I I intentionally don't really follow the rumors that closely in the leadup to a product launch because realistically I'm going to get briefed on it anyway and that will be the real information anyway right now isn't that "like 2,800 CAD yeah more it's it's" probably more like $ 2900 Canadian dollars yeah 2000 USD Cad and I think what oh yeah 2884 what's median what's "median income these days like 38,000 or" something like that median income Canadian oh my actually oh wait is this
household median income hold on median income was "41,700 in" 2022 um yeah so  wildwood.com by the time you actually like get taxed on that and stuff yeah the tariffs guys the tariffs wouldn't be from China they'd be from Taiwan um which ones people are like oh you have to factor in tariffs now uh no you we could end up I I I I doubt it um but that would only be for the states anyway for Canada I I doubt that we would be paying any kind of import tariffs on Chinese exported gpus they're going to
start smuggling gpus over the board yeah the gpus themselves are made in Taiwan but a lot of the card assembly is done in China so the finished GPU would probably be subject to any Chinese tariffs but but that's all speculative until after January sometime so for the sake of  USD that's too much I'm going to do it what if it's 2200 stop what you I'm not going to let you pin me down on this I'm not g no I'm not going to commit to anything I'm not going to commit to anything I just is
there you don't have to vocalize it is there a limit you don't have to tell anyone just in case you want to get out of it or whatever is there a point where you would be like is there a soft limit right now I don't want to open my wallet because you're going to like for for a context he's not going to buy one no no I will I'll buy one okay look if I'm G to say I accept this madness I can't just I can't just use my influencer clout to be like to summon one I don't I don't think
that's right because I took a principled stand on 40 series I was like this is too expensive I won't even use it if I'm going to break that I think I have to "pay for it going from 1,600 to two grand" in one generation doesn't deserve a principled stand Luke What GPU do you run I don't want to talk about it uhhuh what is it I know what it is it's it's pretty good yeah what is it it's pretty good well if you want to see it you should check out the uh the line of actives video uh on Bulbasaur see I have
no problem I have no problem I have no problem gifting you know a 40 series to someone that that's that's no I I didn't need to get involved in this I just wouldn't yeah I just wouldn't buy one I just I I wouldn't I wouldn't buy a 40 series and so because I didn't want to hack and just request one then I was like use them yeah he he actually didn't reest I mean he did hint to someone Oh I thought you were bringing up the video he did I was it was I just didn't know you were doing that let me bring it back
he did hint to someone that he kind of wanted an upgrade or something I think or maybe no maybe Jake's idea I think it was Jake's idea um anyway let me make let me make at risk of being called an advocate for the Devil Himself let me make an argument for my "$2,000 " GPU okay okay okay I'm hold on I'm going to find something um cuz to be fair that's like really close to the current cost of my current car yeah oh yeah I used to talk about like you know the first car that I bought as a as a scale for computer
parts uh now it has to be the one that I   crazy you can you can buy something that literally gets you from A to B instead of something that like digitally gets you from A to B when I was growing up a computer setup at Future Shop okay okay hold on so you know where I'm going with this but hold on a computer setup from Future Shop would have probably cost you somewhere in the neighborhood of 2500 to "$4,400 okay right that was in like 1998" dollar um and they could have easily
gone more like easily you could spend five grand on on a computer on a on a personal computer as they called them back then I would make the argument that like TVs PCS in spite of some of the utter craziness of the last few years have actually beaten inflation you can still get for like "$4,000 a computer tower and the fact" that it can contain something as powerful as a 4090 actually kind of impressive kind of cool it is not that wild to spend three four five grand on a PC once every you
know five to six years and it's pretty wild and well but it's not it's not it's also not wild like it's it's a thing that when I grew up was normal every family when Tech scales you don't have to keep spending the same amount no you don't but you also can and you can get you can get a PC that is vastly more powerful than that 1998 machine for 500 bucks yeah so you absolutely don't have to but but I also thinkone I also think that for something that is that is a purchase that you will use for an
extended period of time and that you will get much much much much much use out of it is not entirely unreasonable I don't know if you're going to get that much use out of it yeah that's fair I don't I don't really get to gain that much does I feel like it's like however on your ally however which of us is further into our playthrough of the pixel remaster of Final Fantasy 6 you or me wait are you playing it it's on sale I picked it up oh no he's going to beat me I said I was going to play it this
week that I had actually a very busy week and had no time speaking of my Ally oh boy where are you at well let's just see why don't we just see if you recognize where I am because part of the problem is that he he quote unquote doesn't have any time to play games but then you'll see him jump on a game on Steam at like midnight and it's like oh I wonder what he's doing but then you know it's not on his computer that he would have spent all these thousands of dollars on I could stream
it wrecked on the Ally yeah of course is there a camera on the what no no no not that kind of streaming so you're just going to like oh why would you stream the pixel "remaster so I could get like 9,000 FPS" who cares don't worry about it okay so here here's what we're going to do here's what we're going to we're going to play a little game called do I know where you are do you recognize where I am no all right so you've had it for like a couple  QED all right well you're going on a
trip are you going to play it on your trip yep darn it well where are you at are you still at the uh Imperial magitech facility no I'm past that you past that yeah oh okay are you at the sealed gate  banquet no I don't think so you're probably somewhere somewhere in that neighborhood yeah okay well I'm not going to spoil anything not going to spoil anything um I will say though that if I feel like treating myself to a nice gaming PC I think that uh unlike some people I can
complete a game in a year so I should be entitled to do that uh I wanted to do it this holiday season I was so ready for you to tell me I don't game I was so ready dude yeah I I my my brother spun up a family holiday valheim server so we've been play together my brother my dad sometimes Emma so that took the time that I thought I was going to spend playing Final Fantasy 6 that's pretty cool though that seemed fair I respect it I respect I'm still going to try it now that I know you're on the on the
track I'm still going to try to get it out all right get it finished pretty quick all right let's go let's go I've I've spent a lot of time like dinking around doing stuff I totally don't need to do I will say this though the pixel remaster is easy oh oh dude okay that makes sense it is so easy because I've I've heard you talk and I've heard a lot of other people talk about like needing to grind a bunch and stuff and and certain fights that you're like oh this is really hard and then I went and did
it I was like I don't think I did anything special dude was hard it's like a joke okay so they difficulty tuned it laughably easy well it's not just like it's not just difficulty tuned it's like um certain things were broken in the original game the evade stat literally didn't work okay um so you like always got hit but would miss a lot and it was real real frustrate um also the ability to to just turn off Random Encounters while you find your way through something like I I to this day didn't
realize how small some of the dungeons were because when you're getting into F so much random encounter every three steps they feel huge they feel enormous like you could never navigate them that almost feels like some of the difficulties sometimes is the like time between potential rest areas so being able to turn that off oh dude and the the way the saving works it has like quick save yeah oh dude the game didn't have quick save you went back to the last like Star  will there be one more random encounter
before I get there like it was a huge deal and like dude the map definit using the map marks The chocoo Stables yeah those weren't on the map well aren't they in the player guy oh okay I don't think so hold on hold on Final Fantasy 3 included map North America I don't think so though like you definitely would have been able to get um here here's one You definitely would have been able to get like a like a a strategy guide or whatever back in the day yeah um but no yeah so like so
traversing ground was like tough yeah if you didn't like have a friend who knew where they were or whatever right like it was I didn't turn off Random Encounters I've never bought a chocoo oh you don't you don't have to buy them or rented or whatever oh oh okay okay um you definitely oh being oh dude being able to walk diagonally I do I do that huge yeah huge cuz that's literally one a half one step for two yeah um oh what's uh what's another big one oh yeah the fact that
you have Sprint shoes always equipped you had to use a relic slot to be able to walk fast oh and you couldn't walk fast outside of towns oh yeah so like hiking was tedious like there there's a lot that they've done to make oh the explanations for like what equipment does and what espers do and stuff has been I find some of that to still be weird has been upgraded but the interface for equipping espers is actually worse I did it once and couldn't find it again the next time I
went to play the OG interface is so much better um actually for espers and seeing seeing all the Spells they teach and also the um the level up stat boosts that they give you now part of why it's comically easy for me is that I'm obsessively going in after every random encounter and like fine-tuning which espers are on my guys so that I make sure that I get the best like level up stats oh I'm definitely not doing that yeah don't do that don't do that cuz it it makes the game like comically easy it
also doesn't feel necessary to be honest anyway back to I've never lost really yeah oh I've still I've still managed to lose some but it might just be because I'm like Clowning Around maybe um you'll you'll lose some stuff I'm sure I've gotten very close a few times there was one of the like I think it was more of a mini boss than an actual boss but I don't know if my scaling was weird for that fight or something but I found it very hard I went down to one person at one point but was able to bring people
back up are you um are you are you leveling up all of your characters or do you just have like one main party of four that you just are going with uh there's a couple people that I really try to always have there but other than that I'm mostly trying to cycle a little bit oh another big one is sabin's blitzes like you had to enter them without any indicator so you just like wouldn't find out until he went to execute the action and' be like yeah you input it wrong yeah and so he does this thing he'd go
forward and his eyes would flash like he's about to do it and it would just say incorrect Blitz input and he'd go back also uh Cayenne um you know how you just like pick whatever sword technique you want to use yes he had a timer so you had to wait and if you played like me with active turn battle so like everything's happening in real time while you're sitting in the menus if you're waiting for like quadr slam for his Force that's you're like waiting and getting like
creamed yeah um so there were there were some big big difficulty differences yeah like sabin's in my party all the time yeah I think he's my my like main I guess but most other people swap out a little bit he was he was less reliable in the original version unless you were like really good at the inputs I think I've only ever missed one cuz it it displays it easy you can't screw it up I was like oh yeah I only missed one because I just like fat fingered a button or something I was like oh crap
it was yeah yeah that's about it and sometimes you can get unlucky like when the parties split up and you recruit Shadow yeah you you know about that uh there's a there's a random there's an r and he can leave after the first I had him leave after the first fight once yeah he's stuck with me for quite a while and I was like okay that's cool pretty neat good game well designed it'd be nice if be yeah if that started after like at least a few fights or something yep um also
because I've played the game before I know when to like unequip guys cuz they're going to like leave so that I I've gotten wrecked by that a couple times where like a lot of really good things go into one person and they piece for like a while it's like okay yeah pry now when they come back those things aren't very good anymore and the sell rates is pretty rough I don't actually know what it is but it's pretty rough so 5090 right I'm going to buy one to play Final Fantasy 6 on your ally to play
whatever to play to play whatever I want to play to play ano released 5 years ago on your PC dude I just got a a 4K 240 HZ  in it supports DP 1 uh 2.1  anything I'm not talking about anything but if you did get something in the future then there'd be a video about it for sure and you'd want to make sure that you had something powerful to run it I guess yes just in case cuz that those potential resolution and frame rates that would be really tough just yeah yeah you didn't say who it's from
yeah that's true actually yeah yeah that helps quite a bit uh cool and anyway um apparently it's got a single 12vt 2x6 power connector which replaces 12vt high power ah um shorter sensor pins longer conductor terminals okay or hear me out Nvidia PCI E8 pin just put a bunch of them on like we used to you know what forget it actually a bad idea all right what are we supposed to be talking about uh explain merch messages uh yes a few of you have found them already I assume Dan how's the
merch messages going over there they're pretty good I'm up just fine really okay well we haven't really talked for anyone who doesn't know about it yet about the deal we have running on the all new commuter backpack it's here let's go you've looked at it already right I have one oh you have one how do you like it it's very nice I immediately I I traditionally walked around with the power connector and laptop just like loose around work and now it's my like my work backpack
which is nice let's go this is it folks the commuter bag it is selling like billio um people are absolutely loving this thing I've got a fully loaded one here we're going to switch to the Linus oh okay we're maybe going to have to adjust this at some point because I oh just hit my mic yeah holding it on this side with the mic is very challenging anyway it's got two water bottle holders they are the same size both of them um no it's okay we have two water bottle holders so you can use one for your
umbrella one for your water bottle whatever you like we've got our pouch of holding oh my goodness I'm dying um are you sure you don't want me to hold it yeah I'd be fine but I got some tennis elbow so my arm is in a lot of pain okay yeah yeah if you just want to finish on doing the zipper that'd be great there we go so it comes all the way down put your mouse in there put your text sack in there put your notepad in there your SSD in there your pen your screwdriver of course with our classic
zippered screwdriver pocket in case you drop a bit or something like that in the bottom we want to make sure you guys are able to get that out we've got a sunglass holder in the top sunglass poach right in there get your get your sunglasses in there and then of course it's Tech forward Zips all the way down so you can reach all your good stuff with two spots for battery Banks or even gigantic power bricks and cables and then a tablet slot as well as a laptop slot and another zipper pouch there
and the best part and the part that has got people losing their minds is I saw a lot of pricing speculation with people saying like yeah two 150 150 that' be like that'd be like sick 150 would be great but I'm afraid to hope for it cuz it's all the same quality materials as the original bag YKK zippers reprieve fabric made of recycled water bottles  stuff but we did it 150 and for a limited time only and I really do mean limited time only it is $30 off it is 120 if you buy it through YouTube shopping
oh I just want to give you guys a little update here um hold on I'm just going to refresh the thing so I already told people on the WAN show before someone says I missed the YouTube deal sad no you didn't the YouTube deal is active it's active now um I told you guys before it's limited "to 1,700" units so far and Luke can verify this cuz apparently I'm a I'm a big liar in a scumbag if you believe all of the recent "scandals or whatever um we are at 12," yeah 635 units so we still have what does
that work out to 4400 units at the discounted price it is possible possible it is possible that they will not make it through the weekend so if you guys want to pick one up the discount is through YouTube shopping what those numbers make no "sense oh 17 177,000 we have 17,000 say" 1700 my bad uh well I mean I'm a big liar so probably that's probably it um so we have we have 4400 more discounts you buy it through YouTube shopping which Dan is it set up on W show today should be pinned um I've seen some stuff
that you might have to disable ad blocker for it to show up if you are using one that makes sense thatn yeah as well so you have to you have to click on the little product okay so I'll go to my laptop you have to click on this thing uh and then when it goes to the store it's not going to show the discount immediately so you have to add it to your cart it shows the full price you have to add it to because it's YouTube's discount whatever so you have to add it to your cart and then in your cart you
see it boom someone says WTF not on float plane that's because the money the $30 YouTube is not from us yeah so when your payment goes through YouTube kicks in $30 we are getting $150 but to promote YouTube shopping Google is is sort of co- launching this product with us an extremely extremely generous offer um we would be charging $49.99 and we're going to keep selling this backpack for years at $149.99 um and based on the reactions that people had to the original price when we announced it um that that's
going to do great and it's going to go Gang Busters for us for everyone who doesn't see this message right now but Google is pitching in $30 so you could see that oh I will not talk in any more detail about anything uh cool anyway buy it through YouTube chopping $19.99 oh see you later I don't know I got like four messages from he just says stop talking so I'm good it's it's  120. got him Li say liar again yeah confirmed confirmed unethical why are you hiding the rest of
the zeros from us free the floats any anyway the point is we love YouTube  and we love our Google overlords I don't think they love us right now I don't know maybe they won't notice okay well that's a merch message would you like me to read you one before you do the announc oh yeah we should explain merch messages so uh while you're checking out on the store you can leave a merch message if you just put something in your cart you'll get a little box hey there you go and you can
send a merch message producer Dan who looks like this and is in the dark today um okay we couldn't afford power over Christmas Christmas was uh we had too many Christmas lights running we couldn't afford any lights for Dan um the lake dried up anyway it'll go to producer Dan who will pop your message up here or give you a response or curate it for me and Luke to respond to on the show Dan do you want to show us how it works sure hi LDL looking at where Luke is today what do you guys think about
lying on your resume I'm looking for a new job and want to know what you guys think keep up the good work well being an unethical liar I would say lie as hard as you can as much as you can um I wouldn't advise it by the time Luke first of all Luke faked it till he made it yeah that part's pretty important he did manage to successfully perform the job functions as expected even though he did not have the experience that he claimed to have when he came into it he figured it out
so you're going to have to be ready to do that and by the time he got busted or rather admitted it to me it was in a an as friends conversation as friends and I was like oh you also this is far from  believe sounds about right it's not it's not a good way to kick off our relationship though yes and I wouldn't advise you to try it yeah yeah oh man yeah I've also like I've had a not insignificant amount I I kind of wish I never said it on camera not because I don't mind owning it but because people
have like taken it as like uh I'll do this to him and it'll be funny thing oh it serves you right and I've caught a bunch of people doing it and then I'm like well I can't like this isn't it doesn't work yeah if you get so it's one of those things where it's like big bet big reward big downside yeah right bet big you either win big or lose big because if we don't catch you maybe you get the job if we catch you you will almost certainly be removed from any consideration yeah and a lot of the a
lot of the positions have like and technically the one that I did had a form of testing as well but a lot of the positions here have some form of testing or like a trial period or something like that my interview process for him was a three-hour Vibe check so and and we filmed something MH um in Fair his filming stuff back then was as simple as like oh yeah can you make sure that the correct object is zo so just do this dude with that said though you'd be surprised at how many people [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that
up they just couldn't they just like couldn't I'd be like cuz like for you it's obvious right if I'm like uh you know Google's had an amazing year this year they've come out with this and they've come out with that and what I really want to show you is this and I look at okay so to him that's obvious you wouldn't believe the number of people who just stayed on me while I was literally not even looking in the lens and I'm like talking about this thing in my hands and I'm
like this this for the love of God this there was no second take back then so yeah especially cuz a lot of it legitimately was taking the thing out of the box and in many cases that was breaking seals so like there there was no second take yeah zmbt says Luke Luke's problem was he just focused the camera on the road that's a good reference yeah a that's a quality [Laughter] reference oh man anyways yeah don't yeah don't do that don't do that y dear Duke oh hold on hold on by East
one says there is no second take because there's only one tape there were times we cheated oh yeah if something went catastrophically wrong we would turn the box around yeah and break the seal on the other side for sure yeah it's just you you don't aim to do that yeah that's supposed to be like a really really like last solution type situation uh do you want to show um Lieutenant beefy where YouTube shop is really quick one more time there's a few people that are having trouble finding it sure uh if you
are having trouble finding it so it's it's on the 6 months ago it you with this LTD store commuter back not a great still frame uh um uh if you're having trouble seeing this little block right here it's probably something to do with ad blocking or tracking blocking or something like that some type of add-on you have or potentially your browser but you're probably running Chrome so it's probably fine um should be on this W show as well oh okay I didn't know that that's Co should be pinned in this Swan
show I sure hope so let's see let's see there it is cool okay so that's how you do it and then that should bring you yeah right here and then again when you get when you get to this page it's not going to actually show it lower you have to add it to your cart and then in the cart it will be discounted cool beans there you go okay one more uh yeah yeah sure hit me hit me with the merch message dear Duke and Dan and vertically challenged Superstar what oh sorry sorry one some
people are finding that it's uh Geo fence to a certain degree so they have to VPN around to to get it I wonder if that is a YouTube thing yeah I don't know could yeah it could be limited I I don't know anything about that it's a YouTube shopping promo so um we do not have any control over what regions YouTube shopping is able to operate in and um hey it's still a great bag at 150 yeah yeah true our notes say here you may need to disable your ad blocker or VPN if you don't see the tagged product so yeah I
think it is Geo Fen or enable your VPN no I I didn't say that I didn't say that private internet oh do we have a private internet access link oh coincidentally Dan uh if we have um p a it's a service that we've talked about a lot that I've used for many many years now yeah and uh you know just sometimes you run into situations where you need to access a thing as though the thing is from some other thing I I have no idea if it'll work on this I I legitimately don't know
check if you're getting scamed on flight prices like I've I've run into times when um even using a VPN was was not good enough like when I tried to buy a valve index man they got that they got that locked they had that locked down I had to get someone from America with an American credit card from an American Bank to buy that thing for me and send it up  me God Bless America um have you ever had the  flights Southern lus would actually be amazing these SC darn 409s I will take a stand um anyways uh
have you have you had the flight prices thing work uh I I have okay I've had people tell me that's a that's debunked it's debunked but I'm like I I don't know what to tell you we literally did a video it was theoretically debunked or not I I I there was recently I thought it was working and then we figured out that it was Canadian versus USD but they didn't show any differentiation oh interesting um yeah anyways um Southern lonus and the  saaz okay credit to pk7 in float plane
chat that's pretty good 10 out of 10 nicely done all right um Dan why don't you hit us with one more I'm trying oh wait have you not done it yet no well get on with it man what is the jankiest solution or fix ever suggested for something that everyone said no to and looking back how bad it would have really been oh man everyone said no to and and we don't say no that often it was worse than expected the jankiest fix most of the terrible janky fix Solutions uh I've just done them yeah
and they mostly work like I don't know if we've been I don't know if we've been  badly like yeah to be honest oh uh um the the the air fiber link between here and Creator warehouse went out sometimes okay but I think what we determined with the problem was that they were too close oh no they were too close to the roofs oh was it that I thought they were too close to each other oh I mean and they were designed for like a higher power or something like that might have changed but I think
there was some Reflections for them being like they're supposed to be on a post we like glued them to the ground but swimming pool water cooling works though yeah well it does now after that fitting like corroded away and it leaked all over everything but I don't think that was like the concept yeah it's also not that janky it's actually pretty good yeah um and it's like a thing oh the oh this one was funny so the the roof solar that's supposed to contribute to heating
the pool that one doesn't work at all oh because they filled it and I forgot that they told me they filled it but they didn't gly call it so last winter everything blew up and it has to be like completely replum yikes and I haven't gotten around to it yeah yeah so that one that one was bad speaking of which how's the bike going your bike is my Final Fantasy 6 I made progress oh okay I made progress actually this while I was while I was off I um I um reset up everything I added a second intake fan so I have
better positive pressure so I was getting a little bit of dust on some of the previous Parts um I remixed my primer which had settled into water and mud and took probably about 10 15 minutes so with the like the the drill powered paint mixer to get to to get going again um I um I redid my hangers for the wheels cuz the ones I was using before made them kind of hard to maneuver so I made new ones out of like Chopsticks and then um aircraft wire and then like another Chopstick so that it instead of coming
down like this it comes down like this now so it's a little bit easier to handle um so no I actually spent a few hours on it over the last um being off this week getting prepped I'm getting it I'm getting it going again I got a space heater for the booth so that it won't get too too low I got that set up and made sure everything's good to go so I'm I'm actually I'm actually good to get  do a stream where lus paints his bike and Luke plays Final Fantasy 6 first to finish wins it's not a horrible idea it's
actually not a terrible idea that' probably be pretty fun actually I mean you could guys just hang out in the shop together and you know plays it on an ally or something yeah there there's there's a lot of multi-content style streaming that's happening these days and like even just multi content content like you look at the shorts with like the whatever racer thing going on while they talk about something else Subway Surfers yeah yeah yeah here's the problem though these are projects that neither Luke nor I
individually have managed to work on assuming that we are going to somehow align the Stars so we can be in the same place at the same time doing it at the same time I mean oh yeah well come on pause come on man get your mind out of the gutter get your mind out of the gutter it likes it there it's  oh man I didn't actually watch the video did they cut out my uh did they cut out or no you never mind never mind if they cut it out then I'll leave it cut out okay what are we supposed to be  cool um the
uh the LT commuter backpack announcement is that different than what we did for the merch messages call out I don't think so okay uh they just have cute links if you go to lm. Discount please then um it will take you to the store and then when you add it to the card it'll automatically be applied so if you're having trouble lm. discount please that brings you to the YouTube video oh cool right again see you later bad guy and it's kind of however you want to spell it please full word
plz PLS both of those were all three of those were um um I had a lot of fun hanging out with Colin smear yeah was good yeah the video went up it's funny they um I I just I I I felt like I I don't know I felt like they did a really good job they just kind of man the dossier they had on me yeah I don't think that made it into the cut but they had like they had like a book this thick on me it included everything from like like like AI summaries that were full of mistakes to like a print out of the
Wikipedia which I think might also have some mistakes on it but they also had um like past sort of times I've addressed St for stories that I've told on like w shows so they had all these like citations like they had a whole clearly they have someone who or either they do it or someone on their team does it where they go through and they have like a whole like like background check process for guests on their show um which me makes me all the more surprised that they decided to host me given how
controversial I am it was actually really interesting reading through uh both that and uh assumptions yeah reading through sort of like the audience questions and then in the case of Colin and Samir the questions beforehand compared to the comments on the video itself like it's I noticed that too it is a stark difference it really is the like terminal terminally online commenters want to talk about versus what people who actually watch a video care about no relation to each other
whatsoever um anyway was it was a lot of it was a lot of fun I was very surprised to see the Final Cut and that it was like two hours long cuz we only sat down for a little over 2 hours like I don't I don't think they ultimately cut that much out of it I think think uh Colton had asked to have a look at it but I never had a look at the at the cut before they before they uploaded it um I skipped through parts of it I haven't it's obviously it's long I much time I don't think you need to watch it like
you you literally watch you live through you survive sorry I keep changing the language here to better reflect the situation the WAN show every week so I I don't think you need to yeah and you were you were there for a lot of the stories that I was telling so there really isn't I don't think I just wanted to see like what the vibe was basically that that was all I was really doing and it it seemed pretty good I didn't sleep well the night before I'll tell you that much you seemed fairly relaxed though I
was trying to be yeah I mean I don't know it's like um like I thought I thought that was pretty good like we we we wanted a chance to to kind of talk to an audience other than just our own audience that's why we that's why we went down and you know did it in their studio and why we went down and did assumptions as well um I think that you know for for a while I've been a bit of a shut in like there's been some exceptions lately we've done some some fun collabs like with Mighty kods uh but
like I've never really done like the the interview circuit or anything like that like it was very you know generous of lewig to invite me to the yard but I I've never really gone out and been like hey do you need a guest for show before that I can remember um and it was fun actually yeah yeah it was fun it was cool to see how many people in our audience caught that the collab was coming when we shot our Ark battle mage video in their Studio oh yeah because like Their audience obviously knew because they
posted ahead of time hey do you have any questions for lus which by the way as far as I can tell they completely ignored CU they had their own questions ready and I read through the questions that people asked on Twitter and stuff I was like I don't remember seeing any of this there yeah but uh but yeah I I was CU I've watched some of their content before just sort of like I don't know I think it's they actually do some really interesting stuff yeah they're they're like the creators YouTube metagame about
creators for creators Channel yeah it's it's I've watched quite a bit of their stuff um and something that I've I've noticed is that people tend to be pretty relaxed and pretty open and I was like okay is lonus going to go like presenter style like will you have come off just filming something an hour before because that's normal and be like in like presenter mode and then no like you were you were kind of chilling having an open conversation so I think it was I think it was good that Colton
and I went together because we talked for like 4 hours on the flight down there so maybe I was just in like chill chatting about the business mode because realistically both of us are the kind of people that just never turn off yeah so we we literally talked for like 4 hours on the flight down there didn't shut up the whole time I'm sorry to anyone who was on that flight from YVR to LAX my my apologies yeah um someone's saying I should go on Joe Rogan I've had that suggested before a I've never been
invited B I don't know what we'd talk about I I literally have no idea because I I find I am very knowledgeable about a nich that as far as I can tell almost no one cares about which is like Tech YouTube because a lot of what I know is not even necessarily applicable to non like non- Tech or non at least um tangentially related like like science or you know education YouTube or like like you could like you could kind of find ones that are like kind of similar where you're trying to present
information and also make it  yeah um next topic yeah Scrappy DP says he doesn't know who you are 100% he has absolutely no idea who I am I I don't think I've ever seen him operate a computer so um I think his uh I I think his producer at some point or something talked about the screwdriver though red ban is not his producer but has worked with him in in the past and definitely knows who we are for sure um he he's like the what what is the kill Tony oh okay okay okay that's
the one I'm thinking about yep but I I think he used to work with Joe Rogan in the in the way past or something got it got it got it got it got it okay yeah red red BS W like he's had like I think he's talked with scw Bo he's worn a an LTX sweater on one of the kilton in the past um cool yeah so he's definitely  remember I guess this would be before you were doing YouTube stuff but I thought Joe Rogan was really into like Quake I've heard that and doing land stuff back in the day I don't know that
would have had to be like a thousand  ago all right Melody bun there is no risk of me going on Rogan they're begging me not to go on like I have not been invited he literally doesn't know who I am it's fine just chill L do you think a like a gorilla could play badmington do sorry what you know like a gorilla like they're pretty strong and like fast what do you think are you are you saying I should play Joe Rogan in badminton no no no no like I like a gorilla do you think I could play B he's trying to be Joe
Rogan I'm prepping you for your interview I've never watched the Rogan Experience okay I i' I've seen the occasional clip here and there like are those the kind of questions he asks I don't know I don't I've seen Clips like that that all his interviews turn into him talking about like what if this was a giant scary animal and could you like take it on so it doesn't matter that you're a tech YouTuber because you won't be talking about that I see it's like that uh I I think the whole thing is like
yeah like could you fight a bear slash have you done DMT before that's the meme I think what's DMT I was going to I was going to mention that but didn't drug oh okay what is it though I don't know dimethyl tryptamine as a strong psychedelic well yeah I mean obviously um but like what's its well what's its colloquial name DMT when versus Joe Rogan in a cage that would end poorly yeah he might be old but he's still a lot bigger than me he's going to do one of those spinny kicks and send us into orbit um
uh Dimitri and Fantasia schedule one controlled substance in the United States blah blah blah blah blah oh okay okay so it's by other names just called DMT yeah um okay well I mean now I know about that so if I ever get into when I yeah when I start my hookers and blow art then I'll I'll have another DMT and bears I would work in Vancouver I'll  that please tell me the bear thing was  yeah I'm sorry I'm going to shut up now oh man I mean I feel like I'm overdue for a real Scandal you know like I feel like I
feel like to put in to put things in context I need to like like run over some orphans or something you know because then me not me not talking about you know a sponsor that we haven't worked with in 3 years will be just it it people will be able to put it in the correct context you know yeah like come on tell me tell me what what what Scandal Do you guys want you want like a good one not yeah don't you know don't run over orphans give me something you know speeding come
on I mean that that was another that was another funny one to me just cuz like the fact that every other car YouTuber does blur their Speedo does that make what they're doing like any the fact that they successfully blur their Speedo  better like I'm not saying that it's a good thing to do that you should just rip around on public Road wasn't he in a school zone he was there was a there was a children at Play sign of some sort but I don't think there's any concrete evidence that it was in effect it may 
um like dude there was that there was that scrapyard Wars when I was literally texting while driving in scrapyard Wars and I'm not saying that's good and you shouldn't do that um it was a different time for real and that's not a good excuse like distracted driving is terrible I'm just saying that like it was it was it was interesting to watch how eager people were to like nail Marquez to the cross for that one and I'm not saying what he did was right and the timing sucked coming right on the
heels of the um I think that's most of it to be honest yeah I don't know I feel like a lot of what's G on with us has been blood in the water a has been a significant amount of residual anger that goes all the way back to ad block his piracy yeah probably I think that was our first thing where people felt like personally attacked even though I never said don't do it and there's a there's a certain degree that you get to I've had this conversation with a few people there's a certain degree that you
get to when uh it is encouraged and uh cheered on by the community to attack a person or group of people um so it it it ends up being like the safe route like I think I think I can think of one particular point in time where it was the safe route to throw at us with everything you could oh yeah 100% so like it was anything else would have gotten you like destroyed even if you said nothing even if you said nothing you would have looked like you're evil or something so then like and that that
residuals for a long time I think it I don't think it goes away potentially ever yeah I'm not I'm not convinced it goes way okay so hold on a second hold on a second we' got we've got suggestions though we've got suggestions for a proper Scandal um okay interesting lonus is actually 6' five lied the whole time that's good nice that's good draus asks how were the Diddy parties dude if you think I am anywhere near cool enough to be invited to a music industry party please 
is remember when we talked recently um I'm not trying to say he's Associated to Diddy just before people freak out it's already starting oh no that was not my point at all um remember when we were talking recently about like celebrities that I've met and I couldn't I couldn't think of any yeah yeah yeah like even Seth Curry the the like the Lesser Curry still great still great NBA player I I don't watch I don't watch basketball but still my understanding I looked at his
stats I creeped the stats and they were good um still great but like I haven't met anybody I I don't know anybody I don't wait the Lesser Curry who's the greater Curry um Steph oh yeah they had two kids they named them Steph and Seth wow yeah good thinking I don't watch I don't watch I thought they were the same person no not even okay yeah not even all right um oh yeah I met Dead Mouse I mean Joel's kind of Niche famous too though I think so like he's like if you're into
EDM now I think so and you don't know who dead mouse is you're like like a cultural [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] basically but if you're not into EDM and you don't know who dead mouse is like yeah like he had like one song on the radio like let's be real and I think in our age bracket and pretty much everybody knew I think pretty much body knew but outside of that please yeah that's probably true yeah come on yeah um and Joel's super cool nothing nothing against him or anything but when when you talk like
like famous famous I mean I did meet Paris Hilton okay I was in the same room and I you meet her were you in the same room I complained about her did you meet her or were you complaining about her in the same room uh she uploaded that Christmas video of her naked so I would say that I I would say that I've actually seen more of her than  life that is not that is a h wow that is a very positively parasocial thing for everyone that enjoys only fans I think all the only fans enjoyers are like yeah
I know them I've seen a lot of them yeah she's disrupting the market if if if Joe Rogan did know who you were and invited you would you go on uh I think I would probably leave it to the management team it's like I think it' be fine i' probably well then you feel free to cast your vote but I don't think I'd weigh in on that I think that's I think that's something I'd let the team decide because that way I get plausible deniability I can just be like yeah the executive team sent me here I just work
here because I really I honestly don't fairly true I don't really have an opinion I've I've seen Clips like I said I've I've come across the odd clip I've never actually like sat through an entire podcast but i' I've seen Clips here and there that make it look like a very very stupid thing um but I've also seen clips that seem to have intelligent people and some semblance of like a a coherent U intellectual conversation so I don't really know what to make of it yeah um I don't know I just think things 
like yeah if you keep your head about  talking man we discover lonus pays people to play games for for him um that could be that could be something n there's you you guys got nothing you guys got nothing badminton Center's a drug front oh that's not bad that's pretty good yeah there's there's there's shipping Bays on the back shuttlecock more like mule penises like mules like for drugs yeah I don't know okay all right yeah and they're big so lots of drugs big mule penis drug
I don't know like aphrodesiac I don't  Panda um oh man what else we got here shuttle Cox you could have a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fighting ring oh man even in float plane it's amazing how many people like actually believe some of the stuff that is just like not true at all uh someone said someone committed suicide because of you that's not true at all is that is absolutely false I have personally verified that that is absolutely false and it's just it it's it's so bizarre the way that
someone can say something about you online and it becomes and it becomes canon in some people's heads and you can never reach 100% of them you can never reach 100% of them again Luke is actually allergic to chicken and rice oh  what does it mean maybe his allergy is that it engorges certain parts of his body oh no which would actually work out great given what he cooks his famous chicken for for his 100% success chicken rate that that could be that could be quite convenient actually winner winner

your laptop or something like that yep first up is David with his console tier list perhaps the most high effort tier list video ever made says David the Cleopatra of the tier list format can you tell the guy writes for for a living uh David says I loved making this video because it fell outside of our comfort zone I especially liked the challenge of coming up with visuals for the longer storytelling bits like the paper puppet show during the Sony intro or the crta roll during the Sega bit only video game
Dunkey has a more popular console tier list I am very proud of how this one turned out yeah this one has been a slow burn out of the gate it actually did not perform very well for us but over time it has it oh it's it's cranking very clickable yep it's doing great and you you can see that like to view ratio very solid very solid I they the team outdid themselves on this one it was an extremely high effort video and it's long like putting together a high effort edit like this for a 10-minute video
that's that's a lot of work putting it together for a 30-minute video and it never it it never slows down like the the the the the quality of this video is just outstanding they did a really good job I think it's pretty interesting that the highest replay spike is not the final tier list I think it's cuz everyone just like final tier list is a high Spike but not the highest I think everyone just kind of knows like it's PlayStation yeah and there was some really like interesting stuff like this
this bit um even though a lot of people know the the history there um David did a great job of providing a really excellent and fast summary of it yeah for sure all right next up we've got Adam I built the world's biggest gaming TV I can't believe lonus took this down to build a stupid Badminton Center we were there till like 1:00 a.m. and it was worth every minute uh you got that one up yet y this was legitimately an unforgettable  Unforgettable um Dan was there Dan wasn't even
working no one told me I would have been there yeah I know I'm sorry yeah they called me like 4 hours late I think I arrived at like 11:00 p.m. scam absolutely worth it it's hard to even get a sense of the scale of it like it's it's enormous Bonkers um so cool though and like watch even just watching Dan play Flight Sim on it you played flight Sim yeah I mean I said at the time I it felt more immersive to me than VR just because of like oh unlimited fov yeah look there I am oh yeah you were
driving the car the car was bigger than a real car wild like you can see the couch yeah wow like dude so cool that's nuts those walls are w part 35t tall I think 32 32 yeah yeah and like the fact that we locked out and "it was actually slightly over 2,000 in" dance so we got to meme on Frank's 2000 inch TV yeah like oh oh I loved it man this is this is amazing because I didn't even remember either of those like our writing team editors work on a lot of videos yeah I I work on okay
how many Raiders we got 1 2 3 4 five six I'm going to also count myself seven because I do write videos from time to time so I literally work on six to seven times as many videos as them so there are things that I just and all the streams blank on um I I didn't remember that either of those were this year we we do those were this year yeah it feels like they were longer ago we do cool stuff oh yeah like actually cool stuffff crying out loud um plof says his favorite no way no way is working on it
this one got it oh wrong one I have two weeks to file a dispute for this scam TV okay it is the hardest that I think I have ever seen plof laugh in the years that we have been working together so you got to skip forward it's probably going to be a view Spike forward forward Way Forward look for the big one at the end this is probably it that's got to be  realizes wait for it that's inside the  realizes that the only person he knows who's stupid enough to get ripped off by this thing is sitting right next to
him look at have you ever  happy oh man oh dude no acting could ever be that pure and that genuine the the mirth the Mir that this man felt um so he says uh he says just like Jake tyy I enjoy wasting Linus's money also apparently once the refund was finally going to happen and support   boy you know we've had to dial back the like references to like wasting my money and stuff in videos because people get so hung up on it they're like oh line is flexing his money again or like it's not
even his money it's the company's money it's this like like people get so mad about it what they don't understand is I don't write I don't write that into the videos the team writes that into the videos they think it's funny I'm like I what what do you want and so I have to sit there and tell them yeah this thing that you enjoy and you think is like genuinely funny to meme on because people will get upset on behalf of the team they'll be like yeah line is flexing his money in front of his team
that can't afford this Chinese TV or whatever but they're the ones who love it that's pretty man um all right what else we got oh yeah oh yeah Alex obviously was going to pick this one the Mighty Car Mods collab coincidentally pl's least favorite video plof says not my least favorite but I do wish yall had like one extra day thanks Customs for delaying the engine cuz it took a while for them to actually get it driving ready for him oh okay yeah it was sitting in 105 for like the next
couple weeks oh wow this is such a great moment for the that was pretty cool it's so awesome having them all in the engine bay there love it um I have a response from plof here about the TV oh oh what' he say let's see let's see wow plof with the game sense to message the producer rather than messaging me I think that's a first fwan show no I messaged plof oh all right then that's my w nice or we can both take the L's I don't know we'll share I like sharing L's two L's yeah I make a
W uh let's see AliExpress is offering a partial refund but not telling me the amount I said I either want to return it or get a full refund uh they closed the case oh uh okay case closed then I guess yeah let's see Visa uh Visa they reached out to Visa uh basically both TVs are lumped in the same purchase and AliExpress uh they've appealed five times so they've appealed the charge back you have uh you've purchased two TVs no way I should be able to get my money back what's the point of charge
back if I can order the wrong thing and they just get to be like yeah it's a Chinese inch what's a Chinese inch wait did they say that yeah what they said yeah our inches are different from your inches oh no I think the Visa is a separate thing oh okay okay okay all right well we'll figure it out we'll figure it out if it says if it makes you feel better the video did get three to five million views what what's three to five million plof does have access to this dashboard did
he say that or are you are you saying that that's what that's what oh my God  up okay so yes that's true but the TV then should be bigger not smaller oh right yeah so we we measured it every possible way and also there's multiple Chinese inches um and Andy talked us through it so so yeah so we we we measured it if it was cim it's not right if it was Chinese inches it's not right and if it was regular inches it's not right it's just completely invented like it's it's nothing to do with anything on any  
okay all right let's keep going Elijah really huh uh add yeah if only there was some way to because you know that we're going to do the next thing ceue up the okay it doesn't matter uh the point is his favorite was why did you make me build this the CEO PC build this was his second time water cooling he was apparently super nervous P.S when are we "selling the poster the video hit 100,000" likes uh okay so there's a poster at the end if you go to taran's office yeah just anywhere in his office
so that poster um I think I think we are going forward with it I don't think it's going to be that big but yeah uh you guys did you did "reach 100,000 likes so there's no real" avoiding that at this point Pope he was able to get rid of the chair which is great he still has to use I think he still has the keyboard he still has the computer and the computer which is loud and annoying that's not my problem that sounds like that sounds like a like a CEO issue if it reduces
the performance poster soon probably in January really this is from nickl yeah I forgot like it's during the work day today there will be an option to buy the big one yeah that's why I reached out no way the oh my gosh okay um I responded to this I didn't realize that it was a segment for Wan show I said I love all my videos equally that's like asking me to pick my favorite child he actually put a screenshot of that from teams in there uh but I really enjoyed the 3D home theater video even if no one else
cared about it it was pretty cool to to put together like a true Cinema grade passive 3D setup the number of people that provided advice to me on how I could have done it better or Cheaper by using active shutter glasses or whatever  I followed 3D pretty closely I am aware  glasses I did it this way because I wanted passive 3D with glass Optics I have never seen anything as good as the 3D setup that was in my house it was awesome the only thing that I would like to do differently is I would like to get
my hands on a higher quality deal DLP projector I also I also learned about another type of filter that could help me make non DLP projectors like like make the light polarizable or something it a whole I forget what it's called anyway I I linked Elijah to some articles in case we were going to do a follow-up but the video didn't get any views so we probably won't but um I'd like to get my hands on some better DLP projectors with lens shift so that I could perfectly align the images and
then oh man oh so cool I I I I would totally have that set up maybe as part of like whand or something I also really enjoyed doing the equinix tour I always love getting access to places other people don't get to go um it's one of my favorite parks of this job like it oh so cool and then the last one that came off the top of my head was the motherboard repair video that was probably the most pure joy and like exhilaration that I have felt filming a video in at least a
couple years just like stacking up those w although we have one coming oh no this one came out already the one where the uh the wife threw the guy's PC out out the window the three-story balcony when he asked for a divorce uh we got have you watched it I've gone through parts of it oh okay um we got all but one component working yes I did know that all but one wait no I think I did watch the whole thing yeah that was super awesome I was very surprised I've also got another response here from Nick
light I'm on vacation Ulus I'm not working I'm on vacation Ulus there's a blank in there no he said Ulus I'm not working Ulus what's Ulus Ulus Ulus oh he said you lus nice God I hope my button Works doesn't for us um Jordan said I'm on vacation Adam please stop messaging me nice and then Belle's favorite was you might feel a little pressure the lwig swipe plus bedet short circuit that was actually a lot of fun what oh sorry sorry I just assumed you wouldn't bother clicking it
wow that was the only one that's had an ad like this one didn't have an ad on it that was awesome how many views did this "get we should hire this guy 850,000" views on a bedet yeah absolutely natural talent I mean I told him this when he came up here I was like like if there's anything oh I think I I think I actually said this on the yard but the guy is an S tier Personality yeah like just you could probably put him in front of anything with anyone doing anything they do pretty well and he would just he'd
like figure out the vibe settle in and just perform like the guy is uh yeah just absolutely s here  uh okay oh Sammy Sammy picked a favorite one I haven't watched this video you haven't watched your own setup doctor that's weird weird way I feel like I would watch mine yeah he says he has a hard time watching himself oh I'm I'm the same I haven't watched mine what oh what okay I was working up the courage too but well anyway uh all right yeah he said that was his joke answer and then
his real answer was this is how we make an LTT video 2024 this was outstanding and I didn't even know about it until I watched it the team did such an outstanding job of this video going through the entire process in like a this is super cool I don't know I don't know how to describe why it's so much better than the way that we've done it in the past but I think this might be the best like dislike ratio on float plan you just ruined it now no they won't float plane's not like that I'm going to do it
what Dan no float planes not like that they don't respect that cool yeah so yeah he said it was a video idea he wanted to do for over a year and uh   hold on I can block mods you can yeah  plane um okay Sammy Adam added some other stuff some stats uh 844 million views on the channel this year um 172 million hours of watch time uh 234 LTT videos 59 live streams 34 shorts 12 6 float plane exclusives including behind the scenes and exclusive live streams and themed weeks um themed weeks are
"sick 640,000 new subscribers oh we have" some most viewed videos can you guess the top three okay well I know one of them I have a theory for one of them which I'm very surprised wasn't mentioned at all oh really up above um I know the top one is the O hold on I have a theory of what one it is should I write it down um yeah you can write it down but I know it's I know it's one of two it's oh shoot oh it's one of three oh shoot I think the top viewed video on the channel for this year is actually um
the Samsung folding displays short from CES that isn't what I thought and that isn't what I wrote down interesting uh oh we didn't count that apparently so I think we I think we might have gotten it wrong I guess they're only counting vaud but yeah no the top performing other than that uh would have been the underwater scooter but that's another short or the Taiwan PC okay I wrote down Taiwan yeah yeah that that one far and way outperformed everything else this year yeah I'm going to sort by views
here I think oh I don't know over 10 million is that enough zeros I don't even know uh yeah yeah so this short from January of 2024 got almost 13 million views yeah um this one got a lot but it's from the previous year and then the the underwater scooter one I think did like 8 or 9 million or something like that so hold on let's have a look at let's have a look at what Adam's got so can you guess the top three yeah I knew that one off the top of my head as for the next
one man I don't know we actually played this game recently and I had no idea when we did the 16th anniversary stream I had no idea what like top performing videos were from the channel I don't spend nearly as much time in the dashboard now that it sucks so much um yeah so the yeah the other three I knew Taiwan PC was going to smash other than that uh um crap I feel like the the iPhone video is going to be up there somewhere no no it's like good I think it's got like 3 million 2.9 Million or something like
that the next segment is commented I bet  one most views though cuz the giant TV was last year right was it I think the giant TV was last year oh you don't mean like the the projector setup at the Bon Center yeah okay cuz that one I just saw that that one had almost like 4 million views I think okay I give up I don't know oh wait what oh that's such a hack what the second one totally is the TV H wasn't published this year so I put oh it's the ones that got the most views this year
okay I'm giving myself some credit for that one because I only excluded it because I thought it was ones that were published this year yeah fair enough okay I don't know what the third one is one is no way this this one like bombed out of the gate 5.3 million 5.3 yeah this one did not do well hold on I'm not uh I'm not logged into the right account here but let's go let's go find it I I'll show you guys like this one it was supposed to be like a like a sequel to a top performer because this is uh EVGA
wow yeah so like dude this started come on this started like at the low end of typical yep and then just reached escape velocity and then "just has not slow down 15,000 views" today like just casually racking them up "yeah that 30,000 views last 48 hours for" a video that old is crazy it doesn't happen that much anymore it used to be how our entire Channel growth was architected what we talked about yeah was just you make Evergreen content and it just like gets views forever but only
a few of them only a few of them break out like that yeah crazy all right what was our bonus forth they left this in my driveway the Clen scorpion gaming chair yeah yeah there you go that's such a great thumb I forgot that was this year and the fact that that that that title is not clickbait like that's actually what happened we ordered the thing and they just dumped it like in the driveway 11 months we didn't even sign for it like they just left it there I'm like really that seems a little silly absolutely
wild um okay most commented video with "13,000 comments that's got to be the" iPhone video there's no way oh no it was "the uh the $5,000 PC in the tai1 E Tech" mall and then the next one was April fools that that checks out oh man are none of them in the iPhone video is the last one the last one was the iPhone video okay "10,800 comments on I really tried Apple" iPhone 30-day challenge I'm still using it by the way but only because I'm lazy um and migrating WhatsApp off of iPhone
I've heard is even worse than migrating WhatsApp onto the iPhone so I'm really not looking forward to that cuz I I used to lose my chat history all the time and that's one of the reasons that I stuck with the note 9 for so long honestly I don't know why people keep using WhatsApp to be honest I mean I've never understood how it survived it's fine but like the so is everything else everything's fine it's where my chat history is I think losing it no no I haven't lost it
in like six years oh okay yeah I used to lose my chat history all the time like I didn't even I didn't even realize with uh cuz like text message migration would be really sloppy unless you like went and did it at the store or with like the proper app or whatever so lose I'm not saying a lot of people don't still use it of people still use it I just don't understand why and then like losing my WeChat history was super inconvenient at one point I don't know if you recall that yes um but I had a lot of people
accuse me of impropriety because I didn't have WeChat receipts for something I'm like I didn't even realize it didn't cloud backup I don't know like China not have the cloud like okay I thought they keep everything I'm sure somebody has it yeah can you give it back to me please at least a copy um and then yeah app uh the migration just like kind of like kind of sucks like you can at least use it across multiple devices now which is a big upgrade yeah this is what I mean yeah I know I know I get it
I don't I don't understand I get it um it's just it's been it's been pretty sticky because almost everyone I know uses either that or Facebook Messenger um and Facebook Messenger is um is like the predominant one for like organizing group events MH and then WhatsApp is the big one for like group chats yeah um what uh when is your heart out is it 17 minutes from now no hour yeah oh six five okay sweet as for our best like ratios the powercolor factory tour at 99.08% Sur honestly not surprise that
was a cool video that was a wicked video that was an awesome video it's tied though tied with hello old friend media ripping explained that was a thick video yeah like it was dense yeah um very like information heavy uh how did that end up performing that's what I'm checking yeah hello old friend here we are bring up the dashboard yeah see this is this is more typical these days where even something that performs really well flat lines flates high but still yeah but because it got there start high yeah in
August it had 1.54 million like for contrast what's it yeah last 48 2 230 Yeah so basically dead so this kind of like how to rip Media or whatever in the only reason this shot up like this is cu it had a really good title in thumbnail and then that's it it's like they're they're not going to keep they're not going to keep serving this bummer YouTube's uh YouTube's just different now and you have to adapt to the meta or you die knowing that a lot of Evergreen just dies and knowing that
the audience is actually surprisingly cyclical um would you consider remaking old videos because I know that was a thing that you were Hardline on no in the past yeah absolutely yeah at this point Y it seems like it makes sense now especially cuz like there's there's new information that you know hadn't come out or we didn't know or has changed yeah or you can just do a better job potentially like a lot of them especially from like the really early days how to water cool
a PC the last guide you'll ever need in 4k yeah sure you know or whatever like we could I I think could even go back to some of the old like uh ncx Tech tips the green um like there are there are videos that I literally um haven't made because I'm like ah no we we did that on NCI here hold on ni Here We Go ultimate water cooling guide yes 13 years ago buddy we've been doing this for a while I know right this was pretty early Luke shot yeah uh um Luke tried to figure out
water cooling but turns out he lied on his resume so he didn't do anything that was one of the fun moments when he left me to water cool two gpus and just left the room but I've never water cooled anything before I've done no water cooling before and I had to take the the the heers of two gpus that was uh terrifying yeah well he didn't do it I ended up having to do it no I came back and I I think you weren't done yet I think I had to at least help yeah that's I was like how you've been doing
you've been here for so long what's taking so long that wasn't entirely true we've talked about this a few times cuz you didn't actually give me very much time there were other parts you didn't have enough time for you definitely had enough time when I wanted those heat sinks stripped off okay that's probably fair this um the last one uh at 99.06% was the sensible Tech upgrade that was Sebastian's oh dude his place is so Stylin that was a really good video yeah honestly the tech upgrades in
general are just like pretty awesome I I I love the tech upgrade series 2.1 million wow that's not even that old yeah they're just they're just reliable they're just reliable our team is so cool that all you have to really do is like hang out with one for a bit and then like people love them and his place is so interesting all these little projects are so interesting yeah not even little all these like incredibly professional projects y that's a lot of and the team puts so
much work into stuff these days like those little extras like the amount of work that went into just having an entire like couple of Master cartons of screwdrivers on the island there it's like it's extra I think is the the term for it yeah uh discussion question how did you feel about 2024 what did you achieve any surprises disappointments um it was a tough year 2024 was a really tough year uh we were coming off of um we were coming off of um some allegations that you know after after the investigation
was completed did we we released our statement that said the um the the investigation found that the allegations were unfounded and unfair um so you know going through all of that um when the allegations were according again to the investigation unfounded and unfair uh was extremely challenging uh for me personally and for us as a company um you know I think that wait on a lot of people yeah for sure for sure and and there was a lot of stuff that um uh there's a lot of stuff that people
didn't see behind the scenes that made it that made it really hard um what we achieved I think is we we got our groove back we we're we're back to we're back to kind of killing it it's always it's always cyclical like I think uh we talked in that recent All Hands about how we're like back to you know before viewership and it's a little down this month but you know it do be like that though I mean I think there's going to be a lot of people upgrading when 50 series comes out I think there's going
to be a lot of Buzz around that so there'll be some some upswing there and and then it'll be down again it'll be up and you whatever  um yeah dyslexic Stoner says um I'll admit I stopped watching for a while I couldn't stand having another person I like turned out to be a monster I was glad it wasn't true um yeah no there was a there was a big quite a bit of that there was a  um yeah there was a big group of people that just stopped watching and there's a significant group that you know if their
comments are to be believed have never come back and that's sad um that's really sad and it's still sad for me I think it's true yeah because there's also like that stuff went so far and wide well you'll never be able to reach all of those people again um yeah yeah really tough um as for as for what's uh welcome to the next quarter of a century oh my goodness yeah did you know Star Wars 1977 was released closer to the year  year I'm just going to close that talk topic why don't we move
on yes yes let's do that there's a fake Nintendo lawyer sending out dmca takedowns a few months ago YouTuber Dominic dendo num received dmca takedowns on his Legend of Zelda Echoes of wisdom Let's Play videos however after some back and forth with the tetsumi masaki protonmail.com account um dendo reached out to Nintendo with itself who responded that the emailer was not using a legitimate Nintendo email address oh yeah a few weeks later the YouTuber received a followup from
that same email with a short message I hereby retract all of my proceeding claims although the threatening email would start to come from a spoofed anti-- piracy 3 nintendo.co JP email rumors of fake takedowns from Big Red last circled when Gary's Mod removed all Nintendo related fan content after receiving dmas originating from suspicious looking emails the developer claims to have verified The Source though Nintendo and partners have also been accused of using AI tools to issue
Mass takedowns um that was just a quick a quick topic um I want to talk about this one this is called my experience as a winner turned into disqualification by Nvidia and this was actually flagged for me um before the show like just a just a little while before the show this was posted six hours ago on the Forum but um this poster in our community said they were officially declared a winner and their project was publicly listed on Nvidia platforms they were supposed to
win oh winner yeah winner I think it was uh yeah here we go and Nvidia RTX 6000 add a generation graphics card so like a really valuable GPU and then after declaring them a winner and sending them through a bunch of a Hoops they apparently were disqualified um for reasons that Nvidia has not apparently been able to properly explain so they've just asked us to highlight this because I hope I I like to assume you know incompetence where um where malice has not yet been proven uh
where hopefully by getting some visibility on this we can at least get them a uh a satisfactory answer so what they're asking for is if anyone from Nvidia reads this I respectfully ask for my project to be reviewed by a team of qualified technical experts my only goal is to ensure fairness and transparency thank you for taking the time to read this I appreciate any help that you can provide so they provided a link to their project um to their GitHub uh repo so um that's on there just wanted to make sure
that we uh we kind of highlighted that we like to make sure that we're taking care of our community members and this seemed like seems like there's got to be something going on here they should at   ah do you want to do the AI stuff uh oh no I didn't even know this uh by a vote of four to three the Arizona State Board for Charter Schools approved an application to open a fully online school which will serve grades 4 to8 um that doesn't automatically sound all that bad uh Unbound Academy hopes to use
AI to condense academic instruction into a two our window which now sounds really bad uh to free up time for life skill workshops covering financial literacy public speaking goal setting entrepreneurship critical thinking and creative problem solving which sounds great except in theory uh quote as students work through lessons on subjects like math reading and science the AI system will analyze their responses time spent on tasks and even emotional cues to optimize the difficulty and presentation of
content that sounds ambitious wow good luck with that wow that sounds like um that sounds like a like a Stanley Parable style like video game level of of issue when it would be applied to the workplace and this feels like to me some amount of desensitization before it gets applied to the workplace but we'll see uh Unbound Academy has been triing this 2-hour learning method in Texas seemingly in person and has applications to open other schools in Arkansas and Utah experts have questioned the
effectiveness of personalized education programs and have called it orwellian an orwellian misnomer for replacing teachers with digital services and data mining software y uh much of the criticism stems from the lack of clarity behind the term yep personalized learning is perhaps like personalized ads I.E data collection a form of double speak says Adam and I strongly agree um discussion question do you think kids need that real connection with teachers in order to do well I'm going to stop
you right there yeah not necessarily oh I do but what they definitely need is a real connection with other students oh yeah 100% And in theory good point this is freeing up time for life skill workshops covering financial literacy public speaking goal setting entrepreneurship critical thinking and creative problem solving in practice homeschooling is an extremely poorly regulated area um I strongly recommend watching the John Oliver segment on it um oh cool yeah and I'm not saying
that you have to agree with John Oliver on everything but what I will say is that as far as um as far as background research goes um they do a pretty darn good job and this just feels like this just feels like homeschooling with extra steps to me it feels like if you're going to have a problem kid it's just going to be exacerbated so much um because without someone there being able to do something about it uh I don't know what if they just frown at the AI camera for like five minutes what 
nothing nothing does it make the tasks easier because it detects kid is upset like I don't know assuming that every single kid is just going to do this perfectly seems but I mean assuming every kid is going to do Traditional School perfectly you know it's not right is that the whole reason why the teachers are there or a big part of it but I mean not every teacher is great I mean I definitely agree you know one of one of my most frustrating experiences person had at least one bad teacher yeah
one of my most frustrating experiences being in school was knowing from having parents who were teachers and from having my teachers who were teachers and you know seeing a little bit of the inside baseball knowing that competency was not necessarily the most important attribute for keeping your job and getting promotions and raises yeah seniority yeah it was politics you know that and that's not yeah that's not how things should be done right um anyway yeah good good luck Arizona um I I am deeply
worried about the I I'm I'm deeply worried about education Top Gear said no there will be a Baseline and it will be monitored it won't be so easy they graduate below level um yeah but you can't fail kids anymore that's a whole thing so like  be I don't know I don't have a great answer and I'm not in that field I don't have a kid but education doesn't feel like it's going in a fantastic Direction I feel bad for the kids the No Child  like it feels sort of Conrad a good idea like a or a warm
idea that in practice I just don't really understand why we're still giving it any Credence Conrad says my mom is a teacher and says the upcoming generation is not okay and I don't think it's their fault to be super clear at all I I think the the current Powers at be are setting them up for failure um I don't I   anyways yeah inventor to boy five says yeah that's what my sister's telling me too she's a teacher too they are super uninterested in learning um yeah I'm I'm reminded of that famous 
um that is not actually from peanuts and lonus did didn't actually say this in the strip but uh so good that's pretty good yeah it's stuck with me though yeah I mean it feels like that right yeah actual attribution as  right open AI outlines new for-profit corporate structure nice they've outlined a plan to change their corporate structure by transforming its for-profit arm into a public benefit Corporation a company structured to balance the interest of society with sharehold shareholder value which should
make securing investors easier they recently completed a $6.6 billion funding Round 4 billion from Amazon alone and currently have a 157 billion valuation the proposed change comes after Elon Musk dropped the lawsuit claiming a for-profit structure would be illegal musk and Sam mman worked together for nine worked together nine years ago to Launch Open AI as a nonprofit Prof with the mission statement to develop generative AI for the benefit of society musk left in 2018 after seeming frustrations over the
company taking billions in funding from Microsoft um also failing to gain a majority stake in the company for himself might have had something to do with it yeah yeah there's been the whole thing with the might have suddenly made that everything y yep yep yep yep yep yep yep any who uh that's it for our topics oh Dan left cool well we're going to switch to after dark when Dan comes back in the meantime um I could read some off if you want oh what happened to the uh oh I have another GoFundMe that
unlike the one we talked about earlier is um not a downer and oh hey look at that pass it goal let's go wait did we oh okay well I mean you know what that's cool some Anonymous person yesterday donated "$1,000 uh reboot rewind has a GoFundMe" you guys can feel free to resurrect this iconic animated show from my childhood was actually the first fully computer animated TV show uh here's some footage um y pretty awesome you guys can check  there I did not end up stalling for very
long no uh do you want me to read some off oh uh yeah we could do that or we could wait for Dan they'll wait okay oh we don't have have a lot of time to kill though that's what I'm yeah I kind of have to I have to leave at some point okay there aren't a ton of them either though oh has Dan been filtering a lot of them there's only 10 oh okay they uh apparently people just don't care about leaving merch messages because there was bought a lot of backpacks I think he also was maybe pretty
aggressive with the curating because there was a decent amount of merch messages I'll let you guys know how many discount codes are left uh we are down to to mental math is hard we're down to about 3500 so we have a couple videos that are queued to go up this weekend that have call outs for the computer bag it's after dark time Dan and I'm a little worried that we might have to YouTube edit or like cut out the part uh referring to the discount code we'll see how it goes so many of them
yeah already yeah let's do it I must have missed a topic change sorry about that no you're good Dan  tripping look at that now it's dark so  I I have been an absolute lump for the last two days I don't remember the last time I did less I didn't even I didn't even respond to social messages like Luke messaged me over the holiday actually with some some stuff that probably merited paying attention to I was a little surprised you didn't respond I was like okay I mean it's fine he's probably busy so so
initially initially I just had a lot of family stuff going on up until the 25th um or until the 25th and I think i' I think I've updated you on like my family being a little complicated right now um so that was I assumed there was stuff going on I wasn't I wasn't bothered by it um and then and then on the 25th and the 26th I I went and played badminton with my in-laws and my son nice and other than that did literally actually nothing and then yesterday um I went and played some
badminton in the evening because I looked at my step counter and I had like 400 steps I did actually nothing so you probably saw me on Steam like all day yesterday like I would no yesterday was my family's Christmas got it yeah so if you'd been on your computer you would have seen me on Steam doing absolutely nothing I am substantially ahead of you in Final Fantasy 6 I okay and I only played yesterday and a little bit in the evening the day before you know it shouldn't be an always thing but it's
it's not a bad idea to slow down every once in a while I don't remember the last time that I've done it and you know what it was kind of glorious but but at the end of the day yesterday I was like really brother okay on the wor so I dragged my I dragged my butt to smash I played for a couple hours and then I jumped on the stair Master for 10 minutes I found out my step rate by the way um the the speed that I'm doing is 133 steps per minute so whoa um it says 350 Watts on the wow on the thing so I
only did I only did 10 minutes I don't know but I think that's really good I only did 10 minutes of that yesterday uh but what I've been doing um before when I told you that I would would cycle between the machines is I've been trying to do half an hour and so I've been doing um for rowing 2 minutes for every 500 m is about the pace that I Target and then for the StairMaster I've been doing uh that so I've been doing 133 steps per minute and then for the bike I've been targeting about 140 Watts so
that was that's my like half an hour continuous that I've been trying to do I've fallen off the wagon a little bit over the last couple days as I as I already told you but when the uh when those binton players come out here for the collab I want to be at the point where I can comfortably do half an hour of continuous like crazy cardio Rod mind out the gut please we both read that at the same time I want to be able to do 15 minutes continuous on the stair Master at that speed and uh expect that from Rod and
then I'm going to bookend it with the bike and the rower nice so I'm thinking I'll go oh man what will I what will I do yeah cuz the bike is really tough on the thighs too I might have to find like a third cardio machine that's not just pure legs cuz oh the you isn't there an elliptical there oh yeah that's true elliptical is your most well-rounded whole body one that you have okay yeah May why I push for that maybe I'll do elliptical then so I could do but you got to actually operate the handles yeah
well I'm going to need to because my legs will be dead so maybe I could do the elliptical last so I could row and then jump on the stair master and then do the elliptical for the last five minutes pull it into your yeah I know yeah yeah I did try out for the rowing team oh nice yeah yeah that's as far as I got they did invite me they did invite me to be the coxen ah yeah light yeah and loud yeah oh yeah piercing makes sense all right hit me down hi what big house upgrades or projects do you have in the
works I struggle with permanent modifications for example throwing holes in the walls so I love watching home upgrades okay okay I am going to do this I want to build like an epic catwall like with all the like things and the things and the ropes and the things they can climb and stuff I want the entire upstairs hallway essentially oh sick to be just like cat jungle jungley jungle gym not jungle nice yeah I and I would honestly I would we can never close doors in our house so I
would honestly love to work out some kind of like tunnel system so they can get in and out of rooms the problem is that so that then you could close doors is that yeah for my room I do have sound isolation requirements um you know and so I would that that's good real yeah yeah yeah yeah so what I was kind of thinking is maybe what we you could just get like a plug cuz the cat's whine if we close our door mhm but if we had just a hole then there would always be sound leakage
which is not better y so what I'm kind of thinking is maybe I could um G maybe I could make like a cat thing and then they could go into like a tunnel that takes them up through the attic to somewhere else on the cat thing so they could get in and out of our room oh all the time but we could just close our door so or something like that so that there wouldn't be a clear path for for sound you could make like a a baffles basically that they have to like walk through yeah yeah yeah yeah exactly I
think something like that would be cool don't worry they're not going to go up in the attic will en close it obviously come on guys give me some credit here give me some credit here um other than that like I don't know fixing the roof solar oh the light switches man because we've actually had like two days off ivonne's been learning to crochet cuz like her husband's busy playing video games I guess so time to time to go full old lady um and she's been like reaming me about our horrible
light switches cuz I need in AI to hurry up and get me those millimeter wave switches yeah I think those are the big ones they are pretty horrible yeah they are pretty horrible did you just turn off all the time next up sure um clapped K24 cord says I'm an insulator I always find it hilarious when parents soundproof their bedrooms it's a very common option yeah I mean that's considerate it's a good thing it's considerate yeah why not considerate healthy bedrooms no soundproofed the kids don't have to hear
all the fighting yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that's it yeah there you go keep family friendly well maybe so much worse so much worse literally worse L lonus luk and Dan how do the three of you individually maintain the desire and effort levels to keep working on your hobbies how do you keep pushing yourselves to be better at your jobs uh well you guys push me to be better at my job so so there's that I mean I I think we also push ourselves a lot um as for maintaining effort levels for my
hobbies do I badminton badminton I do I do I'm highly motivated to be better at it I um it's the motivation for me is that it counts as exercise so I don't feel like I'm wasting time when I'm playing badminton unless I sign up for a session that's like tournaments feel like a waste of time those are an Indulgence if I play a tournament I know that I'm playing like 20% of the time and I could have easily done a lot of other stuff in that time um but no that that's the easy tournaments is like a a
benchmark though absolutely check where you're at yeah oh dude we actually my team instead of coming eighth like last year we came ninth this year but I actually I I don't mind that result it doesn't actually feel like a downgrade especially for me personally because the only reason we're ninth is because our first match at 9:00 a.m. on the first day was the one that determined that we would have no shot at the top eight oh because the way the seating worked uh we we were seated two within our group of
four for Round Robin and we played number three and it was close their team won three games ours won two but two of the ones we lost went to Deuce which is um and one of the ones went to deuce in the third set so basically that means that's where you're tied at the end and you have to win by two yeah um so it was really close and then once that was over that very first match uh the next one was basically a walkover we played the fourth seed and like you know they tried hard and whatever but was was a
different class of Team yeah and then our our last one in our round robin was a walk over for the other team they were the top seed and I think they went on to win so basically the team that we lost barely barely two they weren't even eighth they were like higher than eighth but because we lost two in our round robin stage the best we could do was you guys were screwed yeah and then the following day we won all the way through so we came came in ninth yeah so I don't even feel that bad about it and in that
first one I won my game um I I played men's doubles and I played against the person that I lost to in my final game the previous year which was what put us in eighth instead of seventh and I won cool so so personally I felt like it was a pretty big upgrade I I played really well the only games I lost were the one that was against the team that won and one of the one of the kids that was on the other team literally plays at like a national level like currently I'm like okay whatever I got a few points I feel
good about that and then the other one I lost um I retired from uh my team had already won so we were just playing for fun and I hurt my back and that was like in a lot of pain for a week or two like that was when I was telling you I couldn't sneeze like sneezing was like incapacitating I like pulled something I also got tennis I shouldn't have played that last for fun game it was really close up until I was like guys I'm done wasn't your ankle like a little bit messed up still at that time yeah I had
to wear a brace but it didn't bother me during the tournament okay but no I was like three different parts of your body very injured um not awesome yeah and yeah oh man and to be clear I'm not going to make any excuses they won you know when you retire from the match they won I'm just saying any match I completed or was not playing someone who you know it literally is like almost Semi-Pro right I I performed really well so I was really happy with that yeah nice yeah Pains of getting old dude I hear that
100% 100% hey D we never got Luke's answer oh we didn't what was the question staying motivated for your hobbies oh um Progressive overload incremental progression I am addicted to those two concepts that's pretty much it yep getting old is going to be hard oh yeah I've I've had this like Crisis moment many times where I'm like the the thing that drives me on like everything is getting marginally better all the time and when that inverts oh no I don't know what's going
to happen in my brain well you'll a mid crisis not well set up for this yeah like I have I have self-reflected that's why they call it midlife crisis it's not midlife Happy Fun Time fair enough I I've I've been thinking like I'm going  Porsche I think I'm gonna have to try to find like like reduction of in incremental decline as something to aim for yeah and go like okay looking at the math of like averages of how people tend to decline at this age if I can beat That by this amount that's my goal so
yeah maybe I'll be slower or or lift less or not be as good or score lower whatever the metric is but if I can have that be by a lower amount than would be expected yeah just set a new Benchmark yeah I think that's going to be benk of like sucking less yeah pretty much let's go I competitive aging says pretty much this is this has been my like I've been planning for this Strat for a long time though because I'm genuinely very concerned about this you can be like that weird Brian Johnson guy oh
no you Ally just described him I guess "yeah got him you take 14,000 pills every" day um anyways okay hey D I've seen more people losing access to their steam accounts after being hacked I'm terrified of losing all my games what's the best way to protect yourself in the All Digital future don't click on anything yeah uh evidence of ownership um have good TFA set up yeah if you can contact support and be like this is clearly me then you might have a better chance I don't know I don't know yeah so
just take a picture of your driver's license and make that your steam profile sorry I couldn't even get that out don't do that don't do that but it'd be funny it would be kind of funny but yeah make make sure you have TFA TFA set up um I don't know if steam has a log out on all other systems thing does it do you know I think so I think if you log out of steam it I think yeah I'm pretty sure it does than my other or no if you change your password it it'll it'll log out of every system okay yeah uh someone
says SMS is not real tofa yeah have the the Steam app yeah y that's been good for a long time H I mean yeah the Steam app kind of sucks but no but the fact that they have yes but having it is good yes hello again parasocial friends I make training videos for the trucking industry truck stops to mechanics Etc do you think a strict structure is needed for these or would a more YouTube Style approach I guess be beneficial cut off depends if you're really good at it then a conversational casual YouTube style
approach would be great if you really need people to like if this is like for certification you know like if this is something that that needs to be covered in a in a DOT all the teas and cross all the eyes kind of way um you might be able to mix it in that case but you're still going to have to get pretty strict structure y y I agree you can you can like have fun until you get to the the the T Crossing and ey dotting section and then you need to be pretty strict for a bit to make it like
very very clear what the bounds are and then you can maybe get back to having fun hey lldd what greater benefits would emerging content creators get in float plane compared to patreon thanks for all y'all do you could make less money yeah you might like that you won't know until you've tried it uh Flo plane's more of a focus on video um I haven't looked into what patreon's done for a while on video but FL plane really is majorly focused on video to the point where it's probably not as
good of a solution if you're not a video creator and and if you're an emerging content creator that's why I specifically am talking to you it's it's not for you you need to maximize the money that you can get because you need it to eat and our Revenue split is not going to be conducive to that our platform is designed for extremely high quality video and audio and so if you are a large Creator and say for example you were looking to like white label a platform or something like that our
Revenue split is a lot more competitive like if your alternate is hiring a development team and building something yeah we're going to look Stellar yeah whereas if your alternative is like uploading unlisted videos on YouTube or vime or something and then just like has their has a native one I think they have a native one now but but the point is just like if your alternative is finding something free and sending an unlisted link to the people who to the several dozen people who follow you at
zero overhead then you should do that you know it's it's horses for courses yeah there's there's solutions for for everybody um we like Flo plane few other people on the platform seem to really like Flo plane there's also a lot of benefits to patreon the split is generally better um but it also entirely depends like if you if you set if you set your price to the right price on float plane based on how we do our costing you can get a better split than there is on patreon um most people won't
do that but it is possible because we just have sorry no I just I had a something something upside down stuck in my throat we we have uh our our costs are like fixed for creaters so if you if you balloon like if you have a super fancy expensive Omega tier um but it doesn't take any extra from us because we have a limit on our features obviously um then we don't take more so you could theoretically take more but then you're asking for a lot from your audience at that point so most people
aren't going to do it so yeah unless you have like feet pcks on there or something I don't know true we would we would I I I don't think we have anything against vpix technically and we don't really discriminate not a serious conversation we don't talk about I'm being real man I'm you don't know maybe maybe he's trying to sell this lus maybe the maybe the what would you call the top CR the the top foot is watching us what would you call the top Creator in the feet pick
category I tell you to put your foot in your mouth but the servers probably  it the big toe says UC Buffalo toe UCR buffalo in chat just one you don't you don't know maybe the big toes watching man we got to we got to make sure they know that they would be welcome here cuz we don't yeah we don't really as long as it's legal we don't  creators oh all right let's see hello Dan linnen Luke what is the average amount of versions of product go through for that's all okay product revs in
development yeah you just you got it um I I think the I think the backpack was about half a dozen each for the commuter and the original um we've been told by our suppliers that we go through an obnoxious number of product revs and it's actually caused some strain on our relationships sometimes where we'll do half a dozen product revs and just be like no it's not good enough uh they don't like to hear that if you don't go to mass production essentially they subsidize their sample production um
with the assumption that you're going to go to mass production uh from my point of view I'm like that's stupid then just tell me how much it cost to make a sample and I'll be happy to but it's not that simple right there's an opportunity cost on their side um but yeah I I would say somewhere between 4 and 7 is about where we're at on on revisions for products some a lot more like for something like the um for something like the screwdriver you know we might go through that many revisions for every
part right that many revisions for the ratchet that many revisions for the um the molds and and so the the overall number of revisions goes up like exponentially the more parts there are in a product but uh for socks for socks I think we're on like 10 or 12 or something like that I think we're close though I think we're close the the the blue samples that I've do I have them on I don't the blue samples I've been wearing recently are  good hello LL what are your thoughts on containerization I talk about my
interest in it at work all my co-workers think it's dumb what are some other cool things you guys do with it who thinks it's dumb yeah who are your co-workers yeah really your co-workers that you talk to about this know what it is and think it's dumb I don't really understand I don't know anyone in the field that thinks it's dumb genuinely zero people I've never met a single person they want the whole system to crash when like monolithic only to the point where when I was
reading this I was like wait do they mean like physical containers cuz I've I've never met a single person far be it for me to criticize someone who sent a $120 merch message but are you just like baiting us like uh maybe cuz I I don't I'm not I'm not sure if I believe you show this to your co-workers yeah what are they talking about maybe they just don't know what it is properly like maybe maybe it's more of an education problem yeah maybe they use a different term for it or something
um maybe they think you said a bad word and then aner what's a ma okay I like it what's a MAA uh in FL plane chat said Prime and Theo both complain about kubernetes and Docker yeah sure but the solutions that they like are as far as my understanding goes generally running on systems where the containerization is just detached from them it's still happening from the service provider they just don't have to deal with it themselves because they don't want to do infrastructure so they just use services
to do it which is great and popular and like I mean still containerization we use verell for for the lab's website versel is still doing containerization stuff I'm sure it's a concept it's not a it's like yeah my program is my my co-workers think programming is dumb yeah and like yeah it sucks sometimes like I I can totally understand what language why Prime and Theo might be like yeah this sucks you shouldn't like waste your time doing this as someone who's just trying
to spin up like website you should use like this this service thing like great um yeah you probably shouldn't develop your own personal store in 2025 uh because like Shopify exists and you should just use that um that doesn't mean containerization is dumb that means that you might not want to be the person who's interfacing with it depending on what you're doing um we use kubernetes to grade effect with float plane that was not the right approach for the the lab's website
um cool oh dude Nick just messaged me we have removed the discount messaging for the uh commuter bag from the Sunday and Monday releases oh wow he doesn't think they're going to make it that long oh wow that's crazy he says he thinks it's going to be gone tomorrow all right well we'll see we'll see obviously I hope he's right all right lldd my work recently banned third and personal monitors citing security concerns but always allow personal monitors work from home 2 days a week what do you think same
computer office and work from home phones are allowed on site now your co-workers are stupid I'm what I'm assuming this is an IT team currently fighting policy that's yeah you can link them to this video by the way um you can tell them that lonus says that you made them look stupid by laying out by laying out their horrible horrible policy that actually makes me question whether they are competent enough to run any sort of  technology freaking dunked actual idiots um that is not how any of that
works band Third and personal monitors so they can't have a third Monitor and they can't bring monitors and they can't bring a personal monitor okay I can understand not wanting people to bring monitors from home but you're allowed to use your personal monitor at home yeah but bringing a personal monitor into the workspace I can understand why that might be phone as a liability but not a like if you're allowed to like look security leave this at the office I don't let people bring their own lenses
and tripods monitors but but it's it's not even liability it's just like because that's stupid if you need something to do your job then the workplace should provide it it's that simple right but so it's nothing to do with security concerns if you are allowed to have your own personal phone with you everything else is out the window because that is the easiest Vector picture like what I'm going to bring a I'm going to bring a special special secret magic monitor with a Ras
pie embedded in it so I can use a HDMI RF snooping on the cable signal beam it to my spy Espionage office across the street like obviously yeah cuz there there's obviously workplaces where that shouldn't be allowed but they almost certainly also wouldn't allow you to bring phones in yes so like yeah they said they use the same PC at home so laptop okay but they're allowed a personal monitor so who cares home yeah yeah if you can have a phone you can have essentially your own computer at
work they just haven't figured it out yet is this like a have your cake and eat it too thing what like they they don't want to buy people extra monitors but they also don't want to be like that workplace that you have to bring your own monitor to so they're just like you're not allowed and also no could be maybe yeah this could be one of those things where they're just hiding behind security concerns um there's no real I mean okay there is real security concerns they're just also
ignoring all the other bigger more obvious I think I think that if they're if they want to be honest they should just say no because if other people see you with a third monitor they won't ask you if you brought it from home and they're going to whine and complain until they get a third Monitor and that's not in the budget everyone gets two monitors and I just don't feel like dealing with it that's the more honest answer probably yeah almost always there is the reason why you can't have
something nice is because someone else [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it up oh yeah almost always oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it's always so frustrating or or your workplace is a bunch of cheap butt heads it's super frustrating when you're on the like Administration side of that and you see it happening and you're like man I really wish this person would stop because if they don't stop I'm going to have to do something about this but this has worked fine for years and years and years because no one's pushed it past
this limit and then you like try to get them to stop and they just won't and then you have to kill it for everybody and it just sucks I remember having like tough conversations with you about stuff that we like can't do anymore and you're stupid I'm like trust me I know how stupid it is more than you ever will yeah yeah it's frustrating there's nothing I can do about it it's frustrating cuz like there you can you can interact in good faith in a certain way but you have to be careful about it
because other people might see it and then interact with that thing in bad faith and then it gets turned off for everybody and it's happened a bunch of times I can I know I cannot give you examples for reasons that I hope would be obvious oh here's a good one good comment from chroni I'd be willing to bet they're using monitoring software and it has a TW monitor limit so for the work from home setup it's a laptop with only one display out that's a good hypothesis I like it I like
it I mean the fact that you have your phone still is like stupid or whatever it says personal sighting CER but allows personal monitors work from home two days a week they might have a way of  okay I don't know that is interesting though why are you so popular today I don't know he's so popular all right hit me Dan sure I was just waiting for the interruption to stop Hi lus and hi lus and luk I would like to game single co-op games from my PC to my living room TV there are around 60 ft apart how would
you guys solve this Optical HDMI cable and probably um a USB over ethernet adapter we showed USB 2 ones that are cheap like like 10 15 bucks cheap that can easily do that distance uh that's that would be the the highest Fidelity way the low Fidelity but probably easier way with less wiring would be to just use stream so have a thin client and just use like steam in home streaming or whatever they've rebranded it to steam link or whatever they call it now what tech were you most sad to see
flop or fall out of fashion I really wish phones with physical keyboards were still improved and made mainstream uh hold on before we move on UCR Buffalo says why not HDMI to ethernet adapters too because by the time you do that you've added all of the cost and complexity of an optical cable except you're paying for copper now fiber is actually cheaper by the foot um it's just the media conversion that's expensive so if you're going to have media conversion a lot of the time
unless you need to be able to service it in the field like if you're doing Live Events or something like that um there's no reason to use um like like HDMI over ethernet instead of just HDMI over fiber um also a lot of the HDMI over ethernet stuff is not like 4K 120 whereas you can get fiber optic HDMI cables that that will allow you to do the full HDMI 2.1 no not any lag difference that I'm aware of it's just just doesn't make sense like in the home okay sorry uh what were you most
sad to see flop or fall a fashion I mean 3D is on my mind so I'm going to go I'm going to go with that I'm going to go with that because I've seen some glasses free 3D that's like really good like we could have gotten there we just the content's not there anymore this person said physical keyboards on phones I don't agree with that but I do agree with physical key inputs practically everywhere else um there are some good Solutions like I'm assuming the one in your car is right it's okay but actually
almost everything else is trash especially things public things that are touchcreen just like I don't like touching them and occasionally you get ones that have like good rejection and I can't use my knuckle on them cuz I don't want to touch them with my fingy tips yeah like I was a germaphobe before it got cool in 2020 I don't like touching things I don't like shaking hands like one year I stopped shaking hands at CES and immediately I stopped getting trade show illness yeah I do the same thing
now okay brilliant um I I you used to be able to press physical buttons with like your keys or something yeah and now now you have to touch screen and tons of them are terrible so you have to do the input like a billion times and one of the nice things about physical Keys is that they almost always do actually work yeah and with touchcreen keys it's often not a very good indicator of if it actually worked or not says your oh my God okay that's going to defeat the purpose of using my
knuckles in the first place for things you could spit on it you could Hawk to it um touch it there's a reference that makes me old I guess probably very slow uh anyways yeah physical buttons on on random things I think high-end touch screens having physical having touchcreen buttons is fine so phones is fine there's probably some cars that are fine but there's also some cars where it's terrible um but in general just like physical buttons would be better yeah Japan does this super well by the
way a lot of their stuff is still physical buttons and it's very nice I still think their train ticket kiosks could be improved I regardless of button type but I like the buttons I'm working my dream job at a big Tech data center nice the work is fulfilling and amazing but there are moral implications to working for a major tech company oh so he works for Amazon do you have advice for my moral conflict there's lots of other data centers you could work at also um could be worse you could work for an
evil company like lus Media Group who didn't tell anybody true about honey yeah dry dry your tears with money that helps some amount of it's like you got to survive yourself slash ass and a lot of people will put their own as I sort of am right now we'll put own making sure making sure yall are up to speed on that on you so you have to decide where your line is um your line is Oh myness um get it line is less anyways I get it um it's just not funny yeah fair enough no no I missed I missed it I missed it I I
didn't do it inten I was busy waiting for I was busy waiting for chat to actually for the people that didn't hear the segment earlier on the honey stuff to be like OMG is that what he really said about it yeah for those of you who weren't watching earlier what we said was hey we don't really um know what you're talking about we didn't know almost any of this stuff at the time and we dropped the sponsor years ago if you're mad that's great you should be mad be mad at honey be mad at their
parent company PayPal yeah yeah I I don't there there seems to be a perception out there that like what you invest in and the job that you have should have zero reflection on you at all and I don't completely agree with that I understand that sometimes you're in a life situation where like you just don't have another option luxury of just like taking a stand yeah and that's so that's one thing and I am not shooting at that at all but I will say for myself I've had extremely lucrative potential
job offers that I have not wanted to take because of where they were at and I didn't take them so like it's not impossible and like I I've heard must have been awful I mean you were here and we and we didn't and we didn't make a video about honey um so like I don't know there there's it's it's possible I also know people that had very good solid jobs and then took a job somewhere that they didn't like the company and complain about it all the time and I'm like this is entirely your fault are you just
calling me out or yeah the prime example is Dan uh have you been reading my blog U but yeah like I don't know you should you should care at least a little bit if it's your only option it's your only option I'm not trying to dig you for that you got to you got to put food on the table but um you know if you have a range of options life isn't just about making more and more money 100% of the time in my opinion yes it is which is why I never made a video about honey because yeah because you had some
form of financial gain there right yeah for sure yeah for sure it's not that honey was stealing my money losing the AdSense on that video is was very financially beneficial to you you mean the uh you mean the affiliate Revenue no on on the on the video oh yeah for sure yeah not making that money and also not exposing someone who was stealing from me yeah yeah that was definitely my motivation you really lined your pockets you got it dude the number of times that I see people be like how is
it that lus spend so much money on this but he couldn't afford $500 to test something they're so close they're so close to the answer they just need a little nudge oh man they're almost there it's almost like they're nothing to do with each other all right next up hello I love being an internet personal I'm amazed if you haven't just lost  it see these These are crazy eyes he hides it well on camera at least hello from the I beat him off camera watch him cower where the hell's
D this is me cowering I don't know why it's pointing over there why is it so dark you've let me down for the last time Dan pointing the camera in the wrong place don't make me throw things at you again which I have actually done and Luke has yeah yeah Luke actually almost hit him that one time did I I think so yeah oh nice you threw an entire CPU Cooler at me probably had it coming me yeah actually did when Luke threw something at it that was actually extremely warranted so
yeah I think I apologized is it victim blaming if the victim blames thems I think so no that was actually that Stockholm syndrome or something not okay the other times have been unwarranted that one was like and to be fair I threw like a small little coaster it was that's right yeah yeah uh hello from the Netherlands to lonus do you have any motorcycle specific Tech you love if I may what bike do you ride I have an SV 650s it's a 2003 but what bike I ride well none because it's in pieces and has for two
years I'm G I'm going to do it this time I'm going to do it this time this be rusty no I'll be fine yeah I took a long time off before and it's like whatever  bike I don't really have any motorcycle specific Tech I I use a pebble for track changing cuz it has physical buttons sure does and you got gloves on okay makes sense time and place for physical buttons and on the motorbike is definitely one of them yeah oh no what did we both click archive at exactly the same time and accidentally archive two cards
nice nice so weird my chat's not up updating so I missed everything that uh chat had  live just give me a sec here let me see if I can find it no I won't Anonymous asks lonus what was your favorite game server or Community back when you were younger what's your favorite memory from there uh I well I mean it's got to be the NC gaming server shout out death Hawk you know who you are all for me I'm GNA answer this anyways even though I wasn't asked playing that Left 4 Dead playing that
TF2 let's go no lifing it I think it was Halo 2 oh yeah used to play a bunch with some dude named Utah kushia which I've never been able to find again sorry that's pretty good um but we used to yeah I used to be a part of a community on there it was it was mostly myself and Utah Crusher but there was some other people involved as well where we would just try to glitch everything we try to glitch out of maps um um we figured out that the the rocket to sword switch thing I think that was literally
us um and there there was there was a bunch of other cool things too there's whatever the name of the map was was really really small it was a Covenant Ship there's a floating platform in the floating platform in the middle um we the platform is a penis it's really small have you just you've been spending too much time in this pool I've been spending too little time sleeping I think that's it um and we spent we spent way too much time cuz we were kids but um getting these containers to go all the way up
the ramps to where the floating platform was and we had to time it perfectly we screwed it up a few times but if you so you're saying you put a box on the penis kind of nice yeah two boxes two box wow yeah same time that was actually the whole that was a very important part of the equation the physics of this sounds painful it's tough difficult okay I'm sorry what was the what what does it do we got the boxes all the way up the ramp and then we had to get them on the floating platform at the same time and
that would slam the floating platform in the ground which would horrifically glitch the whole map out and it was amazing we only able to do it once nice we're probably the only people that did it I'm assuming cuz it took forever and it was really really stupid I forgot about that really fun gaming session you and I had taking the warthog plac it wasn't supposed to go that was a blast that's everything I love about FL uh almost just said flow plane uh everything I love about Halo is just
breaking Halo in horrific ways nice yeah well there's also the music music music is pretty good oh so good care for a diagram I I could I could do like a horrible paint drawing but I really don't think it's worth it  it what cool well thanks for tuning in to the W show find what the the message we were looking for that's the one he read it he beat me to it oh what that was there on my dashboard yeah it was  what all right we'll see you again next week same B Time same bad  bye so this is what gaslighting
is well then no it's not damn it you're wrong there's a leak and if you're wrong you deserved it like how it gas lighting's not real y crazy if it is you made it up oh man
