hey there everybody Welcome to a chilled out relaxed W show so smooth we've got a great show lined up for you guys today we're going to be talking about Apple's iPhone 16 glow Time Event the PlayStation 5 Pro announcement Luke we also have some good news in this week in Ai and we're going to be talking about how the US government is pushing for greater VPN access they're pushing for greater VPN access I think it's a good thing it's smooth MH Goes Down Easy just like this intro to our intro uh 
yeah the show is brought to you today by manscaped The Ridge and acronis along with our chair partner secret lab and our laptop partner LG why don't we jump right into our first topic which is of course that I was wrong this week yeah twice yeah now I assume that you have watched literally nothing nope I assume you know I mean I don't think there are any two Tech products that you could care less about than the iPhone and the PlayStation yep yeah so why don't I catch you up on exactly what happened  uh
wow it's been 3 minutes and we've already thrown something at our producer  talking why don't we what do you want to start with should I should I catch you up on the iPhone or should I Let's do let's do the iPhone okay so Apple announced the iPhone 16 lineup so you got the 16 the 16 plus the 16 Pro and  honestly I'm not obsessed with Apple's lineup and figuring out exactly what it is I'll look at it when I need to and I'll refresh myself but other than that it honestly isn't something that I pay
that close attention to but this time around and this made people pretty angry I was approaching the iPhone announcement event from a bit of a different perspective so I feel like and and what happened was our video ended up having a pretty positive overall spin on it when largely the reaction from the tech press and and sort of influencer army out there was pretty negative but I'd like to explain why so first of all let's talk about what makes the Iphone 16 lineup new uh they're getting the new
a18 processor family so we have a regular a18 in the iPhone 16 and then an A8 Pro in the iPhone 16 Pro um as far as we can tell from Apple's comparative benchmarks like they didn't compare both of these new processors to one single predecessor they compared them to different things oh and if you do the math from previous Apple presentations they seem like they're probably pretty close so it it looks like they're very it looks like they're very similar in terms of the at least
CPU performance GPU performance and neural processor performance but all of this is going to become more clear as time goes on um the there's uh there's upgraded glass so their ceramic Shield is is now significantly stronger um I actually don't have a I don't have a summary of the specs in my notes which I normally have when I run through something like this so we'll have to kind of figure that out but uh the things that really stood out to me were actually not necessarily the hardware oh there's a
new there's a new button there's like a programmable button yeah which is kind of cool action button which which I kind of like was that ever a thing in the past um on the iPhone I I read some comments of people talking about like oh they took the button away so that they could give it back to us now and I was like what I mean they had the home button okay but that wasn't they a button actually but was on the 15 was on the 15 Pro but now it's on the regular 16 so so that's just okay so so there
were there were a few things that people were pretty pretty the camera and the camera button is new across the board okay so we have a dedicated shutter button but no no iPhone in the past has ever had a shutter button okay so there were a couple of things that people were pretty upset about and one of them was that in the video I said that I was probably going to go because I've been talking about switching to an iPhone for a little bit for a while now and I think I'm just I'm overdue um and there's a
lot of things about iOS 18 that are looking very compelling to me and there's some there's some Android um there's some Android Army members who are telling me that these aren't new features to Apple or that they're copied from Android or that uh they don't make that much of a difference or whatever uh but the reality of it is that to me like the phone operating system that I use doesn't really matter and I don't really care who's copying from each other realistically Google and apple cop copy
liberally from at this point and and it doesn't matter to me where it originated from what matters to me is that I need a new device right now and the iPhone 16 lineup actually looks pretty compelling um I think that's kind of the root of where your thoughts on this stuff came from was that you need a new device and you're on an old one um and I I think you and I even talked about this I don't remember but I a lot of people that are unhappy with the event it's because they
have a current generation device and they're looking at the upgrade and going this doesn't really seem like a lot but we're at I mean it's called iPhone 16 the jumps per generation is going to slow down phones have been boring for a long time now and the the way I'm kind of looking at it is you can be disappointed quite genuinely every single generation or you can start shifting your goalposts a little bit and look like one or two generations back for your improvement jumps and I think it's
going to be more than one or two I think realistically what this comes down to is that the the days of us getting something major to upgrade to every single generation not only are they dead but they've been dead for a long time I completely agree I've been over it for a few years now at the very least um and so I um I I guess that was and the amount of speculation that we were paid by Apple to have kind of a positive spin guys anytime you someone who accuses us of being paid by Apple to be positive
about Apple products you can immediately just dismiss invited to the event no of course not yeah apple still the extent of Apple's media relationship with me up until now is that they emailed me once aren't they kind of cool with Mac address oh I don't know if they are uh no one has kept me up to date on it okay I know I'm not sure maybe but as far as as far as I am concerned and as far as the LT channel is concerned Apple has never so much has never gone past scheduling a conference
call with me they never actually went through with the call it did get scheduled but it was cancelled minutes before we actually went through with engaging for the first time Apple has has no interest um in working together with me so so so people were mad about a number of things they were mad because we they felt we were overly positive about the event um and I think that a big part of that comes down to that difference in perspective where most of the rest of the tech media where if they're running
a 15 Pro now or a 15 Pro Max are looking at this going uh boring yeah you know where's the Innovation apple and I think they just have to get used to the idea that that's going to happen over a much longer cycle whereas I'm looking at it going man my airpods Pro 2os just got way better like ages after I bought them which I'm pretty stoked on I didn't even know that was a thing that sounds great it's a kind of behavior that what feature are you gaining um for me personally not much they're optimizing
the noise cancellation they're adding some like and this is retroactive to what you have now yeah it looks like it's like uh some kind of machine learning assisted uh quickly switching in between transparency mode for conversations and everything back that looked really cool yep um it's something that absolutely exists in other products but my assumption is that based on how well Apple has handled active noise C canellation it will actually be implemented pretty well and I might
actually use it um they're also adding like hearing aid like functionality to to airpods um I've been using them as casual hearing protection for a long time but they are more formally talking about using them that way with the improved active noise cancellation if you cancel out a wave the wave is cancelled no I was I was think you you mentioned hearing aid and then noise protection both and I I thought you were saying those were the same for a second not the same you're talking about
different stuff okay um so I just I thought that was pretty cool I actually opened the video on like a software update essentially and I think a lot of people were kind of surprised to see that the other thing that people kind of went after me for was that I told them my intention was to go with the iPhone 16 uh plus the nonpr and and a lot of the feedback that I got on that was l you know if you're going to go into the Apple ecosystem for the first time in a long time you should be having the full
experience but the reality of it is guys like I can pick any iPhone I want like we we're ordering all of them through work I just literally grab off the shelf whichever one I am I I want to use but the reason that I went with the iPhone 16 or iPhone 16 plus I haven't actually 100% decided which one I want I'm going to hold them first is that I don't think people should be buying the pro don't get me wrong I don't know what the difference is there's features on the pro that I would like to have the
regular iPhone 16 still doesn't have a high refresh rate display oo yeah 60 HZ which for like $800 hey pretty embarrassing um but most of the other stuff that's and but then again neither does the device that I am upgrading from I I it feels nice I have a higher fresh rate screen now I can feel it it does but I guess what I've discovered is for my phone I don't know if I I don't game on my phone it does make touch feel more responsive I can absolutely instantly tell if I'm using a high refresh rate
device and things like uh higher pulling rates on the touch input it definitely makes a difference but I think I have just become not that much of a power user and a lot of the other features on the pro I just don't need them the studio quality microphone 4K 120fps recording I don't need that stuff it's got another I think it's got another camera I know man the iPhone's ability to film and log makes video on iPhone extremely interesting sure but I'm not using it professionally this is
just my phone do I need to shoot 4K 120 on it like I can they added I could see it they added Pro res recording to the non-pro so if I just want to record in Pro res and I don't need 12 frames per second is there ever like you you never want to shoot like a little slow-mo thing of of your son uh playing binton or something like that I don't know true do I need it at 4K oh it's four okay so you could still 4K yeah oh yeah I can still do high I can still do high frame rate I just sheesh yeah it's it's just
it's a lot um people are saying okay yeah the uh the liar the lar is great you know what that is great I I don't take that many pictures and the handful of features that need the depth sensing I can I I know enough people that I can borrow a phone from like there's been I think it's come up twice uh once when I had to do a facial scan for that VR headset the big screen Beyond and once when I was um a bit part when I had a bit part in an undisclosed film that I don't know if it's ever even
going to get made at this point I haven't heard back about it in a while um whatever anyway I wonder if part of it sorry I used it to scan the room that I was in because that was useful for them for VFX like overlays I wonder if part of this is people that can you pre-order yet I I think we've placed our orders did they set up pre-orders I actually don't know that's a minor detail I procurement will take care of that yeah yeah yeah way to go it's nice um uh what was I going to say uh I I
wonder if some of this is people that bought the pro that are yes you can you can pre-order it I wonder if this is people that bought the pro that um you know want The Tech Guy to make the same decision they did I do think there's a lot of that and the and I can see why they would want to because it's "$1,500 Canadian Canadian this is" Canadian so it starts at I believe 12200 us um and it is funny it is funny to me seeing how many people are legitimately angry at me like I've betrayed Max is
1750 because I'm because I'm using an iPhone um the pro Max is what my car cost not my current one yeah I was going to say surely that's not right no my my first car sorry you're getting older your first car was a minute ago you might have to have some inflationary adjustments which we'll be talking about a little bit later um it's still a lot of money yeah I mean we're and so I was realistically I was looking at the iPhone 16 going okay is this really do I need a titanium
phone or is aluminum probably okay are you going to end up that one's not in a case are you going to put it in a case anyways no I'm not going to put it in a case okay but like it's aluminum and dude their glass is like very shatter resistant so I'm I'm really not that worried about it I used to be no case I was no case in my previous phone this phone's so huge that I decided to get a case for it anyways because I was like I feel like it's just going to get knocked off of things more
often cuz it's enormous and I'm happy I have one look at this there's a massive bite out of that corner oh wow yeah you really hit that one yeah she uh that case is doing work and it it is actually it's it's been dropped a couple times but something that's kind of nice about it is that I just don't care because I don't even like the phone nice but I don't want to replace it so there's a case on it but I don't care for it if makes sense so it's just like a whatever yep which is a nice
uh it's nice to just not worry about it another difference for the for the pro is that the bezels are slightly smaller so in about the same form factor they're the screens are 0 2 inches bigger I did but then if I cared that much about that why would I get an iPhone with like a you know giant forehead notch in it in the first place like I I I don't know guys I mean feel free feel free to like come at me and let me know but I think that people should probably just be getting the regular 16 if they if they
want an iPhone if they want the ecosystem and it's funny to me how we get so stuck in our Tech bubble and we get so stuck in our sort of um in our priorities that sometimes we forget that most people don't care most people cannot tell a 60 HZ display from a high refresh rate display are also only looking to upgrade their phones when their battery life starts to annoy them too much which is usually every like 3 years or or more like my battery life didn't really start getting bad on this
until about the last year or so and I believe this is up to I believe this is six years old probably depends on their usage like if they game a lot so they're doing some really brutal battery Cycles um then it's going to be sooner if they don't later etc etc um nokki asks you often say you prefer a phone where you can take photos and videos of kids important moments would the iPhone 16's shutter button be a good addition for you um I never need to be that quick on the draw like as
long as I've got a gesture that I can activate in a reasonable amount of time and the onscreen button is there in a reasonable amount of time like I am I'm so well adjusted now to the ergonomics of holding my phone so that my thumb is here for the shutter button I just the value of a of a dedicated Hardware button for that for me is extremely low extremely low there's still things that I'm super not impressed about I mean the fact that Apple's base storage is still 128 gigs I
was just going to talk about that because on devices that cost like a flipping ton of money the fact that storage upgrades cost so $300 to go from 512 gigs to 1 tab is we did the math Luke crazy Apple literally charges so much that their  gold literally we got no I'm serious we we we grabbed some pieces of the golden controller and we compared them to like like like nand chips and like we like we did the math and like how much gold it was to weigh as much as like Apple's
nand chips and like wait for wait apple apple storage and memory cost as much as gold was this for a video yeah I was going to say why would you need the pieces from the gold we it was I believe it was from the just weigh the other one and then look up gold value I believe it was uh I believe well yeah but we had the gold so we could do it pH that's why I said is it for a cuz if it's for a video then it's a cool visual thing anyways yeah so it was it it was it was freaking hilarious right though because
it's it's crazy it's like when you compare printer ink to you know yeah uh Chanel Number whatever you know like like these obscenely valuable liquids funny enough I watched that video oh the like printer video yeah I watched that you're one of the very few who did it was I didn't watch yeah the how' you like it I was actually it was pretty good yeah I didn't know about the whole tank thing and stuff and there was one really mad comment that was saying everyone knows you should just get an older laser
printer I had a bunch of up votes I get these questions all the time and it's like um like genuinely um no no no no no no no they were like everyone knows like like our Our advice was bad they didn't get to the part of the video where we talked about that oh oh very cool I can't I can't help people I can't help them um any any who so I'm I'm kind of excited to try it even though I'm definitely going to have some issues um I don't think that having USB 2 speeds is going to bother me that much
dayto day I very rarely offload I noticed Plex why USB 2 speeds on the 16 nonpr it's USB 2 even though it's USBC like look there's absolutely stuff that is going to make me mad but how often do when's the last time you offloaded  USB uh yeah that's fair when's the last time you connected your phone to a computer via USB oh decently often okay to transfer files though no okay so who cares yeah who cares I do think it's interesting do they have any color overlap oh black and white okay okay
Crystal asks will you miss your S Pen the answer is absolutely yeah I have become I've gone from why are they taking up space in my in my note with this stupid pen to whenever I want it I really want it predominantly for marking up screenshots why don't you get a new note is it just Apple time yeah I could it's just time Apple time yeah it's just time um so so basically I think that's what it boils down to and you know what the last part I think is is I mean we've talked about this on the W show so you
guys will kind of be familiar with this already but I'm so tired of negativity yeah it's like why do we have to compare it to last year's iPhone 15 and say it's not enough what do you mean it's not enough if it's not enough then keep your iPhone 15 yeah that's totally fine that's go for it maybe even good that's good you're just yeah who cares if if anything I would actually now that our our mobile processors especially apples are fast enough to do pretty much whatever we could need to do on our
phone reasonably speaking I would actually love to see less frequent upgrades and longer software support or you know whatever that looks like because you got to remember apple is driven somewhat differently from other phone manufacturers they are a lot less motivated by the initial sale of the iPhone to be clear oh they're happy to grab it though they're happy to take your money yeah but they are far more motivated by the size of the iOS ecosystem and the number of people that are buying stupid men um
he' on picked up word Scapes um like the mobile like yeah like word crossword spelling d jumble thing um and I've been playing with her sometimes dude dude the lengths that they go we're both getting into playing Boomer games with our partners what is happening I play the New York Time games with with or whatever is yeah those things and you play word Scapes yeah how the Mighty Fall nice I know right we we used to be true Gamers I used to play Left 4 Dead too with my posture like this boys oh boy keep
going I heard that yeah so so so we've been playing wordscapes lately dude the length that they go to to extract money from you oh I'm sure Apple gets a piece of every one of those transactions at the end of the day the most important thing to you is that you're on an iPhone not necessarily that you were on the latest iPhone but that you were on an iPhone because the bigger the install base is the more of that sweet sweet App Store money they're extracting from you and the more incentivized app developers
are to continue to prioritize the iOS platform form so I forget where I was going with this what was my last reason I forget it doesn't matter let's talk about the PlayStation 5 Pro announcement this was a little more recent so I'm going to remember all the details a little bit better but in a nutshell Sony upgraded the GPU I was a little surprised oh we also get Wi-Fi 7 uh higher based storage um I'm trying to think if there's if there's anything else that was really upgraded going from the PS5
to the PS5 Pro and I don't think so there there were some things I was a little surprised by uh I didn't expect the CPU to stay Zen 2 yeah already when the PS5 came out I remember it I remember feeling like oh yeah it makes sense that it's Zen 2 because the development cycle for this is so long that it would have had to be but boy would it ever have been nice if they you know if the dev kits were all Zen 2 and was like Zen 3 for the real product you know um so I I was a little surprised to
see Zen 2 stick around but it also kind of makes sense um wait hold on what's going on here okay hold on we'll get to the PS5 Pro in a second uh shraf to in flo plane chat says lonus this is such a disconnected take when a product cost "$1,200 and there's no improvement to" justify it that's when we should be negative this is a consumer protection issue no no a consumer a consumer protection issue would be if Apple tells you it's something that it isn't yeah a consumer protection issue would be if Apple
deactivates your iPhone 15 Pro and forces you to buy an iPhone 16 Pro you are not compelled to buy this this is not food it's not shelter it's not water it's a iPhone but if you have a a 15 or especially like a 15 Pro you don't need a new phone yeah which is not a bad thing like like the that that's the biggest take from the event from me is that you don't need it and I'm I am certain honestly it might have even already happened because I just don't care that much because I'm
not going to upgrade my phone yeah uh but whatever new pixel announcement I'm not upgrading to it so like I don't even really care what it is what I'm looking for is going to end up being like the pixel 10 or 11 yeah when that launches I'm going to be evaluating that versus whatever iPhone is launching at the same time in comparison to the phone that I currently have and deciding am I going to get a battery replacement or am I going to buy one of these phones and then I'm interested in it so basically
back to back to my point of us being more focused on like the the positive aspects remember too guys this isn't a review this is a summary of a product announcement so obviously I'm going to talk about the highlights why do I want to drag myself down why do I want to drag everything down by dwelling on the negative and at the end of the day if it's not a big enough upgrade over last gen well that's fine because Apple's not targeting last gen they're not selling it to last gen the question is not the
"question is not is $1,200 compelling" enough for someone who already owns an iPhone 15 Pro that's a stupid question "because it's not $1,200 it's $1,200" minus whatever you could sell your 15 Pro for that's the actual value and that I don't know that's up to you I have no idea what they're worth in the secondary Market that you you can go figure that "out the question is is $1,200 worth it" for someone who needs a phone and so I think that's the difference and it looks like just on the
surface to me like it looks like yeah probably that's the difference in perspective that I want to start approaching things with is as someone who is the actual target market for for this product okay so let's go back to the PS5 Pro so the main things are it's got a better GPU similar architecture which again surprised me because we got to remember this this product launched four four years ago I think it works out to right PS PS5 came out in 2020 PS5 release the uh PS5 no not not the slim or was it
2022 yeah November November 2020 was when the PS5 launched so four years later I was kind of expecting you know I don't know Zen 3 at the very least um I was expecting an architectural change to the GPU but then as I was sort of working through the script with David I was like no it actually makes sense because from Sony's perspective the most important thing because this is a midcycle refresh that realistically they aren't going to sell a ton of yeah especially if you compare this to base
ps5s or or PS4s right these Pro Models are for their more affluent customers they're for their more the more Discerning console gamer right you know sips te like this right who who can who can definitely see the difference in the pixels or you know realistically who can see the higher higher refresh higher frame rates um so making sure that developers have continuity between the regular model and between the pro model is way more important than squeezing a little bit more performance out of it um
Wi-Fi 7 I think is actually a pretty important upgrade that is maybe not being talked about enough especially by us um like we turned that video around extremely quickly and so there were a couple things that I think weren't necessarily wrong but are things that I would probably want to do differently to go back I would talk about Wi-Fi 7 and especially in the PlayStation ecosystem where you might have a PS portal and your PlayStation 5 Pro is not connected via Ethernet having Wi-Fi 7
and a Wi-Fi 7 router even if your PS portal doesn't support Wi-Fi 7 which it doesn't because it's a PS portal um it would be better to have a stronger connection between the PS5 Pro and your router it's it's still it's still better the the better every Link in the chain can be the better off you're going to be so Wi-Fi 7 is something I would have talked about more I also would have more explicitly talked about the lack of a disc drive uh that was something that we just we kind of glossed over in at the
very beginning we had a bit where you know by the time you buy a stand and I think David and I had talked about how the visual should also have the disc drive and it should just like add up the whole price and compare it to a thing cuz we we said something along the lines of like by the time you buy a disc drive this thing costs darn near twice as much as a base model PlayStation or costs about twice or I forget exactly how we worded it and I probably would have expanded on that more later uh because I
think that people were pretty upset when they felt like we were justifying the price when we talked about how it wasn't Sony's most expensive console ever that Crown actually corrected for inflation goes to the PS3 uh which came out at 599 but that was back in man when the PS3 come out like 2002 oh boy I'm going to get this wrong 2006 okay so that came out way back in 2006 I said I'd touch on inflation quite a few people were really upset that we made a with inflation comparison to the PS3
and I'd like to explain why we did that and the reason they were upset was because and and I get this people are sick of seeing a price Justified today because of inflation well it's reasonable for it to be $700 because if you compare that to $500 for the PS3 inflation arily they're very similar in fact that that was more dollars back then but that wasn't what we were saying we weren't trying to justify the price in fact the very open scaled with inflation I'll get to yes
I'll get to that we weren't trying to justify the price though what we were saying was there's a precedent for this that's what we were saying this isn't their most expensive console is that like one of the communication things that you would have wanted to change I would have wanted to clarify that um and I can see why people are upset about it because yeah their wages haven't flipping scaled with inflation the buying power of that much money is not the same even if it's the same inflationary wise
exactly however something that I feel like a lot of people Overlook in stuff like this is that the costing of a product from a company from a consumer electronics company like Sony is contingent on their costs for their sourcing do you think Sony makes power supplies does Sony have a power supply manufacturing plant do you think it's that I I think it's more there's no competition really in the space we talk about that but I I just want to I just want to talk about the importance why
this inflation number matters Sony buys power supplies from light on and those power supplies cost more now than they used to yeah because commodity prices have gone up in inflation yeah um do you  microprocessors no no do you think Sony has their own Iron mins where they get iron to make steel if we were talking about Samsung maybe who knows they do everything that's true but we're not but Sony no uh Sony manufactured dram noes Sony is their designer but they don't actually
manufactur just about any of the of the raw of the raw materials of a PlayStation 5 like certainly they're doing board assembly and just like M hop pointed out in phe chat fab time is huge right now fab time is crazy right now ran Maan says I saw a chart yesterday that showed how much tsmc is essentially gouging companies due to manufacturing capacity and it's rough and that was why the second thing I said was microprocessors yeah Sony doesn't make microprocessors we are we are in an
environment right now where there is an effective Monopoly on cuttingedge node microprocessors um as much as it's been kind of hilarious for people who ate hate Intel many of whom are Justified to watch them struggle with the roll out of their Fab business we should be rooting for them because Samsung has proven time and time again that they're just not going to catch tsmc here's a hot take then again so has Intel I'm surprised they're as cheap as they are with how few people can make 
place I think we're lucky that they're not making it way worse and maybe they're not making it way worse because they know other companies would then have more opport opportunity to spring into the space and they would rather there's less people competing so they're happy to take their really significant significant cut that they are but they have an effective Monopoly on Cutting Edge chips and the fact that they're not like just astronomically more expensive is I think were yeah I remember seeing a
quote from I think it was tsmc's chairman or something like that basically making the observation that Nvidia is sure charging a lot for these AI processors yeah yeah I don't remember that quote but I know what you're talking about yeah like huh we could take more of that because who else is going to make it nobody no one no one like they they could they could effectively charge you know there's limits to this but practically anything for certain product lines that like you
know a government is not going to just not buy it yep so like I I don't know I think yeah I think the fact that you can buy go out and buy a very respectable super solid CPU for your computer for like 100 bucks is and it's from a monopoly that you're also going through middlemen for is wild like yeah I don't know yeah so I think um they're cheap because they're a lost leader you buy the console uh and Sony gets the licenses when you sell the games they have no competition right now yeah but
you don't decide that that too that's not up to you yeah and when there is no competition there's no real reason for them to do that yep and who's who's competing with the PlayStation 5 Pro right now Microsoft yeah no yeah not even a little bit my my understanding is the rumor is that Microsoft has actually canned their mid generation refresh I don't know if that will end up being true or if that's even or if that's even the recent Rumor Mill um but Sony is effectively competing
against absolutely nobody and what they're selling is an experience that only has a value to those few who value it and back to our conversation about the about the iPhone because I think that in both cases a lot of the criticism of our coverage came down to the same thing guys Sony is not selling PlayStation 5 owners a $700 upgrade Sony is selling people who want to buy a console a $700 console and if you want a disc version yeah you're going to have to pay another 80 bucks for an add-on for an add-on
disc drive dude the writing's been on the wall for game discs forever I I think this is you think the last generation with thises man I hope not yeah I hope not me too no I think we're going to get one more I think PlayStation 6 has a disc drive but I think that it is I think that it is it moves to this add-on model that we have now and I think they deemphasize it extremely heavily and then I don't think PlayStation 7 has one um okay sorry what was I saying right so they're so right so so they're selling a
$700 PlayStation to someone who wants a PlayStation 5 but like a bit better and if you were have a PlayStation 5 and you were going to upgrade to it you wouldn't be paying $700 you would be selling your PlayStation 5 and you'd be paying whatever the difference is so you'd probably get a few hundred bucks for your PS5 and you'd pay $400 or whatever which if we're being realistic four years into this product's life cycle it's not a ridiculous amount of money I wouldn't pay it no I have
personally never bought a PlayStation that's not true you never bought a current gen PlayStation no I've never bought a PlayStation I was given a PlayStation 2 a you were given that yeah I own it darn it but I didn't buy it all right fair enough cuz I knew you had one yeah I got a PS2 all right Fair thought I got you no it was a gift um um okay so question I'm jumping off topic from PlayStation do you have anything else to say about PlayStation no just uh just we're evaluating it from the perspective of
someone who's interested in buying it and I think that's something that our viewers are just going to have to get used to we are not evaluating it from the perspective of someone who hates consoles and thinks they're stupid yeah um and we're and we're going to be realistic like it was I don't know I it was it's tough seeing people say yeah it's easy for a you know it's easy for someone like you to come down and millionaire explain to us why cost so much but you're just out of touch it's
like well okay but if someone else said it would it be would it be more true the information doesn't change or less true because what it really boils down to is that there's about 200 250 bucks worth of GPU and SSD upgrade in this thing stop millionaire explaining to me and it costs about 200 250 bucks more kind of depending on how you want to do the math yeah it's like and they're going to make money off it cuz they have no competition so that's what companies do and it's like
uh and and we're not I'm not I'm not being an apologist I'm not saying I'm not saying it's good I'm just saying it is um sorry yeah um the the whole iPhone thing a comment that I saw a few times after we moved off the topic was that uh we were ignoring negatives in the video that you did for the iPhone thing yeah did you mention anything about how like you know it's cool whatever but it might not make sense for you to upgrade if you're on 15 I just thought that was obvious okay
I did not I did not mention that it might not make sense to upgrade from the 15 that wasn't my perspective um and I think this comes back to a point that you've kind of been hammering on for a while we don't need everyone to have that perspective oh yeah for sure if you want that perspective you should be watching a video from someone who has an iPhone 15 Pro I don't if you are seriously considering this thing I would watch I I would value personally like actually completely detaching myself as
much as possible um I would value seeing your video because it's a different take and then I would watch a range of other videos that also have other takes and then I would find where my opinion is on it somewhere in the middle or whatever um maybe I align perfectly with someone who knows but like you you you figure out where it is but I I don't personally even want a reality where every single piece of content on a product is exactly the same because if that happens there
will only be one reviewer left yeah and and there's eventually people will stop watching all the other ones there's no value to it wants that this is a funny thing um I often get asked by up-and-comers or people who want to start a tech Channel you know like do you have any advice on on like you know my style like what can I do to make my videos more like you and I'm like you don't yeah make your own you should have your own ideas you should have your own perspectives however much the audience
is going to yell at you for not exactly copying what everyone else does in the long term it's better they'll value it and and the proof is in the pudding my perspectives my takes have changed over the years and that's not flip-flopping that's being open to new information and new ideas and New Perspectives theoretically if you follow the scientific method your your stances on things should change with new information you should be trying to have the most accurate one you can and I I
did mention some negative things like I mentioned that uh you can get cheap Android phones that have high refresh rate displays when I talked about the 60 HZ display on the nonpr I mentioned that I would miss side loing and that I would probably still need to have an Android device handy like I did acknowledge issues it's not like I'm just trying to yeah it's it's not like I'm just trying to like be an apple apologist all of a sudden I'm never going to get an invite to one of their events that's never
going to happen and like honestly it really just doesn't matter anymore I don't know if you want go it would be so much more work to make the same video that I would make in my basement yeah cuz you're just watching the keynote anyways yeah so like so like why am I there yeah I don't know like I can I can get hands on with it but let's be real it's an iPhone  that's all right okay I think we've we've bashed the the things that you were wrong about um yeah moving on should we do this one I'm still
wondering what this one is oh oh sure yeah we could do a couple merch messages I mean that was kind of like two topics right yeah I think that was two topics if you guys want to interact with the show you know send a little message to producer Dan so he can put it at the bottom of the screen or send you a little response or forward it internally the way to do it is a merch message we don't want you wasting your money just throwing it at the screen if you if you want to throw money at the screen you
should get high quality merchandise in the mail for your efforts and we've got a deal for you this week we are heating things up with a special promo for w show we're bringing back Luke you got to get your thing oh they don't fit oh they didn't have my size did they bring the wrong size yeah but I have other colors to show you all right cool uh we're bringing back some pieces for a limited time now that it's almost fall these are the color block hoodies that we released a couple of years back
themed around our various channels so I'm wearing the short circuit one here's LT here's the tech quickie one uh we thought it'd be fun to throw these back up on the site for just $39.99 but the catch is that they're only available as a mystery so you never know which one you're going to get and we're going to heat things up even more coming back at the same time when sweatpants and if you buy a mystery color block hoodie you'll get these for 10 bucks heads up nuts heads up this is
kind of for our big boys out there okay we have very limited stock of the smaller sizes we're stocked a little bit deeper on the bigger sizes uh but the discount will apply automatically when you have both a mystery color block hoodie and a pair of w sweatpants in your cart so if you're looking to send a merch message while being able to get some stuff that's on sale that won't be available for much longer now is your chance um also on the store the off-site laptop bag is available again um to be
clear guys it is not going to fit an Ohio class submarine in it it is a laptop bag it is not a uh man what are they called the like messenger bags yeah it's not a messenger bag this is a laptop bag um so sorry for any miscommunication around that uh lm. g/l taptop bag it's up there and I guess that's all we have to say about merch messages so all you got to do is add something to your cart you'll see a little box for a merch message that'll go to producer Dan let's show you how it works Dan hit me with a
merch message sure thing hey Lar nuke and dual and PVS 14 night vision monocular sure sure I know that thing yeah cool if given the choice and that it was unpro would you choose to cover older military Tech if not if so under what circumstances um older military Tech yeah I don't see why we wouldn't cover a military Tech thing the issue for me is that we don't really get into Tech History that much yeah um and we definitely don't I think have the street cred in the military space to speak
intelligently about that kind of thing like I would be doing all the same research that anyone else would do you know browsing forums and Wikipedia and uh you know downloading schematics off of War Thunder or that are not supposed to be there or whatever leaking military Secrets yeah given the the reference in the in the naming uh covering like night vision goggles I don't think is a thing that makes a ton of sense for us I think it would have to be like how do they uh how
do they make sure that like I don't know these electronical components are able to survive in like uh Warfare zones I could see that being like a good Tech quickie yeah kind of interesting what makes an electronic device battle ready you know or something like that but how does how does it help resist EMP pulses stuff like that yeah I don't see I don't see really though why we would get into like a specific piece like that really seems more like a like a gun Channel could I I okay I could see us being
brought in as a collaborator on something like that like if they if they wanted to discuss um if they you know pull a board out of something and they were like okay uh and then to talk about you know what makes this board special compared to consumer electronics of the time uh we sent it to LT to or sure or the opposite considering they had that like was it PlayStation 3's I think was that that server Farm made over PlayStations like like little things like that yeah could make sense but I
think um there isn't as much crossover as you might think but there's there's some next up ter thing hi lldd you've teased a smaller backpack before is that still in the works or was it replaced by the oh no laptop does it just cut off there by the okay by the um it is definitely still in the works our latest sample of it is very good uh Luke you saw it last week yeah yeah I really liked the side pockets I won't say too much about it yeah I don't know how much we're talking about but those are sweet
did I even show you the little hidden Pockets that are in them I don't think so I don't know if those are going to make it into the final but we're going to we're going to push for it um depends on depends on costing a little bit but yeah no the the smaller backpack is coming uh we're working on naming for it I think we're going to have to do one more sample but hopefully that'll be like a pre-production sample rather than a sample sample and if we can sign off on that one it can go to production uh
we're we're very very excited about it right now it fits like a 15.6 in gaming laptop pretty comfortably we think we can make a tweak that would allow it to fit most 16in devices even at that size um it's the one that I was wearing in my AMD um ryzen uh ryzen 9000 coverage from computex if I recall correctly so it looks a little bit different computex Linus uh 2024 it looks a bit different now and the internal layout thankfully is way better it was my notes after that trip were not good and I wasn't 100%
sure if we were going to if we were going to even be able to move forward with the product because the design of it was so dependent on um it being basically unusable as far as I could tell but Matthew I think is the one who did the work on tweaking the design while also dramatically improving the usability of it uh yeah here's the here's the video where I think it made its first appearance uh this is a this is apparently uh this is apparently a hack if you just go back and forward ads
disappear and the more you do that the more it trains YouTube to just not bother serving you ads really yeah it doesn't seem to account for that you go right back onto the video it just accounts for that you bounce off the video the second you see an ad here's the question yeah if ad block is piracy yes is ADD aversion piracy like avoiding ad oh like like out avoidance like going back and forward to make it not send it resume viewing resume viewing that kind of thing H yeah yeah creepy I think as
long as you are cuz you're not breaking terms of service it's not against the terms of service to close your eyes is it officially against the terms of service to use ad block yeah okay whereas navigating away from a page is absolutely not against the the terms of service no but if you automated it so if you had a browser extension that every time you clicked a YouTube video like micro loaded the page and unloaded it and then loaded it again I think that would qualify as a as a as an ad serving
counter measure cuz it's it's the automation of it like but not manually running it that whole that whole argument where ad block is basically the same as closing your eyes is stupid because it's not yeah closing your eyes is the same as closing your eyes and you know they'll compare it to like TV commercials or whatever else right um no because you you you would you would just close your eyes that that would be the same thing um but when you when you automate something um then to me that becomes
a um is it also the distribution of it of said thing h so you're talking like if you made your own script or something like that or you made your own tool I want to address this really quick syrax in FL chat said I just hate malvertising I strongly agree I hate malvertising too um that's we're not telling you don't run this we're also not telling you don't use ad block yeah literally never happened never said that yeah it's I yeah I I don't I don't feel like I don't feel like rehashing that one to
today sure um I have never said don't use ad block I'm trying to think like maybe there was some wow in the garage in 2013 where somebody's going to like got him it's like I don't know whatever okay I have never that I recall said don't use ad block um I've been very consistent for a lot of years that uh I don't know Val heri in floing chat said lonus literally called me up last night and told me not to use Adblock so what are you saying I told you not to tell people that that
was a that was a conversation between just the two of us he called me too so is that is that why you're so tired this week you're just calling all of the audience members I actually have to confess something you broke into the float plane database I have to confess something I bought an auto dialer it wasn't even me it was it was a recording oh so it they couldn't even tell it wasn't me because those guys are idiots it's not oh it's not even AI of your voice no no just it's literally an oldfashioned auto
dialer they got Bamboozled wow yep wow Get Wrecked um anyways yeah it's not a thing dude we're just uh and like we've go we we' both got some Linux isos okay so like relax yep or don't relax it actually doesn't really matter to me stay tense uh I'm probably going to do one more if you're okay with that sure sure let's see hey lld did Plex ever fix your issues got my first Nas set up a bit ago transcoded downloads are crucial for me so decided to try MB haven't had any real issues might be worth a
look I am probably going to try jelly finner MB at some point um overall I've been I've been pretty with Plex um that issue recently was a permissions thing in trass where I was having trouble with that show you wanted to watch so that wasn't a Plex issue that series of Linux isos yeah series of Linux isos sure whatever um the point is just that I haven't I haven't actually tried to do a lot of local uh local downloads lately so I haven't I haven't realistically played with it that much
but Plex has been pretty well behaved for me lately and I actually saw some pretty promising news I think it was either this morning or yesterday Plex announced that they're going to split out the photo backup functionality that they used to have in the main Plex app into a separate app and I remember talking to them about that because the photo backup function was really cool and really easy to use and really convenient and I really liked it and then they just deprecated it and I was
like well that's sort of uncool because I thought that that was part of the function of this product so now it's a separate app and I wonder if that's going to help them overcome some of the the challenges that they've had because from what I gleaned the issues that they had continuing to support that feature basically came down to like Library access and like constant changes when it came to um accessing the library and then backing it up especially as a background task so if that can be a dedicated app
rather than part of the video watching app maybe that'll help them do a better job of it so I want to check that out but I know absolutely nothing about it yet and I'm going to have to I'll give it a chance I mean I I have a lifetime subscription so if I so you go away from it you can always just come back yeah and the but the cost of Plex is not a factor for me yeah for for a lot of people the cost of Plex is a major factor so they want something free and open source but I I don't care because I
already own it so the cost of both of them is the same for me personally uh it might change what I would recommend to someone else I might say hey give these free options a try before you spring for the paid one but for me it doesn't matter so so I'm going to give it a shot and then the other big thing that I'm waiting for is um that that Nas software that I invested in from from ashte you doing the research on this before the nas software comes out though because I'm assuming you're going to have some
video on the nas software kind of does make sense um yeah but my whole thing with the nas software is I want to have to do as little work in research as possible oh no I mean like if you're if you're making a video like hey do this stuff to set up your Nas or whatever I don't know having an informed opinion on the Plex jelly fin whatever debate would be good no I probably won't oh okay because a lot of my opinion is going to come down to ease of setup and so my my goal my big
ulterior motive stay out of it as with this whole with this whole investment into ashtech was that whatever I want to install on a Nas that I think is good I will have a back Channel way of saying hey can you guys support this and make sure that everything just works so that I don't have to think about it and then by proxy everyone else will be able to install let's say Plex or image or whatever super easily and won't have to think about like the stupid permissions issues that like I switched which VM I
was using to download isos and it uh it made it made it so there was like it turned in like read only for certain for certain like containers or um because it using like kubernetes I was on the older version of trz scale it just just like such a such a mess and I'm sitting here going I don't want any of this I just I just want to have my files and like I can read and write them and stuff yeah it's the whole thing all right are we are we done now are we moving on I don't know who knows you want to you
want to pick a topic Luke um I'm this one which one scroll up let just be a man and say it cuz cuz I don't know what's going on with it B A man do the right thing I fix it sure yeah iix what's happening there um honestly inform me honestly I don't know so why don't we do this together oh oh boy so earlier this week yesterday uh iFixit announced their smart soldering iron uh this thing's kind of wild by the way it's um this is cool 100 watt heater ready to solder in 5 seconds it can run
offthe wall for like an entire workday I think they advertise it has a literal web interface huh that you access through like Chrome you know like through a browser like like an actual you know like a web interface I yeah so that you can configure it and um yeah I don't know pretty cool I've definitely seen some discussion around the price uh by the time you buy the soldering iron and the dock and you know whatever else people are saying it's like hundreds of dollars which when you compare to some of the
more value oriented options um is not that competitive yeah but there are also soldering irons that are wicked expensive there are but I think that for the people who are into like hackos you're going to pry them from their cold dead hands yeah I'm um showing our producer cam for no reason oh I'm a JBC boy oh really okay there you go Rolls-Royce baby actually my the one I have at home is like a $40 clone and it's like okay but it doesn't have a battery you pack you can't like mve it
around oh yeah that's right Dan's Dan's the one he's the one who made us spend a fortune on those stupid soldering stations isn't he nice dude I sitting there they're a partner this is not an endorsement but I was sitting there trying to learn on my soldering iron oh yeah I remember this this actually happened I was trying to get Dan to like teach me how to solder and I was you know coming along but I was struggling a little bit and then he gave me the nice soldering iron and I instantly did it
like and then because you're you're learning the techniques you're not necessarily cuz you're for me to use a really broken soldering iron is difficult but I know it's wrong and for somebody learning but you don't need "like a a $1,500 station to learn how to" solder with yeah so it's like it'sin it's for sure a skill issue but still the nice soldering iron just made it so much easier and something that has like temperature control like this and it can get hot really quickly and it's not
super unwieldy it's the nice thing about the jbc's is they are like this size for their their ends and stuff like that but they're Ultra professional levels yeah all right so um whoops where am I going last laptop there we go uh so back to this thing so I've seen some some commentary on the pricing some people are not super thrilled with it um some people are are more thrilled with it anyway uh Vitor responds and says now I want an LT soldering iron and Kyle wans um CEO of iix it says he does seem to be
good at copying our products there's been a fair amount of speculation as to what exactly he means by this is it gentle ribbing is it uh genuine upset and more than one person has pointed out that on the very day that he posted this one of our videos went live with an iFixit sponsorship in it um so what I will say is I also don't know so what I'm going to do is I'm going to reiterate everything that I've said about the iFixit relationship and we'll go from there sure so if it's gentle
ribbing gentle ribbing received um if it's not gentle ribbing well I don't know we're good on our side um we're chill we believe in the iFix admission we have absolutely no intention of becoming iix it uh we're not going to we're not going to even begin to approach the kind of uh replacement parts that they stock the guides that they create through their Community um the even the type of content that they produce they do such a great job of their tear Downs um that we've looked at doing that type of
content before and we've just kind of gone yeah I don't know you know maybe someday but realistically this seems like it's pretty well served you know evaluating the repairability of devices and stuff like that um we absolutely value iix it as a partner we specifically went out of our way to make our driver available as a standalone driver for people who just want a driver upgrade and they're going to put it into their iFixit kit and use it with their iFixit bits we went out of our way to
make sure that our driver was compatible with iFixit bits so there's a whole thing uh we talked about it in the short circuit live stream when we announced our Precision driver where the iso standard is actually uh not what everyone including iix it does and I forget the exact detail but basically it comes down to manufacturing tolerances so you're supposed to have um this socket which is actually a if I recall correctly a metric translation of what is actually an imperial size so that's
supposed to be the size and then the bits are supposed to be smaller but what everybody else does is they make the size bigger and the bits smaller or whatever basically you're supposed to make this big enough that at the upper range of the tolerances for the bit size they'll fit for sure and what we did was we made this at the lower range and then our bits were smaller I forget hold on let me think about what it is so what happened was our initial drivers this was too small that's right so everyone
else makes the bits the size and then they make their um their driver bigger slightly oversized and what you're supposed to do is you're supposed to make the socket the size you know 4 MIM or whatever it is and then the bits are supposed to be smaller so in our first samples we had bits and sockets that fit perfectly but when we went to put someone else's bits in our sockets we realized they were the ones that were at the high end of the tolerance range were too big so we had to go back and we had
to make ours like everyone else anyway doesn't matter the point is that we went out of our way to make sure that the driver was compatible to reduce waste so if people already have a set they can upgrade to the fidget spinner SL Precision driver without wasting all of the bits in case that they already have um but we also wanted to offer an option with the ideas that we had to improve the product that would include bits and uh and a case so you know I don't know if he's if he's serious about it
um I don't I don't really know what to make of that I'm we're still down to work together uh I disagree I guess I I will say that I disagree that it's a copied product iix it didn't invent Precision screwdrivers iix it didn't invent um bit cases um and you know from my point of view either it's a copy at a higher price in which case he shouldn't be worried about it right or it's a product that innovated with things like this magnetically detachable nicely cool stackable case uh deeper bits that make
their way into you know recessed housings more easily um an all metal driver that has bit storage they do have one with bit storage but it's not all metal uh higher quality bearing replaceable tops stronger magnet um no I think it's I think it's about as different as a product can be and still be a Precision screwdriver um oh we added we added magnets to the inside yeah that's nice it's a parts tray effectively yeah and to be clear the iix one can also be used as a parts tray but it won't be magnetic
yeah so there you go uh so yeah I don't know is he mad who knows are we working on a soldering iron not at this time but if we thought there was room to innovate and make a better soldering iron I'm not going to rule out anything uh we definitely have other products in our road map that are tools and therefore will probably overlap with anyone who sells tools but part of our product development philosophy is that we don't just make the same thing that's already out there if we aren't adding something
then um I don't see why we'd bother and in some cases what we're adding can be as simple as uh making it more affordable like most things I have to do around my house basically just require SC screwdriver so I have LTT screwdrivers for everything uh I had to use a hammer last night wasn't an LTT Hammer disappointed we actually we actually do have a potential product spec for a hammer I have some ideas okay that was entirely a joke but all right no I I it's true I mean what I
said is not untrue I used a hammer last night and I I I literally pulled it out and was like huh it's like blue it's not orange and black I have ideas all right um and you know what sometimes it can be as simple as coming in at a lower price like I think that anti-static work mats are overpriced essentially so our modmat uh which we actually created in collaboration with modri who has been doing mod mats for oh Lord only knows how long they um didn't they it yeah yeah like way back in the day so they're
they're they're pretty OG uh so we actually partnered with them and ours is going to be coming soon it's going to be very price competitive compared to what's out there and that's still like profitable so so yeah if we see if we see an area where we can improve the state of the market then yeah we'll go for it uh but if we don't then we're not just we're not just looking to come in and copy someone else's product and I I reject I reject the assertion that this is a copied product and if it is a
copied product they should have no problem recopying it and then there's is better and that's how competi that's how competition works then everybody's product is better I mean we didn't patent anything here even if we could have which I really you know I don't think we could have but even if we could have that we're not that's not really how we roll I do think at some point we'll probably have to patent something um but that's not a bridge that we've really had to cross yet
I think if we ever did like a like a new you know what it's probably better for me to just not even say there are a couple things that we have in development that could potentially  but patent tax right off yeah sure let  that all right yeah okay so anyway hopefully we're still cool we love you I fix it and um if you guys are mad um sorry speaking of Madness the US government pushes for w the dock just keeps floating around uh the US government pushes for greater VPN access
last week the White House met with Amazon Google Microsoft and cloudflare as well as civil society Advocates to encourage tech companies to offer more digital bandwidth for government funded internet censorship evasion tools which uh is an insane sentence to me uh tools supported by the open technology fund or the OTF which is funded by the US government have surged in popularity in countries like Russia Iran Myanmar uh oh and Myanmar sorry I missed the and according to OTF
president Laura Cunningham the number of VPN users they support has more than quadrupled over the last few years to around 46 million users each month the OTF wants discount or subsidized server bandwidth to help meet that growing demand what is which to me sounds like the government is basically being like yeah we don't really care if you like pirate movies and music and stuff we want all your data that's that's my that's what I get from this personally tools supported by the OTF which is funded by the US
government have searched in popularity in countries like they want you know resistant groups and whatnot that are in uh maybe not super friendly to us countries to be able to do their thing but do they want encryption for their  citizens this would allow them to see all the things to encourage tech companies to offer more digital bandwidth for government funded internet censorship evasion tools is that such a wild sentence  um interesting yeah I don't know a ton about the
OTF I don't know how far the fingers of the US government are in the OTF but if  yourself you can do a whole heck of a lot but are they saying they're running the VPN I don't I don't know or are they saying they want Tech companies to offer more bandwidth wait for but for government funded censorship evasion  those it's very interesting to me uh it's it it sounds like a a two-pronged attack this is the vibe that I'm getting so the the one prong is hey we get to help groups that are in Russia Iran
Myanmar and other places uh-huh yeah yeah yeah which which is valid which is probably something that they want to communicate and organize a multitude of reasons yeah for sure for sure and then the other one is like oh know and if if other people use it we get to have a really good look into what they're up to well yeah um wow 46 million users a  wild OTF vpns yeah like what what is an O what is  oh no this is good stuff like do they do openvpn did I see an openvpn logo there I recognize that
logo immediately yeah so wait no this is like good then so these are tools that you can use to build VPN like this is not necessarily very interesting I don't know though I'm not aware of like a sick  um I don't know what this means though or if this is just a list of things like  um do they make are they responsible for openvpn guys I don't know help me out here genuinely no idea like I don't want to I don't want to get into like a wire guard versus openvpn debate like but wire guard may
be it's on here though it's on this list that's why that's why I'm saying like I'm not sure what this list necessarily means like do they just of yeah maybe they're part of the funding for openvpn wire guard and tour I see this okay but I don't necessarily know if this means this is from the open Tech fund or if this means this is the funding that it's received you know what I mean they've got to have received more funding than that overall oh wait maybe that is overall I don't because it says
free and open source software sustainability fund your mom's VPN why do we even why do we even talk to any read the last paragraph through the F sustainability fund openvpn will focus on growing its core contribut okay this isn't the is is that a different thing I don't know is the F sustainability fund a fund within the open technology fund I don't know I don't know where this Rabbit Hole goes but it's it's definitely so there may be downsides but fundamentally it's probably good better
VPS access seems probably good good okay I'm going to say I'm going to say it's a W for now yeah and hopefully I don't end up eating those words yeah uh we don't have very good information on this so I don't think we can really say much unfortunately but we'll move on what I would like to talk about is NVIDIA purses yeah what uh AI researcher Teresa Barton is selling a limited run of 10 purses crafted out of Nvidia GeForce gt730 graphics cards for uh "$124 or $1,024 her website also"
indicates that she will at some point be selling a handmade bag made out of a handbag uh yes a handbag made out of a  that's neat that's cool yeah I don't know is there like a little battery bank somewhere to power the fan I see the fan has its the fan is on the outside and it has its own plug yeah there's got to be there got to be something there there got to be a battery in there or something I think one of my questions is how much stuff can you actually store in this purse like is it purely aesthetic I
do think that they look surprisingly neat yeah I read this title and was like oh it's going to look like junk and then I saw the actual thing and I was like oh it's not too bad what is um what is the what is the justification for the price here because she literally says they made of ew um I don't I think purses in general I just there's price is whatever how do these items end up so  this like about here here is there like I honestly think if you try to figure this out you're just going to hurt your
brain is there an objective like is is she is this contributing to oh I think 1024 is just computer number no no no no no no no that's not what I meant by that I no oh my I just got assaulted by LT ads oh they just went away I get it all of the verticals of ads on this website which there are many they were all LT ads for a split second and then they went away oh sorry I just I was I was kind of expecting it to say like oh yeah um Pro proceeds are going to some kind of research into AI something but no
this appears to be just like I don't know maybe she's just a bespoke designer that made only 10 of a thing and if you're going to do that you're going to charge a bunch I don't know yeah I guess  okay uh sure well hey you know what I wish you luck I bet you at least one person bought it you think so I feel like it you think so I think so I don't know dude I um I think that seems pretty unlikely I think even most people who spend a lot of money on purses probably expect to be able to carry something in
them I do not agree with that statement  all wow I don't really I don't really understand what I'm looking at here so you're basically telling me this purchase is ineligible for this why is it even here then um I guess shop probably doesn't deal with a lot of things that are over 30 grand so they never really thought about that scenario this just seems like like is she just is this a social experiment is she's just trying to grab headlines like this this can't this can't seriously be
the best the the best sales pitch is "this is this like $60,000 one yeah yeah" I don't think she thinks anyone's going to buy it personally but like you you know enough rare one-of-a-kind gp4 training GPU know there's lots of them um and if you know enough to know about GPT then you'd think you could just use chat GPT to like write a better description for it that's literally all it says on this entire page this particular page I think is more about the bringing eyeballs in like she's I
think she's meming dude oh at least to a certain degree yeah fits a phone nice yeah long or short chain of avilable I bet at least one has sold I think she's meing that doesn't look good the other pictures looked pretty good that the pictures are just stupid because this picture is not a gt730 this is the H uh the h100 one so what is it doing on this product page that's like what is this doing here this is not any of those things this is this is ancient this is like uh yeah gf100 this is fery this is
a this is a 480 so like what am I even I don't think she expects to sell any I think she's meing should I buy one I still no but I bet you she sold one because of what you just did don't actually do it I'm I I want to know if it's a real site am I actually going to get a purse in the mail do you want my credit card no I don't want the only way I'm going to get an h100 at some random time in the show you should throw that thing back at me what what I'm sorry I was talking no it's

used to be at the very far wall the yeah there's a there's a piece of glass and then they have a display behind it yeah like no the team the team's great bring it back there yeah this is uh this is where edil was experimenting with some of the ue5 like real time tracking stuff yeah yeah cool anyway the show's also brought You by Ridge look at us they're also bringing gold to you this summer with their he that's us too massive sweep Stakes yep that's did you see it was dentist driving uh yeah yeah there
he is yeah it should be um now you could do now you can drag race like Dennis he's the passenger seat gold cyber truck what am I looking at and if being the center of everyone's attention isn't your style don't worry okay that happened I know they were telling us before the show shro got pulled over right that's actually shro right there yeah yep they um okay sorry we're really we're really losing track of the sponsor talking points here anyway is so good Ridge massive sweep Stakes they have
other prizes to choose from and yes that is real footage of Dennis and cherro on the highway in Salt Lake City anyway the winner of The Sweep Stakes gets to choose between a Hennessy Velociraptor a goldplated cyber truck or 100 "$100,000 cash uh this says what would I" pick ooh oh it cut back to me yeah that's what it's supposed to be what would I pick uh what would I what would I pick I guess I'll take the cash what would I do with a velociraptor I love that I love that the
the the follow-up sentence was what would I do with a velociraptor not the other one well I mean yeah yeah that makes so much sense I'm trying acknowledge something that's a real option I mean I don't what I would be seen in that you could melt it into a controller like dude I'd be out in the parking lot scraping it off I don't know man I'd be I'd be legit I'd be legit ah look Ridge hopefully this is compatible with the sponsor spot we're doing for you right now here I'll talk about your key holder
uh there you go there you go be distracted um I would be there is they they do have a cyber truck and a Hennessy version of their things their key holder and their wallet yeah I would be embarrassed to be seen in a cyber truck at all or the goldplated one is the goldplated one less or more embarrassing it's cooler it so it's less embarrassing yeah it's cooler I think it's I think it's so bad that it comes all the way back around to kind of cool this might be a weird take I actually think the where it says
just Ridge on the side of the goldplated one actually just looks good I rarely like when you see like just the brand logo on things but I just something to break up just the like ca of it's all the same right there y like I think it actually looks sharp having something on it yeah uh that thing looks so tacky though I just can't so if if you had to pick a vehicle you go with the Hennessy Raptor and if you had to something you'd go with the cash hold on a second hold  um are you looking up their value on the
resale Market no you have to pay people to take them away I'm just a little curious um price of stainless steel per pound a dude see I would have a really hard time going back to filling up at the gas station I am not into having a gas vehicle anymore at all you go anywhere in a cyber  on get the truck and electrified it would be fun project oh no but if I'm going to have an electric truck getting a getting a like over a th000 horsepower Hennessy Velociraptor and taking the engine out and
electrifying it would be kind of hilarious that would be completely put  dude I'm sure the engine for the Hennessy is bigger than your whole car somebody put an LS in it with twin turbo chargers they to like remove most of the front end in the hood it's 800 horsepower oh my that's actually terrifying um death speedrun yeah that that would have that would have like the the the the power to weight ratio of a slot car like that would be ridiculous it's like it's like nearly one to one
that's crazy actually I think the engine weighs probably more than the car the rest of the car yeah so it would affect that slightly Top Gear 1224 says what's more embarrassing a gold cyber truck or a purple tyan gold cyber truck yeah I really think it is cyber truck the Cyber truck is just brutal dude um anywh who from now until September 16th you'll get two entries for every dollar spent or you can get four x entries when you purchase the Cyber wallet or Hennessy Specialty Products so we've got a couple
of their uh oh we've got a key holder and a wallet oh why am I even holding these up we've got wonderful footage of them there you go that's what they look like wow see looks so nice so enter now at ridge.com or using the link in the video description I take the cash I'm just going to take the cash take the cash uh speaking of taking the cash even have to answer our next sponsor is acronis is your business paddling risky Waters the risky what paddling the risky Waters of the internet unprotected our sponsor

few merch messages Dan go ahead and hit me sure hey lonus and the talent I'd be curious to your thoughts on yeah that's nice that's no I'm not responding to this merge message no no no I don't like it no that's that's good for you no okay whatever Talent is a derogatory i' take it that way it is not I don't think he means it to be but right now no Talent is not derogatory it's uh it it removes moves the person from the statement where you're just like an object who hold on a second I what really I've
always thought it's I think they meant it as a derogatory but it's it's like no that's that means that you're the real person and and we're just like accessories to make your show what oh man see cuz I've called you guys the talent before because from my perspective like I'm producing the show and you're just kind of like part of what makes the show right so you remove the like human aspect that you're human the no no I'm not I'm not a person either like the show becomes the entity
right oh uh and you are just kind of a part of the show like set dressing right I it's a whole thing most of chat uh does not appear to be aligned with that Dan no no no it's definitely supposed to be no I don't understand I don't I don't because I thought cuz hold on cuz a lot of people have said hey Dan in the talent before but this is the first time that like lonus has been no no they're calling me untalented it's definitely a sick burn but like but a lot of the other merch messages that use Dan and
the talent in them right yeah because because the the onc screen players are the tent referred to as the talent yeah like that's just I think that's just an industry term I don't think it's meant to be derogatory like if you say and yeah but that's derogatory to you cuz you're like the if you if you say and director then like I don't think that's disrespectful I think that just describes their role in the production am am I am I off base here I don't know I think we're all a bit off base I
didn't realize that this would be so polarizing so immediately all right I've never loved the turn personally but I honestly my amount of cares is quite low yeah cuz I've never L the turn oh all right well for what it's worth Luke host makes more sense I think talented cuz is well not everyone's a host though here's a question about the word talent cuz I just looked it up and I'm still not I I've taken it and maybe I'm just taking it wrong I've taken it as like you have an innate skill it's
not something that you honed but you were just naturally good at something dude you're applying video game logic I get to be that sounds very likely do I get to be right on wo for are you guys actually siding with me for a change yeah I think I think lonus is right too yeah yeah sure it's it's all it's it's a bit of a thing yeah Talent is used for anyone on screen not just the host yeah yeah yeah yeah they're calling me talented but they're just meing on me but originally the reason
why I didn't originally like it is because it seems derogatory to everybody else oh that was my original reason like referring to the person who is like the star the only people that are any good as the people with Talent yes oh I see that's like when I originally didn't like the word that was yeah but I don't think like a director implies that they're not a talented one I think it's just yeah no Talent is just yeah but the directors tend to be the ones with the money so that's
producer yeah no director the director not also if you're good sure but if you're a good talent then you also have money and if you're a good actually as far as I can tell most everybody else ends up not making a ton of money but um yeah then you're an extra you're not even Talent oh no no I just I was well I was trying to come up like I mean I guess if you're like see but like yeah why is there a distinction there no an extra still Talent are they 100% a lesser Talent lesser although often extras are
given no lines so they have like no real uh effect on like Luke's this up I'm going out of here uh background actor supporting artist Junior oh my goodness have we custodian alized the uh extras no it's right there no no no no I mean that we don't call them extras anymore oh oh now they're Junior artists atmosphere that's something that I didn't know about atmosphere sounds so much worse to me personally oh yeah that's awful waa that's such a excuse me what's your job could the atmosphere go stand next to
the Potted Plant like we got some bad atmosphere gross oh man uh yeah yeah this is not something I've thought about a lot or cared about much to h i turn  gas I mean if you could do that you might be one of the main characters in the show actually I may be slowly turning into gas I mean we've seen plenty of evidence of  chairs okay so when we frame it as lonus in the talent what was the question I don't know I want to finish this what does that mean so lus in the talent means that I'm untalented or no yeah
that's what they meant it was a sick burn we've just established that Talent is a a role in a production yeah you guys are both talent because there boom talent untalent talent untalent talent untalent yeah but you still have a job here well yeah but they were just meming because they were pretending to misunderstand the term Talent as having talent and they were referring to me as being untalented I think that's why I don't like the word but but think no cuz because in my mind
you're the one with the name so you get to be a person and then we're just accessories to your production no because like I've okay like I've they definitely intended it to imply you are untalented but I've gone on third party sets where I am like the main person yeah and I get referred to as Talent or like on the contract it'll just be like blah blah blah blah blah here to four referred to as Talent like it's it just means a performer that's all it means exactly right
I mean my favorite term is watering the talent right I fill up your water bottles I used to give the the bands on stage their water do you want warm water do you want cold water what would be best for your throat right uh watering the talent it's it's fun I don't know from now on I want to be referred to as shortened I'm not tall so I actually see the whole term as kind of  uh all right so what are we talk what was the you wouldn't let me get there I'd be curious uh to your thoughts on
why teeken gaming cafes haven't taken off in North America it seems like it'd be a slam dunk with gaming becoming super mainstream and popular now they don't seem to be doing as far as my terrible observations can account for I don't think they're doing as well in Asian countries either these days oh really I mean bit take because Mobile gaming is taking off that's why oh but are you talking about like a themed Cafe though or are you talking about like an eye Cafe with like gaming computers in
it is that no I think they're talking about themed cafes oh my like there was that bar downtown that had like gaming themed cocktails and stuff or whatever was that what it was called Stow yeah yeah but didn't they shut down uh during I think they at least shut down one location um looking it up yeah I guess closed yeah I guess the question for me is you know what is it man this is tough cuz I have to confess that when we went to Japan like went to the Pokemon cafe for example I was super unimpressed by
the whole deal uh the food was not just not very good like it was functionally inedible a lot of it where at sorry in Japan um it was s it was packed like business was booming but uh it was just kind of sucky and I I just kind of wonder if the expectations for a themed restaurant are totally different here because I wouldn't see a business like that succeeding very well here your food still has to be good like I've never been but my understanding qu in Vancouver is actually insanely High my
understanding is even like Hooters has decent food though I've never been there um that's what i' that's what I've heard don't quote me on that but I don't think it's good enough to have a theme with a themed restaurant with just like disgusting food in it here um yeah apparently the wings are great says chat um yeah there you go so they used to do know about nowadays um the wings are good yeah so I maybe that's part of it and I think that one of the challenges is that in order
to have like a gaming themed Cafe it either is like sort of generic in which case I don't know if it would appeal to people as much or you'd be paying licensing fees because it's commercial use of the IP um and I think that affects the quality so like the Pokémon Cafe seems to be actually run by the Pokémon company and so the kind of margin that these that these licensed Brands expect um has a direct impact on the quality of the product in a lot of cases has been my experience
um with that said I mean I think we've talked about you know restaurant ideas before or and like IV and I have talked about lots and lots of business ideas over the years like uh one idea that I had a while back that I thought would be super cool keep going after um is I wanted to create like um like toddler land and so the idea was that it would be like an attraction for adults where you have this Warehouse that you decorate the outside to look like a normal house but
everything is scaled up you walk through a giant front door and you experience this entire environment like what it would be like to be thigh high to an adult so there's like giant stairs and you can like sit and eat a meal at a giant table with giant Cutlery and like I don't know it' just be like a weird it'd be such a like a you know an instagrammable yeah like thing to do a big spoon on like suspension crane wires that like flies food towards you uh well not even that
not even no I hadn't gotten that far cuz that would be a lot of work sweet though mostly it was just going to be creating a giant environment it was kind of inspired by these up upside down houses that you can go to yeah um but just like have you ever been to dark table I have yeah like I like those types of experiences personally would the meals also be giant portions yeah I mean sure yeah I'd be down um like you you Source produce that's like oversized and stuff and like I don't know I I don't know
just just it's just like wacky ideas but I've I've always had this kind of uh brainworm idea that like if I don't want to if I finally just want to chill I would like go you know move further out than where we are now to a smaller area and then open just like a a very small Corner Cafe Diner thing like Luke in Gilmore Girls and just like do that interesting be like I'm just going to chill now and I would have to have enough money that it wouldn't have to be super profitable or maybe even
profitable at all because like those types of businesses are often you'd want to buy the property out right maybe find one that's commercial zoned on the bottom and it he does in Gilmore Girls exactly are you a Gilmore Girls fan oh yeah really yep I did not know that yep huh y hold on okay let's play a game um I mean I haven't watched it in a long time but yeah well yeah it hasn't been been airing for a long time like are you are you like uh quing me no no no I'm not going to quiz you I've only seen
bits and pieces I'm just trying to figure out the game I want to play is I want to try to guess what it is that you like about it okay so I think you probably like the smart Snappy dialogue yes the on liners absolutely um very much so that's a huge part of the draw it's not the only draw that's why I started there that's why I started there um I think you like probably the relatively realistic and believable character interactions it's very dramatic as a show but it doesn't get into like I
cannot believe that any human would behave this way territory I think for  part it is very dramatic but there's never usually like like I don't think there's any like murders it's not like oh my how oh my goodness it's like uh  what else for me yeah I'm answering now um yeah I found some of the characters pretty relatable I found the mistakes that the characters go through or like the choices that I didn't agree with to feel very human if that makes sense like I might not have agreed with the choice
that this one person did but yeah I could see them doing it or I could see like one of my friends like doing this I found Rory sufferable often yeah I just like it like she's not my favorite character sometimes there's characters that I dislike enough as people that I just kind of have a hard time watching the show and I just found her extremely difficult to be around in my opinion the and someone in in chat said this but I'm not actually just cop copying them it's also my opinion the show is about Laura
liia and Luke right and I didn't like Luke just because he shares my name you're not that shallow no not quite cuz I I I definitely and his characters for any character named lonus I get so few W's Luke there isn't that many Lukes either but the ones that I do have are pretty cool you literally have an apostle I don't want to hear about it that's I I have that Skywalker's pretty sick yeah Luke from Gilmore Girls is pretty based yeah yeah yeah I don't want to hear about it we've got it going on um yeah I
don't know it's just it's just a good show I like I I find some people might not even like this um but I don't care I find a lot of modern media is like like it's all about the the Grays like you know the the evil guys you should probably like like them a lot and the good guys are like actually really bad and we're going to make sure that you come out of this learning something and having moral questions and like sometimes I just want to watch something and be like cool yeah
the Na's lost and that's good good like I just leave it alone I I I don't anyways uh um and there's there's another form of content that aligns with that whole concept which is just where it's like relatively casual and you actually just want to relax and watch something and I think Gilmore Girls Falls in line with that there's another like there's a Canadian show where it follows a family that owns a uh it's like a convenience store or something oh Kim's Convenience Kim's Convenience I
like Kim's Convenience okay for I think similar but not the same reasons why I like gimler girls I thought gimler girls was better but I still thought Kim's Convenience was pretty good yeah it wasn't something like Kim's Convenience wasn't something I was going to sit down and watch dedicated sure but if it was on yeah it's cool yeah sure and like Gilmore Girls was somewhat similar I used to watch Gilmore Girls cuz the computer at my parents house was in the family room
where the TV was so like my mom would be watching g girls or whatever and it was good enough that I would like headphones off and like actually pay attention to it while I'm doing other things Slice of Life shows yeah they're chill Slice of Life shows or you can go you can go on the dramatic level and have more intense topics but I often do like it when it's like yeah the Nazis lost and the Nazis are bad there there's there's a time and place for the like the morally gray learn things question
things content but it's just it's so constant these days it's just like man relax I don't I actually just want to chill the world has enough of this already um have you looked at politics at all um I don't need more of that personally my goodness all right I forget what the question was but go ahead Dan hit us with another merch message uh yeah sure uh what even is this show about how did we get was that a merch message I think so yeah that was a merch message for the last 15 minutes
hey w. with the PS5 Pro comes my continued sorrow that storage is soldered thoughts about the idea that PS4 Hardware could outlive PS5 Hardware since high failure components can be replaced that's an interesting question um and to be clear I want to acknowledge that the the PlayStation 5 has has some non soldered storage it does have a a storage Bay that you can install an m.2 SSD in which in my opinion was such a pro consumer um like healthy move that I I can't I can't say enough how unexpected
it was for me from Sony of all of all players um but with that said what Eric points out is that the boot SSD is very much soldered and you cannot boot off of that m.2 drive um could PS4 Hardware outlive PS5 Hardware because you can just replace the drive anytime time you want man I'd love to think that you know Sony could issue an update or something that would allow you to move all of the all of the boot partition like any any any necessary OS files over to the m.2 drive I kind of don't think they would
but then I didn't think they would have an m.2 slot in the first place so I don't know maybe they would but remember Sony Sony acknowledges I think that the performance of the m.2 lot is not as high as the soldered SSD but then I don't think we've seen a game yet where it's made a difference I I think really my answer to all of this is that it should be terrifying for anyone who's into consoles um that it's basically just PlayStation right now that is horrible very bad does it matter
absolutely well hold on hold on let me hold on let me finish does it matter if every Sony exclusive is just going to come to PC anyway I'll let you finish but well I did finish finish no I'm doing the Kanye reference I I know the reference but I'm already done talking all right all right uh I think it does I think it matters for console people but like for PC people I don't think it makes a difference what's a console person even going to be in a few years I mean Microsoft has has publicly acknowledged
Steam OS now I think we're going to get a Windows console OS for handheld at which point we're going to get a Windows console OS for desktop because it's basically same we get that then I think it's fine but I've heard no Whispers of that and honestly PC on a TV right now is not a great experience it's not a console like experience it's not great you can you can configure steam to launch on Startup and launch a big picture it's not you're 100% right like there's there is I I don't care but I
understand the reasons why certain people like consoles and it's they're getting less solid because consoles are getting more annoying to use I think over time which is weird and sucks but back in the day the argument was like you know with my N64 put thing in turn thing on I am playing game y That's it Y which is awesome it was so funny I saw one comment that had a fair number of up votes that was just like they're like charging more for just like it's like slightly better and it's more expensive 
just like on PCS sorry man but welcome to the party yeah exactly I apologize that you're here yeah yeah and um but yeah no they they're so PC like you're right yeah which which Unfortunately they seem to be inheriting a lot of the negative aspects of PCS and not inheriting as many of the patches while PCS are actually gaining things from consoles are retaining a lot of the negativity that they've had like paying for access to online multiplayer like that is mind-blowing and you look the way that
Microsoft has just brazenly changed the way that game pass works so that it kind of sucks on Xbox compared to on a PC yeah and effectively have just said I don't know get good bu a PC then if you want to get a good deal on gam pad let what yeah it's it's I think a a somewhat uncomfortable time to be a console gamer uh especially if you're an Xbox console gamer but even if you're a PlayStation console gamer it's just all all a little uncomfortable right now and if you're
someone who's like a you know a TV gamer maybe let's call it that yeah then yeah it's just awkward because windows isn't an amazing solution you can do it but it's yeah it's not great as long as you need a keyboard and a mouse um couch solutions for that are just kind of awkward and really bulky and I don't think there's any getting away from that to be honest no but there's so many games that you can play on PC with a controller now like it's kind of it does help a lot solved
essentially it helps a lot speaking of which Speaking of games that you could play with a controller I have a I have a hot take that the internet is not going to like me for you played more of Final Fantasy 6 and it's not that good no I did play more of it and it's very good nice I'm still very happy with that game it's going to take me a long time to beat it but um on really is on I got I got pushed with a very strong recommendation to at least try a game uhoh so I did what game and so far it's really
good what game Star Wars Outlaws oh it's really good so far I thought people said it was okay I thought people said it was terrible oh wait no I'm thinking of Jedi Survivor yeah uh okay so sorry is that is that a hot take Outlaws do people hate Outlaws it's cuz it's from it's cuz it's from Ubisoft which is I think why why people don't like it after playing the game it has one of the coolest I'm going to say most Innovative and then someone's going to be like oh they lifted it from this
any game I'm sorry I didn't know uh most Innovative like lockpicking mechanics the story seems really good so far the characters seem cool um the the design of the environments are fantastic like the city that I'm in is awesome um there's some things that like leave things to be desired I think the the speeder driving mechanics are not great I think mad that you and also drive at the same time kind of weird um you can use a ability to do like like a taked down or whatever it is
like an timate kind of yeah but it has to like charge up that is definitely like awkward yeah um but it also has barely impacted my Gameplay at all so I don't care I haven't played that much so maybe it becomes more of a thing the more you play I don't know um but so far  it's I think most people are saying it's bad because Ubisoft is bad not because the game is bad I think the game is pretty good how many hours are you in counting it in hours is already becoming disingenuous um I'm not that far in I'm
through the the intro to the game area and then I've spent probably like 20 minutes after that and then that's it so I'm not that far into the game but like the sound is great the story already has me quite interested the lock picking mechanic is so cool that there's a there's a thing that constantly turns yeah and then in a rhythm it like shows the pattern that you have to do and then as it comes back around making like ticking noises you have to like almost preemptively press along with the Rhythm
and then unlocks for you which is like actually kind of fun and satisfying you like feel like you did well when you did it instead of a lot of other lock P mechanics in games where it's just like tedium right um I don't know I I just can't with Star Wars anymore dude I just I oh I'm just I'm just I'm completely ignoring that it's Star Wars oh okay that makes sense um I I haven't seen a lightsaber in the game yet I don't think it matters you're like Outer Rim whatever space Outlaw person okay no
part of the game so far has been like Star Wars has not been important even slightly so far I don't think we've ran into a single character that's like a major character from the mainline series um personally yet there's no lightsabers no there's no even reference to any of it so far there are technically Stormtroopers I think I've seen like four and they didn't matter yeah okay and the last one I think I've got for you here hello lonus Duke and Dan question for Luke I currently am
desperately searching for a job in a market that seems almost dead for developers what do you think of jobs that ghost applicants we've done it by accident uh um I am sincerely sorry for anyone that we ever didn't get back to um it was not our intent sometimes I end up doing it and I I don't also like he's saying intend to but for some of the positions here we just get a insane amount of applicants and it's a little bit hard to keep track um you can keep bumping to get a response but in general uh you're
recognizing that it's a tough Market out there don't just apply to one place yeah and don't wait um dude I had not one your but two articles in my news feed like before even refreshing that were like I've applied to 900 jobs and like haven't gotten an interview and I've applied to 400 jobs and haven't gotten an interview it seems like it's getting hungry out there what a big part of the problem is uhoh uhoh uhoh uhoh spicy take incoming no oh okay AI written applications oh AI written cover letters
AI written applications application rates at jobs are going through the roof not in line with unemployment because the barrier to apply to places is lower than ever especially when they ask for cover letters and stuff because people just aren't writing them interesting and then the average quality of people's writing is going up because a lot of AI writing is better than the average person's  now tell me this if you're using AI to write your application and then they're
using AI to sort it Yep this is a whole thing how are how are the humans actually involved in this transaction current Year aw going to have to find some way to change the dynamic of how hiring works I don't know what the answer is but we go back to everything's in person you walk into a store and hand in a resume like your dad told you we meet potential employees at uh at like uh you know Events and Adventures we have to go back to online dating but for like jobs I I feel speed
speed applications you all get together  applications man crazy uh no do not show up here with a resume I'm just saying you know was you know what was very surprising to me when we did the um the screwdriver pop up sorry sorry sorry sorry Tim 0000 X3 and I actually do believe this my brother-in-law uses a "bot to apply to 1,000 jobs a day he got" 10 offers since he started zero before and people hear that so then they start doing that because if you're getting zero offers
you're desperate right you're going to do something this makes sense you have  so they're going to hear that then they're going to start doing that and now this person who was previously able to apply to I don't know maybe 50 jobs a day max is now applying to a thousand then you times that by a bunch of people and then all the workplaces have too many applications so it either takes them basically months to go through it which is what like some of the positions "I've had where I have 2,200 applicants"
like yeah it's going to take an obscene amount of time to go through it all um or they don't feel like doing all that work so they just sort it with some algorithm or AI reading thing or something so like there way this is broken basically and I'm not I'm genuinely I I have no clue what the next step is but I really hope I don't know some startup or something find some solution to to solve this because it's uh so it's bad uh at the Precision popup I noticed we had a little booth that was
like an lmg Bob's booth and I was Ariana and the uh the new HR oh shoot probation I think well whatever whoops um I'm pretty sure that's wrong  nice yeah let's go with that I'm going to say pretty sure but yeah cool anyway uh they were there and I dropped in and I was just like what are you guys doing here and they were like oh yeah it was uh it was someone in Management's idea and I'm like they're like why is it a problem I'm like no I just wouldn't have occurred to me in a thousand years to
have like an lmg jobs booth at at like a at like a product launch popup thing but I talked to them after the fact and they were like yeah we were actually like uh what's the not not bumping pumping bumping would be like club right yeah there they were like booming booming business with booming was was effectively what they said and I was like oh that is cool and I I guess in the context of this conversation that makes sense like we're going back to in human connections to Wild right
like that's not that's not what I was told growing up I was told you know send your resume maybe drop it off ask to speak to a hiring manager but like good luck none of them are going to talk to you by the time that advice made its way to me so yeah wild I don't know if I ever got a job out of the blue trying to think like I volunteered at the pool um oh dude what my family just oh yeah all of us my mom got into the film industry by biking up to a film set and like talking to the
director and then uh the director could tell they were in like the middle of nowhere so he was like yeah sure bring me your resume like today as like a joke and she actually biked all the way back home and then biked all the way back to the set and gave him a resume and he was like that's nuts sure you have a job and then she became that was a union position so she skipped the whole like you have to work through Indies to get into the Union thing because she technically got Union hours from that
meaning that she was in the union so then she was just working for like big Netflix shows immediately um almost all my early career jobs I just got by like basically showing up and being like I'll work right now I can  sure I'm sure my brother has similar stories my family's kind of yeah we've been all over that um huh yeah uh in response to your question how'd I get a job at NC I I was well known on their Forum they had thousands and thousands of posts they very much knew who I was before I showed
up with the resume kind of how sean got a job sort of he still had to like win the interview rounds or whatever like he had to go through the process but we absolutely knew who he was yeah um all right but yeah it it sucks out there it sucks real bad it sucks for both sides because I've gone to pretty crazy lengths and it's sometimes taken a long time to fill positions in in some of my teams because of the insane waves of applicants we'll get the most we ever got I think was like 22 2300 but
properly giving an appropriate amount of time to each one of the 2200 applications is brutal hold on a second who is Top Gear 1224 says he was Notorious actually what was your  TYC I want to know now new line is from The ncx Forum let's see if I let's see if I remember them or if I get to pull  are yeah we'll see if we get a response anyway sorry I got distracted there uh yeah no so like it it it sucks for the people putting in applications um and it also sucks for the other side
because I don't know that having an ocean of applicants actually means that you are for sure going to get like the best one cuz it's such a crapshoot when you're just going off of pieces of paper that try to describe a person it's like no dude depends on what they're applying for like if they're applying for a writing position position piece of paper's pretty good yeah maybe as long as they actually if the piece of paper is writing but are you actually getting the writing sample with the initial
application or are you just getting the resume and stuff and then you request the writing sample afterwards depends I mean a lot of the time you can at least if they actually wrote it you can tell a lot about someone's writing ability from their another problem because it's it's pretty easy like okay cool we have this super Neato um was this written by AI Checker except that so did the people that are trying to get past it so they can just make small edits until it says
0% like it doesn't mean anything um Top Gear was meing and tyback says you don't know me but you were impossible to miss on the NC forms that sounds likely yeah it's kind of my jam no there's no archive no key uh it's actually a real shame there was a lot of techn know lost there it was lowkey like kind of an amazing resource an amazing archive because the threads about products were tied to the bottom of the product page so if you browse the product archive you could find all this discussion about
products that was highly highly relevant and probably difficult to track down anywhere else it's it's a real shame that that site is just vanished Into The Ether now I I maintain that I would love to acquire the domain and IP and resurrect it but we have not been able to reach an agreement that I consider to be reasonable up until this time Taran asked me about it the other day though he was like do you like still want to do that sure like if you can negotiate it but the the offer that I got last time
was not had no basis in reality so it was very difficult for me to uh as time goes on too it's worth less and less like are they recognizing that I don't know I I mean I haven't talked to them about it in a while basically the last time I made offer it was pretty much based on the cost of a fourl letter.com and then plus like some um and then what they came back to me with was essentially an offer that um would have some kind of like long-term Revenue share and like a bunch of and I'm
sitting here going no you you understand that this brand is like completely trashed and worthless right like it's not um even the people who know what NCIX is know that it imploded spectacularly and was like shady at the end like it's it's the IP is worth nothing the brand is worth nothing it's a fouret with with people's personal information on them were auctioned off yeah yeah it's uh um the bitman asks if you got nc.com would you bring back the netl name no I think I think what I would do with
the NC channel is uh like a like a software and troubleshooting Channel I think that would be that would be the closest thing to sort of its origin story while also fitting in well with our current portfolio of channels I would I would love i' would love to do something like that yeah Top Gear asks is the issue the creditors or the seller or that's not really what they asked but whatever close enough uh it's a combination right because the ownership of the IP was not necessarily the corporate uh netlink
computer Inc so if I were to acquire it there could be some dispute as to who I was supposed to pay for it um and none of that as far as I can tell has been legally resolved and no one who's involved has any interest or any motivation to resolve it until someone comes in with a bag of money so it's kind of a chicken and egg problem so I just think it's just going to I just think it's going to just languish forever and I think that's also something that the seller doesn't
understand is the baggage Associated and the risk associated with digging up this this corpse um could be diseased they'll just never sell it though I mean they'll die eventually but that's that's not them selling it no no I I just mean like you know I I remember telling my wife at some point she wanted me to like pick something up and I was like any problem goes away if you wait long enough she's like no I'm like no really I mean yeah eventually we're all just going to you
know Big Crunch or whatever the current theory is for How the Universe ends eventually the fact that humans were on this planet will be irrelevant eventually eventually yeah sure when the sun just goes wh wait we digging up corpses to eat no no no just roadkill I want to I want to be US president it's recycling um all right what are we talking about more topics oh sure yeah uh this week in AI strawberries UI benefits and meta being meta do do you want to do the AI Roundup yeah some
pretty interesting stuff this week I wasn't sure I didn't know that uh strawberry was actually 01 um I don't know I didn't dive super into that so maybe the person who wrote this is is correct I just I didn't think that was the case but I didn't verify this or anything um so maybe it is I'm not really sure but uh either way I'll go through the talking points regardless and then if you guys want to look that up if you care at all then that sure um but I'll go through the talking points
open AI has unveiled its new strawberry AI language star star star just I thought it was strawberry for days it is strawberry oh it's starberry in the dock why does our why do our notes say starberry yeah I thought it was strawberry gosh darn it notes okay well that's fine handyman is saying it is strawberry 01 I think he means strawberry 01 I think he means that it's look if you want real news go watch a different show this is just us talking I do have some cool stuff to show for this
but yeah okay so strawberry I guess it is the same thing thank you handyman I believe handyman um so they unveiled their new strawberry AI language model which the company says has significantly improved reasoning and problem solving abilities the new model's official name is open ai1 with initial versions available now which are 01 preview and 01 mini open AI says that 01 preview outdoes GPT 40 in competitive programming mathematics and scientific reasoning users however say
that this Improvement is far from Global and comes with significant delay due to the multi-step processing occurring behind the scenes before answering a query and before before we move move on to other this week in AI topics I want to go over some of the things that I did oh Luke did a thing so one of the examples that they had was how many e are in the word strawberry which is I think why or sorry how many RS how many RS are e or RS yeah RS I did E because I wanted to switch it up so how many RS
are in strawberry and hold on is this a trick question three no it used to say two it used to say two so previous models would say two because it it couldn't like count very well it didn't have oh it it couldn't like deconstruct problems things like that um okay so I dumped oh I zooming a little don't want to show you all that anyways I already did that's fine we're doing some stuff with ovh it's going to be cool um I copied some texts that I had and had it count the amount of e
that were in it and it did it and then I was like I don't want to verify that so I made a smaller amount and then asked it to count that and then I did verify and they were correct so it can count that properly now which is cool okay I didn't know that was hard that was that was not super easy and then I looked up a uh a calculus question a fairly basic one as far as my understanding goes and I compared its answer to um what the internet said and it sound like it was pretty correct
ignore this part uh do you mind zooming a little on the calculus question yeah just in general do you mind zooming a little is no it's not Control Plus okay uh but yeah it's interesting it came to the same final conclusion that I found in in answer banks on the internet which was interesting and then this is a question that I had shown on Wow before that it couldn't answer which was this New York Times game with the rules of the game and then can it do it basically right oh it totally
did so that was wrong oh it was uh because I was trying to see so this new the o1 preview you can't do attachments so I was trying to see if I switch to a previous model like gbg4 and do an attachment can then I can I then switch to 01 preview and make it read the attachment the answer is no um it no longer allows you to switch the second that you have an attachment um but I just fed it the information this way instead of inserting a picture so I just laid it out for it basically yeah it took 62
seconds but it was not wrong it won the game wow instantly well inant seconds yeah I then kind of realized you know Works instantly 62 seconds of the time I I mean more like the first time it tried but um so the challenge here oh I don't think I even  it okay I didn't actually ask it to do it in six words yes Christopher we do I didn't ask it to do it in six words but the goal this time was to do it in six words sometimes they'll be like oh dude try to do it in four words or whatever
and when I play with Emma usually we try to beat the amount that it asks you to beat it in so it says six words we'll try to do it in four words or whatever else um so I then asked it after I did it right away the first time I said can you do it in as few words as possible because that's not in the rules so it wasn't aiming to necessarily do it in as few words as possible and then we went way off the rails uh this was rough um after y we need a word starting with k so we can consider the last
letter of koi as K by rearranging the sequence slightly which is not a thing at all um additionally alternative we can add a bridging word if necessary which is necessary and then it just didn't do it and decided the last letter of koi was k um which um is a really different misspelled sort of not how that works so I tried to work with it and then it ended up answering but it answered like sort of multiple times in one answer and also the final one was actually eight words and it was like congratulations
you won using eight words and I was like that's uh that's worse six uh so yeah I don't know um it's not a silver bullet and in classic open AI fashion they're being a little closed about how it works um nice but it is interesting you can see it sort of think like throw throw a question at me and I'll show you how it how it in quotes thinks because this part's actually important um sorry what do you want you want a question throw throw something at me to throw it it uh um what's better a zip up hoodie or a
pullover sure why not I don't know like you're putting me on the spot here I don't know if that's a smart question  not but let's see so when it does this whole thinking thing we'll see if it actually has to think yeah okay so we can see what it does evaluating hoodie  yeah cool it's very neutral very good um but you can see the steps that it took noticing convenience and style offer adjustable designs and Casual Aesthetics while pull over hoodies excel in warmth and simplicity and I I wanted
to dive more into it I wanted to try to play chess against it to see its spatial reasoning but I didn't have time um but I was I was chatting back and forth with Wendell about this for a second these are odd these are weird oh yeah noticing convenience in style did it notice that did that happen they're like they're very humanized ways of doing this right but is it actually different from what it was doing before it's uh I think I feel like they're trying to make it more
approachable and friendly by humanizing it mhm and I don't know if I like that and I wonder if this is part of the the contention that has led to certain people leaving um open AI cuz this is like genuinely kind of  um I think they just Generate random text to it cuz like this is all factors that would have had to be considered by any other previous model anyway so if the only difference is that like and how do they how do they prove that this has anything to do with the actual model training anyway like I
don't why would open AI be motivated to show us any part of the of the narrowing down and categorization that helped it to understand my two comparatives here well originally they were supposed to be open and now they're like the least open version um so I think that's why they would show us but I I think in my opinion the reason why they're showing these steps is they're trying to justify the time taken which is that does make sense this is why it's taking time um because it's not blitzing
towards one answer it's trying to compartmentalize the the question that you asked and then solve each section individually and then bring an answer to you um to to deal that's like the the whole reasoning steps and stuff I haven't done enough research on how this works yet this broke yesterday I've had no time but um it's it's definitely interesting it is worse than old models at certain things um some people have called that like an overthinking problem H where sometimes
the the solution is like easier than it tries to make it um and by in quotes again overthinking um it it causes some problems here and there but yeah they don't show it actually it's faking they hide it for competition yeah  like I was saying they're they're they're very strongly humanizing what it's doing they're not they're not it's not exactly what's happening that's fairly obvious it doesn't work that way it's not noticing anything yeah um but then was it all wasn't it kind of already like
friendly yeah see the difference by doing that drop down it feels like you're trying to look behind the curtain I see and there's another curtain and I don't think like in the same way that people used to argue with me before it was to look on the internet they're like no it is looking on the internet do you remember that yeah yeah people AR going to get this I see and I I don't I don't necessarily think that's good you know in other news speaking of things that are not that great uh the state of
Nevada has announced that it has paid $1.3 million for a Google powered AI system that will assess unemployment claims using evidentiary documents and transcripts from appeals hearings and recommend to a human referee whether to approve or deny benefits Nevada officials promise that every case will receive human review and they expect the new system will eliminate the backlog of cases that has existed since the pandemic by reducing the time it takes to write a determination from several
hours to just 5 minutes in some cases here's my question how do you do a human review in 5 minutes of something that used to take several hours unless you're just mostly going along with what the AI said I I don't know how realistic what I'm saying is but I've also been reading some stuff about how the you know the whole like get a a chat gbt or whatever style program to help you with the thing and then review the output before you submit that's being followed through less these days well yeah
dude fixing a bad output in some cases as someone whose entire job for a lot of the last probably eight or n years has involved a significant amount of taking other people in this case other people's output and fixing it is actually a significantly higher mental burden than just thinking about it and putting it down for myself in the first place whether we're talking about script review or whether we're talking about like a like a a planning document for an event or whatever the case may be
um imagine iming for a second that by having the AI do the work that someone can just review it and it like and that those skills even are necessarily transferable or or fully transferable is so naive you also have to understand humans right like someone's going to fall behind and need to catch up because their boss is mad at them and they're feeling like they're going to lose their job so they just start stamping things  I don't like this um it clearly still hallucinates it clearly still
does is able to be lightly pushed into problems that are not super easy to detect if you're not really looking through stuff um it's not ready for these types of scenarios and meta Global privacy director recently admitted during an Australian Senate inquiry that the company has been using public photos and posts on its social platforms from his farb is 2007 to train its AI models meta claims they only scraped accounts of  18 is this even news no uh and Google's notebook LM app now has a feature called
audio overview which can summarize the documents it's given into a lively bantering conversation between two AI hosts essentially a fully automated podcast that actually sounds complete completely unhinged and I would  that I would we should just feed the W document to it see how it does yeah see how it does see how accurate it is I'd be I'd be I'd be actually pretty down if you did this with the I don't know the automated meeting notes that you get if if you try to have something automatically take like
exactly transcribe what people say from meetings it's hilarious anyways it's wrong all the time oh yeah 100 they are 100% oh dude dude dude dude dude dude dude dude oh have I have I shown you this I I got a clip uh hold on this is amazing oh I should send it to Dan do I have it I wiped my phone a little while ago so I actually don't know if I have this clip on my phone anymore I'm so upset right now oh let's see if it sync to Google photos my Google photos is a little messed up though so things don't
always syn there okay well I do do do a thing real if you don't mind I'm going to see if I can find this uh Google the way back machine when Google search deprecated its cash feature earlier this year Google liaison Danny Sullivan expressed a hope to compensate for the loss of the feature by linking to the way back machine now according to a blog post from the internet archive that hope is now a reality Google likewise confirmed that search will be linking to these archived
websites uh users will be able to find these results by clicking the three three dots next to a particular link and searching the more about this page option on the about this result panel uh which is actually pretty cool so that's that's good news yeah I thought that was super cool that's cool um being able to find way back machine stuff better is is pretty pretty excite um some actually really are you still looking I think I found it but I am Dan do I have just like a a
standing share folder with you yet uh no but you can just send it to me on chat if you want nah all right well they do that uh some other really good news actually uh we're all in gab's family valve is officially rolling out steam families for all users family allows up to six members of a household to play any game from their shared Library this includes the ability of multiple people to play multiple games from the same library at the same time or the same game if the library contains multiple
copies so cool the previous Family Sharing system blocked playing multiple games from the same Library if the owner was already playing a game which was really inconvenient for me CU if I wanted to play tape to tape over in the Lan area and someone's playing Beat saber over on the TV I couldn't I couldn't do that so you had to go sign in a stupid other account it's just a pain in the butt if you're not playing the same game at the same time and you're a family living in the same house
this totally makes sense I love Family Sharing I've been in the beta for a while I I love it I love it I love it I love it and uh it's great and everything else needs it dude uh the kids wanted to the kids want to try ano yeah and I was like I like logged into up play and I'm like these guys are so far behind how so what I have to log in as a parent I have to log my kid into my Ubisoft connect account in order for them to play this game like the we've gone so far backward from discs and then now steam
has caught up to discs and then P discs in everything but resale resale is still something we got to solve here valve but like dude I was just I was looking at it going this is this is ridiculous it's like dinosaur I'd rather I'd rather they just like not bother playing the game like I just don't want to I don't want to deal with this platform at all this is such this is an absolute game changer for steam users it should be noted you can't just willy-nilly change families
there's a one-year cool down so you can just be like yeah yeah I'll just like join a family and then dip and then join a different family according to what's most convenient for our shared game library but you also like uh so the next note is a counselor that his children will be unable to leave the group unless kicked out by a parent while parents can leave at any time once a user joins they crash the car man now you got real leverage I'm going kick you out of the steam family no dad I want to play the
games I wonder about that rule actually it says once a user joins a family they'll have to wait a year before joining another as a as a child of a family that you may have conflict with is that weird it seems like it might be weird I wonder if once you're a certain age you can just leave anyways I don't know probably yeah cuz your age is determined by your birth date anyway not by telling it how old you are like in Steam oh yeah yeah yeah you don't say I am 13 you say I was born in this year so it should be
fine yeah yeah uh yes sound is very important contact steam they can't just do it willy-nilly I am a little worried if there's like any identifiable information in the video is there anything that needs to be blurred oh what is this don't worry about it don't worry about it okay just don't worry about it okay uh no it looks like it should be fine you're thinking about sharing to stream but I can't see what it is yeah yeah well cuz it's a surprise for you oh okay yeah it's a surprise okay on your
own on my own laptop oh well I didn't think of that did I not no no no no I can do it on my own laptop um makes the sound this was taken in August so so this was taken a little over a month ago and this basically summarizes in a nutshell why I just completely don't believe anything I hear from Google about the usefulness of digital assistance I've talked a fair bit about how utterly bloody useless my voice voice assistant always are for me so no matter what the demo is whether it's
that stupid camera that was supposed to take a picture whenever it was the right time because AI or whether it's like your assistant supposed to like book an appointment for you and it's somehow at the right time and the person on the other side isn't mad about it just like all these things and I I hear from you guys like oh yeah no like it works great for me I'm sitting here going the amount of time you waste getting this stuff to work compared to the amount of time it
would take to just call your stylist and make an appointment I'm sorry I just don't buy it assistant is a more convenient alarm setter this is the this is the kind of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that I deal with just about every bloody time I try to use the thing okay so Dan do I have audio so your laptop's currently playing something so let's make sure that stops before we play this your laptop's playing something there we go and I'm going to turn that on and we should be able to hear it too I hope yeah go for
it you guys got audio for me no I don't have it here does Luke hear it we should turn on C can't hear it on C I'm not I'm not hitting it anymore I'm just making that noise stream does stream has it oh stream has it I don't know why we don't wait but Luke can't hear it nope well how that gosh darn it let's just watch Dan until he fixes it I mean you got to play audio or I can't oh I see yeah I don't know let's look at him very intently why aren't we getting it I want to listen does it look like I'm
looking at him I'm trying to look at his portrait oh oh we were just going to look at him I guess we could look at him he's he like behind a monitor though this feels this feels like more like if he if he's looking at the preview of the show then like this is like intense like we're like yeah yeah we're overseeing micromanagement I think I know what haven't you press that key on your keyboard slightly too slowly see how effective this is yeah he's he's going to fix it because we're looking
that's I'm going to have to take the stream down to fix it we uh really we probably shouldn't do that let me let me see what I can do if we go set this to seven we can solve all the problems start to apply changes no I'm not going to do that we we can solve all the problems lmg has if we just have two managers per employee and then they just stand over them yeah it's very effective they'd work probably twice as hard that's what construction does and it's very it's very efficient and and
there's never cost over runs construction sites worker and Friends uh and to be clear and like he said timelines never get exceeded no disrespect to the people who are working hard on construction sites it just when you drive past them the Optics aren't great yeah oh the honestly the road workers I understand almost more because a lot of the times it's the whole hurry up and wait situation the whole crew can't be working at the same time you have to wait for some process to finish
but it just you know when you walk by and there's four people looking at the one guy in the hole who's dating it's just like yeah but sometimes the hole is too small and only one person can do it I also anytime people bring up that argument it's just like yeah and then you go to work and sit on your darn phone anyways like there's I have a solution assuming that on the side of the road turn up your laptop speakers just because what you happen to be doing is inconvenienced by these workers not
having been done their job already doesn't mean that you're also not lazy  up um my solution is my job isn't broadcast uh to thousands of people I mean yeah it is okay hold on hold on hold on hold on okay uh my solution is dumber than yours but also might actually work a little bit better than yours at the same so I'm going to hit play at the same time and then Luke can just listen to it slatch it on my phone oh well you oh yeah I guess I'll have to do it okay uh we ready okay so let's switch to Linus
laptop oh Dan why are you hanging out in the middle of my car console okay here we go 1 two 3 yvon  yvon who do you want to call Ivon ho she's right here who do you want to  Ghostbusters sorry who do you want to call Ivon ho who do you want to call Ivonne who do you want to  ho who do you want to it's brutal that it's writing it too that's so bad actually it's writing it out prop the Ghostbusters was very funny the best part is that that interface as soon as I deactivate like
the voice assistant the top contacts thing goes away I can't I can't touch it I can't touch it I'm like come on while the voice thing is up can you touch it uh no no it doesn't work because it because the voice thing is overlay yeah yeah yeah oh that's so annoying dude and to be clear I use that function all the time and it does work a lot of the time it works just often enough that I depend on it and then so when it doesn't work it's just another another potential W for the old Acura
when I want to call people I press the phone button on the steering wheel that's me pressing the phone button on the steering wheel and then I have dial that just goes through my speed dial I actually and I am a boring person so honestly the top four people in my speed dial it's pretty much all I need and I have give me your phone oh it won't be through there am I on your speed dial yeah but I mean in my I'm talking in my car car okay my goodness look I'm insecure okay I just  relationship the same spot
I'm number number two suggested after the literal GF nice hold on hold on let's see oh I don't actually okay so this is interesting I I use T9 yeah so you'll see the way that I uh the way like when I open my dialer it literally just has me dialing random numbers so with that in mind yeah I only have like my recents I just clicked like which is just 50% Ivon and then like some random other people you can it's like a hilarious and unknown numbers for the most most part well those are
incoming oh yeah yeah so and if I were to if I were to do like uh outgoing only it would be probably about 80% Ivon I call almost no one but my wife I don't do like speed dial on my phone is there a speed dial thing yeah speed di is still a thing you can like oh yeah okay I have a favorite section there is that is that better that might be even better dang okay so it's it's Dad brother girlfriend and lonus and Mom I uh so the the one that you're looking at here um yeah this this is this is fine right yep
the one that you're looking at here I set this up when there were only about 10 to 12 people in the company so I set it up with um basically you and Ivonne and then I think it's just like alphabetical so I still have a bunch of people that don't even work here anymore that are in like this top contact like the I forgot there was even a favorite thing on my phone I don't use that yeah speed dial dude speed dial is dead yeah like it's really easy to use you just go like this
and then assign but I just I'm never going to use that because I can totally just okay I misclicked but but I can I have you that quickly by just because once you have T9 memorized it's quick it's so fast to call people T9 dude iOS 18 adding T9 dialing is way too much of the reason that I'm willing to try it I believe you I can't call people without dialing that's like and the only person I call is my wife so it's stupid that's like uh phone screening for me is an actual
required feature I'm not going to switch phones if it doesn't have phone screening at this point yeah just won't happen yeah um yeah I don't know like I don't I don't I I cannot think of a possible feature that a phone could have that is going to override my desire to have phone screening at this point with how many spam callers there are I'm using phone screening like every other day xw2 asks do you guys think your social situation may change considering the text bubble change in
iOS 18 on my end it's prohibitive with my one friend being singled out as the only Android User how do I say this gently xw2 you and the rest of your friends are fing ass holes switch to a crossplatform  special you're welcome Urban fer said iPhones have screening I thought yeah so I would consider them I'm I'm just saying this is I'm I'm not saying there aren't Alternatives he's also saying iPhones have T9 dialing now I'm just saying that is a required thing for me if if one of the brand if pixels stopped
having it I would no longer use pixels  rubber Nick says how do you know what they are doing lonus the fact that it matters that anyone is on Android or iOS tells me what they're doing that's ridiculous it's so stupid speed dial is not T9 recursive T9 the amount of time I've spent arguing about T9 dialing with people who just I think most people have literally no idea what it is don't understand what it is and don't want to understand what it is I've explained it so many times and you
you don't need to but if you don't understand what it is don't argue about it that's it someone says what is it oh man okay I'm going to explain it I'll explain it I'll explain it I'm going to explain it again okay you know how on your phone when you open up like the dialer screen with the numbers if you start typing someone's number right it'll start autocompleting the rest of the number that made a ton of sense back in the early 2000s when people memorized phone numbers which also no area codes yeah
yeah and phone numbers were a lot shorter phone numbers were seven digits when I was a boy we didn't need area code to dial the area code unless it was long distance anyway um okay there's another way to start dialing numbers where instead of dialing the numbers okay so the two area codes here are are the two main ones in our area are 778 and 604 okay so if I dial 778 in the modern era that's going to autocomplete literally half the people in my phone book and if I type 604 so it's not narrowing it down
much I've typed three numbers and it hasn't really done much but if you look closely and this is a remnant of a very long time ago when it was really great for marketing to have your phone number for your business that you would expect people to maybe memorize I hope because that's how people would remember phone numbers was by memorizing them if you could have the phone number of your business correspond to a word so say for example you were a business that um did house cleaning then you might want your
number to be um one two clean you know okay so numbers correspond to letters two is ABC 3 is DF four is ghi and so on and so forth so what you can do is you can dial the numbers that correspond to the name of the person you're trying to call and it narrows it down way faster  5853 that could be luke it could  be it's probably Luke right so as as soon as you've typed probably three numbers at most four unless you have an enormous contact list you have probably surfaced the person
you're trying to call and on Samsung anyway you can text with a swipe to the left and you can call with a swipe to the right so for me being pretty fast I can call Luke in okay well here I don't know give me a  Jake that was that was pretty quick I saw it come up I didn't see the whole thing I saw slow which slowed me down but like I said the the he typed three numbers and then a list of people came up and I could I could I couldn't see it very clearly but I saw Jake's profile
photo I recognized his Prof so probably in about half a second I can call someone it completely negates any need for me to have any kind of favorites or ever dig around in my address book and that's the reason that it's f f is because for whatever reason when you go to contacts you then have to click search you then have to start typing it's so many more interactions with the device when what you should be doing is just dialing the numbers according to the letters and it goes through your
entire address book which when your address book is as big as mine um can be a challenge and and admittedly it's not as big as it used to be like back when I was handling um all of like our brand relations on the sponsor side and product procurement and also the team and and and and and um you know the the random people that I might call um list was a lot longer like these days yeah I mostly just call my wife but I'm definitely used to it I'm definitely used to just you know doing that and you
can put businesses in there too like if I want to call my vet I'll just type uh here hold on I have to close the stupid address book that I opened like a caveman so I just type 838 and boom my vets there assuming that I actually put my vet in my uh in my address book which I oh you know what I probably I probably did but it's probably under uh Fraser Animal Hospital there you go so uh 3727 I don't actually I couldn't tell you like if you ask me right now like what is the number code for calling Dan Dan 3
to six I want to say six nice nice but there was like some computation there but yeah I don't I don't have to think about it if I'm dialing so it's one of those things where it's just like if you if it works for you great and if you don't want to memorize all of that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] just don't and don't care and just not be bothered by the fact that T9 dialing is there for everybody else because it doesn't affect anyone other than the people who use it it's totally fine uh Jeron de
says I learned about T9 dialing from you changed my life best tech tip ever yeah it's just it just it drives me bananas um when I'll explain it like this and then people will look back at me like a stupid like no it's not stupid it just doesn't matter it's not for and that's fine but it isn't stupid yeah I don't use it I think it's cool I think if you're a person who's like invested in it it's it's pretty sweet I there are definitely use cases where I think it would be kind of nice but looking at my
phone and the people that I call uh I don't call that many people the favorites tab is fine and honestly I don't even use that I can pretty much just operate out of recent oh dude especially in my car when I can't rely on my voice styling recent is like a godsend I'm usually trying to callon anyway in in my car the the top contact is Emma yeah to call her in my car is yeah probably half a second because I I'll move both hands simultaneously I'll press the the foam button on the
steering wheel and then just enter on the middle of the like dial thing because she's the first one and when you press phone it goes directly to the favorite so it's just like rip calling nice amazing and then if it's basically you or anyone in my family it's just like one or two dial clicks and then enter and it's right there it's like okay cool zaku asks silly question is "Taran eligible for the $5,000 Tech" upgrade series I don't think exec are eligible at least not anymore we did
Colton though and we did Ivon come to think of it are exec eligible I think some have opted out I'm not 100% sure I don't know how it works all I know is that the the float plane Peeps are Elijah  eligible if I ever get pulled I'm taping Elijah to a pole so he can't do anything in my house I wouldn't blame you we could actually just have like an Elijah cam yeah sure that would just be in the corner of the entire video so it would show what Elijah was doing taped to the
pole while and I wereing on it aped down and we could give him like little puzzles or something to play with yeah like little finger puppets or and then and then we can make sure there's a monitor nearby with like Subway Surfers so he can just oh good have like you know distractions so he doesn't just like start tweaking out yeah having withdrawals yeah that's good Elijah we got you we're thinking about we're thinking of you we'll make sure it's comfortable uh okay what what else are
we supposed to be talking about okay yeah Subway servers oh God he's in now he's he's there are two more topics left uh long form videos in the shorts feed somebody on the subreddit posted a screenshot of a long form YouTube video being displayed as a short according according to Google's support page they are conducting a few experiments with the watch page to increase discoverability across channels formats and lengths of YouTube which could mix could include a mix of video formats
including long form videos where you'd  kind of weird I get the motivation I get it too there's no money in shorts not for creators not for YouTube it's it's very small like we did that we had that short a couple weeks ago that did like eight or n million views on that little like underwater scooter Mig thing and compared to a long form video that did that kind of viewership to be clear it's really hard to get that kind of viewership on a long form video by comparison but compared to a long form
video that did those kinds of numbers H like a fraction it's like I I think the I think the monetization rate is like a 20th or a 30th or a 40th or something like that like it's some it's some tiny tiny amount by comparison so sorry I thought you were done so I can I can see them wanting to convert shorts viewers to a longer video watching session I don't know that having letter boxing and pillar box or whatever or like gigantic letter boxing I guess is how it shows up I I don't know that
that's the solution but um that's my biggest push back to be honest is the formatting is weird I can see why they want to do it and I can see why creators would be interested in it as well because short form content is very much seen as a funnel somewhere else whether it's to your courses that you offer to your merch to your long form videos Almost nobody sees it as um or like uh something that gets a lot of ey so you can sell sponsorships or product placements like almost nobody is
treating shorts like the end it's a means yeah uh Elijah pointed out short to Long conversion is so bad though less than 1% so that's true and I don't think that's at all surprising if you look at how the mechanism of shorts works it's notree I think is the idea yes there are also if you look into it some really interesting strategies being employed by creators to improve their short to Long conversion and I promise you there are certain creators that have way higher conversion rates than that I also think
there's other forms of conversion rate like one of the most interesting short strategies that I've seen is uh a Creator who they didn't take a slice out of their video it's a genuinely Unique Piece of content but it's related to an upcoming video and it's really interesting and it makes you want to know more and then that video comes out so they use it as a trailer almost hours later or a day later so yeah it's basically a trailer and you won't see any conversion on that effectively
because there's nothing for them to go to watch but it it might give you a stronger click-through rate on that first notification because these viewers are primed to be interested in this piece of content got it and then they see that content follow through really interesting idea there's a bunch of interesting angles that creators are taking uh um but nokki asks didn't you guys get sponsored by nexo to make shorts answering people's Tech questions how's that sponsorship Revenue compared to full video
sponsorship um I don't know how much they paid uh but I would assume that it is less than like fulllength videos like vods and more than if we just uploaded shorts without any sponsorship uh we we uploaded a short the other uh yesterday I think oh no to he we uploaded a short today that's actually doing pretty good it's a um it's reacting to the cardboard laptop oh yeah yeah Evan and Caitlyn made met them at Matt Pat's uh retirement party almost said funeral he's alive as far as I
know now yeah oh my goodness yeah you just ominously add that at the end  another 80 years maybe oh my goodness um yeah that's cool though that's good yep good job team is Uber engaging in Pay discrimination nonprofit news organization more perfect union recently conducted an experiment where they brought together several Uber andyt drivers and had them log into log into a shift and plac their phones next to each other on a table they found that the drivers were consistent instantly
offered different pay for the same jobs with lift price swings being the most drastic sometimes this variation was only a few cents difference but it could also vary by as much as $3 wow due to the blackbox nature of Uber's algorithm it is unclear why any given driver was offered different pay according to an Uber blog post upfront pay may be affected by GPS location estimated arrival time promotional offers and surge heat maps that refresh every few seconds however these should have been
larger accounted for by having all of the drivers in the same place at the same time however this pay may also vary depending on tests that are being run by Uber our discussion question is is this pay discrimination and what is the likelihood that Uber can or is using this system to minimize driver pay uh that second part 100% as for whether it's pay discrimination that's harder to say because they would have to prove that they're discriminating based on some kind of protected attribute of the
drivers also these drivers all the same rating is rating allowed to play into their their income does it play into their income is it just a a way to get kicked out of the program basically there's a lot of questions to ask here I just thought it was interesting it's interesting that there's variance yeah I mean it makes sense that if they're going to play around with the rate that you pay they're also going to play around with the rates that they pay totally and I would absolutely see them using this to
minimize the amount that they pay while maximizing the amount that they extract I mean that's literally the name of the game that's how business works yeah hey float plane updates speaking of business yeah have you ever wondered why the W show is late all the time to answer that oh my God this is a monthly series apparently to answer that question people like the first one we have a monthly series called why is when late that just launched yesterday um and is apparently already
beloved so Sammy has been going around in the leadup to WAN show and talking to people about what's going on in the leadup to WAN show especially when we are late and there's some pretty good behind the scenes you can kind of see what it's like on a Friday around here this is this is pretty old this is from I mean yeah obviously when you were at um Defcon at Defcon yeah and you're getting a fair bit of great and the beard oh yeah dang yeah not the hair so much the beard for sure
well you have a really favorable um hair color to hide it oh yeah my gray has been coming in for a while but because I have a little bit of like blonde highlighting it's been hard to hard to uh hard to tell it's pretty obvious now though I don't care I thought I was going to be bald yeah me too I'll take it dude I'm so stoked to have gray hair like you're apparently supposed to look to the men on your mother's side yeah I didn't know that dude my grandpa went bald in high
school oh my grandpa had hair the whole time okay then yeah so yeah I didn't I didn't know that though so I just look at my dad and be like well like I had written off having hair I assume by the time I was like 25 I'd be yeah gone Y and I didn't care about that which to be clear yeah is fine yeah I was like whatever I guess that'll happen I guess I I could pick it seriously though so there's so many bald dudes I don't know who cares and then when I figured out like that isn't
happening it was like fairly neutral I guess cuz I had accepted it so much that I was just like whatever and now it's like oh I guess I'll have it but it'll be gray that's fine I don't know I just I I don't care yeah I some people some people get really like self-conscious about it really really really really into it like I was quite taken aback when I was on lwig stream and he goes hairline Che Caroline check and I'm like like he does that with his he does that with his stream like very regularly and
then he's like oh you're you're doing pretty good for 37 uh are you on the are you on the finest ride and I'm like sorry what is that what even is that I only know what it is because we had this conversation it's like a a hair thinning drug um I thought mine was worse well it it's mostly here it's mostly here that it's going to recede more uh so yeah you could you could see I'm defin I'm definitely receding but I don't know it just uh I think like I respected my dad the whole time I was
growing up my dad was bald the whole time I was growing up so I just I never cared at all yeah apparently that drug can be dangerous so I'm I'm not endorsing it yeah it wasn't an endorsement y like I don't even know if it's legal in Canada there's all kinds of drugs in the states that like thing up here yeah supplements too anyway uh it follows both lus and Luke um after 4:30 p.m. and we're even tracking who's the latest so go check it out we're also bringing back another
special week on float plane Riley week Riley week we'll go live with a few specials centered around Riley we talk more about it next week and maybe even show a little teaser of what's to come so make sure you guys are subscribed to float plane and now it's time for when after dark yeah Dan you want to change the color  Dan nice nice after dark nice nice nice  nice you know what would be nice some merch messages yeah do we go back to the way we started the show and be all gentle and soft or Hi l
I moved last weekend and in the confusion the Mover stole my PC have you had any PCs stolen uh how do you prevent theft in such cases I had a pocket PC stolen it's kind of my fault I left it behind in a nice rink oh um and then when I went back it wasn't there anymore and that thems the brakes uh that was pre like pins like literally the if the battery died on that device it completely factory reset like it was just yeah that was that was a real thing by the way that was
terrible yep yep I I don't think I've ever had uh I don't think I've oh uh okay I think this isn't what you mean but like we've had equipment stolen but not like my computer I've been I've been very I've been very lucky yeah I uh I have never had one stolen I do take measures um you know General house security is that's not going to help you when movers take it so I I have no real tips for stopping the movers from taking it that's that's a rough one um when I'm traveling with like laptops and stuff
um even if I'm not tired if I'm just like sitting down in an airport I never like I don't like just put my bag on the seat next to me because there's a chance I'll look this way and it will be to my back and someone might just take it and walk away and I might not notice um I'll like tie it to myself or wear it or something or like it can even be pretty simple like I'll put the bag down uh I'll I'll kind of like hook my foot through the shoulder strap while I'm sitting down like it's not even a
noticeable movement really and just make it so that if you were going to pick up the bag you'd be picking up my whole leg and then just like whatever and I'll just keep it that way um might have had a beater laptop taken from the back of my Civic once when it was broken into but I remember at the time not even being sure if it was in there like it really didn't matter yeah uh so maybe my the first laptop I ever bought still works this would that Asus thing pre that oh really yeah that Asus thing also
still works I've never actually had it to someone the the like brown one right yeah okay yeah bamboo um yeah yeah sweet steal a bag get a free Luke yeah basically it's one way look at it he DL I recently installed a smart panel and apparently my network closet and officer pulling 12200 Watts total constantly any tips for how I can bring down my $600 monthly electric bill for the network closet there's not much you're going to be able to do other than buy new stuff and it I mean f $600 a
month oh man power must be way more expensive where you are they're saying home office and stuff too right the they just they added monitoring they didn't say home office they said my network closet and office office home office well you guys are assuming that it's home yeah otherwise you wouldn't care about the electricity bill you might if you pay utilities and your true I don't know I think we forget that our electricity is cheap here yeah no I think this I think the electricity there
is just really expensive without reducing what your electronics are doing or what what your things drawing power are doing the only way you can really do stuff is like get more efficient like power supplies or something like that 1200 watts constant that's a lot is a lot yeah 2 240 would improve efficiency a little bit but we're talking like you know 3 to 5% maybe percentages yeah yeah so maybe you're saving like you know 20 bucks a month and whatever that upgrade is costing you it's going to take a
minute to I'm really wondering like the what is what is the constantly what is running constantly that's taking that much power because there might be um some things that you can do uh where you can run like scheduled systems to to shut things down or something that's that's a lot to pull constantly dude like are you running AC overnight oh yeah like AC could be a big part of it Tim says I'm in Massachusetts I have a "home lab I spend $1,000 a month in" electricity yeah we're really lucky that
our power comes from falling water here um yeah you gota other than buying new stuff that is more modern or doing less with it shutting it down when you're not using it putting it on a schedule I don't know what to tell you cuz utility power cost what utility power costs I mean you could put up solar panels um that's an option I mean you're spending a lot in order to to make these upgrades but like it's also costing you a lot to not make them so it almost seems like you'd have
to I feel like it's got to be because he said constantly my interpretation of that is like even at 4 in the morning when no one's there so my assumption is that certain things just need to be shut down whether that's AC or else maybe the computer 1200 watts like that doesn't even account for having AC running yeah it's not enough is it yeah it's got to be he's leaving the computer on constantly shut her down put it to sleep hibernate it yeah do something I feel like something can change
H up next lus the closet gamer you have said in the past that you didn't agree with some of the decision lmg what were they who made those decisions then oh man there's all kinds of decisions that I don't necessarily agree with big company now I could probably just search my email I mean even in the earlier days um yeah I'm just going to search my email for the phrase I don't agree s by hold oh my God there's so many uh hold on well yeah I'd kind of hope so at this point to be honest we've
been around for so long if he didn't disagree that many times like uh he's like too agreeable at that point okay I search for which we know is not a problem okay uh GDB sometimes I don't agree with  good my position can change on things no exactly that's reasonable  to I don't foresee the results no I mean hm I uh man what could I oh I'm going to search for try anything twice cuz that's a line I often use when people suggest something to me  uh okay uh this is regarding the compilation of scrapyard Wars my
response is just try anything twice I support it I do and I said I no okay I didn't this I didn't really have an opinion on man I guess a lot of this would take place like via chat Luke can you think of something we did that I was like I don't agree but let's try it anyway like I feel like there's definitely been I promise you this has happened a bunch of times I can't really think of like a particular example like there's there's definitely concepts for videos that I've been like I don't
agree um but we can try it and see how it goes or like like titling a video where I'm like okay yeah yeah go ahead and try it um I don't think that's the best approach I can't find anything right now though I can't think of a particular one off the top of my head but I know there is videos back in the day that we'd go back and forth on and you'd let me try stuff and sometimes it would work and you were wrong and sometimes it wouldn't work at all and you were right and it's  go okay
um all right well I don't know do you want to do you want to do another one and I'll I'll keep trying to find something in the meantime sure do you have any for me Dad yeah I know that there's one or two in here let's see if I can find it ah hey lldd Luke what's your favorite Leanback game to relax with these days Oh I thought of something oh okay never mind look shut up uh we're doing it uh we're doing a fairly costly uh customer survey oh yeah yeah um I don't agree I I told I told uh the senior
management team that I don't think it's the best possible use of money I think that a lot of the things we're looking to learn from it are are things that if the product team at Creator Warehouse wants to know I could probably I could probably get them 70 to 80% of the way there by just chatting with them for 30 to 60 Minutes um a lot of the questions we're asking I I understand why they want to to do it in this way by by hiring like a like a survey company to that specializes in you know the the
composition of the questions and the sampling and and whatever else and it has you know these   uh I think that the polling and Survey industry is inherently flawed um because truly neutral sampling is literally impossible especially in the in the Modern Age and you you see that with highly publicized survey results like uh us election predictions um us election polls uh so we're doing it we're spending what I consider to be a not  um uh amount of money that I'd like to spend on it uh but I green lit it
because this was something that the team other than me and yvon and some other people is aligned on and my whole thing is like okay well then here's my expectations in terms of measuring a return on this um and I hope you know what you're doing um tyack says this is a mistake you're airing Dirty Laundry it's not dirty laundry it's okay to disagree I've said that a bunch of times on the show show is lus I I've said a a billion times on the show that this this company makes decisions that I don't
agree with all the time and that's okay and that's okay you're never going to be in an organization where you agree with literally every single action the company ever takes and I've provided my rationale but let's make sure I provide their rationale as well their rationale is that if we sample our existing customers it doesn't tell us much about the the broader customer base that's out there if we just you know go based on gut feeling well then or like you know what we've anecdotally observed over the
years sure yeah that might get us 70% or 80% of the way there but if this gets us a few more percent um that might at the very least uh you know help guide product development in a more uh in a more um scientific you know a more a more rigorous way um part of the justification is that that's just what these things cost so if we want to dip our toes into into data collection in this manner this is just kind of what what it costs to have a credible company do it and then we can decide after
trying it once if that's something that we want to do again so there are absolutely absolutely counterarguments and at the end of the day I said I don't  check bold bold well you got to you got to try stuff right I mean if I just wanted to if if all we ever did was my perspective then that could potentially limit our capacity for new ideas and growth right um there is this whole problem um with Founders where uh in some cases to like grow past a certain point you you either
need to like cycle them out or certain job functions can't be done by them anymore because they'll have a certain scope of thinking that doesn't necessarily continue to work and to be clear there's certain times when I would absolutely stick to my guns um yeah but when it's a difference of opinion you have to leave openings yeah okay sorry what was the question for Luke I want to hear now what's your favorite Lean Back game to relax with  oh I don't do that as much these days
um not playing gam you assume Luke leans back yeah time has been expensive for me lately um genuinely lean back is a tough one uh cuz usually I I'm more like I'll I'll go play Pokemon go because it gets me outside I'm walking I try to stay in constant movement when I'm playing Pokemon go as much as possible um literally the opposite yeah it's not a lean back but it is relx maing yeah I'm changing the words which is not fair so makes sense yeah so it's I I wanted to include the answer because it's sort of
in line but it's it's also completely not uh so a general Leanback game I haven't played it in forever but um either uh Civ so civilization or FTL is not a Leanback game I I sweat when I play the game I always make it like hardest possible scario stress as hell go crazy um I've beat all the challenges in the game on all the anyways that's impressive actually um I I am a FTL sweat it's one of my favorite games ever very sweat um uh but yeah so Civ or Assassin's Creed um right now it's you can tell I
play it all the time because I don't remember the name Odyssey Odyssey odyy let me look it up did you ever mess with Dwarf Fortress uh uh sort of give me a sec though yes Assassin's Creed Odyssey I've been playing this game for uh it looks like six years I play it you know every once like every 3 to six months I'll go jump in and do a few missions and then leave again the the setting is beautiful Assassin's Creed Odyssey is a a beautiful game Great Sound you have a really cool uh
partner buddy in like this pet eagle that you have um the environment the setting is just is absolutely fantastic so it's a very fun game to go just chill in um yeah I don't know that's it though okay let's see what else do we have hey leak lime and do drop nice lonus uh when are we getting more house build updates oh very soon I actually reviewed a video today that is fixing the um we think we hope uh fixing the corrosion issue with the water loops and adding leak sensing leak sensing is good yeah do you
have flow issues with that you have a crazy pump so maybe it doesn't matter um we were having some flow issues but that was due to the like particle filter that we had in line we got a better particle filter and it seems to be flowing a lot  no lonus are you still grateful of having this job years ago you kept mentioning that you have the world's best job but you don't really bring this up lately being frustrated by the community instead H it's a good question heavy um it's a good question though
well framed too I am grateful I have definitely  I have definitely found a less positive side of it um particularly over the last year or so and I don't think it's new uh I just think that for a long time the supportive voices largely overwhelmed to the point of completely drowning out the less supportive voices animosity and negativity in the tech space has like massively spiked I um it sucks a lot out of curiosity because other than Sony's own video we have the highest viewed
video on the PlayStation 5 Pro like it's not even close um so out of curiosity I went over to r/ PS5 like Reddit hates me it's it's like not that's not subjective that's just a fact uh largely speaking the Reddit Community just whether it's dismissive or um or outright hostile uh in in general the redditor community just kind of hates me um and so I I went over I was just I was curious do we even Merit a post let alone you know getting any up votes over there and not only did our
PS5 pro video which multiple people elsewhere like off of Reddit um pointed out how balanced it was like we did point out the things that um that Sony did that were making it very difficult for people the extremely high price for a cons is uh is a tough pill to swallow in this economy you know like it's it's not it's not it's not great but we also talked through and explained why why it costs what it costs U so not only did we not Merit a post even though people they're clearly watching it people are
watching it um but our last couple of PlayStation products uh so the I believe it was the portal and the psvr had a bunch of discussion about them when the videos were posted zero up votes um not because there was any particular argument against anything we  of outside of and even within the LT Community there is uh an amount of animosity that I am having a hard time really coming to grips with uh it's been interesting which I think is fair it's been interesting watching the discourse
change around something like the framework investment when we did it it was with full transparency and with the informed consent of the community um you know understanding what this was what it meant what would and wouldn't change sorry are you talking the the framework investment right now so not only the full consent the excited involvement and over time that has morphed from enthusiastic support and I don't mean for everyone a lot of people are still like very much like raw ra raw framework
in fact too much I mean Austin posted that not completely positive video and people piled on him for it it's just another edge of the sword of too much animosity there's too much fighting so a lot of people are still very supportive but there's there's another sort of portion of the tech community that just looks at it and goes okay well you know lonus is compromised now because he's got this framework investment but what I don't see is I don't see anybody actually providing any concrete
evidence to suggest that the framework investment has affected my coverage of any mobile device show me show me where I said something that was un unfairly flattering of framework or unfairly critical of a competitor to framework show me if anything I treat them like the coach's son yeah I reviewed a script that Vibe a couple times I reviewed a script with Elijah today um we had someone come to us um with a complaint about their customer service experience with framework so it took us a little
while but we secret shopped them um and I was not involved um Elijah Alex um some unnamed people who are staying anonymous because they're not staff and if we can use their credit cards for mystery shopping then hey why don't we just not disclose their names and then we could use them again um so so a team of people put together a secret a secret shop for framework and as I was going through I went out of my way to if anything I still I still did act in my role as editor but when I made
a change to the script I made 100% certain that everything I did toned down the positivity as opposed to toned it up or I explicitly checked with Elijah and I said does this still  um I don't know it's uh it's been a it's been a really difficult thing I uh we're deep enough in wano at this point that maybe I'll maybe I'll just say this but I I I I made it sometimes I make edits to the script as we're as we're going through and we're working together on tweaks to it that are just meant to be a
joke they're just meant to get a laugh out of the writer who's sitting next to me like watching me change stuff and um I I I put in I put in a bit about how realistically the value of Frameworks investment for me is less than um I could Pro I could probably name half a dozen laptop brands that have paid me more over the course of my career than the value of my investment framework like if you're um and it was kind a funny point it was kind of poke it was kind of  uh that somehow it was going to affect my
daytoday operation of the company other than to be extra extra extra careful about it I mean you know this every single time the idea of framework has been brought up when it comes to internal use what do I say every single time if anything you point out that they're expensive and you push against it if anything and outside of that you usually like I don't want to be involved with the conversation because we were we were looking into getting Frameworks for internal laptops because of you know
their repairability and other stuff going on but honestly they're really expensive they're really expensive they don't have touch screens it's tough yeah there's a lot of people the company that are pretty ride or die for touch screens um and again they're really expensive so I don't know hopefully they can figure that out that cyborg relay says I've seen someone say you accidentally auctioned an engineering sample uh or whatever controversy it was to attack that brand cuz they were a
framework competitor truly unhinged and and the thing is that like it was it was very it was enlightening but also disheartening um rossman's video supporting our degoogle your life series uh because the the the the portion of the tech  um I don't I don't under I don't understand it uh if you if you wait if you wait into that mess  uh I don't know maybe if you have like a like a background in psychoanalysis you can let me know what you think the kind of rationale behind it is but it's uh
it's pretty intense it's tough and um I still have a great job and I still um am extremely grateful especially for the years where things were Lar largely not largely they're still largely supportive and positive it's actually been it's been really encouraging seeing viewership tick back up we're like I think we I think we cracked like 80 million views on LT we've been actually executing really well on content uh overall audience audience sentiment has been really good but the
um I do miss the days when it was almost universally supportive and that doesn't mean that I just expect adulation for everything I do I I have always solicited um constructive criticism we had a rule on the Forum when we first started it that you you couldn't attack you know other creators in the space each other um other people Media Group moderators basically anyone but you could go after lonus and myself and it was genuinely fine for a long time cuz people would do it but it was not a huge
population of people and and usually the people would just kind of deal with it and move on and it was fine it was it was genuinely fine for like many years and now it's just I don't I think there's a little bit of  people there's some people that are still extremely angry about like ad block his piracy thing yeah like really angry um which I genuinely at no point in time have ever understood cuz everyone's like happily posting memes about pulling the pirate hat back out
again and stuff but then pointing out that that is also that who cares if you don't care deeply insults them it's like what do you mean if you don't care and you sleep well pirating movies and music like why is is this a different line I don't know why is this a worse line I don't I don't I don't know i' I've genuinely never understood it I don't know I don't know dude whatever um or like you know when when you have that conversation that basically goes but just like understand that when you pull
the funding away from something it gets worse yeah like dude the state of news media now it's it's terrifying yeah it's terrifying and the deeper you go down that rabbit hole the scarier it is yeah we are so we are so vulnerable right now because we weren't willing to pay a subscription and we're still not willing to pay a subt description to support  um yeah so there's been a couple comments one of them was saying that like it's not just you guys um while that is true I genuinely believe that we
get a higher percentage than most because of a lot of stuff that happened tall and that and that both really but there's channels that are just as big as us that don't get anywhere near as much um and then also uh there's been some comments of people telling me to like pull this topic along because it's clearly negative and that we should just ignore the trolls I hear you I don't want us to do this all the time on way show but I think sometimes showing kind of what's going on on our end is just
sort of being honest with the viewers um and it's pretty intense like uh if you sort that that Rossman video that you mentioned pretty positive video overall if you go into the comments it's not entirely positive but it's a pretty positive video If you go into the  newest brutal yeah and it's like it's easy to say well forget the haters but this isn't that small of a niche you know that's a video that has well over half a million views now thousands and thousands of comments um and
there's this almost Universal just like I don't know how to describe it other than just like yeah animosity hostility um anger and expression of anger paired with a note that no action no matter what you do can ever be redeeming I noticed that out at a very oddly consistent rate there was a bunch of different people clearly not Bots but just like this doesn't make it okay and nothing that is ever done can fix my opinion of this person it's like whoa yeah and it's it's it's uh what's the term Ming yeah
like it's it's it's it's tough to relate to like I I try to take feedback right like I try to uh we we've always taken in in data and tried to throw out what's bad and and keep what's good and and keep evolving keep evolving right um but when you when you get something that's just like um I'm mad and nothing can ever change that I'm mad I don't even necessarily know what I'm mad about but um you know here's what I've kind of like here's what I've kind of grabbed on to as the justification for my behavior
it's I don't I don't really know how to deal with that um speaking of things that I that I that we've done that I haven't agreed with um I strongly disagreed with a lot of the ways that we  um but that's part of making decisions together as a team that's part of making uh decisions based on you know the best information that you feel that you have at the time uh I felt like there was a lot we could have said and I wanted to say but you have to to manage there's also that it was in two parts well makes it
complicated yeah I don't want to get way too many things yeah we're definitely not going to do that because if we were to make a decision about changing what we have or haven't said about any of that that would be a decision we'd make as a team because what you have to understand past a certain point is that the decisions you make impact more than just you there's a hundred people on payroll who depend on this company and that was shown that was thrown into sharp relief last year when I think I
think a lot of the Crusaders felt like they were taking down you know like a a big bad ogre um when at the end of the day I already made my money and the people whose lives that if we went down which we we weren't going to we kind of are awesome and we have a great team literally world class um but if we went down the people whose lives would have been most negatively impacted would have been small creators I often hear people say yeah I don't want LTT I watch small creators because I want to support small
creators you know oh you mean smaller creators like Dan besser you know producer of uh of this weekly podcast who by the way creates every day for a  um even in that same sense if you start looking to uh external to this company small creators um I have always believed in a rising tide lifts All Ships when we were at our Peak so was the entire Tech YouTuber sphere when we slumped so did everyone now I don't think that we can assign any CA yeah there's been there's been other challenges the the
whole industry follows a similar line yep um and I don't think that mean that relax I don't think that members of the tech media tearing each other down is constructive I think that I think that we have always worked   no I don't there's there's the one case where we were negatively comparing I'm saying we as a company not us not you and me as individuals oh we were negatively comparing other outlets sure but I think think we dealt with that pretty decisively I agree I'm just
saying okay yeah I can't I can't control what every single person says and does no um yeah there was a there was an error in a in a video a little while ago that um you know basically I was accused of being biased in some way I don't want to get into the exact details because it's just not worth it but I was accused of being biased and I was sitting there going like I didn't even touch that I never saw it yeah that's tough and like I think I think that's largely cuz like it might
not work that way this uh here we have 100 plus people but a lot of YouTubers are one two bit operations so people do think that they basically see everything    um it's harder to keep track of that um there are there are definitely times I I was I was swimming in my private pool the other day and I thought no really though and I was like this is this is the pool that you know this none of this would be possible this is a crazy life I could have never imagined for myself if
I hadn't through a combination of uh Hard Work Talent and being exceptionally lucky I was in the right place at the right time um this is something that never would have been possible this is absolutely incredible and just like had this moment of gratitude I was I have to confess I was thinking not as much about you guys I was actually thinking more of um my wife and the team um sorry you guys are totally totally integral to the whole thing like for real um yeah that was like 3 days ago so
yeah I I definitely think about it often but um it's harder in the day-to-day these days it's it's been it's been very challenging it has to just to you know help us come up for air a little bit here though yeah you mentioned earlier teams are doing better things are getting better all of that is true yeah like uh not only are performance metrics coming back but I genuinely think the space is getting a little bit less toxic I think there's been a sentiment shift towards us specifically as well um yeah
I I'm honestly looking more overall at the whole industry but that's probably also true in regards to spefic they're kind of related maybe I think they're kind of related I think a lot people are maybe tired of it I think exhausting it is it's very exhausting I'm I'm just tired of being angry yeah I don't have the energy for it anymore like why why are we doing this I I don't know the answer has to be because we love it otherwise why why oh oh oh you mean like the work I thought you meant the
fighting yeah no sorry I was  um yeah and I I I am genuinely it was a little Doom and Gloom for a while there at this point I'm seeing the light at the end of the tunnel I think we can get back maybe not exactly where we were but I think we can I think we can fix some of this um and it's going to it's going to take effectively everybody well creers viewers can you guys be part of it like can we just can we try to you know not not be upset about if someone just likes the PS portal even
though it's locked down can we just be okay with that if they just like it is that okay yeah and to be clear this this means honestly mostly elsewhere right not just us um and it doesn't mean just like accepting everything all the time just king ghost I miss the friendly collaboration too yeah I literally my favorite thing out of practically everything used to be going to events and having these dinners that we used to do Luke we had dozens of creators at probably the biggest Tech Creator dinner that has
ever taken place yeah at LTX and that sick literally weeks later we were living on ostracization island yeah literally Weeks Later yeah as if it never happened and we never did anything to help build up the space as if we were evil people motivated only by whatever like tearing people down I uh that was quite the quite the peak and fall cuz that that I still got whiplash yeah we we were like videos were killing it I think public perception was super super high and this is I mean this is a story
that's been told a bunch of times in reality yeah but uh yeah we were we were at a hell of a Peak at that point in time um anyway hey we had a collab go live today yeah Evan and Caitlyn super cool yeah we have some more collabs coming I'm I'm I'm very excited for everything that's coming and uh yeah we've been we've been killing it no thank you Anonymous uh yes I am grateful and you know what maybe it was uh maybe it was cathartic too to have this to have this conversation I don't want to do this all
the time no no me neither but um I think this time it's good to reenter and refocus every once in a while thank you yeah and like look at the channel man PS5 pro video 1.4 million views Apple event video 1.5 million views $50 "versus $50,000 computer 1.3 million" views 1.9 million views on why the YouTube video are taken down lowest rate of PC 1.3 million views 1.6 on on Tech upgrade content has been killing it yep I understand the printer video isn't "doing that well you still got 800,000"
views on a printer no one even buys those show me anyone else who can get "800,000 prin at a certain point it's" like that's still pretty cool like yeah it's not doing as well as the other ones but it's a printer I remember using a line a lot like that when I would back when I would pitch to Brands I'd be like especially it Brands consumer electronics uh you know they can they can go to they could go to like a okay this is contemporary right or contemporaneous so they could go to a
Casey niat you know like Samsung or whatever right go to someone lifestyle right um but it Brands I would I would often pull out this line I'd be like tell me who else can get a million views  drive I'll wait um like it's we are I think we're really good and it's not it's not just me we as a team are really good at finding what's interesting about about technology and and being excited about it and sharing that excitement that's our superpower and and watch that and also watch everyone else's stuff I
don't know the tech Bas is cool and different angles are cool we say all the time we'll say it now if you watch review on something watch other reviews as well yeah like that that's never going to change I want this tide not only do I believe that the tide lifts all the ships I want it to lift all the ships the space is uninteresting if it's just a few players um and that's how things slowly die you you want it to be vibrant and Lively you want a lot of places for people to go for information
for news for entertainment content all the type of stuff where the interest is this type of Tex stuff that's how everything is going to be able to move forward best and that's how you that's how you SE the seeds of the next generation of creators as well like if we're just down and angry and negative all the time how are we going to how's anyone going to get enthusiastic and replace me smashing on anyone for for having a slightly different opinion uh there's no real space for for new angles
new Talent new ideas yeah um so try to try to promote the idea of of different angles on things different opinions on things different approaches to things and then there's more of a chance um that that person in their in their bedroom with a camera that had bought a new phone can make a video on it and and start a career that way like Jim's TCH says the printer video was good it was a bummer that the only laser printer you had was monochrome there are some good color Laser Printers out there
that are cheap also that's a really good point I think it was just kind of a limitation of the format we were trying to do that thing where the increments go up in 10x and at $400 you can get a really nice tank based inkjet at $4 you can get a piece of garbage bubble jet we literally did get a $4 printer though um it was like seven six and a half Canadian dollars or something like that I forget exactly what it was but it was like 450 us or something and then at $40 you're
not getting a color laser you're getting a black and white laser so I would have actually really liked to show like a$ 6070 option that's like a a color laser that will at least do like color documents or whatever we tried to kind of talk about it but you're right you're right that was that was something where we we tried something we tried so we we tried this like uh increments of 10x format with the um 50 versus 500 versus "5,000 versus $50,000 computer thing we" tried it with the printers I don't think
we have anything else in the queue right now but we we got to try stuff we got to try stuff could maybe do honorable mentions just to fill certain gaps that's an idea yep maybe I don't know y that's another thing is like we'll we'll have minor missteps here there but con content constantly changes and you're never going to perfectly hit every time we learn things move on that's part of the job I I think the content team is doing great I think they're killing it and I think the the views and general
audience sentiment improving reflects that a random physicist says home theater would be a great 10x video like $10 home theater based on what you did in scrapyard Wars you could do it do like there's just that's one of the things with home theater stuff is like well that guy I think just like took pity on me or something I don't know or he knew who you were oh he didn't at all okay did the audio from that ever go in I don't think so I haven't watched the full video we have
we have the whole thing audio recorded he had genuinely no clue who was all right all right I I'll allow it I'll accept it he thought I was a a very weird guy um but yeah there's like old home theater equipment sometimes people are just just trying to move it on that wasn't even old that was actually all kind of newer stuff anyways that was weird but  uh yeah next would you would you care for a second merch message that's got to be one of the alltime yeah let's go something a little
lighter this time if you don't mind oh yeah oh uh let me just look uh what is your opinion on geopolitics uh this might take me a bit to find one would TechLink still exist if Riley didn't join lmg in 2019 you talked about how it picked up nearly all the Lost revenue from LTT when LTT struggled this one wasn't better would lmg be entirely different now if there was no Tech link I love Riley um I didn't see a path toward having that high energy irreverent yet informed style uh without
Riley I basically had in mind what I wanted to do and waited until NC went to crap and immediately slid into Riley's DMs I I don't who else could be Riley yeah tell me that no Riley is Riley is a unique a unique Pearl that has been  sand do that again Luke I'm just say like how you get pearls like so you had to like crack ncx open and just like  thing no no offense to some of my former colleagues that there were there were other pearls they're just a little Miss shapen next uh Hey dll as an ignorant
American my knowledge you don't have to say ignorant my knowledge of America's hat comes from media like pure ponage letter Kenny shy and LT what canadian-made media would you recommend I don't know wait pure ponage is Canadian I think they were yeah we don't even know what's Canadian that's that's a whole thing just assume most of Amer I think friendship is Magic is mostly Canadian oh yeah the production was like local like uh Riley did a voice in it once oh that would make sense why he did that
okay yeah sure yeah but I I he was saying red green yeah yeah yeah red green Fred pen probably a pretty dated show at this point I don't remember I just feel like probably uh does anybody know the beach comr is that no yeah some people it might be an old thing Trailer Park Boys is Park Boys Canadian yeah what yeah I didn't know that yeah that's sick what's oh yeah Stargate my hand was on Stargate Stargate Stargate sick what makes it Canadian though I don't know everything's filmed can yeah but like
okay but is it culturally Canadian really what is Canadian culture we I that's a that's a question right there I think that's hard to nail down uh in this part of the country I think it's why I mean they have the same issue in America you can you can drive like 200 miles in America and be like I'm still in Texas yeah well no no I don't even mean that I mean you you could still be in Texas and think you're in a completely different country yeah like and it's it's very much the same
here like in the Lower Mainland I will literally go play badminton and I'll be like oh yeah I'm the token white guy yeah and then I can drive like you know 4 hours to 5 hours to Vernon or something like that and yvon and I walk down the street and you'll have people be like what the Yeah an Asian yeah you like kids same Province dude when she when she was when she was there for her practicum like little kids would point at her like not little kids dude they don't know better they're going to do
what they're going to do they don't know better or anything but it's just like I don't know what the what is what what's I think I think you get more unique Canadian culture the more East you go personally probably more unique yeah like Vancouver is such a mixing pot yeah um not always the most mixed but all the ingredients are thrown in oh yeah they're all in there yeah uh like I I I often tell people that it's like stupid for me to travel for food oh yeah cuz like dude food and vancu you just
got to pick through like dude if you know what you want there's a city that will have amazing versions of that like it's always a joke to to me when people are like yeah you have to like eat the raw fish in Japan and I'm sitting here going you know we live on the same fing ocean right and there's like plenty of Japanese people here to like cut up a fish for me if I really need if that's really what I'm into like I just like what are you talking about there dude man like Indian Cuisine Asian Cuisine
amazing like all of it um only Middle Eastern we kind of lack and Mexican I was going to say Mexican our Mexican food Su very jealous where tell me don't tell me now okay I'm not going to tell you now what is he talking about you're going to like where it's located as well really I've been getting sick of where we live for food so I've been trying to find them mostly just for you there's I really really like Mexican food yeah dude you can go to any random hole in the wall in la oh dude it's
amazing and you'll get this like giant thing it'll be like $8 $9 okay I haven't been down to La it's up to me and I'm in the states practically anywhere in the states I will basically just eat Mexican food oh yeah cuz I know I'm not going to get it when I come back 100% it's like you get like an anchal here and it's like this stupid wimpy little thing you go down there you order enchiladas and it's like a whole plate covered in delicious like sauce and there's like unlimited Pico and a little thing you go
get it and dude the the Pico oh properly made Pico pop properly made guacamole yeah dog oh man it's so good so yeah we're lacking that yeah yeah we and and to be clear I'm sure you can get good Mexican Cuisine in down in Vancouver yeah but what we don't have is like a huge Mexican Community here and so that's the difference right like you can get good Indian Cuisine probably just about anywhere but you guys don't have sui where like it's it's cheap and it's everywhere and it's like
honly super authentic if you just pick a random one it's probably going to be very good I don't go to random ones anymore I don't either I only go to ust. G dude Masala and Langley no man ust. g i I will challenge you to like a curry hole Showdown which wait hold is probably not the best paraphrasing that I meant like a Hole in the Wall restaurant that specializes in curry I  was that intentional yeah have tell me was that intentional it doesn't look like it was intentional Luke I know when it's
intentional with lonus oh God the pair of you sure I was thinking like watering holes know SL hole in the wall yeah yeah exactly it's not a that's not Curry that comes out of that hole that is not a curry hole oh man I had really my favorite one was in the middle of Siri and they they closed down they changed ownerships what was it called I cannot remember it wasn't Taste of Punjab was it no no this was like G now and they way it's like actually better you no they Chang
management I think G you g dude dude the owner is a g I am definitely like the weirdest pictures of Him in all their I've been to a couple of their is that actually their branding is it UST g76 yeah oh no scroll down scroll down dude the Central City location going keep going the Central City location what a che the Central City location has artificial turf on the wall why I don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] know but it also has fairy lights and they I love this man they had uh they had Mr Bean cartoons on
the TV when I went in look at the way he poses in front of his restaurants this is sick their branding is so inconsistent and they don't seem to give any F that means it's good their garlic none is perfect the food looks amazing that that the picture oh that looks so good their garlic da is Flawless and unlike McDonald's the food looks like that no way it looks exactly like that that I will defend I still think m is great we'll do we'll do both we'll try that looks so good they pulled food out
of their kitchen and they took these pictures I swear to God that's amazing what is this road it's Canada we have one like seriously dude I love their branding what is what are they are oh they're Milestones they look like  locations so I didn't become aware of them until they replaced the place I liked to go in C Central this website decides amazing oh yeah like what font do you use yes Conrad take notes yeah yeah oh apparently oh okay so that was a grand opening a while ago but apparently
they're in cam loops so there you go anyway you g like what does this site just scroll forever what am I even looking at here seems like who is Buddy in the jeans this is their Instagram this is him is that yeah yeah that that must be him that must be him this is insane dud just never incoming call but what is this videos it's their food yeah dude okay you we got to the end y anyway so yeah I I I love uh I love Vancouver I love Vancouver food yeah vancu food is great y it's one of the best things
that's got going and like like okay like Chinese food you can get everything from like like liter like like actual Regional Styles so like sesan style or like more like Hong Kong style like hot pot Taiwanese style you know like you can get like so so like the China area you can get like different styles and then you can also get like trashy American Chinese food you know like you can get your sweet and sour pork and your oil drenched Chowan or whatever like it's s yeah it's
great okay what are we supposed to be talking about uh I think we're done with that one D any way to vote on items we would like to see again in the store I would love to see the black shorts again pre-orders or even Kickstarter style where we need to reach a minimum order size which black shorts like the the swimming trunks or the swe we had just like shorts the sweats I think they were sweat shorts um I actually had a conversation with Nick earlier this week about some of the ideas that we have
that we just don't know how feasible they are like we don't know what the Order Mix is going to look like in terms of sizing we don't know in terms of color like is there the possibility of building our own kind of Kickstarter style thing where we basically say okay "yeah like our mq for this is 2,000 units" if 300 or 400 you pre-order or 500 like we set some threshold and we basically go okay yeah here's here's where it's at right now here's how close we think we are here's where we anticipate it will
come out are you down are you in um yeah I could put if you're going to if you're going to anticipate when it would come out you have to put a deadline yeah yeah and then we just refund if it doesn't make it yeah I think this person is describing a non- deadlined version but yeah I think interesting I yeah it sounds like they're describing more of like a um like a threshold for resurrecting older items uh I we don't have anything right now but there is the possibility that
yeah mop style or Kickstarter style that we could we could either bring back high demand items or or do kind of edgier Kier stuff that uh that we're really not  about is drop just like a keyboard company now oh no no no there don't forget about headphones yeah Top Gear says okay but how long would I have to wait after I order will it be like backpack six plus months yes yeah yeah production times are weeks or sometimes months shipping is like a month it just takes time at sampling
they got to like someone has to like make it like it's oneoff you know and then it has to be shipped and then we have to like schedule the meeting and then we have to evaluate it and then we have to compile our feedback we have to send it back and then they have to like make another one like it's making products is uh I I feel like a lot of media and I don't just mean Tech media I feel like a lot of media would have a very different perspective if they had experience actually created anything yeah a lot of
critics create nothing um and it's   more yeah or not we could just sit here  yeah so excited to meet monitor [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] why can prod what what I have no idea why can products that are still being purchased out of stock on the store I'm going to give you another crack at this one go ahead Dan why can products that are still being produced be out of stock on the store why not just send it when it's made after I ordered we are generally not that into taking back orders because our lead times are so
long that we end up creating negativity out of an attempt to provide a service which is the ability to back order um we're not like we we act more like a manufacturer it's not like we have a water bottle Factory like I don't you know own water bottle Factory but we behave like a manufacturer in that we um we Place Large orders we uh have to figure out our mixes we have to Warehouse them we have to Market them sell them like we're we're pretty vertically integrated for a lot of our
product stuff which means that our etas are dependent on Manufacturing in Global Logistics they're not dependent on whether our supplier down the street has stock or our other supplier has stock there is no other supplier a lot of the time we're working directly with factories so it takes as long as it takes and um you end up creating a lot of work for yourself because no matter how hard you try to disclaim that this is going to be 3 months sorry people will message you and be angry about it
and then heaven forbid it lasts longer like we'd rather just take your money once we have something in stock or at the very least once we know with a fair degree of certainty once we're like when we're going to be getting it we've made and honestly it's worked out okay sometimes but not as well other times Word 97 guy in PH chat said oh man when I was working in the snowplow industry we spent a year developing the crate it ships in yeah things take time when you start
getting into engineering and development and whatnot things take time and you'll think it'll take six months and then in month five you'll go oh there's a big problem that we didn't foresee and now it requires re-engineering or the whole ISO standard for the size of the bits and the size of the sockets realizing that the entire rest of the industry was doing it wrong backwards orever and we had to decide do we go according to spec or do we go according to compatibility with the rest
of the ecosystem making that decision is going take a lot of time how could we see that coming yeah this stuff happens all the time so like I don't know 's a bu four hello lonus luk and Dan as big fan of overcooked I was wondering if lonus had heard of the game plate up it's pretty similar it's also published by some of the YouTubers called the yog cast cast I have not heard of play up um I know overcooked I know moving out my my kids really like moving out I play play up overwhelmingly positive reviews
on phenomenal it's great if you like screaming at your friends yeah cool so good after having played overcooked I haven't craved more of that kind of gameplay really personally but um yeah I might be down to try it sometime but I also I don't know man like I'm I'm old like when I have half an hour to hang out and play a game honestly it's a lot easier and more comfortable for me to just flip on a game that I already know how to play dude that you don't need friends for got
them I mean like you got to get a group of people together there at midnight right not wow why you got to burn me like that we both first you want to you say first you uninvite me to your pool party yeah okay  place turned off's off bye Dan bye I'm sorry okay welcome back Dan we need someone to read the merch messages okay need somebody to come to my pool party please hello rain yeah lawn party just splash around on the floor hello W.D with iPhone and pixel promising plus six years of software
updates do you think that they will try and push newer devices harder or increase the benefits of the new devices and exclude from olders I think they're absolutely going to try to differentiate the newer products but I think that six plus years of software updates is less um an action that they are taking to extend the lifetime of these devices and more an acknowledgement that that is and is becoming the product life cycle for phones and they better just get on board or they're going to be left behind and
there's going to be no one to sell a new phone no one who wants anything to do with their brand when their competitors are supporting the devices for longer I think this is a response I don't think this is proactive particularly on Google side Apple seems to have slowly acknowledged this over time you go back to some of the very earlier iPhones they didn't necessarily get this nice long support period but for the most part they do now because Apple recognizes that the value is in 
base my company recently got Acquired and the new organization is nothing but egos but I love my team and old co-workers how would you deal with new leadership causing problems due to the  it's the same story man you hear it over and over again Acquisitions like private Equity um I don't know it's tough I'm sorry we we've never been in that scenario honestly yeah I mean I've definitely had friends that have talked to me about you know how the company changed after they're Acquired and stuff and
I can't think of too many versions of the story where it ends real good they exist they do but I haven't heard people that it usually ends up real good for is not the individual workers oh oh no but that's what I meant yeah I know I'm only counting the stories I've heard from Individual workers I'm not counting like the ownership ownership does great when uh when a company gets acquired that's yeah kind of how it works what happens when you run out of bad shafts for the Scribe driver will we
just be getting a scribe driver with the Primo nerling instead no the Primo nerling is too rough to to hold like in a pen grip I buy a screwdriver and then cut off the head and then machine it myself why don't you just machine a pen at that extremely expensive scrap driver that's probably worse I like this yes we've talked about this I live my life by that Luke I thought you knew me I yeah somewhat what I'm referencing we are for never mind we have lots of supply of shafts
what is it four tons this is not a this is not a a concern for the time being we have a lot of shaft however we're not concerned about not having enough shaft uh we we it's okay look it's bad sh you're not and  rough technically it's ribed technically it's nled oh I think I think that's worse uh anyway the point is we've got lots but we have talked about this and we would consider making a scribe driver from scratch but I don't know we're years away from having that conversation I think we've got plenty of
scribe drivers you should take the um you should take the branding from Nintendo like new with the like multicolored things coming out of the new do you know what I'm talking about new Nintendo 3DS do that new scbe driver new scribe driver what's new about it technically nothing but it's made from new things I don't know yeah I guess yeah yeah so scribe driver uh yeah we'll we'll keep mining for shafts mine shaft shaft mine shaft mine shaft I don't know we' there's plenty in the
hill of shafts shaft Hill shaft Mountain broken shaft Mountain that's a great movie Shaft Mountain classic uh hi lus luk and Dan this is the last one I got for you I was wondering if you think there is a chance that tsmc will be broken up as a Monopoly Monopoly particularly if intel were to pull out of the fabrication space and focus on research and development so when you break up company you are you are breaking it up into uh it's like an antitrust thing right you're breaking it up so that it cannot
utilize its advantage in one area to give it an unfair advantage in another area tsmc for the most part just does one thing you can't break up tsmc I mean oh you could demand it's so integrated I was going to say you could demand that there there R&amp;D and like like tool development breaks off from their pure manufacturing but in Silicon they're so only serving the one thing parallel and they're so integrated I I don't see how you could ever I also think that would quite genuinely be directly against the
interests of the governments involved yeah like the government the government of Taiwan is like not going to be interested in that no and I don't care which one you ask like the more pro- freedom government that is currently in power or a more pro-china government that if they were ever to manage to win somehow uh none of them would be interested at all in disrupting disrupting tsmc's current just like March to complete Global  here yeah yeah they're not going to disrupt that
that would be unwise on like so many  levels thank you so much for tuning into the land show yeah we're going to see you guys again next week yeah same bad time same bad Channel yeah bye
