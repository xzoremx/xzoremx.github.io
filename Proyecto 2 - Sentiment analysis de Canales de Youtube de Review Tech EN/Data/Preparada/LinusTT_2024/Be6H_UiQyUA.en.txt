dear diary with each passing day without Innovation from nvidia's board Partners I cry a little no I cry a lot remember the good times we had together when they were the first company to add asymmetrical cooling to the mx440 or put heat pipes on the GeForce 4 TI 4600 remember when they let you update your bios without a CPU installed I just missed them so much why why did you have to leave us I don't care if some of your Innovations never took off like the red colored GPU that was $50 more because it 
back ah box of graphics cards oh EVGA how did you know I would build this computer with all the super cool stuff you don't make anymore and how did you know I would tell the people about our sponsor you green their new 13 in1 Revo doc Max 213 has more ports than seconds in this ad and with an upgraded cooling system it'll stay as cool as you with all your stuff plugged in check it out at the link below using parts from this box and some other ones that we tracked down with some help from EVGA we are
going to be building the most EVGA PC ever I'm talking GPU sure of course but also motherboard power supply Ram evg made Ram yes yes they did and as we put together our system we'll o be taking a little trip down memory lane looking through our care packages at some of the ideas that EVGA brought to life over the years the good and also the bad let's start with what's in this box and look at that I've got a special guest the only other person who works here who's old enough to remember all this stuff
maybe too old now before we get started tell me this as a certified Asus shill are you allowed to wear EVGA shirts absolutely all right let's do it I've been released of my Asus contra track there that's better now look they didn't have everything in the archives to send us I would have loved to get my hands on the 275 Co-op for example the very first GPU physx accelerator combo card yes and the very last one also very last one that was not a very successful concept but we
do still have some really neat stuff now not everything that EVGA you know innovated was their own Innovation this for example is a 79 50 gx2 this is two gpus each on their own independent cards with an SLI bridge in between them but the Innovation was that they were crazy enough to partner with Nvidia to do it I believe it was them and Asus oh that's right but not even Asus was crazy enough to build one of these no their own dual GPU this is the 460 to win to win get it to Twin oh twin
n it's two win okay the cool thing about this is back then two mid-range cards in SLI could be quite performance competitive with a single higher-end one and at a price that you know was blacka 480 yeah or you know sometimes even less if you could get them on a deal the issue is that as soon as you put the engineering into building a combo card yeah out the window yeah it all went out the window this thing was about $700 it's kind of no wonder in video doesn't let the partners build stuff
like that anymore but still it was a lot of fun yeah you talk to anyone from the board partners and that's all they'll talk about is how much more fun it was to build cards back in the day uh how about this one right here this would have been something that would have been pretty tough to compete with right 980 TI Kingpin do you remember what was special about this guy I just know Vince put a lot of work into it honestly that's a great summary Vince lucido or Kingpin worked with EVGA on this card to
dramatically increase the available power to it from 250 watt stock to 450 WTS that involved adding additional power connectors to it a full back plate and of course this all copper drop dead sexy cooling design do you want to pick the next card ah I actually bought one of these oh of course you did it's 9800 gx2 they had three different versions overclocked super overclocked the SSC it it EVGA yeah wait that is is just super super overclocked yeah I know and then they had the the KO there was a 25 mahz
difference on the core clock and the memory clock as you went up the range but the main reason I chose EVGA it was the uh design cuz I actually wanted the PNY XL R8 yeah yeah Asus had the uh top card had the highest memory overclock and it equaled on or or was right below on on the core clock on probably had like a cringey anime character and it looked like the Ane character was in the middle of an autopsy that was really fun but I think we all know that builds don't start with gpus they start with a
motherboard which conveniently EVGA also has they've actually been in the motherboard business for a long time starting in 2005 and I guess if you think about it it was a pretty natural progression for them because a lot of the same principles uh designing a board with a good circuit layout and excellent power and cooling management go into both gpus and motherboards now in the early days EVGA did less of the engineering on their own one of their most famous boards was simply an Nvidia
reference design for the 680i chipset that EVGA put their label on but over time EVGA got pretty darn Innovative even launching Intel chips at motherboards in 2008 once Nvidia left the market there were a couple of noteworthy Milestones that EVGA hit first in fact they were the first to make an XL ATX motherboard that allowed four-way SLI with four dual Slot Cards and this boy right here the EVGA classified sr2 or super record 2 was I don't know how to put this other than
utterly unique it allowed overclocking on Dual Intel xon processors and you guessed it the ability to install up to four graphics cards in SLI simultaneously it is is both taller and wider than any motherboard standard that existed for consumers at the time now because of that we are not going to be using it there are no cases these days that will fit this thing but we do intend to do a video with this retro monster in the future so make sure you're subscribed so you don't miss it
by the way speaking of retro our new retro colorway screwdriver is a must have for the Discerning retro Enthusiast LTT store.com instead we've gone with something a little more modern we've got a z79 dark Kingpin this is an $800 board for 12th to 14th gen Intel processors with a 14 layer PCB 21 phase vrm support "for up to 64 gigs of ddr5 at 8,000 megat" transfers per second and this is really cool they've managed to build in support for PCI Express gen 5x 16 to either of
their 16x slots that means you can get full performance out of a pcie Gen 5 GPU that installed way down here that could be important if say for example you're going for an overclocking record and you need more room for the Subzero cooling apparatus you have up here can I just say how amazing it is how well these guys know their customers how cool is this it's a bare PCB with kind of a stripped down block diagram this is the neatest swag I think I've ever seen included with a product almost as neat 
itself oh that reminds me here here's an EVGA motherboard Innovation they were the first to include right angle connectors on their p67 FTW not everything they did was particularly Innovative about a decade ago they came up with a number of superclocked and super super clocked DDR3 and ddr4 memory kits as far as I can tell with these the product development process went something like this but hey they were Speedy at the time and competitively priced unfortunately these are too
outdated for us to use in this system so for Ram and actually storage now that I come to think about it we've just gone with third party options thankfully that won't be necessary for our case these are really hard to get your hands on these days because as far as we can tell anyone who owns them is holding on to them for dear life evga's dg85 is part of the dg8 series that came out in 2016 it was very well received like check this out there's a lower compartment where you put your power supply that's
pretty normal but what's this IO down here including HDMI for your VR headset that's super cool and that's just the beginning you've seen interior Cable Management what about exterior Cable Management why would they need that you ask so the entire back of the case can have this clean look all hidden away by  door man we got all kinds of stuff going on here easily removable dust filter trip fans in the front hey plof we said that sr2 board wouldn't fit in this case but I think it would will it fit hptx it
kind of looks like it we should build it in there then uh yeah later later for now we're building a real computer anyone would actually want to use today oo hello oo hey wo hey you know it was a little on the pricey side at almost $200 but for everything it's got going on that feels like a deal what are you thinking for the Clos Loop cooler top mount yes but why did I call it a close loop cooler instead of an all-in-one or AI because that's what EVGA does meet the CLC X they've actually done a couple
of different closed loop coolers but this is their most recent it's available in configurations with up to 3 120 mm fans and compatible with all the latest sockets there's not a whole lot more for me to say about it so while we install it why don't we do some EVGA history did you know that EVGA originally stood for e-commerce video graphics array they were founded in 19 1999 by Andrew Han and Keith Rochford and they were the first company to make driver installation seamless for gamers with
ADM or automatic driver management does this thing have three bios chips on it with a selector switch that is wild next up is our power supply and this segment is as much about evga's past as it is about their future did you know that the Supernova 850 and 750 G2 units were the first to offer an eco mode switch which is neat but but we're not using those instead we've got a big beefy boy the EVGA Supernova 1600 T2 it is fully modular 80 plus titanium efficient and cost about
$500 evga's entry into the power supply Market was marked by consistent quality aggressive pricing and their trademark strong post sales support from talking to them today power supplies are very much a part of their future going forward and we wish them the best of luck with that naturally we have gone with the king of EVGA gpus the RTX 3090 TI for the win three did you guys know that aside from helping us get graphics cards into the hands of Gamers at MSRP during the Great crypto winter EVGA also had
their own Q system to try to deter scalpers they also ran their stepup program for years allowing anyone to Simply trade in their card and pay the difference if a newer model came out within 90 days of purchase just to give their customers a little peace of mind and back in the day they used to offer lifetime warranties on their gpus giving their customers the assurance that they would never have a problem with an EVGA graphics card now I want to solve the mystery of the giant piece of acrylic
with an EVGA logo on it I don't get this man there's no obvious place that it goes I'm EVGA is going to watch this and go oh mine is wait I found it it's in between what we both thought it is inside the window but not at the back just to kind of clean the place up a little okay that looks really sharp last piece here is the front panel but we are far from the end of our adventure because evj also makes peripherals we've got the whole works today we got the torque torque sure X10 desk pad I've got the
X20 Mouse and plof here is unboxing their z20 keyboard we also have their xr1 Pro capture card the mouse is a fun one I guess we got this from EVGA and it didn't quite make the cut for shipping to customers at any rate we've got another first here this is the world's first triple sensor Mouse so it's got a Pixar 3335 Optical sensor which is pretty normal but it has dual liftoff distance detection sensors which is not normal but I guess in theory allows you to really fine-tune your liftoff
distance yeah you know when you go and then you put it back down heck yeah now I noticed something weird about this keyboard cuz I know that years ago it did come with this button but what happened to it uh I am not sure yeah  so this is looking good now it's time for the PS STS evga's sound card I'm kidding we actually would have but we couldn't get our hands on one of those I'm talking instead about the interview 1700 dual monitor system my friends you could fit so many Global
patents in this bad boy for real though 14 unfortunately this product kind of sunk their monitor line it was Innovative sure but they say that the downturn in the Market in 2008 and 2009 was just terrible timing for it to launch I think it had other problems like say for example that this is clearly a business forward product from a company that up until then had been almost entirely focused on Gamers but to me it was more about the unnecessary of it I mean why buy two 17in TN monitors
when you can buy one dual 17in TN monitor there was cool stuff though and integrated 1.3 megapixel webcam which could swivel a built-in microphone three usba a ports I mean if they had launched this thing right in the start of the covid pandemic boom they would have nailed it they got the wrong Global crisis yet another problem is that it used a connector that you've probably never heard of DMS 59 or dual monitor solution 59 pins I love engineer names count them count those pins no the
monitors ran at 1440 by 900 each or wxga plus which is not to be confused with wxga the other wxga W sxg or wxga plus don't you miss when we named monitor resolutions like that it was great it makes full HD UHD QHD seemed downright sensible anyway none of that was the big feature the big feature was this whoa want to show the client what you're working on pry it's pretty cool compared to today these monitors aside from being TN are not great with a 500 to1 contrast ratio yes that is hundreds 220 nit Peak
brightness and 8 millisecond pixel response times but this thing would have been pretty sick for office use back in the day except that affordable larger panels were like kind of common place and 17 in was kind of bad yeah it's an all- inone solution so that I can what take it with me yeah look at that it's great why walk away we got this all we need is two display port to DVI adapters oh wow that is we set powered on we've spent so much time talking about evga's awesome design
this interview logo not their finest work I don't think this mouse works oh my God this does not illuminate okay hold on let's get a mouse be stock more like dead dead St have you guys got the interview already yeah okay that's great cuz I brought a vampire oh my God Interview with the Vampire wow that looks like garbage that's TN panel from 20 what 2009 one of the strats back in the day you guys was to put a glossy surface on the screen to kind of try and uh boost the perceived
contrast and Clarity it didn't work okay what games are we playing uh whatever you want Halo Counterstrike nice it's you know what it's not 60 HZ Linus it's better than 60 HZ wow that motion blur ghosting Trail it looks like I have most pointer Trails on it's pretty bad day  66350 this is it guys is ready this For Better or For Worse this rig is as EVGA as any rig can be it's dead quiet hey yeah should we get it closed up it looks amazing close it let's close it it is a
beautiful case hey you going to peel one side I was going to wait for the sr2 build yeah we kind of have to do wait for the sr2 build do the inside do the inside PE all right there it's at least a little bit more clear we're going to see it in all of its Glory next time there we go EVGA gamer okay here we go oh my goodness this is the worst thing ever it's playable this monitor is I don't remember Badness like this technically you're terorist look I can't tell on this monitor blaming the peripherals
well I mean a little bit Yeah that's what a real Gamer does look that's my blood on the wall no I'm going to win if you get a kill I I couldn't even see my Crosshair dude I couldn't even see it  bad come on I didn't hit him at all no no I got this I'm going to get a kill all right one kill oh no I have the bomb okay well yeah well follow your team follow your team yeah no just toss it to your teammate just rush B Rush B Rush B well what they're not rushing B you rush you said follow the damn team what is
this how did that not kill him you were aiming on his left shoulder his right camera left camera left I could see it from here that was his head I mean if it was his head he' be dead right I brought up float plane cuz we were talking about how you could stream on here float plane great streaming quality great show it's got a webcam right there okay wouldn't used that In fairness to me this is pretty bad huh it's pretty bad like remember when 40 milliseconds of input was a
thing I know this feels really rough so floaty pretty yeah right I can tell you have no control right now oh it's so bad youing at his shoulder I was I was I can admit when I was aiming at the wrong spot this sucks it's so hard okay here Colton you want to turn what what are we doing you got to try to get one kill what do you mean I got to try to get one kill easy what are you talking about the challenge is over when you get one kill oh what is happened hold on no you're dead you're
dead he doesn't even know he's spectating the monitor is called the interview do you get the joke now while he's wearing a cape yeah the joke is  some I didn't even realize what I was gaming on what what is this why yeah but what if I wanted to watch the game Bo does it even flip it did that was really good okay that's pretty cool that was really good if you manage to put a bullet on target you'll be ahead of me in play no he did that seems like a really high refresh rate uh 
66 I got one head shot W no yeah boom head shot another that's a tall order it was a nice shot though you could barely see his head that was pretty good now that some time has passed we've asked EVGA hey why did you guys end your partnership with Nvidia and stop making graphics cards in general and after some PR talk it basically boiled down to the market being til tilted toward the chip manufacturers and away from the addin board Partners meaning that their margins were razor thin and it just
wasn't worth it anymore it also seemed like they weren't happy with chip manufacturer restrictions that limited their ability to innovate which as you guys saw earlier was a big part of what EVGA was about nor were they happy with how expensive graphics cards a product meant for fun primarily were getting they said that Nvidia has strong technology and they wish them all the best in their future endeavors which apparently is all AI all the time now so take that as you will for now we
sincerely wish EVGA the best they didn't sponsor this video or anything and if I'm being honest I don't know if they're going to be around to honor their legendary 10year warranties their product lineup has shrunk and shrunk and shrunk down to it seems like they're going to be quite focused on power supplies going forward but hey we've still got a lot of fond memories and this was a lot of fun to do you'll find links to some of their products in the video description below um and you'll
