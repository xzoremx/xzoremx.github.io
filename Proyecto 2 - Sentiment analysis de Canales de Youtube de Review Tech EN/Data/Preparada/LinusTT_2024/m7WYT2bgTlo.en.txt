I bought this Windows laptop from the Amazon renewed store for $54 this one right here is a custom built top-of-the-line gaming PC for five grand and my friends that is far from the most expensive machine we've got but just because a system costs 10 100 a thousand times as much does that really make it that much better we're going to take a look inside these systems test them and game on them to see what your hard earned cash can buy at these drastically different price points
starting with what I got for 50 bucks look at this thing I don't know if you're supposed to do that and like look at the screen like it's got this segue to our sponsor ug green their nexo Pro 100 watt is Compact and Powerful being able to charge three devices at the same time whether it tags along with you during your travels or stays plugged in in your wall at home you'll first have to pick one up using the link in our description okay the Nova 100e only has a dual core processor Just 4 GB of
RAM and it doesn't even have a full HD screen but aside from a little bit of shmoo that's still on it from the refurbishing process I mean it's a pretty usable little machine except it's not what we ordered um I don't think anyways I was looking at the product page that's a completely different computer I think this is like the second generation one it doesn't support touch gestures you can't scroll with two fingers no she's dropping frames 100% of your CPU being used by System interrupts this
is a completely different computer yeah it doesn't even have the same processor I mean it has two extra cores so like the multi-core performance is better but the the single thread of is quite a bit worse it's like 25% worse which matters a lot on these super underpowered machines because a lot of what you'll see when you open up task manag and you do anything on a computer like this watch I'm going to open up Chrome is see that your CPU is going to spike 200% so having a few cores that
turbo faster actually makes for a noticeably more responsive experience it's emmc it's not a like a SATA SSD curiously it actually shows up as an SD card in task manager why don't you try to play a 4K YouTube video that's like you know I have a suite of tests that I want us to you know experience as a baseline on each of these machines and 4K crab Rave is one of the okay hold on a second J just give it a moment hold on hold on a second no no no hold on a second look that's mint no it's really 
now there were some drop frames ooh I can't tell if that's just the display mind you probably don't need to be streaming 4K videos on a screen like this oh yeah there we go there we go still like the same level of crust no no no no that's oh oh well don't try to multitask yeah I wouldn't recommend that you notice something weird about this there's like a skin on the bottom yeah why don't you peel it off it's on the entire laptop including the touchpad oh so whoever the student
was who had this probably cuz this is an educational model did they skin it you know what maybe the school put it on because it got damaged gave it to a new student yeah actually that's a really smart way to mitigate that when we were reacting to tech support Gore we saw some of what happens to these educational laptops and putting a plain black skin on them would mean if someone were to scribble all over it you just peel it off and throw a new one on imagine skinning this laptop between the
vinyl and the labor involved I think you just doubled the value of it does it look like it got applied yeah day one maybe day three oh my God are you rolling on this Glenn Glenn come over here Jake Jake check this out check this out so that's a screen right you know that's what  like if you want to get anywhere near that saturation you got to get the darkness oh I got to be shorter yeah you get see see what I'm talking about you get ass what are you talking about well I know but you get a little sliver of
color saturation oh I get what you mean yeah yeah right it's not good it's not good but it was also $50 yeah with Windows yeah and a battery if all you were doing was Google Docs it would be fine yeah and it's actually not the stupidest thing you could buy no it's really not considering the cost what's your next test oh my God Minecraft nice so I installed a few mods that make Minecraft run better okay so single player Minecraft you're doing the chunk generation yeah locally yeah yeah yeah
so if you're playing on a server you might get a little bit better performance this is with every setting at the absolute bare minimum with sodium which is a frame rate optimizing thing with lithium which is like optimizing the chunk stuff with another thing that does chunk optimization with another thing that does GPU frame optimization well have you ever thought that maybe adding all those optimizations added overhead no oh this is rough dude if you just vibe in one spot 64 FPS look at
that wow not bad not bad okay but what happens if we move o 20 hey as long as we don't have to generate any chunks you're right it's serviceable yeah it's chunky there are other games I want to try on the other computers naturally um they don't launch on this one yeah yeah wow if you get a head shot I will buy you lunch if you kill somebody I will buy you lunch so a head shot is two lunches sure I'll give you two minutes okay how about that two minutes okay you have five minutes then all right five minutes
Jesus did we load so long that we got kicked oh my God okay I'm I didn't even get a chance to see anything it's say one FPS but I think it's actually a situation where you you have like. five dude there is no way I'm dead not I'm it didn't even go to full brightness oh okay this is a strat hold on no no no no no no no come on come on come on yeah no dang it come on come on come on yeah buddy I got him let's go 1 minute left you did technically get a head shot too  it he's got the taste of defeat in his
mouth right now that's why he's all okay it takes a little while to register that you've pressed the recording button but hey once you do it it didn't look that bad this actually looks perfectly fine it's not very saturated oh thanks for that real mature it's not very saturated but In fairness that might be theen so maybe we can get a comparison from the editor here here here the footage versus what it looks like on the screen you know I have one more thing for you to
try on this one because the rest of them is are probably not worth it this is a client for olama which allows you to run large language models tell me how pretty I am in the form of a Hau oh my God okay the page file is twice the size of the actual memory so I'm never going to find out how pretty I am am I no okay oh oh oh oh oh red whoa it out put one word red that's not a hiu well you know what I'm taking it oh Radiance I kind of liked rad better oh wow it's actually oh it's like
going now I think it's finally like  dawn like Dawns light yeah oh it's going to get after us about how haikus are not about directly expressing Beauty but it's not going to get the number of syllables right okay she's done Radiance like Dawn's light pretty as cherry blossoms bloom Beauty descent full of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I mean your hair you could maybe say is radiant it can compute for $50 it can play a YouTube video and minecra is now we're moving up in the world how is this a $500 gaming
system this case alone looks like it cost 120 bucks this is the new one from fantex it's the XT Pro I believe a lot of case for not a lot of money tempered glass comes with a fan looks decent they do have an RGB version that's like twice the price don't buy that buy this and the specs are pretty decent too we get six Intel 12 gen performance cor 16 gigs of RAM a radon 6600 GPU and okay that 500 watt thermal take power supply hasn't made it through the lab's gauntlet yet but it's
running indeed it's a little bit over the budget you're looking at like $540 this is pretty much as good as it gets unless you're going to buy a used GPU which if you're spending this kind of money on a computer you probably should you won't get a warranty but you will get a lot more performance while that GPU is still working of course if you're gaming at 1080p this might be all you need anyway let's take her for spin wow that loaded a lot faster okay so we still have the optimization mods to make
it okay even playing field and I have the settings in the absolute dumpster like on the laptop it's at 1080p though so this is high resolution it's press F3 butter smooth um "1,800 frames per second turn the" settings up a little bit uh yeah I think we could afford to do that fabulous wow okay wow look at the world out there she's struggling just a little bit to be fair I wouldn't recommend running six render distance on like a local game that doesn't tell the entire story of
the performance experience in fact you guys can probably even see the occasional hitch in our recording and that's not because our GPU isn't fast enough to render this it's rather because the chunks need to load occasionally and the whole system's like play some Counter Strike hell yeah it's quiet though I was thinking exactly the same thing it's damn near silent let's see you get a kill you just wait so this is fully maxed 1080p is that it 200 FPS isn't enough for you I mean I don't know
I haven't played CS2 literally once this is so much better like not a 100 times better like last time actually is 100 a thousand times better in terms of the experience I mean you're standing right now how did you just how did how the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] did he not die you hit him in the shoulder I hit him in the neck no I'm sure it was the neck editor replay dude you can get so much gaming PC for around 500 bucks these days that's great all right let's fight boom why do you just oh my God 1080p medium
preset you turned off motion blur casual 80 FPS no upscaling it was 100 right there jeez this is great 70 plus degrees on the CPU and 56 on the GPU I mean hold on we're only drawing like 40 50 Watts on the CPU sure that's efficiency baby we don't even have the front fans installed in the case let's see how our  SSD is ramping up yeah okay everything's being loaded wow that is also also not a hi coup stop it for a second and say that's not a hi cou is that a h cou NOP it's closer than
it was either way that for 10 times the budget we are getting anywhere from 100 to a thousand times the experience and this is what we're talking about when we say bang for the buck or sweet spot from a value perspective you should definitely save your pennies for a $500 PC if you can the question now is is it worth spending another 10 times as much "and getting a $5,000" PC my goodness look at this thing "$55,000 but it looks the part doesn't it" it's one of those things where when you
get to this class of performance you kind of have to spend money on looks to get to this budget wow yeah that that's $300 of fans we spent as much on cooling as we did on the entire other computer by the time you put the aiio in there oh definitely yeah more easy yeah 6400 megat transfers per second dual 48 gig RAM sticks 360 mil a with a screen on it and look our 14900 K works it's a k here we go and loaded oh pretty good we've changed resolutions we're now at 4K boom
800 frames per second I'm still getting the occasional hiccup but honestly this is better than what we were running last time in terms of the playability of it like I can notice a difference than the $500 one oh yeah how is this even Minecraft I know right the crazy thing is if you don't run these shaders on stupid settings like we are this is the ultra preset for BSL shaders as they're called uh the performance hit is not actually insane this beautiful this is a lot and it's still running at 200 frames
per second this is awesome I adjusted the render distance down to 16 would you say that this is a 10 times better experience than the last one in Minecraft no no it's five times better if you don't waste money on $300 worth of fans okay hold on you could get pretty amazing performance for not quite 10 times the "budget you can immediately SL ,000 off" of this computer by just getting rid of the fans and buying a cheaper 490 you could probably drop another 100 bucks with a cheaper motherboard cheaper
cooler cheaper Ram it's like a $500 Ram kit oh crap oh my god oh you didn't even get killed by that guy that sucked stop it Jak stop that consistently above 200 FPS very nice do "you need a $5,000 computer to do that" not really full Ultra R tracing like hurt my computer settings with no dlss that's 45 FPS I believe it I don't believe that it does not feel good I'll set it to something more reasonable this is probably how I would play this game oh well oh my goodness I'm so sorry
oh oh I'm sorry sorry sorry again frame rate is identical okay see no I'm confused now because this is way smoother than it was before obviously smoother yeah but but it's reporting around 40 FPS so I think maybe the report before was wrong try like just no rate tracing sure oh yeah no that's 60 FPS for sure yeah yep oh yeah no the frame counter is right can it write a Hon oh what are our temps like oh wow yeah casual like 63 degrees on the GPU and our CPU got a little Spike there she
got a little spiky dude that GPU hit almost 400 watts yeah let it load for a  it just like who who that's a proper ha coup no way your radiant smile Cascades in waves of sunlight Beauty Endless Sea oh my goodness so it's look the GPU is actually at 100% usage what's our power consumption not even that high yeah do you want to try a harder to run  a daunting task spring hius no way it starts categorizing them wild Frosty morning silence snowflakes dance gently falling slow
Nature's peaceful hush this may be 10 times better than our last this may be more than 10 times or you might want to spend even more and treat yourself to "our $50,000 computer are are you ready" for this one I'm so ready try not to drop it I'm not going to drop it oh "$50,000 it's a server no it's not it's a" server it is a workstation and now it's a server I don't see it in a rack is this actually going to be faster for gaming I have no idea all right let's find out right away
I can see where some of the money went "why have one 2,000 wat power supply when" "you can have two 2,000 watt power" supplies the super micro as 2115 HV tnrt is no ordinary machine it might look like a server in fact it has a rack mount style case like a server would it even has server features like the ability to remotely manage it through a web interface but it isn't a server since it doesn't have a data center CPU like amd's epic lineup instead going for a thread Ripper and not just any thread
Ripper this is the full f Big Daddy thread Ripper Pro with a whopping 96 cores and 192 threads and oh my God it's beautiful wow this is a "$52,000 machine with everything that's" in here right now and this is a fifth of that just the CPU not one not two not three but four of nvidia's RTX 6000 Ada cards and these are special you know they might say that it's the same 8102 chip as a 4090 oh it's not this is the chip that would have been in a 490 TI which they never made so it has like 10%
more everything and double the vram these have 48 gigs of vram on them and we have four of them it works out to like a calm cool and collected "$27,000 at MSRP now typically when you" buy a system like this from Super Micro you'll spec it ahead of time for exactly what you want and they'll build it for you but we asked for more barebones config so we could take the original storage Drive they had in here and add some more oh yes each of these is one of Kia's 15 terabyte cd6 data center drives giving
us a total of about 100 terabytes of solid state storage in here does that "get us to 50 Grand to 52,000 actually" how much RAM did we put in here because it's thread Ripper Pro and not epic a lot less RAM sticks we only have eight channels they put eight 64 gig ddr5 dims so 512 gigs of RAM you could put more Micron makes 128 gig dims now all right I think we'll be okay with 512 GB of RAM for gaming for gaming this is threader for pro it is unlocked for overclocking you can turn PBO on this CPU does Super
Micro support that on this motherboard though oh really it's on the product page memory and CPU overclocking enabled mind you on this air cooler they only rate it to like 350 W oh that's it huh yeah oh wow which is the stock TDP it  more it's definitely 10 times louder than the last machine certainly and maybe a 100 times louder than the previous one it might be 100 times  one dude I'm going to click so many heads with this bad boy I can feel it  stop 96 cores and she still turbo over 4
GHz this is an incredible process tur's over 5 GHz crazy well I feel like we should start with the drives right we didn't really do a storage test on any of the other ones just because not that exciting this one different story you got to make make your radar this is ridiculous hey look at that think you could fit your games on here yes yeah I think so holy mackerel yeah she'll suck back about 170 Watts just moving data around all right "games yeah 2,000 again kind of depends"
where you're looking at that's not that great are these workstation cards really that much slower I wonder if this is one of those scenarios where we're we're actually CPU bottleneck yeah I mean we could be because even though we've got a ton of cores it's spread across multiple dies on the package so if we're accidentally using a core over on this die and a core on this die and a core on this die there can actually be a performance loss as that data gets fetched across the different dies
definitely is this the first time that spending 10 times as much gets to a performance downgrade yes okay render distance what do you want 16 chunks try 16 32 24 well you know we got all these cores just send it sure back to game oh dude dude dude dude dude did you see that one hitch at the begin but other than that even while it's generating chunks oh there was one more this is by far the smoothest I've seen I think it's the same it's not the same "the $5,000 rig no you'll feel it you'll"
feel it you'll feel it he slide on in she doesn't slow down see this is it folks maxed out Minecraft ridiculous mode despite there being 10% more everything in these graphics cards they don't have as much clock speed y they're power limited yeah so we are using it 100% now in some cases oh yeah no she goes up she goes up but a 4090 is still going to be faster in real applications that multi-threaded chunk loading is gnarly I think it goes so fast that it actually just like starts to crap its
pants a little bit all things considered 60fps yeah like it's definitely using more than one core oh yeah you know what's interesting though is that while we used to be able to run multiple gpus together to render games in SLI or Envy link these days it's kind of dead so you can run Counter Strike yeah but it's just going to use a single GPU and probably not going to run as well as our  FPS no so basically you shouldn't spend 10 times as much if you want to get better at CS2 unless we're talking about
a $50 computer but you could spend 10 times as much and get better at running large language models it's not even worth running cyber Punk at this point we're going to write the best Haus this is an enormous model it's bigger than the memory we have even across all of the gpus and I'm telling it to do the stupidest thing write me 100 hius about how mkb lore.com is we had a different vibe there immediately all of the GPU memory is full oh look at those drives go pulling 500 megabytes a second time 8 4 gbes a
second just casual just casual Jake loading up that system memory casual you can actually see it's going at a boat 4 gigs a second dumping it into system memory I suspect our GPU usage is not going to be that great but it should run which is more than you would get on most other computers oh oh I see I see power usage here we go here we go here we go so this looks unimpressive but this is like a 200 plus gigabyte model so it's actually kind of kind of impressive I mean our CPU drawing 240 250 just
coordinating all of this crap even like the top end h100 h200 kind of gpus that are meant for AI struggle to have 100% utilization when you're just talking to them rather than training it better be right is it right it's not even right oh my God we get the best model and it can't even do it okay hold on hold on LTT stores got all the best techies Rejoice now these suck it's 5 five but it's 8 in the middle I don't know how good they are with syllables either let's try a a small model on all the
gpus I am doing a destination wedding and I have no regard for the feelings of my family and friends who are inconvenienced by this that's literally all you're made for here we go I strongly advise again sending an invitation designed to manipulate your guests Microsoft and mistol are both  go got him so so easy oh man just pretend it's a meme bro hey look at that 150 WTS let's go well it does it how useful it is I don't know but sure it's fast you can do so so many AIS
on this thing we can do blender that'll  we l 2.6 seconds like it takes a second to get really good but wow should we render it sure hey that's right camera 9 seconds not worth it for gamers no definitely not first I think we need a bit of a summary on this one yeah $50 computer no Docs Google Docs sure $500 computer though dude if you're gaming at 1080p like the vast majority of people on Steam are 100% you're fine and if you're willing to go for a secondhand GPU you're more than fine you have a
great little machine that can do pretty much everything from light video editing and photo editing to playing games like "cyberpunk totally you can spend $5,000" and you will have a better experience and it will look cooler and you may even be a slightly better gamer but not nearly enough to justify the difference in expense no as for machines like this well if you don't know you need it you don't need it so you can put your oil PRS money away yeah unless you're like a
large language model oil prins yeah or a 3D rendering of O then it's great just like our sponsor Squarespace whether your business is just getting off the ground or you've been in the dark ages of cold calling for a while a website will give you that extra push to take things to the next level that's where Squarespace comes in their Squarespace blueprint guided design system gives you the ultimate starter pack to get the creative juices flowing with professionally curated layout and
