yes I'm free gone are my sponsor obligations to Qualcomm about their new Snapdragon X Elite chips I can say everything I want and guys following our lab running their most rigorous tests ho what I want to say is damn these processors are really good we got our hands on two of the machines that are supposed to de thrown AMD and Intel with performance and efficiency that is unheard of in a Windows laptop and while they might not live up to every single one of qualcomm's very bold claims
there's no denying both the sheer efficiency and the shocking day one completeness of the entire package kind of like this complete intro now that I've done the segue to our sponsor Odo running a business is difficult especially if you're jumping from app to app just to complete one transaction with odu's all-in-one software you can save both time and money by streamlining your processes click the link below to learn more let's kick this off with a fun little anecdote that qualcomm's
lawyers cut from our sponsored video for some reason nearly 12 years ago I had my first hands-on experience with Windows on arm it could browse the web with Internet Explorer navigate with Bing Maps and even play video to say we've come a long way would be a gross understatement you were looking at balers Gate 3 running on an AMD powered system and on a Qualcomm system and shockingly the results are nearly identical so of course the first big story here is performance the conventional wisdom about arm-based
processors is that they are extremely power efficient but that they fall behind x86 chips when it comes to Raw grunt well a few years ago that all fell apart when a little known fruit company out of copertino launched a processor that made even hardcore Windows users here in our office consider making the switch it was a huge blow to Microsoft and their Partners who were caught with absolutely zero response to the Wombo Combo of class leading performance and unheard of battery life that is until
now cuz Windows just had its M moment but no really like literally the man in charge of Apple's a architecture and presumably much of M was Gerard Williams and after the fun design Des phase of the M processors was over Gerard and a couple of others left to form a company called nuvia to make their own arm server processors which was a pretty good idea but then Qualcomm showed up and offered them a cool 1.4 billion to Pivot and build a mobile chip and a couple of years later why don't we let
the battery life results tell you how that went our Asus Vivo book S15 lasted over 14 hours away from the wall with our HP Omni book X able to crack 15 hours now you might be gearing up to get very mad about how that is absolutely nowhere near the numbers that Qualcomm advertised but you've got to remember that's in their tests and this is in ours and for context a MacBook Pro M3 that we bought just this week with zero battery degradation managed only 12 hours and 30 minutes in our test with
the rest of our laptops getting left in the dust which brings us to a big question how much a performance hit are you willing to accept to get that kind of battery life it's not like Windows on arm is new and there's a reason that it never got adopted well what if I told you that things are different now and the performance hit is virtually zero along with our MacBook Pro M3 we also tested a more price comparable MacBook Air M2 and then representing x86 we've got an Asus Zenbook with an Intel Core
Ultra 7 and we've got a framework 13 investment in framework disclosure with an AMD ryzen 7 all of them linked down below now we do wish that we had a more current ryzen 8000 chip but those are basically the same thing as ryzen 7000 but with some more AI bolted on but then not enough AI to meet the minimum specs of Microsoft's co-pilot plus program so we think from a performance and battery "life standpoint using 7,000 series here" is fine in multicore workloads running
an application natively the Snapdragon X Elite was able to beat literally everything we put it up against even Apple's M3 it's not a completely clean win I mean the Snapdragon chips have 12 CPU cores in them versus just the eight in Apple's M3 so that's going to be an obvious advantage in multi-threaded benchmarks and when we look at single core performance apple is actually still in the lead with Qualcomm barely besting Intel and AMD but you've got to note that it's possible Qualcomm still has
more in the single core tank currently we've only got laptops with the X Elite x1e 78- 100 chip going to hold back ranting about how horrible that naming scheme is for now but the important thing to take away from here is that this is the slowest variant of the ex Elite chip which entirely lacks dual core boosting and has the lowest multi-core speed so instead of being stuck at 3.4 GHz the faster ex Elite could go to 4.2 which presumably would perform a fair bit better with that said it's currently
very difficult to get reliable clock speed and power info from these chips so we just got to kind of guess what exactly is going on under the hood what we do know though is that we have multiple performance profiles on the Asus viab book S15 and we tested everything at both 35 watts and 50 Watts with multicore performance and cinch increasing by 177% for that 43% increase in power meaning that although more power does mean they can go more faster there are certainly diminishing returns after 35
Watts but of course this is workload dependent and that's why handbrake is so interesting in this Benchmark the Snapdragon X Elite once again comes out on top in both x264 and av1 encoding which is great but doesn't paint the whole picture for that we need to take advantage of the fact that handbrake is available in both arm native and x86 64 versions this allows us to look at the performance hit from emulating a more traditional laptop architecture and ooh 40% in both x264 and av1 that is a lot
more than the 10% figure that qualcom was throwing around and the same goes for blender where x86-64 emulation caused a 26% hit to Performance with that said though even with that performance penalty the Snapdragon X Elite was still able to hang with the competition while leading the way when we were running it natively unfortunately that's kind of the end of our productivity benchmark not because there aren't plenty of other pieces of software that ran but because getting
them to run across all of our platforms under test in a repeatable manner was kind of difficult to say the least with that said in general our experience with qualcomm's x86 emulation has been largely okay I hate using this F word but has been largely Flawless the occasional installer would get mad but once installed we had almost no problems running even some kind of unexpected and heavy programs like solid works there are two situations though where you can get caught out if an application
requires avx2 support it simply won't open or if a game has kernel level anti-che which brings us perfectly then to gaming now the raw performance of the Snapdragon chips very impressive rivaling both AMD and Intel's integrated Graphics when it works ah yes that's the caveat because sometimes he know work he's so good things do seem very early days with some games running wonderfully and some being a bit janky with others just not launching at all because for whatever reason qualcomm's igpu shows up
as having no vram that's a strange one one thing that's promising though is that there doesn't seem to be a performance penalty going from direct X11 to direct X12 something that's been a huge thorn in Intel side with the development of their Arc Alchemist gpus now given that Intel has spent the last 2 years getting their driver situation somewhat figured out for Arc it's probably going to be quite some time before we can recommend a Snapdragon X Elite chip for gaming but if I get my
way the end goal here will be to have a proper dedicated GPU in these things anyway so that we can have our battery life cake and also eat our gaming pie finally let's talk about AI Microsoft Qualcomm even your nan realist L won't shut up lately about how AI is going to revolutionize how you use your computer but after a week of playing with these machines this is the number of times that we used AI outside of explicitly testing it for this video the auto presence detection
legitimately kind of cool but can also end up being a bit distracting so we ended up disabling it the paint co-creator probably isn't going to be much fun if you're older than about 10 and the we were most excited for live captions with translation didn't really live up to our expectations in our testing it did a passable enough job going from Mandarin to English but it completely failed Cantonese French and Hebrew so you might just want to stick to a good old Google translate at least
for the time being also Microsoft's controversial recall feature is completely absent at this point which is probably great because Microsoft clearly has a lot of trust to build with the community before they're going to allow them to screenshot and key log everything they do on their computers the good news is that the benefits of this platform are about more than just co-pilot plus and one that I don't think enough people are talking about is the image quality advantage of the webcams
on Snapdragon X Elite laptops this isn't just down to laptop manufacturers using crappy webcams in their AMD and Intel designs though it's because qualcomm's s so includes a dedicated ated image signal processor that's built right in that conveniently allows laptop manufacturers to use much better smartphone targeted cameras that's why it looks so much better overall though AI aside guys this is an incredibly strong start for Qualcomm Snapdragon X processors we didn't get to test
everything so hit like if you guys want to see Alex and I switched to these laptops full-time for a month yeah a month but after our initial test the performance is good enough and the battery life makes every other processor company blush not only that but there's a shocking lack of Jank for our first gen product and with design wins from nearly every Windows laptop maker and not just yeah we shoved it in this weird skew we know nobody's going to buy like really good clean designs Qualcomm
clearly aren't the only ones that are confident in these chips and I'm very confident in this segue to our sponsor odou if your business is super glued together with a bunch of mismatched apps oh don't let it go on that way o Do's all-in-one business management software lets you combine all of your apps into a single unified operating system this not only saves you the time and effort of syncing everything up but also your hard-earned money I mean think about it how many $9.99 per month subscriptions
