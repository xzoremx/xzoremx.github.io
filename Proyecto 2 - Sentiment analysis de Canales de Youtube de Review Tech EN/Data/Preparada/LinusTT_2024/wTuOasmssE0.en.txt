I have a dream a dream of a sports and Esports gaming center with the world's fastest WiFi with an incredible whole building audio setup 4K cameras and  everywhere to be clear the dream is still alive but as you can see we are painfully behind schedule the power's not finished the date is barely half run and they are still today putting in the boxes that our Wi-Fi is supposed to amount to and somehow we are supposed to be soft opening at the end of next month but we have a plan with the help of
ecoflow who sponsored this video and sent over their awesome new Delta Pro 3 smart battery backup to give us power while we work I and the tech Avengers here are going to be hopefully solving some of our problems and getting this train back on the tracks and by hopefully I mean we have to because starting tomorrow Jake and I are each  weeks to get 100% completion of this part of the project we need a rack two wall racks nine patch panels 200 terminations four fiber Bays eight
Network switches 200 patch cables let's just see how far we get um the good news is the rack will at least be a little bit easier than last time thanks to an awesome new technology um that okay it's kind of like that tool for eating you know but like huge like a fork yeah yeah that's how we got it up here cool right okay maybe there's a little bit of movement still oh yeah it's got to go in that room huh oh jeez I just need to get under it okay one moment please okay wow we
good we good yeah yeah yeah you're good yeah buddy and now it's on Wheels hey thanks Hammond manufact uring this is part of their H1 series of data center cabinets it's 42 rack units plus these cool six extra ones on the side that honestly don't even make it that much wider which should be enough for all the networking server equipment and battery backup that we'll need for our badminton and pickle ball business and hopefully Esports gaming events assuming the city of Siri gets on board knock on wood
metal wood speaking of networking I hope we have a plan for all of this hey it's not so bad some of it's going downstairs why did we bring it up here thing is in a building this big you don't have the option of home running everything to the same server room because some of the ethernet runs are longer than the maximum supported distance one way around this is to use fiber optics and in some cases where we need very high-speed connectivity over a great distance that makes a ton of sense
but in most situations within this building it doesn't so instead of us trying to work out how to adapt a fiber cable into every single security camera we built this closet that is also going to be packed with networking realistically we probably could have crammed a regular floor standing Rack in here but as someone who has done that in the past in a room this size it really sucks and this is just for Network stuff anyway so instead we opted for a pair of these hammonded wall all mounted
vertical racks this side over here is primarily going to be for the fiber that connects this room to the main server room as well as the fiber that connects it to the second wall for gaming events that we're hoping to be able to host uh massive shout out by the way to infinite cables when I first heard their name I didn't really take it seriously but given how much theyve sent us for this project I think it might be literal I think their supply of cables is infinite so anything on this side of the courts
or in the office up front that's going to the server room right over there everything else is going to terminate into this little Network closet right here that is smack dab in the middle between the two units going into a switch which effectively resets our maximum distance then we have a high-speed fiber link that goes back to the main server room where Jake is the last piece we need for the fiber side is this UniFi high-capacity aggregation switch it's got 20 8 10 gig SFP plus
ports and then it's got four 25 gig SFP 28 ports these are the ones that are going to run back to the server room the rest of these are going to be short fiber patch cables from this to the other side where we're going to have all of our copper and that's going to be for our Wi-Fi access points our security cameras I don't know if we have a POS terminal in the concession stand POS that kind of no not piece of oh point of it's the same thing because so many of the devices on this side can be powered
with their network cable using Poe we're going to be using their Pro Max 48 Poe this thing is sick it's got a total of 48 Poe ports 32 of them are 1 gig with looks like eight of them supporting poe+ plus so that's higher power devices it's got 16 that run at 2 and a half gig that's perfect for our Wi-Fi 7 access points and then it's got a handful of SFP plus ports that run at 10 gigs so if we were to trunk all of these then we could have up to 40 gigs on our Uplink here which is way more than we would
need probably the coolest thing about this though is that it has RGB lighting and not in like a silly you know for gamers way what do they call it ether lighting lighting something like that it's diagnostic so it works best when paired with you their patch cords that are clear and translucent so it kind of catches the light you can pick a port in their software and go go show me that one or you can color all your APS green and your security cameras purple or since the low voltage construction Lads
are terminating fiber in the main server room right now we kind of don't want to get in their way so we're going to be building up the rack in the corner office here Jake's got all the gear that he's going to be populating it with kind of laid out here actually this is not even all there's more awesome so I'm going to leave him to that for now what he's going to need in order to make sure any of it works though is power which is going to be provided by our ecoflow Delta Pro 3 we were originally thinking
of deploying this thing as part of the W show set so that we could make the ultimate Unstoppable W show like seriously we could broadcast the entire show off of this thing plus the battery units that Jake has over there do you want to bring those in Jake yeah sure fantastic that feels great doesn't it here you go okay basically their ip65 ated and we've got a total of 12 kwatt hours of battery in the pack that we've got here let us know in the comments if you still want to see us do that wow
setup but for now this was great timing for us to be able to test this stuff while the power to the building isn't fully hooked up yet so we'll be running entirely off of these pre-charged batteries for today but in the long term this has a ton of flexibility in terms of power inputs it comes with a standard nonproprietary c19 charging cable and with an upgraded cable like this one from infinite cables it can do up to "4,000 wat Max AC charging speed and yes" supports both 120 and 240 volts it can
also get power with Solar Direct from your car's alternator uh it can use EV charging it can use your car's 12vt outlet and it can even use a gas generator most importantly for us though it has a sub 10 millisecond transfer time meaning that it behaves about like a proper server UPS so even if the power does go out or you know doesn't exist in the first place our networking equipment should perform flawlessly and with an "output of 4,000 watts you can even power" High wattage appliances like AC units
water pumps fridges and more of course Jake also needs internet which he's told me is going to be a bit of an adventure so while he works on building out the rack I guess I'm going to go figure that out so the server room is way on the other end of that wall and our internet connection comes in here where aj from the float plane SL lmg infr team everything yeah whatever AJ is going to help us get from this box to there yeah but it's not that simple no cuz we are running single mode fiber up to the room
problem this single mode yes so everything's great no this is a apcsc cable and we're trying to run it to an LC adapter uhuh but uh we don't have it yet so what we're going to try to do is take this cable and splice it with uh what infinite cable provided which which is uh fast connect kits and yeah we'll we'll see how it goes and hopefully it works and we have Internet so we're just going to hope that even though I've never feel terminated fiber before that I'm going to pull it off yes so I have
to get this on onto the fiber that's in there yes it's a fast connect how the this is fast oh you got it and it's not long enough I think no no that's fine that's fine that's good you know what this was a practice run don't even worry AJ dude we got this we're Unstoppable you know the uh the success uh chance are very slim um we're trying our best but I don't think we're doing this the right way dude to all the professionals watching this saying hey they're doing it wrong
we know we're just trying stuff we're trying stuff you got to try stuff in  while Lina sorts out that side of the internet let's talk about this side for our router and I mean controller this thing does a lot we're using a pretty new device this is called the dream machine pro Max and if you're not familiar with ubiquity dream machine lineup it's a router controller kind of NVR which is for security camera recording switch Allin one they also upgraded the CPU so instead of around 3.5 gbit of intrusion
detection prevention this one can do about 5 gbit and it can firewall and Route at full 10 gig which with the little 10 gig ports we've got here should be perfect for our application except we have not just one but two next up is a fiber lgx I don't know what lgx stands for off the top of my head but it's basically a fancy thing to hold fiber cables kind of more properly you've probably seen us in the past just use a normal like ethernet patch panel with keystones which works
but not the best because it's not really protected and since we have a lot of armored fiber coming in here they can actually just poke the armor straight into this box and then inside the fiber will spool up in here and be protected behind and all we have in the front is just little patch caes now that the fiber lgx patch Bay thingies are installed we can talk about our core switch it's the same switch that was downstairs literally turns out the plan kind of changed and all the fiber is
coming up here so we stole the the high cap irrigation we showed you downstairs and we're putting it up here uh this is going to be our core switch so the internet comes into this guy and then all of the other switches in the building even the ones downstairs are going to connect into this directly so every single switch in the building it's going to look like one big Branch off of this one it just makes kind of management easier so even though we're going to have a bunch of extra ports on
here and we could use those for the fibers down there we just want to keep everything that's access like a device plugs into it separate from this core switch just to make maintenance a little bit easier and kind of the topology a little bit simpler our stack is droo our this whole thing is just look at how bad this is I know it's oh I'm actually a little worried about that that looks like it's going to bend turns out it's kind of our fault we didn't order the blanking panels that are supposed to go
here and reinforce this if you're not using it so for now we're going to just try and stick the gear in and see what happens if it doesn't work we'll have to like distrib some of the load in the parts that are better reinforced and then change it later about a painstaking hour later we have almost everything installed we've got all of our switches and most of our patch panels and fortunately it's it's a lot less sketch now I mean it's still a little bit sketch they're going to send us the
blanking panels which will help that but it is far more stable and the last piece at least for now is these nvrs we're using standard ubiquity nvrs even though they have a pro NVR that is to use I just like using the standard ones because you can do two and then stack them together in software so that you get the performance of having multiple discrete units they act like one in software um and you can fit more hard drives speaking of hard drives we're going to be using these Cate 22
terabytes which seems like Overkill and it's because it is thanks to Cate for sending these over we're going to equip each of them with four so we'll have like 100 terabytes almost or 90 terabytes almost in each unit I should be quite a bit of camera capacity I don't know if I mentioned this yet but the ecoflow has this wonderful 240 208 volt 30 amp plug in the front so we got an adapter this is l1430 to l630 and then we just had a random pdu which is just fancy term for
big ass power bar uh and we're going to leave that in the back of the rack for now long term we have proper like networked pdu so we can like turn off a port if we want if something's broken and not responding to power cycle it but for now this will allow us to turn things on and try it out we have 7.6 days of power oh we have 32 days of power look at that it's all off battery thanks ecof flow I feel the the Eco flowing through me right now do you feel it Sean I feel something but not sure if
it's Eco oh if you hit me in the face I'll give you 20 bucks hey that sounds   ah it's not bad eh boom you have no idea how easy this is going to be I for many years have hated  longer boom done boom it's managed it might not be managed well but it only took seconds and if I need to change it again like maybe to do it proper L boom pretty cool huh LTT store.com which will be linked down in the description along with links to all the other stuff we installed which is going
to be a very long list at this point I'd love to do a little check-in with Dan yeah you told me about our amazing you know IP speaker system and all of oh my goodness these are really big they're so green they are very green so they're from sound tube entertainment who the devil are they and what's good about this I don't know are we doing a test with the speakers today I would hope so do you have Poe I would hope so there's there's no um there's nothing in the ceiling we're going to have these pretty much
everywhere so this is not going to be the kind of place where you know could the owner of a super loud BMW please be less of a jackass are we allowed to say that about Jake if you can't hear us oh probably he'll review the video wow nice rack it is dude look at look at how mint it is there's definitely no flex there's a little bit of flex yeah we're missing the like right the blocking panels I mean whatever but everything's plugged in and MCM cable managed we're just waiting for you to
mount an access point and then do we get to do a Wi-Fi test yes awesome you should go do that uh see you later now I've ridden a scissor l before but I have never gone this High the ceiling  m i mean solid right now I got to tell you I've overcome a lot thanks to my years as a painter but my natural state is to be quite distressed by Heights um and this is by far the highest I've ever gone in a scissor lift  this okay I do not like this okay what am I supposed to do terminate a cable and install the
AP I am so unhappy right now I don't think I could be less happy yes I could be less happy um there could be a cactus in my right now now while I'm doing this I would be less happy but I am pretty unhappy Andrew you worked construction do you are you like comfortable with this yeah I don't mind this at all yeah okay well you know what good for you don't suppose you guys sent me up here with a testing tool or anything huh no I forgot sorry yeah cool that's fine so the testing tool is just
you plugging the WAP it should light yeah yeah yeah okay WAP has a really different meaning in English now don't call it a WAP she's plugged come on baby please work hey there it is there good enough right beautiful hey we did it okay let's get the hell out of here okay please God for once in your life oh me I could have handed it to him in a less precarious way why did you give it to me with all these pieces I just need the phone cuz it's okay speed test let's go woo how fast is it going 1.3 1 Point 1.3
gigabit damn damn what's our internet speed here 3 gig 3 gig all right oh yeah you're so you're connected to the same AP as me you're at I'd set that to 6 GHz 320 wide I only got 300 up it's is our connection symmetric yes but you might be far away and 6 GHz is very low range yes okay fair enough well I can fix that we're closer to a gig and a half now download 1.43 and my upload is about 550 megabit I have some bad news yeah so while you are testing Wi-Fi 7 they haven't
released firmer with mlo or multi-link operation yet which is what allows you to connect to like 5 GHz and 6 GHz at the same time and maybe get like 2 gabit over Wi-Fi uh they don't have that yet all right oh no way so these new APS the U7 Pro Max have a dedicated radio for scanning oh cool so they can scan all the time you don't have to like pause the Wi-Fi to scan so if you're having Wi-Fi problems you can go pick the AP that's closest to it and see what the hell's going on very cool you don't
even need a wipy or a Wi-Fi man which is ubiquity equivalent product now some of you might have noticed that this is extremely Overkill the fact that we've got four APS out in this Warehouse we've got another one on the mezzanine that we're standing on but assuming we get our land gaming events going we could have hundreds of people in here and that's where the additional APS are going to make a big difference other than that it's very similar to the U6 Enterprises which we have everywhere we
love those things the only real difference is it's Wi-Fi 7 which is flipping awesome yeah it's like theoretically 20% faster than Wi-Fi 6 kind of out of the gate assuming the device supports it and then once mlo is enabled yeah I've seen results that are well in excessive you know 2 gabit per second Wi-Fi real world guys now there's multiple different ways that MLL can be used and one of the big ones is latency imagine this in Wi-Fi if you're not familiar it's not like an ethernet cable
if somebody's using it to a certain degree you have to wait for them to be done that's what makes Wi-Fi High latency sometimes and not so much others imagine now you can go oh this radio is in use okay let me go to this other one the 6 GHz band now you have 50 devices that are using your you know 4x4 thing and your latency is low incredible I'm just curious how much battery we have left on this thing we still have 92% battery and we've been messing around with this all day 300 watts 1.3 days
"that is awesome below 2,000 Watts it's" not supposed to go above 30 DB cuz they have like this crazy cooling setup and if you look at the front you see that Grill if you look in that Grill you see the fans in there they're like there's like two 92 mil fans in there oh yeah look at them go they look Hefty where's X boost the app for the one that I have in my car is like super simple you can't do a lot with it but it just works oh so simple right this thing can boost to "like 8,000 Watts if you need for a"
little bit which is kind of insane all right the big thing is if we had the actual proper plug yeah we could turn this up "to the full 4,000 WTS and it'll pull" that 208 volt 30 amp right from the wall actually I think we need 240 volt for that but for now if we were just to plug it into a normal plug right just go down like watt or if you have a lot of other things on the circuit you could set it to 600 watts just knowing that it's going to take longer but you're not going to try up your breaker right
especially since you have that giant "battery cache if you need to draw 1,000" Watts for an hour or whatever it's fine it will just refill when it is lower the electronic strike doesn't fit in the door what how does that happen do we have we don't know they they built it and the strike does not fit for those not familiar an electric strike is a little module that goes in here that's powered that allows you to unlock a door with you know a fob or uh your phone or whatever the case may be yeah yeah hey
yeah there we go okay and so our problem is that this no fit it kind of looks like it could maybe when you take this off there's an interior Gang Box here's the plan we already opened this one anyway so let's wire it up so we can show the fine folks how our ubiquity access is going to work and how it will just release this thing and a door will open and we'll just get different electric strikes that actually fit in our doors later we can do that nice I'm glad we're finding out today and not a
month from now sh Shadow mode right we we know Shadow mode we're familiar do we Shadow mode is taking your UniFi router SLC controller SL protect camera monitoring system basically your dream machine and synchronizing it to another one now it's not real time redundant like if one goes down just boom immediate automatic failover at least not yet but what it is wait wait wait oh well you you didn't let me get oh did I ruin the surprise yeah oh well okay sort of the way that it's
set up right now yeah it is just like a warm spare it's a warm spare but in the current like Alpha 4.0 you can do automatic High availability failover that's awesome so it wires up exactly like you'd expect you have the two cables from whatever your internet box is uh the two are connected together and then one from each to whatever switch you have and then boom it just does oh that's awesome yeah ubiquity is moving from you know high-end consumer SL SMB to like for real though yeah oh do we
still have the film on the camera it's in there maybe oh you guys you got a cover on the camera you better make an entertaining face otherwise this was all for nothing oh jeez I was right absolute dork is this thing on hey not bad it's not bad actually all right yeah no I think we're I think we're pretty good yeah but if I want to see the lights on the rack well the rack's going to be in the middle of the room oh all right right therea yeah that's pretty good awesome that looks great but what about
access control it turns out that the doors that we installed ah have all the room in the world for our electric strikes but the doors that were part of the base building before we started doing our improvements are different ones so we just have to Source some different strikes for those but for now we should be able to just like do this right oh did you did you unlock it oh no ow what got to tell me if you're going to unlock it I was like I was showing that it was locked of course it's not
that impressive to be able to press a button on your computer and unlock the door I mean we had that technology 30 years ago what's really impressive is that we can use either NFC fobs or phones or even if you know it's not one that requires authentication a wave of a hand like for exit actually how cool is that right pretty good the plan is to have access control on basically every door in the building and the reason for that is that our goal is to allow members to have 24/7
access but only to the parts that allowed to have access to and that might change so if there's a land event going on on the one side right then no badminton members do not need to be going in there for security reasons so no one gets their computer stolen so depending on what's going on in the building we could have very different levels of access for different people who carry fobs or who have the app on their phone right so we don't know how much if any of that is ultimately going
to be rolled out but we wanted to be ready for it and we didn't want to be retrofitting the building you wanted to have the flexibility to do whatever you want to be able to do yes gotcha that makes sense flexibility can be very expensive the camera down here is a different model too that's the Dome we needed cameras down here that were tamper resistant like they have a cover cuz the turret ones you could just go up and just move it out of the way right this one has a cover so you can't just
like screw with it down here got it yeah we I mean realistically we understand there's going to be some shrink any retail operation has some but we'd like to minimize it and we'd like to know who's causing trouble right we are going to have pretty much a blanket policy that anyone who walks through the door is going to be registered even if they don't pay for a higher chair of membership right so don't imagine that you're going to be coming back if you get in trouble the bad news is we didn't
get everything done today but the good news is that leaves lots of content for the next Vlog setting things up here which is probably going to be speakers yeah I'm really excited about that setup yeah oh my God there's so much more to do if you guys enjoyed this video maybe go check out the uh Linus improves his house playlist it was this kind of chaos but on a smaller scale yeah equally as painful
