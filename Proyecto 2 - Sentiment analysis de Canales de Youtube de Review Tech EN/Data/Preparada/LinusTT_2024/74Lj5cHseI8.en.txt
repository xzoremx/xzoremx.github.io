they called me a Madman it'll leak it'll  science through the power of 3D scanning and printing at long last we've done it a Hardline watercooled gaming PC with impossible tubing bins and all it took was some really cool technology a bit of modeling and patience let's start with the first one this thing is so freaking cool the Ein scan Pro 2x V2 from shining 3D is a multi-functional handheld 3D scanner that is exactly what it sounds like this can be used to create a digital representation of small and
medium-sized objects just like our computer here after calibrating it against their handy dandy calibration board it works by shining a white LED pattern onto an object then registering any deformations of that pattern through the attached camera of course because our computer is black and even worse kind of reflective it uh no works so good out of the box fortunately fixing that is as simple as picking up a can of this as sub's matte Vanishing spray which no before you ask will not make your computer
disappear but what it will do is help out the scan by covering your object in an 8 to 15 micrometer layer of matte material that can even be in different colors and will sublimate away or change from a solid to a gas after just a few hours now that our computer is no longer reflective or refractive we're good to take a short break and tell you about our sponsor AC chonis their Business Solution acronis cyber protect delivers protection against cyber threats along with a full Suite of backup and Recovery
Solutions check it out at the link in the description and unify your business's data protection and cyber  we did a full short circuit video on the in scan where you guys can see the whole process but in a nutshell it's basically Star Trek and then you export the rough model from their software for a bit of clean up in blender or the modeling software of your choice that's it even before cleanup actually unless you're doing something more elaborate it is more than usable for some quick quick
simple tubing runs at this point all we've got to do then is model our tubes from one fitting to the next using Fusion 360 which by the way has a hobby license that is free and then hit the print button right well not quite part of the point of this project was that we didn't want to bring out the saws and pipe cutters heat guns torches and deburring tools so one final step that we're going to add to the modeling process is to add our own chamford Edge to the end of every tube so that it can
slide right into our compression fittings now we print and while you wait you can head over to LTD store.com to check out our new Labs phase shirts and sweaters for our tubing we started by testing the most common 3D printing material pla on ausa markv I mean in theory it should work and you can't beat the ease of use but as it turns out people don't do this for a reason the glass transition temperature of pla is around 60° C and our water shouldn't ever get that high but in the event of a
pump or a fan failure it could happen which would cause our tubing to soften and deform turning a bad situation into an absolute catastrophe now we could switch to petg which is the same material used by many Hardline tubing suppliers but solving the material issue still doesn't solve the paracity issue this style of layered deposition means that there are teeny tiny gaps between the layers that prevent our system from being completely watertight now we could fix it if we
really wanted to by smearing epoxy along the entire length of the tube but I mean come on that's a pretty goofy solution when we can do this instead man these are cool do I get any credit for this being my idea to try no Justin said yes this was my idea what the resin well just 3D printing in general I suggested the resin printer fine fine whoever's idea it was or wasn't this is so freaking cool some of these are really clean like look at this Bend yeah it's like perfect right it's
it's almost too perfect it's perfect I mean there are parts that are less perfect clearly we had to do some sanding here with a resin goo kind of dripped but like dude have you ever tried to Hardline bendit 2 before yeah could you do this shape oh no oh no no no no I mean look at this 90° coming out of one of the fittings you cannot do that you can do it and then cut down sure but it still won't be that tight if you have a clearance issue you cannot achieve that radius by hand bending now
obviously to get things this exact you're going to need models of the fittings that you're going into so that you can ensure it's going to line up perfectly but you don't even need to do that you can do a little bit of trial and error and you can actually cut or sand these down to length just like you would with regular Hardline tubing if you overdo it SLA printing is super cool it works by UV hardening resin of that and one of the biggest advantages aside from a lack of paracity and a glass
transition temp that's higher than pla is customization I mean you could buy resin in various colors and keep them all in stock but why do that when you can buy clear resin and then dye batches whatever color you want or better yet use UV reactive dye to make your tubing glow under a black light SLA printing is also the secret to being able to achieve shapes that would be impossible with traditional manual bending guys I've done a fair number of Hardline water cooled systems and even I am not about
to sit here and try and bend my own shell spiral let's see what our system looks like with something more like this oh I love it so much but lonus you might warn resin is brittle it's going to crack or even shatter under the pressure of a custom water cooling Loop well I mean you're not wrong but you'd also be surprised by just how strong this stuff actually is we bought some monocure 3D tough High tensile strength resin from spool 3D Canada and it's worked out pretty great so far and while
we of course aren't going to recommend that you do this at home because I don't want to be liable for your RTX 480 or whatever I'm confident enough to risk my own RTX 480 and we're going to leave this computer running for 6 months or until it leaks with regular updates on  oh this looks incredible and best part guys is that it looks like any other Hardline build except for people are going to look at it and go how on Earth did you do that because these builds are wild I mean
even a skilled Artisan like Charles Harwood creator of the mbx MK2 murder box couldn't do something like this Charles that's not a challenge just sit down and look I'm not going to sit here and tell you guys that this Loop has the best possible flow rate and sure um some of it looks more like a silly straw or a water slide than an actual you know tubing job but the point of the experiment was to find out where the limits are and I feel like we're just scratching the surface I mean okay we
did kind of find some limits um can you tell me what happened with this yeah I basically showed up installed a tube it leaked and delayed the sheet by like a whole day because all of this was covered in water so we had a small pinhole leak but I don't think that that invalidates the concept especially because looking at this tube it's not even immediately obvious where you guys fixed it what did you even do just put a little bit of resin on it or glue that's a really simple fix then yeah okay tell
me this knowing everything you know about this okay we haven't done the durability testing yet would you do a system like this probably not oh I just hate resin printing everything else is awesome I just hate the resin it's so terrible to work with fume oh okay that's why we have Justin if someone else could print it for you if you just used like a 3D printing service sure yeah this actually pretty  Truth that's pretty fun watching that is so cool it's the impossibility of it
like yeah you could maybe create a custom mold for something like this but it would be specific to that model of PC it that particular case and damn near impossible to injection mold but with the beauty of additive manufacturer look at it go to be clear even 3D printing this there could be some trickiness you'll have to play around with supports you might have to do some finishing to get it to look a little bit nicer but the sky is the limit we went with 10/12 mm tubing but
you could do bigger tubes smaller tubes and this is kind of cool okay you've played with solid Works flow simulation yeah would anything prevent you from like okay this is so close to being a signed to you already and I haven't even talked to you about it yet would anything would anything prevent you from creating a an open loop so you actually have like a a water slide that you like create laminer flow and like blast the water over to a receptacle and like a waterfall can we
do the loop such that we're cooling the GPU and the CPU has an NHD and it waterfalls over it I mean can we yeah okay no promises though I think the best part of this though is that while we did use a 3D scanner you don't have to you can totally do the work the traditional way by just measuring out your runs and then modeling accordingly and if you think about it even the 3D printer is kind of optional right like we've got an eligo Saturn 4 ultra which retails for around $400 but there are
online services that that will print things for you as long as you find something with a good amount of vertical print height for your lengthier tubes or a wide printing bed just make sure that you're using something that's precise enough that your tolerances aren't going to cause leaks at your fittings so an eligo Mars 4 or better is what we would recommend without breaking the bank this limits us to either smaller form factor machines though or a lot of money spent on interconnecting fittings for
extensions as for the resin itself the price does vary quite a bit but we can get a liter of the same stuff that we used for about $80 which will create quite a lot of tubing for example our proof of concept here took only 87.4 Ms out of our 1 L jug which is about $8 now realistically I don't see that many folks putting this into action um outside of maybe Niche small form factor Builders but just like everything in 3D printing as the quality goes up and as the costs come down I could conceivably
see a small to midsize system integrator shipping hardlines systems at a super low cost because most of the cost of a Hardline system is not in the tubes it's in the labor all the measuring and all the cutting and bending and installing or I could even see home users sharing models with each other so that Hardline tubing could become as simple as copying your buddy's case selection and building list and measurements and then just printing out the same set of tubes throwing them in and calling it a day if
you do want to get your own SL printer by the way just make sure you take the proper safety precautions resin is hella toxic like gaming subreddit toxic so you want to avoid that but don't avoid our sponsor charge their ice mag isn't just any regular old power bank it's the world's first magnetic power bank with active cooling built right in that's right it not only runs cool but it also looks cool thanks to a transparent window and full spectrum Dynamic RGB lighting supported is 7.5 wat Max
