what is up you guys and welcome to the Taiwan show we're here at computex where I spent about maybe two hours on the show floor and Luke spent even less probably about the same actually really oh yeah high five good job yeah uh we've got a lot of great topics for you guys today uh starting of course with Ikea apparently hiring digital employees to work at the Roblox store dude is the metaverse actually real people wanted work from home I that they did but did they want to work from
Roblox probably not in other news uh Intel wants to fight arm while AMD appeals TR to tradition but the big news of course this year at computex is Qualcomm and their Snapdragon X Plus and Snapdragon X Elite processors I did get to be handson with them which is pretty exciting we're going to be talking about that later what else we got today Luke Nvidia is number two how dare you look I don't always agree with them but you can't call them that you prepped that you had that
prepared that was preemptive I don't know how I feel about that um what else I don't know overpriced maybe but you can't say the quality is number two you know like that right you have an Nvidia graphics card in your computer we got some number two in there um and we have an update on the car thing stuff we talk about that I guess yeah sure we'll talk about Spotify car thing yeah oh how do   the show is brought to you today by ag1 Squarespace and manscaped why don't we jump straight into our headline topic
this week which is that Ikea is launching the coworker game a virtual experience inside Roblox whose gameplay will apparently involve serving meatballs and decorating showrooms what um the game is open to anyone uh the broader Roblox Community Gamers and Ikea fans alike I do wonder how much you know overlap there is between those groups um and this is according to Ikea's press statement Ikea is also hiring 10 people for fully remote virtual roles in this virtual Ikea Universe At a rate of
13.15 pound per hour which Ikea says is aligned with the pay recommendations of the living wage foundation for the city of London I pretty much promise you that nobody is living in London for 13.15 pounds per hour but that's a whole separate conversation yeah the hiring process will involve an interview hiring questionnaire and the submission of a resume and applicants from the UK and Ireland must be at least 18 years old wait so do you have to live in the UK or Ireland I don't know probably not
if you're working for 13.15 pounds an hour um you are probably not living many places in the UK or why is there only rules for there um I don't know maybe they're willing to hire children as long as they're not in the UK and Ireland I I I legitimately don't know weird okay uh quote we are excited to be the first brand to launch paid work on Roblox to Showcase How We Do careers differently bringing our unique careers philosophy to life at Ikea there is no set route to Career progression our
co-workers are able to change roles switch departments and grow in any direction they choose both in the game or in the real world wow yeah to to clarify paid players must be 18 plus and in the UK or Republic of Ireland to apply okay so you do have to be in the UK and rep of Ireland so here's my question for you when you were 18 yeah would you apply for this what do you even do you you hang you hang out like you've got the Press you've got the press release open yeah do you hang out
in in the in the store is it is it a store like it's it seems to be like Ikea employee simulator but but some of them are paid yeah I don't know how you like help customers and stuff when the game is people being what you are isn't it I don't know maybe you manag their shifts Luke maybe you're not thinking metaverse maybe you're like the the the the dungeon master of this Ikea simulator you like create events and stuff I have no idea sure you could you could spawn customers or I might apply for it but to
be completely honest uh at that time I was I was seeking employment that paid more than this even back then and there was options for that well hold on hold on 13.15 pounds what the what the devil is that hold on 13.15 pounds to Canadian Dollars okay here we go here we go okay that's 23 Canadian dollars an hour I don't that's abut not too bad yeah like when when I was that age I was making well hold on a second though because we got to convert so in 2003 I was making 16 Canadian dollars an hour so inflation
calculator uh sure I'll use a us 18 2003 uh 17 okay but that's when I was working got it okay that's when I got my first job out of high school and I was making the same the year after so 2003 uh $16 an hour is what I was making okay uh 2727 so I was I was ahead all right but but In fairness I had to get certifications in order to do my job I was working as a lifeguard and swimming lessons teacher so that was probably a grand total of about "$1,500 in certifications not to mention"
the unpaid time which is Out Of Reach for some people right so so so I'm I'm I'm paying to invest additional time in in getting those certifications so you know how many hours would I have had at at $4 an hour hold on I don't even cover my certification cost so divided by four I don't even cover my certification cost until I've worked hundreds of hours right so so yeah realistically it's maybe not that bad except that the problem is that I've been I've been to London um yeah and like I mean it's not
only London though yeah I I I just mean my my point is just that it's not as simple as your cost of living is just like currency conversion right like things just cost more over there to my crappy Canadian currency even compared to right like you can't just yeah you can't just you can't just convert your currency so the fact that they're making you know 13 pounds or whatever it is an hour if things just cost more because they're pounds or something then it doesn't really it doesn't really help
you so the math that we're doing is not fully representative uh really what I wanted to talk about is is more along the lines of like would you have been willing to work in a virtual store would you have applied to work in a virtual store oh yeah I mean I applied for whatever at that age like I don't know who cares okay I'm gonna try this one more time without just like no I definit discriminately applying to everything would this okay out of the 10 jobs you apply to would this where would this
rank which one would you want uh I would have probably wanted the one that I had at the time at at that time Geek Squad was a separate entity to Best Buy and it was actually like super cool I definitely would have preferred the job that I had at that time over this but it is definitely also something that I would have considered I think out of the out of the top 10 it would probably have been like three or four it's not too bad you can stay at home at that point in time if you could have you know spent
less on gas it's actually like a really big deal when you're when you're making the a huge amount of income is you're like how much money after your EXP expenses you have and when you're making a very low amount of money the amount of money after expenses is really small so if you can reduce those expenses like maintenance on car gas stuff like that it's actually super beneficial so L net profit versus gross profit tips yeah it's like it's a big deal yeah 100% honestly not quite this job like I I I
don't really have any particular love for Ikea I don't mean neither yeah I don't think there's like a like an Ikea passion that could be awakened me deal with like small children scream about their digital meatballs not being good enough doesn't sound exactly entertaining or you know whatever like I don't even know exactly what this is what the job is yeah I don't know but with that said you know what job I would have applied for if it existed yeah if NC whose forums I would hang out on dude
for hours a day yeah if they had like even if it even if it didn't have an hourly raid if they just had like a commission based you probably would have kill you probably would have preferred that over hourly rate I probably would have crushed it yeah if I could just hang out in the NC virtual store and people could just ask me for help configuring their computer or whatever and you know all they gave me all ncx would have had to give me is like a you know like a you know little name tag or whatever like
special recognition that my character you know kind of worked at the store maybe your the name above your head is like a slightly different color or whatever it is and honestly they could have just cuz they they kind of had s systems for the Forum already anyway they were mostly just based on like post count in those days unfortunately always a great indicator not always the best but they did also have like a system for experts I think the line lines of code version of for
contribution yeah yeah but man I I would have I would have loved that I would have gotten home from school and like put on my my virtual you know tie and buttonup shirt and I would have gone and sold computers man I would been so I feel like that that might have almost been a a problem for you you spent like too much time doing it maybe but if I was making money like is that really that then I could buy more computers yeah win-win I feel like that is what the lus of that time would
have done oh 100% yeah 100% And I could be like only like half tuned into that at the time right I could be like half tuned into that and then I could be like half tuned into you know my other forums like my red FL deals for him whe and de if only you know monitors didn't weigh 50 pounds back then then I could have just had like I could have got some online poker going on up here get some like uh like day trading you know Forex right here and like yeah man I'm I'm failing to see is this a full-time
position or not I I think this feels intentionally vague and nebulous to me yeah it feels like they just want people like us to talk about it to be honest it's only 10 positions if they were doing like actual real work I suspect the amount of people especially the beginning that flood this game if you just call the metaverse not actual real work I wish I had my swear button I wish I had my bleep button so I could tell you what a what a guy what a guy you're being yeah yeah what a number two you're
behaving like okay that is real work they're doing real work just because they're sitting with their Cheetos and their Mountain Dew in their digital  meatballs man my digital meatballs are cooking right now yeah I got a computer and a pillow on my lap and we are in Taiwan heat because we liked the vibe of this little outdoor meeting area we could have been inside where the air conditioning is but we love you guys so much we wanted you to we wanted you to share in the outdoors of Taiwan with
uh what do you want to talk about next uh okay let's see Intel wants to fight arm let's do it at computex Intel gave a deeper look into its upcoming lunar Lake architecture the company is claiming Improvement across the board though with heavy emphasis on efficiency and battery life a 38% to 68% increase in instructions per clock for eor compared to a 14% increase for peor Intel is also claiming a 50% performance gain for its integrated Graphics which will be using low a low powered variant of Intel's xe2
battle major yeah battle M battle mage just kind of snuck up on me here I don't know why but I was kind of expecting it to come as a discret GPU first and then here it is Boom onboard Graphics battle mage is here let's go um I heard some folks got Hands-On with it at some point maybe somewhere and uh running pretty good because this is pretty abnormal usually you'd have the discret GPU launch first I wonder if this will help drivers though I hope so help drivers for the discreet GPU people yeah no no I see
what you mean where like if in because because Intel is shipping apparently a negligible number of discret Arc gpus according to the the latest market share Trends which have Invidia almost 90% now wild hey but uh Intel is apparently negligible um and so when you're shipping a negligible number of boards I imagine that the the the incentive to prioritize development of it even though to Intel's credit they have really chipped away at ARC Alchemist and tried to make it as as working as as it could
be um but when you're shipping not that many compared to when all of a sudden this product that is like a Do or Die product for you lunar lake is going up against not just AMD but now Qualcomm Snapdragon X um full disclosure by the way guys not that it actually matters for Wow we'll be saying whatever we damn well please uh but Qualcomm did sponsor a video um on Snapdragon X while we were here which is part of why we were able to poke and prod at it a lot um we got cool yeah man I love it it's very
interesting I love it when we get a sponsorship that comes with like extra access to the product anyways and almost no strings attached yeah when we went through the script uh they were like can we change that word and I changed it I did my trick I changed it to something worse like oh never mind and they were like never mind um they they changed like one word and then like Andy we shot we shot like a pick up yeah we shot a pickup because we actually made too strong of a
statement about the competition oh and they were like they wanted it to be pulled back they wanted it to be dialed back interesting um so just yeah so just is this out already no it's not it's not out yet um but anyway Intel this is a Do or Die product for Intel right where they are going to be they're going to be going up not just against AMD who has been kicking their butt a little right because I mean AMD had like man their first generation that was super competitive that would have
been mobile 3000 4 I I I forget I can't keep track now that the Zen generation doesn't line up with the product generation and the mobile and the desktop generation line it's verying but the point is they had one that was really competive and it was in like a handful ofices that functionally weren't "even really available is that 5,000" doesn't matter the point is they weren't they they were competitive on paper but they didn't exist right and then over the last couple of generations they
exist and they're in some really good designs now like I'm I'm holding an AMD laptop that I freaking love this is framework disclosure I guess this is the flow x13 from isus I flipping love this thing it's got an eight core ryzen 7000 series processor it's got an RTX 470 in it albeit a lower TDP one obviously it's real thin real small yeah I mean it gets hot enough to uh yeah she's she's cooking right because we're uh we're using RTX broadcast for for noise cancellation and um it's not like the
ambient is low here and I think oh yeah no I also have my capture card running so I've got I've got video capture running through it um absolutely freaking love this machine but AMD doesn't have the kind of like Fab capacity to ship enough laptop chips that Intel has to really worry about you know just outright losing wcom on the other hand on the other hand wcom on the other hando Fab capabilities dude I can't believe how many design WIS these chips are in like when you compare this to amd's first
generation of competitive CPUs where it was like you could tell from the designs that like the vendors didn't want to make Intel to met you know not because there's a back room deal necessarily not because Intel is you know back to their tricks of you know paying people to not use AMD necessarily I mean who knows something could emerge you know 5 years from now or whatever I I don't I don't know either way but what I'm saying is that's not the vibe I got the vibe that I got was yeah the AMD chip is in the
slightly more worser one because realistically they know they can't get enough allocation to switch over a significant volume to this thing so they're just kind of putting it in some Niche devices knowing that that's all they can ship anyway and the bulk of this generation's going to be in like  right it ain't happening oh boy dude these Qualcomm designs are sick and I don't mean that Qualcomm designed them sorry I mean like like the Dell XPS with bcom Snapdragon in it like the laptop itself sick yeah
it's sick the surface the new Surface you think this is a decent am pressure from Microsoft CA dude the camera in the surface it's sick honestly in our video I don't think we have the most favorable demo of how much better the camera quality can be it's like a little better are you on the floor or something yeah but we're in like we're in like a demo room and the lighting really really sucks to the point where kind of anything looks bad but under slightly better lighting
conditions when we were in the meeting  before that's that's interesting because laptop webcams are kind of notoriously terrible yeah so we go through this in the video because uh very few people are talking about the the camera image quality benefit of Snapdragon a Windows on Snapdragon um everyone's talking about you know qualcomm's talking points right which is performance Ai and battery life so this this like computer enhanced video well no what it is is that almost all laptop webcams have the
ISP on the webcam but on Snap SN Dragon the ISP is on die and it's linked using um shoot what's I I forget what the I forget what the link is but instead of using USB it uses the same interface as your smartphone oh man so they have plug andplay compatibility for the same camera modules wild from the smartphone industry and they have all those years of experience building ISP so much more work goes into that like for smartphones disgustingly more work dude dude the new surfaces webcam you
can just throw away your add-on webcam just Huck it because yeah because it's built in because it's pretty annoying using that very cool like dude I'm I'm I'm I'm pretty stoked I I've heard rumor genuine rumor I don't know if there's articles about this whatever this is Word of Mouth rumor that a decent amount of this pressure to make the laptops really sick for for this generation laptops is from Microsoft really oh that that makes sense I think that they've been it's funny because
again total rumor I don't know I was looking at the market share that Apple has gained since the launch of Apple silicon and it's not as much at least according to the source that I was looking at it's quite possible that a company like Microsoft I've heard the same thing who's going to be paying a lot of money per year you know for for market research or whatever it's possible they have numbers that I don't but I from what I can tell it hasn't really made a meaningful difference and
that actually kind of jives with Apple's Behavior where it's like yeah I don't know we'll like we'll do a we'll do an update to this one I guess uh M4 I don't know yeah we'll put it in a Macbook at some point iPad right like like it kind of drives with Apple's Behavior whereas like man when M1 came out M2 refresh we're like we're on a Cadence like we're going we're going here come all the models we got the studio we got the we got the big one we got but they're not converting more users yeah but if
they're not converting more users it's like apple just goes through this cycle where they're like oh yeah yeah we're gonna do Mac again we're gonna like kill it we're not we're focused on Mac again yeah sorry we forgot never mind right like they did it with the trash can they did it with the first generation cheese grader or the new generation cheese grader on Intel uh they did it with the St like Max studio is that is that still M2 yeah oh probably yeah Max studio is  family that's Apple stuff man I I was
I've been trying to figure this out I suspect it's because of um whatever it's called replay oh yeah yeah yeah co-pilot plus PCS thing I think that's why they're pushing I mean yeah maybe it's less to do with Apple's threat and it's more to do with just good Lord give people a reason to upgrade their damn computers yeah I could see that um anyway coming back to the fight that Intel's in with lunar Lake um they cannot afford for these battle mage drivers to suck and that gives me a lot of Hope actually for
the for the for the battle mage discreet cards now I'm not expecting them to be competing with a 5090 or whatever I don't think that's realistic but what I amange cards what I am hoping to expect is a real competitor for the 5060 100% because I am I am just sick of Nvidia being like yeah I don't know we'll just have the most basest thing that would have been a 50 class card a generation or two ago we're going to call it a 60 class card it's going to be up to you know what is the 4060 max out at for the
ti like $500 or $600 or something like that what's a 4060 TI worth I think the price is actually come down a little bit uh oh my God how why is it so hard to just find a thing it's 400 bucks for an8 Gig 8 gig 4060 TI like come on yeah that's lame so if I can get something Arc battle mage with a decent frame buffer with good drivers I'm excited for that oh yeah me too um I don't know I don't know if I'm 100% confident it's GNA be battle mage or if it might be the one after Celestial yeah
but I hope it's b anyway moving on uh Intel lunar lake so the this is this is crazy too so we talked a little bit about how much performance gain they're expecting both on CPU and GPU to try and take the fight to both AMD and especially gual on this gen um and you got to kind of wonder how much of that is because this is the first generation because because the first generation of these lunar Lake chips are are going to be primarily manufactured by tsmc Intel says they made this decision
because tsmc's fabrication processes were simply more advanced at the time they were designing the chip what a slice of Humble Pie that's pretty wild the fact that it's not something Intel would normally say no true or not like I I've said this before Intel's Intel stock has gone down quite a lot since I said that if I was buying I would be buying long Intel yeah this actually doesn't change what I said because that kind of attit investment advice not investment advice and I
haven't bought any because I I don't allow myself to to just like trade tech stocks like that uh I do I do own some stake in framework laptops as you guys know from the series of videos that we've done on it and I do have a small investment in a in a it's hard to even call them a startup they're very small uh in a startup that is trying to work on a Nas operating system that makes things simpler um but that's that's it I don't let myself just kind of play the market um but I like this humility yeah
I like this willingness to make the best product even if it's like even if it's not all real men have Fabs you know like like Jerry Sanders that that's a that's a quote okay that's that's a that's like a toxic masculine Jerry Sanders who I believe was amd's found uh second or third Jerry Sanders yeah yeah he's he's the third Jerry Sanders there you go I really hope he's related  somehow thanks for that stranger things have happened good contribution um anyway they went with
the Rival Foundry rather than compromis on the design of the chip uh but next year Panther Lake will be largely fabricated by Intel's own Foundry they've been trying to kind of say okay forget it let's just instead of going incrementally we're going to try to Leap Frog and on stage they did show off their 1.8a process they showed off I think it was a it was either a wafer or a die I can't remember but they were showing something on stage saying they have power on on it so uh who knows maybe
Panther Lake's going to be good things are starting to move fast meanwhile at AMD they have confirmed their stupid AI 300 series naming scheme for the new mobile chips which are Zen 5 which is not stupid uh the fact that we're getting Zen 5 like right away here on both mobile and desktop means that AMD is also probably getting a lot more a lot more Fab capacity right now uh because yeah they also announced Zen 5 epic chips so they must have they must have booked some Wafers uh they are
claiming a 30% performance advantage over Intel's current gen Flagship chip though they did not include frame rates or percentile Frame data unlike Intel AMD will be retaining uh smt or um their version of hyperthreading and seem to be aiming for Pure Performance rather than efficiency now that's something I've seen a lot like I've seen people talk about that a lot but I guess my counter to that is um AMD already had the efficiency pretty good compared to Intel so if I was them talking about my next
Generation chips maybe less of my messaging would be about efficiency but that doesn't necessarily mean that I'm expecting ryzen AI 300 series not to be inefficient I mean I think anything's going to look kind of bad compared to Snapdragon x uh okay so in the video spoiler Alex holds up two HP laptops his um HP Elite dragonfly or whatever ever it's called his his dragonfly daily driver that he chose because of its outstanding battery light like it's one of the best Windows laptops for battery
life and hp's Snapdragon X design according to hp's own ratings which Alex has found to be pretty honest in the past it was something like a 10hour difference it was like 8 to 10 hours difference this is another reason why I feel like Microsoft might be pushing no no no no I'm not done yet okay and the um and the the Snapdragon one had I think a 15% smaller physical battery oh oh yeah wow yeah like it's like this this is this has been the Fairly notorious thing that gets thrown
at Windows laptops is that their battery life is atrocious compared to Mac yep so if like this is another one of the solutions to those things like yeah there isn't a huge amount of market share for Microsoft to claim back from Apple but might be tired of being like the butt of jokes when it comes to laptops like Windows laptops are are are just considered basically inferior they should fix Windows modern standby then that'd be nice just an idea Microsoft while you're while you're at this push
which I totally support I'm super down to have better battery life right like I wonder if it'll be better on different ships it could be I don't know I mean I hope so because realistically I'm not going to be switching to a Mac anytime soon so I am I am fully in support of Windows laptops getting better now I want to make this really clear guys the the performance embargo for independent testing is not lifted yeah so these battery life claims I mean they could be nonsense I think
that I doubt it you know like the do is saying that the claims that they make are are decently consistently Accura is yep that that's on the HP side right you've got all these partners that are staking their reput on similar claims on similar claims you've got and and what I'll say is that  Qualcomm there's very confident that that's that's an interesting it's always kind of a tell you mentioned that they sponsored Y and that they were very not controlling of the messaging that
combination is almost always like oh this is good yeah cuz when they sponsor and they're like we need to control everything you say and then we don't work with that partner because that doesn't work but when that situation happens it's almost always because they like don't have anything yeah whereas when they're like yeah we just want everybody to know say whatever you want just literally their their their their points they gave me were such it's such a power move can you talk about
performance can you talk about the npu so like the on chip AI co-pilot obviously and uh battery life and I'm like like yeah I mean how could I possibly those are the things that we would talk about how could I possibly talk about this product without talking about those things anyway and dude the demo room was crazy because they have like Da Vinci resolve running in there no but like they've got balers Gate 3 running in there oh damn they've got like they had um uh what's uh that used
to be owned by Sony it's now own by someone else it's decently common that these demos will will softball the applications that are running which is why he's pointing me so well and that and because it's not x86 yeah like this is this is Windows on arm things that were not made for this yeah I I don't think laran like made a a version of the game for Snapdragon chips not that I'm aware yeah yeah so so dude oh also they were absolute characters I have no screen share right now so you guys are
going to have to wait to experience this but I did a bit where um I where I I walk into the meeting um and here I'll I'll try I'll try I'll try and kind of narrate along um when I walked into my briefing on Snapdragon processor with Qualcomm I did what I always do and plugged in my laptop and then we have them like that's actually pretty funny mock me for plugging in my laptop and then they like they coax me back into the meeting room with a Snapdragon laptop and a sponsorship uh that's pretty good so
they were they were absolute like total totally fun uh yeah had a lot of fun working with them we've actually I think attempted to work with paulc once oh sorry someone just pointed out pa Gate 3 is already available on Mac OS so it's arm oh okay that's good to know but I do believe there's like compatibility layers for tons of different games and stuff yes not not everything but a lot of things um and and they they had uh what What's it called Sony Sony used to own it that uh
that video editing Suite thank you imperi Vegas Vegas Vegas they had Vegas running um man they they had they had so much stuff running Premier doesn't work is that correct uh I would be very surprised if Premier Premiere barely works on Windows x86 no seriously you know that you know that our away teams bring Max they don't bring Windows laptops anymore because Premiere is so much more stable on mag which I don't think is anything to do with arm um I think it's just to do
with just Windows versus Mac OS that's wild  sorry uh an interesting thing too you you had a narrative here of people trying to push for more Fab capacity yeah um obviously this is somewhat always of a thing but it's been more of a convers lately a huge amount of conversation both on the floor for the limited time that I was there and off the floor with a variety of people at the show has been data centers building new data centers uh increasing how much you're harnessing current data centers
data centers trying to get out low-level clients because there's high level clients offering three times the rate on things like do you remember do you remember that data center zone property that I showed you like 5 years ago oh dude and I was like LOL you should like do float plane data center you would  balling well oh well and it was really small like the overhead of running a tiny data center I think would be super weird because like as far as my understanding goes scale is
pretty helpful yeah because you're going to have to have the security anyway you're GNA have to have the administrative staff anyway you can't just have like a you know few thousand square foot data center um but yeah yeah no dice no dice um oh yeah and back then like when when even when even was that that was during the like 2017 crypto boom yeah 100% uh someone's like it would have been crypto don't lie no 100% the tenants would have been mining 100% but I was also when I was
talking to Luke about it I mean we had already been kicking around um uh lmg VPN oh yeah yeah we already had float plane going so it was one of those things where like kind of like we do we'd be spinning up a thing to be our own biggest customer um and I don't know might have worked out but realistically I don't think I don't think that cash would have been that well invested there compared to some of the other things we did just like throwing lmg and all of that stuff A lot of people are posting a lot of
things about the data center stuff someone someone mentioned data centers use a lot of power yeah yeah that's going to be a huge problem if you paid attention to some of the announcements that happened at this show uh wattage per like device in a data center is erupting dude the new Blackwell GPU yeah okay so I'm just talking the one GPU which is two uh b00 dies okay so a b200 GPU is two B100 dies and uh oh God I think it is it is it 12 hbm Stacks or 8 hbm Stacks I forget two B100 dies and
some hbm Stacks Nvidia is calling that one GPU so they are they're doing they're doing multi multi- diey GPU kind of like we saw on Apple's Ultra SKS I hope that it works a little better than it does on apples Ultra skes I don't know if you if you remember this but we did a video on um Apple's tools to help developers Port b games over to Mac OS and performance sucked and a lot of the Apple Community was extremely angry at us for testing on on on Ultra because it has problems and I'm
like okay well I didn't I didn't know that yeah I I thought I was I thought I was putting Apple in the best position possible and also if you're mad about this be mad at Apple not at me I didn't I didn't make their interconnects between their between their two like core designs their their two Maxes I didn't make that I I didn't make it not work properly anyway hopefully nvidia's interconnect Works a little better than Apple's but this this b200 should present as a single GPU but I'm not done yet a
b200 is a thousand Watts one b200 but I'm not done yet okay because a b200 is part of a Grace Blackwell super chip that operates as a single like like chip or whatever where you've got two b200 gpus and then a Grace CPU on it okay and that like some some amount of resentment in the like whatever and that is 2700 Watts oh yeah because we got two Blackwells and a Grace okay but I'm not done yet because because each compute node contains two Super Chips in a one you I think Jake was
saying something about how some of the partner designs are going to be an ever so slightly thicker one you in order to get all the cooling in there like they're water cooled but like I think they're creating like a one U Plus or something don't quote me on that but Jake was talking to me about it he's usually yeah he's usually pretty credible about that sort of thing but yeah but essentially a oneu what does that work out to math honestly so I  Watts wattage density and data centers
is is going to explode a apparently it's an issue where like some you know fairly established companies that run Big Data are basically tapped for how much power they can get into their data centers so that's another thing with the whole data center game right now is like new data centers are coming up in places where they can harness just absurd amounts of power yeah Microsoft's going to end up way ahead of the game with their like underwater data centers yeah we're just
going to have like a title data center okay title powered like no but the whole thing so like the whole data center is under the water for cooling yeah and then like basically the tide comes in and then like the wall of the data center comes up and it's like a temporary Dam and then it just runs the seawat back through the thing for cooling and power and then rinse and repeat yeah we got this yeah they're going to take up like the entire post of freaking like Alaska with data centers
or something like for real though like no but also they're gon to have to do something it's it's going to be crazy yeah so here someone did the math in "float plane chat this is crazy uh 6,000" watts in a u of Rackspace would be over a quarter of a million watts per rack that I mean it would it would melt we starting to talk numbers that are just like absolutely stupid numbers yeah um like multiply that by a data center dude my dude my my tiny data center in uh in White Rock or whatever it could have had
one rack of Grace Blackwells in it in an empty room yeah like yeah I don't even think we could have gotten that much power in there oh yeah I doubt it like here I doubt it how much okay how much do you know how much power we have locations right now as far as my understanding are being chosen by the proximity to nuclear power plants specifically nuclear power plants that is hilarious uh and there's conversations going on about like um being concerned that some Nations aren't going to be
building additional nuclear power plants fast enough to power all the data centers that are going to be dring out that's an actual conversation our power "to the lab which is a 20,000 foot" industrial building that was formerly used by um steel fabrication or yeah some kind of uh some kind of steel fabricator yeah um has about "200,000 Watts coming into it and that"  lot that's industrial you know yeah so I could power not even an entire rack of Grace Blackwells so it would just be an
entirely empty shell imagine the lab with one super dystopian is just like in the middle of the whole thing one cabinet all these cables running sitting in the middle of  hilarious just like venting all the heat out the roof or something like that like you could sit over it and like cook cook your food it's crazy dude it's freaking crazy yeah data centers and power are going to be a huge thing and if you are someone who is sag about the general power usage that we have going on right now
um it's definitely not getting better with that said uh AJ just said that the Badminton Center has more power than the lab I didn't know that that actually makes a lot of sense um the Badminton "Center is 40,000 square feet right okay" "it's it's two 20,000 foot units so it" probably has cons considerably more power than the lab are you thinking what I'm thinking yeah binton data center here we go that we use not for logical things but for but for analyzing gameplay dude I saw some demos at Nvidia
that probably skewed the entire attitude of my coverage toward them this year oh okay because like I know a lot of gam I know a lot of gamers are super mad at Nvidia right now and like rightly so because nvidia's apathy towards Gamers has been apparent for quite some time care at all they didn't mention the keynote at all they I don't know yeah I didn't watch it but dude um they had uh they had one of their uh Jetson like like Edge Computing devices um it's like a a new generation Jetson thing and uh
they had it running this like stereo uh camera capture magig and on this data set that was trained on Blackwell or whatever and basically the demo was realtime wireframing so like stuff that we want to do exactly what I want to do at the Badminton Center for like it's pretty useful stroke and movement analysis and stuff like to so one of the dreams that I have is every Court having basically that except trained on a data set of badminton play so that you could like gamify your your game your your your
game play so it could tell you like oh against this opponent you hit a lot of smashes but their smash defense was actually really good and you scored most of your winners with your drop shot um you you did a drop shot 15% of the time maybe try doing it slightly more often like oh that's dude oh so cool and okay they had some really cool gaming demos running too and so like nothing I said was not true but when I walked in the door little hyped up and I saw I was just I was a little excited I was a
little excited okay yeah yeah I I I even think things like uh this might not be as interesting to you but I think would' be pretty cool is like um endurance evaluation like having it noticed like okay once you're like 15 minutes into a game your your form on like this movement starts to falter yeah like that's really dude you could use it for all kinds of stuff yeah yeah yeah so cool it's pretty sweet yeah yeah um obviously I'm going to need a small loan of a million dollars for you
know some Grace Blackwell yeah but that's that's like if you end up waiting you know a little longer and then it becomes the old Tech then it'll be a little bit more affordable yeah maybe and I might have put "uh I think about 10,000 watts of cooling" and power into the uh data room at the Badminton Center just in case we'll get her done just in case um and like realistically um realistically like you wouldn't you wouldn't have to do the training on site like you would probably lease time to do
that anyway like I don't think you would at the scale we'd be operating at I don't think we would be doing our own data set training anyhow so as long as we have enough Edge Computing should be fine yeah yeah we had conversations about like it might be wise to wait um to do that for for a variety of reasons but you know the tech not being 100% there was one of them um and I think this just very the Tech's getting pretty there yeah pretty fast but it also like oddly specifically validated that
thought it's like maybe you should wait for it then it's just like shown to you at a convention like I wouldn't have expected to see that at video Booth dude and like it was so good they had um they had some 3D models rigged and they were showing like just live movement to rigged 3D model like that's cool it's not perfect obviously but like it's a lot stuff there's a lot of stuff you're gonna have to deal with at something like a public Bonton Center like um dude what happens if like someone
else walks on the court like Weir weird weird things that you'd have to deal with for like actually running it in production but our privacy policy from day one is going to be we're filming the inside of this facility like it or lump it I'm sorry yeah yeah and you know what we're not going to we're we we take privacy extremely seriously we're not going to misuse that data we're not going to sell it um but we're we're absolutely going to use it for would you potentially sell it to users of the
facility sell it to the oh oh like the gameplay analysis yeah okay then CU like technically that's not selling the data that's selling what we d rived from it but we would be monetizing what what if you let people buy like I don't know replays of their games or something uh well that's that's not the data we're collecting but that would be like C yeah but then you're buying your own replay but other people could be in the video yes this is true even someone walking by the court so we'll just have
to make sure that our P privacy policy does account for that I I think there's got to be a way to make a distinction I don't know not I don't know legal stuff but I feel like there's got to be some way to make a distinction between like we will be you know potentially Distributing whether we're selling or not uh Clips to users of facility of their of their own gameplay and you might end up in it versus we're going to mass sell everything we have there's got to be a way to no I'm I'm sure we can
handle that um and realistically because of the way the facilities laid out uh each Court will have its own camera and yeah you'll like be able to see the other the one behind it but they'll be pretty far away oh oh I see what you mean yeah yeah because it'll be at kind of like a 45 angle is there a no but well you'll see the one    foris oh yeah Dan we have no idea what we're supposed to be doing so you feel fre where are the cards Dan there they got lost in transit do do 
all right let's see here Luke how is Final Fantasy 6 coming along yeah Luke man you suck my plan is to uh play it on the flight back sure I brought the controller sure I finally tried cuphead yeah it's all right yeah it's all right yeah yeah I play co though I played the first like third of it according to the percentage I think I'm good I think I get it that sounds about right to me to be honest I played probably somewhere the the the art style super cool yeah um I think it was worth it like it wasn't a
full price game yeah no yeah seemed I was I was happy with the purchase finally tried it um are you still are you still at like what what what no I'm a little bit past there where where are you in the game now uh you pass Zozo yeah okay so have you done the opera house yet I don't think so oh okay I think I like just got through zoza okay man you are uh you're slow I'm slow yeah like you're a slow boy I I intended to play I think I probably gain more than you know sad well I don't if youc
if you include Pokemon Go Walks probably not um no I don't think I do oh well that's not a real game you filthy casual that's fair no no I'm it's kind I I I am I'm being int strongly opinionated I'm being intentionally toxic I saw I saw a post on the Pokemon go subreddit where someone was asking like yeah should I buy this like apartment or something by this apartment and it showed the stops and gyms that were around the apartment and there was comments like if that gym
is in range of like the couch then like  not Pokemon go is a bad game I I think I can say that honestly like fairly objectively it's not it's not a good game it's great at making going out for a walk fun go outside please it's so I feel so separate from the Pokemon go Community because there's constantly stuff like that people are mad that they can't remote raid more which is like being able to raid from your couch instead of going out and doing it people are understand the
accessibility argument yes but a lot of those people that's not the argument for the vast majority of people if that is the argument for you heck yeah sorry you can only do it so many times a day but that's also like really expensive so I don't know oh boy um cool hit me Dan oh wait do we need to explain merch messages yeah right merch messages are the way to interact with the show they're going to be going to producer Dan who I don't have a button to show him but maybe he does wave to the people
Dan maybe I don't know can't monitor the stream stop it lonus yeah there you go stop it lonus okay I am stopped anyway merch messages are the way to interact with the show don't leave a super chat or a twitch bit or whatever uh leave a leave a merch message all you got to do is go to LT store.com and in the cart once you've added some items loaded up with some super awesome stuff from LTT store you will see a little box to leave a merch message uh that will go to Dan who will forward it to the
appropriate person pop it up along the bottom of the screen for everyone here to enjoy uh who might reply to it himself or he might curate it for me and to read um we've got some cool stuff over on the store hey look at that we are speaking of we were just talking about um hold on let me see if I can where do I even find this stuff hey there they are oh wait I can't screen share anyway um we're relaunching our keyboard pins so they are available in a variety of different colors 
oh we've got that one okay that our RGB color is sick uh We've also got rainbow and gold and purple yellow and white and pink blue and purple and blue pink and yellow and blue pink and white and purple gray and white all these cool color schemes and they are free in the bonus bin with your purchase in any color and representation you love like let's freaking go also uh if you missed out on the Scribe driver last week so that's our fail pen made out of uh failed screwdriver shafts we are working
on a restock so you can sign up for a notification on the site make sure you guys do that uh Dan if you want to show them where the notify button is um that's going to be a good way to ensure that you get one guys we don't mess around when we say hey something's selling really fast you should get it we're not doing like awful fomo sales tactics we're informing you that something is selling really fast and if you would like to get one then now is the time to get it yeah like I I have an unfortunate
situation where I actually wanted to I I can say this because he's he's not getting them um but I wanted to get the Scribe driver for like gifts for things like Father's Day yeah it's gone well you should have moved faster I should have I mean I did warn you you did personally in yeah live I really did warn you that they were running out and I was like oh by the way we missed a huge opportunity what I saw this on Reddit I think it was it should have been called the write off oh so many so many layers of
meaning wow yeah it sucks you made like a pencil version or something it's not as good yeah would need to be B because it because because it was the shafts yeah it was the right off oh man see see how well it works oh huge Miss yikes huge huge L it's it sucks when those things happen I know CU like the Scribe driver is a an interesting name yep it's fine it's fine but it isn't the right off um also in other store news we finally have the oh man uh oh are Cable Management products under other where are
they um gear this is a problem tools where is it I thought it was under tools are they not under Tools we have too many oh we have a whole top level category for cable management okay well there's the problem um okay anyway the cable tie holders are back in stock we must have air shipped in some cable tie holders so we finally have all of our uh magnetic Cable Management products in stock the reviews are in they're freaking awesome which we already knew but hey now you guys have it
independently verified they're all four and a half or pure five stars uh screw drive reviews are in now as well people in the comments are saying they got it flipping loving it the people who are calling it overpriced merch are getting obliterated get smashed obliterated I it's actually been very satisfying to see how destroyed they're getting it's like dude look I'm sorry that you buy all of your t-shirts and underwear at Walmart I'm sorry for that some times it can be nice to have one that's a little
nicer and I'm not going to apologize for our stuff being I will even say the big Crystal pens are super based but if you want like a nice pen $30 is a really good price yeah there's there's different like this isn't trying to compete with a big Crystal deal with it and that's okay deal with it yeah um like even like the $20 t-shirts $20 t-shirts are pretty cheap deal with it yeah actually there's pressure on me to increase the price of the t-shirts I'm not surprised yeah we
haven't touched them since I know I've mentioned this like a bunch of times because it seems crazy to me yeah our costs have definitely gone up Point yeah we absorbed it for a long time but at some point uh t-shirt prices are probably going to go up a little bit probably makes sense I don't I don't know of of any other creators that have  not not to throw too much shade but a lot of them are on bad yeah length we take a lot of flak for the pricing on our store that is just stupid honestly like we have it it
was Notorious for a long time I think it has gotten better with Creator merch in general I think Creator merch General is better now than it was like five years ago maybe there's some stuff that's still pretty garbage we secret shopped someone else's water bottle in the tech space a little while ago and it was terrible I'm not surprised like I couldn't believe how bad it was but it's it's pretty common to get the cheapest POS and like they're not necessarily doing this consciously they're working
through another uh place that is actually like manufacturing the shirts for them um and that company that they're working with is providing the cheapest possible blanks just like feel terrible the printing's really bad stuff like that um sometimes it's not even their fault yeah uh we ran into that a number of times where um our we would get good samp just bait and switchy with samples yeah 100% that was that was why we started to create a warehouse because we were so tired of that yeah we
couldn't control the quality of our own merch I think that other creator that we secret shopped is like an investor in that merch company I think that's probably the only reason they used them because trig in floatplane chat just said the scri driver pen is literally one of the lowest price highquality bolt action pens on the market yeah and it's not it's it's it is not competing and you know what some of our stuff is really expensive that's true but I talked about this I
talked about this in my video on the um on Playstation portal it's expensive for what it does and if that doesn't have a value to you that's totally okay don't get it you can just totally not buy it and that is totally an option but what it isn't is overpriced because like I broke it down and people were so mad about this which was bizarre to me like I broke down what the retail price for all of those components would be and I'm like yo Sony isn't taking any more profit on this
than they are already on their controller or then you know sellers on eBay are on batteries and and screens this size and resolution and and you can be mad that it's locked down you know that it's not hackable or you can be mad that it's an accessory for and that might make it a nogo for you yeah 100% yeah but what you can't say is that it is overpriced because because that's just what that costs it's like if you were to buy a it's like if you were to buy a gold iPhone case and it was
"$30,000 because it contains" "$25,000 worth of gold and like you know" 50 to 60 hours of of Craftsman time well that's not overpriced you just bought something a little crazy yeah it's expensive yeah it's not overpriced and that's a distinction that I would like to that I'd like to kind of drive through more in in in our future videos like I don't know I um some something that I'm a little sort of disconnected from I think the rest of the tech media on is the is the the state of the GPU
Market I'm I'm mad about it that they're really expensive but what people I think  fully um under understanding is the forces at play I mean there are egregious examples I talked earlier on this show about nvidia's 460 series there's not enough RAM on the 4060 at that price it should have more vram Nvidia is absolutely taking that margin on it yeah but with that said the days of $139.99 like gaming GPU are gone it costs so much to tape out at tsmc so if you want that $139 GPU literally your
better option is to buy a secondhand one from a generation or two ago when that price level might have been attainable um and no amount of no amount of complaining about it it's going to change that it's going to change the market forces that are at play here the fact that tsmc can sell that wafer for functionally unlimited monies yeah um did did you hear uh did you hear tsmc's uh chairman or CEO what whatever the the guy's title was um like was like publicly mulling increasing nvidia's
pricing it's just like yeah I don't know yeah we've been looking at how much money they're making and we think they could probably absorb a price increase and you know what I don't think that I don't think from tsmc's point of view who functionally has a monopoly on Cutting Edge node technology until gets their act together I don't think from tsmc's point of view they're going to be like oh but what about the poor Gamers no okay if you're making GeForce we'll give you a better deal that's not going
to happen why would they why would they it makes no economic sense to do so so it so it sucks it's not good it sucks a lot particularly very bad for us we've talked about this a bunch of times though I lament often about how when GPU crypto mining stopped being as much of a thing um I was really hoping for a bit of a market crash so they would feel it a little bit but then the AI rise just it happened right at the perfect possible time like the stars aligned and just allowed them to never feel that hit
they're either really smart or really lucky or both or both yeah realistically for Success you need a combination of the two yeah which I guess leads us perfectly into our next topic uh Nvidia is the number two most valuable company  3.12 trillion with a te um this makes Nvidia only the third company to cross the three trillion threshold so it's Microsoft Apple and Nvidia Nvidia stock appears particularly attractive to retail investors so these are everyday consumers rather than just um
professional portfolio holders and they are likely contributing significantly to nvidia's Upward momentum much of the success is due to their AI chip portfolio but Nvidia has also reached a new peak of 88% market share for discrete graphics holy crap that is the highest it's been since the company was founded which is kind of wild to me because amd's products right now are like pretty good I am I am still radon challenging are you and I'm fine nice well I committed publicly to skipping
the the 40 series yeah and like you know have any more driver issues or anything for the number of times I've been called a liar I'm a pretty damn honest person um I said I'd do it and I'm doing it like I do so so in in my in the land PCS in the basement yeah um you know last harra I picked up used EVGA 30 series so I it's not like I don't have any Nvidia in the entire house or whatever yeah but when the 40 series came out and and was so un your primary computer that you
distribute to multiple screens across the house and use very often 7900 XTX baby yeah yep and it's not a cop out that other computers in the house have other gpus he literally like when when when we went over to your place to play hockey tape to tape yeah it was your upstairs computer well okay actually no no I ended up using Bas I guess oh did you yeah because uh I was not at the land before oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that was my desktop yeah at the land it was this for a variety of
reasons but um before I wanted to be able to use my computer yeah if other people were in the theater yeah logic uh but yeah no I was I was using my upstairs computer because the computer's downstairs but the screen is up well one of the one that's why I kind of like hit like uh he like usually uses it upstairs but the computer itself is not there y uh and you know what it was I had some issues with it at first it's been Rock that's really good that's good to hear yeah it's been
rockold um at computex Nvidia outlined its road map for chip architectures with Blackwell Ultra in 2025 Reuben in 2026 and Reuben Ultra in 2027 they also showed off their upcoming RTX AI PCS with co-pilot plus features though they seemed reluctant to use Microsoft branding of co-pilot plus p or to acknowledge that these RTX PCS are  CPUs fascinating um discussion question we want the glory and all of the glory Nvidia is clearly killing it but does that really mean it's worth one and a half
Googles alphabets I feel like this is going to pop I just don't know when but not investment advice I don't know um it just seems like too much it feels like uh uh another version of Nortel yeah I I was looking at this popped up in my in my Twitter feed um a comparison of Cisco's like meteoric rise and then leveling off I mean what goes up exponentially must come down at some point but would I bet would I bet against it today dude if if you shorted it when that first Massa Spike happened
and then this event happened and it went up again you're hurting yeah like that would be a really quick way for me to go completely bankrupt in like days yeah so yeah I don't know I don't know man if you got the tea leaves on you I suspect there's some some big money to happen there but I don't know not me not me at all and like I uh who's number one uh number one is um Microsoft not by much yeah so let's see let's see who ends up with the higher valuation the shoveler or the shoveler was just gonna say the
shovel seller has not yet surpassed the shoveler yeah we'll see but I mean In fairness Microsoft has a lot lot of other stuff going on what I want to know is like what's next for NVIDIA because Nvidia is one of those companies that values Partnerships until they don't really feel like it anymore until they don't really feel like it anymore I I wouldn't say that they've necessarily sherlocked too many partners uh but they definitely squeeze they're definitely go aloners squeezers there's a reason
Nvidia and apple don't get along um too similar you could you could only fit so much ego at one negotiating table you know yeah um and so yeah I I want to I want to see what's next like like okay look at the way bitman behaves about their their mining Hardware right yeah or has where they'll like literally yeah yeah they'll they'll create a new generation thing and like at what at what point with their billions and billions and billions of dollars does Nvidia kind of just go why are we selling this
Hardware I mean it's not like the thought never occurred to them data centers I it what what about what about uh you know Nvidia Enterprise now instead offor now that's not even that's actually in my opinion that's stronger branding than GeForce now Enterprise now is actually Wicked brand holy crap it's not like they couldn't afford to build imagine you're a startup and you're just like that's the product I want I don't know the the naming of that for a startup company as a product for a startup
company is very strong and so I just like I'm just looking at it going why wouldn't they just take their first "100,000 Blackwell chips and" just gives give themselves even like a thre Monon lead yeah just just leas it I mean that's the same thing that arri does with their top level cameras you can't buy their top level camera they can't they can't bin enough perfect sensors at that size or whatever or whatever the the reasons for it are the cost would be so high that they just
like no you you rent this uh we we literally will not sell it to you so that way can ensure anything you know shot on Alexa whatever that hey hey Andy Andy what's the one you can only rent the r65 or something like that yeah you can't buy it oh are you checking Enterprise now on GoDaddy yeah it's already bought of course it is it's being camped by someone yeah yeah yeah yeah well Nvidia can afford it yeah dude I uh I'm kind of wondering if someone just sniped that like while we
were no no no no there's no way it would have been pretty fast two dictionary work like 12 characters yeah it's probably already taken um man I I I I don't know man does it mean it's worth one and a half alphabets SLG Googles like that's here's the thing though like AI is going to be this tool that underpins everything it's going to underpin alphabet and Google's efforts to better Target their advertising it's going to underpin Facebook's efforts to you know better understand everything
about you and your life and and Target to be fair a lot of it already does I think it's just like development in this space is accelerating extremely rapidly yeah Enterprise trust in proposals and willingness to accept proposals of work in this space are almost blank check right now yeah I mean look at Humane the fact that they raised that kind of money for what was just obviously a stupid product do you see there that's one of our other topics today you see they're trying to sell yeah uh they have
apparently been in talks with uh HP I love our headline here I'm GNA credit Jessica with this uh might have been Riley though they both worked on the do peek I think Humane and HP a match made in Hades uh Humane the company that made a reportedly bad AI pin is trying to sell its business to HP for one billion dollars or roughly what Humane was valued at before their product launched and subsequently bombed spectacularly according to an article from The New York Times the company has
"sold maybe 10,000 pins adding up to" around $7 million in Revenue several current and former employees told the times that Humane Founders essentially banned internal criticism disregarding warnings about product battery life and even dismissing a senior software engineer who raised concerns about the pin add that to the fact that Humane has warned its dozens of users to not use the charging case anymore because of a fire safety risk and I have no idea where they are getting this valuation from like
honestly I think I would buy I would try to buy icq before I would try to buy it Humane yeah I'm actually not sure if I'm unserious about that anymore I see just shut down like is it is it for sale like could I buy icq who owned it I don't know wait what's IQ new hold on a second IQ new oh oh hold on mail. group in 2010 oh I feel like the politics around buying it from a Russian entity right now it's VK dude wait VK you're not VK is like Russian Facebook oh yeah yeah okay you're not buying this
yep sorry happen I don't think they I don't think they'll sell it to you that's a bummer I don't know if you'd want to even if I even if they would um yeah I I I I don't think we need to give money to uh to the Russian government what what is uh IQ now though I'll tell you what Mr Putin pull out of Ukraine and I will consider buying your icq final offer  yeah yeah see chat likes the deal chat likes the deal Mr Putin it's it's a good deal your  deal um lus out here solving geopolitical problems yeah
100% uh all right what are we supposed to it sounds like VK has been using icq as like teams you can chat with friends in VK messenger and colleagues in VK workspace oh sorry no no no that's not branding that's them saying what they they might have just used icq Tech and then just like deployed it we any completely different product yeah like Skype or whatever yeah yeah  messages no that's right we got one more to do and then we're about 15 minutes to sponsors as well um let's see hey lonus can we get
some of the details of how the GPU factory tour video was made what was planning and communication like considering you only had 3 hours to work with keep up the great work uh it was a lot of fun very chaotic uh we had a we had a three-person team um oh shoot Andy do you remember the name of that power color rep that was super helpful and high energy and basically just like was a total Chad helping us get through there sh yeah great guy um he does PR there uh I he was very serious when he
said he was a great guy yeah I'm really bad with uh yeah I'm really bad with names but yeah he was awesome um apparently he started working there when he was like 18 he's just like I'm gonna work at Power color because I'm a GPU Enthusiast and he's just still there now which is cool so he was a big part of helping us get that tour arranged framework was a big part of helping us get that tour arranged because powercolor uh ended up being one of the um well let me put it this way at
Frameworks volumes and with how high touch they are right like you you you saw it in the factory tour they had to create a custom rig for testing Frameworks stupid Rando you know gpus with their interface they invented right like this is not and when I say stupid I don't mean stupid I mean inconvenient right you're setup for pcie thingies go into motherboard um weird pad interface with Pogo pins and needing a rig that can you know like walk onto it and stuff that that's like extra work and I'm
sorry how many of these are you making you know at the kinds of volumes that the semiconductor industry Works in uh someone like a framework is a very very very small fish they're doing great they're growing Rome wasn't built in a day but they're are very small fish and so um the fact that powercor was willing to take them on was was a big deal and was a big part of bringing the framework 16 in Market um so anyway framework has that relationship and they helped to to make that connection as well and then
once we got in there man it was like normally we would want to go around first make a bunch of notes frantically and then I would lock myself in a boardroom or something put my headphones in kind of rewalk for like a couple of hours and then I would like write everything and I would ask to have someone kind of nearby that I can sort of holler at and ask questions and then we would go back through and we would shoot like a scripted like like a roll read and then we would also capture all
the b roll this time basically I just got a verbal briefing on what we were about to see and then I got a like um like a more detailed like I kind of put in my had sort of how much time I wanted to spend on each one and then I got any little details that pertained to each thing as we went and then I I didn't have a script um so people people often ask like what which videos are scripted which ones are unscripted tell me does it matter could you tell that that video was
unscripted maybe I should maybe I should script less uh I should find one that was scripted okay could you tell the no to a boo was scripted yes could you tell that the factory tour was not scripted I didn't useless  um okay I'm I'm trying to I'm trying to hear from the other people uh from the people in the chat I don't know which one they're responding to they're just saying yes and no useless might as well talk to talk to Twitch chat at this point um anyway the point is that they would give me any
little details that I needed for that particular chunk and then I would do it and then um Andy would go and he would shoot like any b-roll bits that go along with it and then Alex was there to be a backup notetaker during the during the tour um or during the briefing and then he was a notetaker he was our only notetaker during the actual actual tour and then he was also noting down the clip numbers for for every section so some eagle-eyed people noticed that that video was actually uploaded within 24
hours of us completing the tour um it was kind of crazy to get it done because we wanted it to be part of our computex coverage this year um so it was a little crazy to get that done but Alex noting all the clip numbers was how Dennis who was like uh I have not edited an LTT video in about two years let's see how this goes that was how Dennis managed to turn around that edit in just a few hours that's Epic did a review we had to change some stuff I had to shoot a uh or
record a small audio pickup on my on my lab microphone he exported again and boom it was up I've got some comments uh one is a a challenge from Scrappy DP saying uh you scripted the walkthr in the beginning of the factory tour I scripted the walkthr he's this is a claim from Fling chat I scripted the walkthrough of the factory tour well when I say scripted I mean word for word scripted yeah not no yeah I can I can show Luke the notes that we had at the beginning of the tour
uh this is the notes that Alex gave me before we started these are the notes that I took hold on oh wait no Alex has added a bunch of stuff to this um none of this is a script anyways yeah so here's the smt line yeah I will read you word for word this is what the video would would have sounded like if I had read off a prompter uh this is for the smt line portion yes spray anti-static now that all the components are validated time to put them mounted to board anti-static shower Mount to boards
9994 each PCB gets pushed into the machine 9999 intake of pcbs soldering paste -003 scanning for paste inspection pick "and place 77,000 components per hour" Cutting Edge machine nearly double the speed of their older machines on a typical Line This investment was made because small pilot batches are often done here 15 minutes from their R&amp;D headquarters and speed and efficiency is a major factor in product development - 21 vrms GPU die placement -30 oven that bakes the solder to attach
everything inspection CT scanning -38 final of smt 44 0048 get some get stopped for inspection 10 to 15% get sent to x-ray manual component placement put on tray add capacitors fluck spray 0068 solder waterfall not quite a slide 0074 final inspection probably three4 of that was added by Alex while we were going through on the actual help so a fraction of that was uh was actually uh done before we started the oh Google doc and go back okay here's the version uh hold on here's the version before Alex added
notes uh I also want to say that you you did the reveal before you asked if people could tell um so there was there was a considerable amount of people saying that they could tell on both and I'm not saying that you're lying but I do think that in a lot of cases is so one might notice that something feels different but they don't necessarily notice why okay and then you're like oh this one wasn't scripted and they're like aha I knew that that was exactly what happened I'll tell you
what why don't we play the game with some more videos did you watch any of our other coverage no what ay I can just jump only what are the numbers me what do the numbers mean those are clip numbers that Alex was adding as we were shooting yeah so almost anything with a clip number was added we were going through so there was very very very little in the way of of of a script um okay here I'm just going to add a filter for let's say views more "than 500,000 I should filter at anything"
that's uh just like unlisted or whatever um okay guys Nvidia Nvidia tour scripted or not scripted go are we pulling them why don't we do our sponsor spots we wait for them to for them to think you want to PLL it Dan okay uh yeah or do sponsor do the poll before we start going okay give one second you can set up the poll and I'll do sponsor spots uh the show is brought to you today by ag1 when cooking up your morning breakfast chances are you're not including certain ingredients that

things is that a thing we can do yeah I can do web pages if you give me a minute or so yeah sure in that case why don't we do the why don't we do the poll results while while I wait for that I don't actually see the poll I can't do a poll and I'm read through some responses though Integrations at Elijah said this is why I said you need to give him time before we started doing this monster oh because he he has to live do the Clips oh well I don't know maybe he should grow a third arm yeah did he ever
think of that Dan do you ever think of that growing a third arm it's a it's a reasonable response you think you'd be willing to like help the company Dan all right I'm so sorry inject some of that uh I don't have enough enthus Evolution virus Dan's doing Dan's doing great let's be encouraging for Dan let's go Dan good job Dan um you want to do that topic while we wait for d uh sure yeah um co-pilot plus isn't for everyone yeah Source The Verge Source 2 Microsoft everyone yeah strangely Intel AMD and
Nvidia seem to be hinting that the much hyped laptops powered by their new Chips won't launch with co-pilot plus features enabled despite all meeting Microsoft's required specs seemingly Microsoft has likewise made statements seeming to indicate that Intel and AMD laptops will get access to co-pilot plus eventually some the verges Sean Hollister in particular have speculated that qualcom might have some kind of yet unknown timed exclusivity in other co-pilot news Microsoft appears to be
making its controversial recall feature opt in instead of opt out which is than good but I still don't like their attitude about it here the fact that they tried to make it opt out the fact that it was ever going to be opt out um did not indicate a good faith effort for Microsoft to maintain the privacy of its Windows customers look if Windows was free like formally free I might feel slightly differently about this I still wouldn't like it but I'd be like that makes sense Windows is not free Windows
costs a $100 I know because I just bought a copy of Windows seriously I I bought a copy of Windows this week for what for a cool video that we did here we went to the tech Mall oh yeah buddy I'm very excited about this we went to the tech Mall um and it was actually Jake's idea he was he was cruising in the tech mall and he found this shop little hole in thewall shop like I mean literally hole in the wall I could almost put my arms from one side to the next side that had this sick Hardline
water cooled system in the front of it with like this 3D printed League of Legends mask in it and it just like it looked flipping awesome and normally you walk up to those shops and you're like I'll take that one and they're like no man that's like for demo uh I can build you like a basic gaming computer yeah I was like I want one like that and for my budget I picked the starting price of a main gear uh what is it there whatever their Hardline was one is main gear uh hold on oh hold on yeah this is my auto
complete here yeah I got this hold on my internet's a little a little it's a rush a main gear a main gear Rush Apex Rush uh starting at "5119 so I gave them a budget of1 170,000" New Taiwan dollars and basically was like bro I'm trusting you I want it to look really cool like this one and I want to game at 4K I want to be able to play any game so I gave him functionally the same the same budget yeah and uh I just looked it up it's super similar I wanted to know what's what are you
better off with are you better off with an apex rush or are you better off with some hole in thewall shop in Taiwan and I guarantee you no matter what you thought the answer will surprise you really cool video really lots of fun yeah had an absolute blast and you know what I was having so much fun doing it I was like man I wish I could do this kind of stuff more often but I get recognized so much that I can't it's hard to secret shop at home yes over here there's a chance right because people might not go
to English media for their first choice for for Tech content right yeah but at home whether you love me or hate me if you're in the tech space you you've probably seen my my my sad Line Is MeMe face at some point you know MH like you probably seen the mug and so it's really hard to get away with just like secret shopping things having the customer experience some people pointed out that it's pretty funny that we have a scrapyard Wars planned and we didn't just do it here
when we were both here no that wouldn't be I don't think that would be the play because I think they want to see crazy rigs for the price and I wouldn't be as familiar with the tools here I think that at home we're going to have our best shot to put together amazing value um man the budget for the gimmick not cool oh I don't even know what it is yeah so I I can't even like comment the budget is not cool but we're still gonna we're still gonna like make some money but like yeah scrapyard Wars
is going to be very expensive this time around you're gonna have fun if you this is off topic if you sit up I can pull your you've been sliding the thing back have I now so you've been slowly falling backwards that makes sense uh if you don't mind actually that would be swell oh I've been moving the whole couch well they're all in sections yeah moving one section nice oh wow that moved a lot more than I realized oh did I move it again yeah cool well that's going to be
how it is then and I got a screenshot um but yeah I'm I'm excited about whatever it is because you keep talking about how cool it is which makes me oh yeah it gives me confidence be fun it's going to be really cool and I I believe you that not knowing isn't really going to impact anything it won't yeah I like I actually believe you I'm not yeah so oh yes I believe you yeah I'm excited um anyway coming back to what we were talking about Microsoft um I don't like that it
was opt out in the first place I I think that betrays an attitude that Microsoft has towards user privacy that is not okay for a paid product um but the fact that it is opt in now is better I'm gonna opt in honestly no you're not okay uh no you do work stuff on that computer don't you maybe nope well it sounds really useful for me you have Sentinel on that computer I  off you really want to play this game kinda because I can uninstall senel I can your St I can you can't I can kind of
SE probably not okay I'm disabling Sean's account right now and turning off the why I don't even think because Shawn would like listen to me over you or anything I think because Shawn would be like yeah I know that makes sense he shouldn't have that on I think he would agree with the idea more than he would like okay but every once in a while I read a really cool AR and I can't remember what where I saw it yeah so like that one that I've been trying to that I've been trying man I I keep
trying to find this article someone wrote a or don't do work stuff on that computer someone wrote a really good essay you're going to I'm changing the subject someone wrote a really good essay how the housing market is like completely doomed like completely doomed like even worse than it is now and they basically laid out the the value Prospect of a house to a person who lives in it and why housing pricing made sense for a long time and then how that value Prospect changed and that was why
we got this like hockey stick um where it was not based on the value to me living in it but it was based on the value to me renting it out and then how it hockey sticked again we're almost making our way to a horseshoe shape now but like but essentially inflection pointed again when short-term rentals took off and the amount of value you could extract out of them was much higher and how essentially we're heading towards or we're we're in the middle of another inflection point where it
basically goes up nearly infinitely as in institutional investors yes Buy and they can have this like much much longer Outlook than any individual could ever hope to have because it just becomes a total dollars in versus total dollars out game as opposed to needing any needing an immediate or or timely Roi on on a specific asset um just just because I don't think F chat's going to give it up uh Dan were you trying to tell him that he can't uninstall it uh I don't know I was just making sure
that we can actually communicate we had um some issues during the pre-show as well yes we can you're just you're just super quiet um so in case you didn't hear it uh I I pointed out that while that might be true he can he can uninstall you know Windows  way yeah sorry guys this uh this isn't it it was like it was an essay a couple of people tried to tried to send me something it was it was it was really good it was really good it didn't contain like the terms hockey stick or
anything like that it was basically just like a breakdown of why why it's basically going to go to the Moon um and fortunately things are softening up a little bit here there's both industrial and residential are finally not just just inexorable March um towards Infinity but I don't necessarily think that it is permanent um I don't think that it's a permanent change this is a aggressively off topic thing to discuss sure but I'm just GNA go for it anyways because you're talking about I'm
kind of done with the co-pilot plus anyway this isn't even sort of tech oh okay but I find it insane have you read this have you heard about this I saw a headline you don't have to talk about it yeah I saw a headline just read the headline the headline is Parks Canada says 84 deer were killed in an "$834,000 call using a sharpshooter in a" "helicopter did you say 84,000 I think" "you mean $834,000" "$134,000 c deer really I the headline" that I saw was like Hunters we would
have done this for you for free yes and have in the past this is an established thing look somebody wanted to go for a sniping helicopter right and they wanted the government to pay for it I promise you there's there's a bunch of other Pickers like it's it's you know it's a Canadian government paid thing but um it was an American company obviously that did the helicopter hunt so like it wasn't even they sell tickets it wasn't even government funds that went into canadi
Canadian company yeah like the the whole  Elijah bro I want to do this it lit you can do it with bors it's a thing oh really yeah that makes sense you don't even have to use a sharpshooter you can  minigun uh oh America America or sorry Texas or our Southern friends helicopter machine gun hel bacon is the company name wait so you never you telling me you've never shot a machine guns from a helicopter is their tagline on their website this is like absolutely a thing apparently there's like actually insane
boore like infestations in that part of the state so they like actually need to call them like it's a huge actual problem but then there's been more or less like tourism activity industry sprung up around it through these companies that uh will bring you along on tours to to get rid of the bores which is something that the state needs but I don't know what happens though like like what if what if your company and livelihood that you've invested helicopter dollars into yeah is
reliant on these bores existing are you taking half of your funds and putting out boar food yeah you know like I I don't know I'm not saying that's happening but like it's an interesting being in a field where you have commercialized stopping an INF station yeah that I mean that's just I mean isn't that just the pest control industry maybe I mean Al Alberta got rid of rats I guess it can technically happen have you seen the like the map of like where rats are in the world no it's 
Alberta we're we're on some weird topics right now where are rats in the world I just assumed they were everywhere yeah uh that is hilarious just a spot so I actually did not know about this like I it rings sort of a very very vague Bell but they they sorry what what did they do they like got rid of rats I don't I don't know what rats can't walk there now like really makes any sense into it um but yeah like apparently a natural thing huh okay ex solocity yeah if I ever find the
essay about housing prices I will let you know but I have I have I've tried digging through my history I've tried searching for the way that I usually find an article is I like remember a sentence in it and I just like Google that and it usually brings it up but I just couldn't I just couldn't extensive rat surveillance and extermination things in Alberta yeah they're like super hardcore about it yeah just use recall see that's what I was talking about that's why I would find recall useful
you can absolutely you can absolutely use read it on my phone any you would like if you would like on a why don't you look in your history on your phone uh Because by the time I remembered I it was had like faded out of it yeah bummer bummer yeah also I think stuff that you read in your Google feed didn't like used to show up in your history properly I don't think it's still does does it no it does now oh okay yeah but I it might have been at that time or something I I can't remember
um what are we supposed to be talking about Dan oh we got some more merch messages to do oh that's right we're supposed to be talking about Dan Dan week oh yeah Dan week is almost over and Dan was supposed to show you guys some some floatplane uh exclusives that have Dan in them yeah we got all of these exclusives there's more coming all the time okay so they're looking at it so we have a video on his cappuccino which is not a beverage it is in fact a car it is mhm barely larger than Dan himself uh we
have a video with your most asked Dan questions all of these are getting rave reviews by the way and a video about his new desk um I'm supposed to ask Dan how was uh the filming experience like for you these videos for you it was pretty good um Sammy had put together a long list of questions and basically had everything you know gotten ready to go and it was it was pretty good um I kind of got to pick a few topics that I thought would be easy to film and were were kind of off the cuff and fun and
yeah it went very smoothly cool uh Dan is apparently going to be signing some products one stubby one screwdriver one desk pad and one bread plushy live on stream it says not all the items few more I don't even know what that means like just one of each is what got it to enter for a chance to win these you've got until Sunday June the 9th at midnight to sign up for the giveaway items you can find the sign up link on on any of our Dan week videos on float plane uh okay for sweep Stakes
though we have to have a um an unpaid entry option so um Dan can you please find out the t's and C's of how people can enter without uh be without paying maybe we could provide the link in the chat here or something sure I'll have a look it should be probably allal sweep Stakes requirements okay we'll figure that out um and we're supposed to ask the audience what kind of future cont content weeks would you guys like to see more people weeks or themed weeks or yeah let let us know leave a tell you
what leave a comment on um where the heck can they do that the Forum I don't know I don't know yeah leave a comment oh add us on on Twitter the social team will see that yeah or you can make a thread on the Forum the social team the community team should see that as well yeah those will work uh thanks for supporting float plane you can also leave a comment on the VOD for this show if you're watching this um in the VOD we have some remaining charity stream items lmg Dogg charity leftovers
we've got a Corsair showcase Bild the short circuit hookie hoodie bundle we've actually yeah we've got just five items left so check them out and uh we're going to keep adjusting pricing until we sell these because we got to raise that money raise that cheddar all right uh Dan is it merch message time oh wait we were going to get that poll what happened to the poll I don't know there's been a lot to do right now cool why don't we do another topic and buy Dan some time topic for Dan time
Dan's gonna have some messages to do okay sure we're gonna have some merch messages forget Dan time okay got them I can ask the merch messages if you want to set up the poll yeah I mean I can oh yeah I don't have the dashboard up I can kind of do both at the same time I'm asking a question I'm doing it I'm doing the thing let's go Taiwan show what's the most pointless thing you saw at computex this year man I didn't see that much me neither I didn't I didn't really make it to the show yeah I got uh I'm
GNA I'm going to completely take over this because I didn't neither of us really saw too much of the show I got my first swag item I've gotten in probably like seven years oh yeah it felt like I just snorted meth and cocaine at the same time oh just the hit oh it was amazing the rush of free stuff just garbage too you know that you get so much free stuff from work oh no but not just just trash you know like it was a branded bag that's like this big like there's no chance I want that it's it's
like basically one use the little clasp on it is already Breaking Inside was some coconut flavored snacks that I I don't want and then there was a voucher and the voucher looks like a bill for 300 NT Taiwanese dollars and I was like that's weird that's not a denomination that I think exists here and then I realized that it's like oh if you spend "I think it's like $6,000 NT then you can" use this vouer for 300 at like taipe 101 or something I'm like well that's not happening so it's all just useless and I
was like yes we're back we're back at shows where they just give you things for no reason that no one wants it was amazing it it was actually like I don't think I can support any of this oh of course not okay cool yeah um Dan the the poll's wrong um also this is hilarious uh the poll is was the factory tour script which I already told you guys it wasn't scripted so the fact that uh so many of you are wrong either means that um you are they could have they could have tuned in later um but it was
supposed to be the Nvidia the Nvidia tour I actually I I actually love that he did the poll this way because that proves a really interesting point that people don't listen at all and that I I I think you know some of the people that said they like they definitely knew on both videos yeah maybe some after the fact it's float plane though so they're probably they're probably messing all Firefox users yes 100% of the time you know what though be careful in YouTube comments though because I have started Perma
Banning anyone that like asks a really stupid question that was answered in the video like if someone's like was this booth tour sponsored by noctua they're they're Perma ban yeah you're gone you're out yeah I'm I'm sorry I'm just I'm not gonna yeah I'm not gonna the quality of the comment section must go up have you there will be some losses along the way have you read comments on any of the compy text coverage skimmed a little bit seemed pretty strong I think what I'm doing is working yeah where it's
basically just like it's it's it's like a bad faith filter I think you have to in modern internet there's there's too many tools for people with bad faith to be super annoyed uh lunar Jimmy asks do you do permabanning on float plane the answer is yes yep we do um we are still very open to feedback and criticism and generally speaking I find the criticism on float plane quite constructive and it doesn't happen often generally the flo plane audience is but if we had say for example a lady on camera and you're
behaving in a way that is inappropriate and Unbecoming of a member of the float plane Community makes them uncomfortable with you will find yourself with a permaban like that quite quick so there's definitely things that that is that is probably the most common scenario is exactly what was just laid out you post some thirsty stuff about him or whatever though I don't give I don't care none of us care oh I don't my beat button but yeah I right I think I  point literally not a protected class in any way
yeah a bearded sis hetero white dude you you got blue eyes for crying out loud hey you're like literally forget it I also like genuinely just don't care yeah that that's that's a big part of it too is like but we shouldn't we we we're not just because I don't care yes doesn't mean it's okay for everybody I also don't care like whatever you know talk about how short I am we literally have sponsor partners that make fun of my height like I'm not if you're going to make an assumption about anyone else
though you should assume that it's not cool that it's not cool yeah uh okay was the Nvidia video scripted uh 62% say yes 38% say no uh I will bring up the script okay Invidia Blackwell rack here we go I'll be able to make a determination  okay okay so partial pretty scripted and then devolves into notes at least the beginning it it it's it felt like it was you know becoming slightly less over time and then there's a a fairly sudden jump to no so any of the Yik Yak I was doing with the demos and um anything
around uh G assist uh as well as the like the conversational demos I wanted to be able to have conversations and interact with the thing so it's a lot harder for me to read a prompter when I'm interacting with a computer so there's no real Point anyway so you guys are about right it was about 62% scripted and about 38% not scripted I enjoy that it was a bit of a trick question yeah yeah I like to we have fun here yeah you know we we have F we have fun with you guys it's nice doing curve balls like that yeah
exactly exactly all right what are we supposed to be talking about Dan were we supposed to be doing merch messages right now doing merch messages right right right right right okay good evening what's your assessment on the cost/benefit of expositions and conferences in the  age man it really depends doing right because if you're like if you're apple and your developers and you want to get everyone on the same page about all your tool you yeah you got to do WWDC like absolutely as for I think like fan Expos
and stuff like that I can tell you from personal experience the economics have gotten a lot more challenging if you're a big established Expo you can probably still make it work with big sponsors but like in the age of digital advertising I have questioned for a long time what the value exactly is of Booth presences at some of these Expos there are absolutely still Expos that are killing it I mean we're seeing we're seeing numbers of booths that aren't you know like half
a hall like sometimes at packs you get like the Microsoft Booth or the Sony booth that takes up like just an enormous amount of space so not boots that are that size smaller than that that cost "$600,000 just to show yeah but like but" that's not every it's tough apparently Pax West actually lowered prices this year because they finally didn't sell out oh remember two people's disposable income the middle class is dying oh yeah badly so like you you're kind of getting you're kind of getting eaten away at
both ends as an expo where sponsor dollars are getting more challenging because you can reach an audience so much more effectively just digitally and then people's disposable income for things like getting on a plane to go hang somewhere for a couple days that's tough I mean that's that's why we downscaled LTX to to just hopefully doing whale lands assuming we can get the city of Sur on board at some point by the way I'm burying this super deep in a Wan show because my my purpose is
not to you know raise a bunch of attention at City Hall right now but at some point in the future if there's any of you that are in the city of su we may we may ask we may create a template letter and we may ask you guys to kind of get involved in in this U not now especially don't do it now because I'm going to have a meeting with the mayor um probably in the next couple of months cool we want to we want to just like you know do without putting well no sending letters to right to City Hall WR word is
absolutely doing things right but it's an escalation that we are not ready to take yet um but we believe very strongly that if we're negotiating with the city in good faith that there is no briting it's it's nice to take proper more measured steps that there is no that there is no reason why we shouldn't be able to host a civil not like one of the concerns that was raised with us was noise huge get real yeah it it just shows a fundamental misunderstanding of what it is and and and non-elected
officials like the the bureaucratic employees of the city are far less incentivized to listen to anything they so if they don't know what a land party is they don't and and some of them are really great some of the ones we've dealt with are outstanding at the city of Siri some of them clearly don't care right and and so you know you're not you're far less motivated as a non-elected official to invest time in figuring this out it's a lot easier to just say well that's that's not on the
zoning ordinance orever it's not on the zoning bylaw so forget it right yeah um but we don't see any reason why as as as oneoff or or multi off but like you know small off few off events uh that we shouldn't be able to do this and and we've expressed willingness to work with round challenges so you say noise complaint we say okay we'll shut the door you say parking concern we say okay you know let's figure out messaging around uh you know ride share and public transit only or let's with some let's
figure out a nearby flat piece of land the owner of which we can negotiate parking in a small shuttle or something totally you know there are solutions to problems life should be improv rules you know and there's no such thing to me in business negotiations right there's no such thing as as as as no if there is a if there is a a benefit to both sides it should be uh yes but or yes and you know improv rules yes but these are my various problems yes give the other side the opportunity to make proposals to
handle the objection yeah exactly so so that's that's what we want to do we want to figure we want to figure it out uh people are asking uh you know the main thing is just showing showing them what's in it for them oh there's absolutely stuff that's in it for them they they want to be they want to be on the map for gaming and orts that's what's in it for them so if we do some tournaments and stuff and I'm absolutely willing to I'm willing to play ball little beauty pageant here or there yeah
I'm I'm Absolut willing to play ball but it we're not gonna we're not going to do it at a different venue yeah because that's not what we're set up for that's not what the economics can support we've made an investment into a building and and for us to build it out once put all the networking and Power in and then be able to reuse it over and over and over again that makes sense for us to go in somewhere else haul all of our stuff in haul it all out for the kinds of ticket
prices that the market will bear for these types of events it just doesn't make sense we can't tiet prices for lands make no sense yeah people run if if there's a land going on it's being ran out of passion it's not it's not a profit thing yeah all right uh what were we supposed to be talking about we're just on merch messages yeah I just forget what it was I forget what the merch message was no idea hey look a wild Dennis appears come  Dennis it's the big room hey yeah Dennis was up till how late
were you up editing that factory tour oh my God 3:30 3:30 nice nice nice up you say yeah I know because  after good stuff um okay what are we yeah what are we supposed to be doing oh yeah yeah yeah right hit me hi Dan and LL I came for the merch I came for the quality products have you seen anything on the current trip that you think is groundbreaking new tech or huge advancements in existing Tech I mean yeah it's got to be the Snapdragon mobile chips and again you know the only reason I'm mentioning it
is is because of the proximity quum did not sponsor anything about this video I can say whatever the hell I want um but they did sponsor a video here at the show that isn't out yet and I don't want you guys to be surprised by that but genuinely on this show not sponsored by pcam in any way damn yeah one thing I'm really unhappy about is the move towards soldered Ram yeah lunar Lake are they both lunar lake is soldered Snapdragon X is soldered and I think me saying both might be
confusing usually there's two sticks I think the new ryzen AI 300 series it's all soldered all soldered it's all moving to like either on package or near package soldered to the board memory just like we saw with apple silicon I get it but I don't like it yeah and like that new desktop form factor was very surprising um cam 2 I I'm actually pretty stoked on that because it I didn't see it coming on desktop like I saw cam happening on laptop because that was where I thought it was intended for
to avoid soldered memory but instead we're taking soldered memory which is going to be even slightly shorter traces than Cam and we're just doing it on laptops and then we're taking all those benefits of the development of Cam and putting it on the desktop so we might be able to see faster desktop memory thanks to this but yeah I was very surprised to see full size desktop motherboards with support for C memory there that that's one but I I'll I'll  advancement and last one before I let
you loose on a final topic um question for lonus I'm marrying my high school sweetheart starting dated when we were 17 but we're now with both 26 in two weeks do you have any advice on writing vows my fiance has asked me explicitly not to use chat yeah don't use chat um writing vows she has the correct opinion did what did you say she has the correct opin or they have the correct I thought you said she is the breath of me or something like that I was like wow I mean word Smith Loop here not writing it
for you yeah I'm not sure about that particular turn of phrase but um something I can say in regards to using chat uh would be that you can ask it what it feels about what you wrote or what it took from what you wrote but don't have it write it for you this is supposed to be yeah I would say the most important thing for me and this is going to be maybe out of left field I know but the most important thing is an anecdote oh tell a story yeah because everyone says how much they love them everyone
says or at least if you're writing halfway you know functional vows uh everyone says you know this is what I thought you were going to talk about some vows are just like stupid how much you love them how you're going to be with them forever I mean I think that's like implicit um and yeah not everyone makes it work so like you should definitely still say that that's the intention thumbs up you know um but I would say the best vows that I've heard are the ones that tell a really great
story that go so it's like why yeah that that the story of the relationship like you know the on the third date when you you like were eating spaghetti and you laughed so hard you snorted actual spaghetti like up your nose instead of a drink you know like and and and and and you asked for a napkin and she laughed and was like no it's funnier I need to take a picture first I'll give you one after you know and that was the moment we knew we were made for each other you know like tell me tell me why
you were made for each other you know that's that's what I want to know don't tell a long story tell a short story keep it short um and this is this is key make sure she cries if she doesn't cry you haven't you haven't done it good enough you want to like like like make hit her right in the fields so so make sure that the story is and and this is this is counterintuitive okay so the story should be super meaningful for her but it should actually be the one that's most meaningful for you it should be like
like why you can't live without her which will that's gonna that's going to hit way harder her care more yeah yeah yeah in the fields you guys yeah in the fields yeah make them cry no no it's okay good cry happy cry for crying out loud you guys you're killing me here crying out loud yeah yeah exactly lace your valves with onions oh boy make the paper out of out  onion what one thing that I would say which I stole from you I think um is a lot of the like worst ones that I've
witnessed is when they'll dwell on like you know it's been really hard sometimes I don't want to hear that it's not the time yeah not the time you guys can have those conversations yeah you should yeah talk talk things through that's super important not the time but like you know like up there in front of everybody and they're up there in front of everybody and you're talking to them and you're like you know you kind of sucked a lot yeah like what are you talking about and like there's a you can
do that at the wedding like absolutely when you give your like speech at the at the reception oh yeah by all means tell a funny story about like you know Finding you know x-rated materials on their computer and it being like something you wouldn't have thought they were into you know or whatever you can do funny jokes at that time yeah like that that's a pretty particular moment you don't need to dig in that moment yeah not in that moment that moment is for like the moment you knew you know yeah yeah
next up yeah talk about the tense prenup negotiations yeah yeah that's not in the vows okay that's not in the vows oh goodness sheesh I'm got to get you guys out of here in about 45 minutes so why don't you do another topic and then we'll move into after dark okay topic time Google leaks leak an internal Google database of thousands of security incidents flagged by Google employees between 2013 and 2018 has given rare insight into how Google manages the issues the document acquired
by 404 media but confirmed to be authentic by Google includes reports of accidental recordings of children's voices a major leak of the itineraries and home addresses of Way's carpool users and an exclusion software failure for Google Maps resulting in The Accidental creation of a database of thousands of geolocated license plate numbers these incidents were typically reported investigated and resolved at the time that they happened but only a few were previously known to the public
there were also more long-term breaches such as is an incident following Google's acquisition of socratic.org where around a million user emails from the company were publicly exposed for over a year one relatively harmless incident involved the 2017 leak of the announcement of Nintendo's woolly World 2 a Google contractor downloaded the private announcement from Nintendo's YouTube channel using admin privileges and sent a photo of the video to a friend who then posted the screenshot to
Reddit not only did this friend admit to getting the photo from a friend who works at Google the URL in the image  youtube.com uh in other news replace your own job with AI in an interview with the Verge Zoom CEO Eric Yuan recently suggested that Zoom should eventually have a feature that allows you to instead of replace the background replace the foreground dedicating your meeting to an AI powered digital twin who could create a summary for you this AI double would likewise
respond to emails and answer calls this seems to be more than an anthropomorphized notetaker however as Yan seemed to suggest that these features would operate with minimal oversight and users would be delegating a significant amount of decision-making and responsibility to these digital avatars hilarious oh boy uh less hilarious Adobe this week or this Wednesday users of various Adobe apps received a popup notice that adobe's terms of service had Chang changed warning that adobe May access your
content through both manual and automatic methods yeah this is ridiculous this is pretty bad the specific updated section of the terms of service that lent into effect February of this year says content you store or process on their Ser servers may be analyzed using techniques such as machine learning in order to improve our services and software and the user experience two main concerns arose from users professional creatives who do work under NDA were concerned about Adobe
accessing confidential information and many users were concerned that their content their creative work would be used to train adobe's Firefly AI which it like absolutely will be Adobe has since issued a statement clarifying it does not use customer content to train Firefly and does not assume ownership of the customer's work yeah sure yeah yet they didn't say the yet I'm adding the yet it's a really easy goal post to move the company further states that the purpose of the updated terms was to
clarify the addition of more review to pre-existing moderation processes that scan for illegal content well we'll see how it goes yeah I don't like that at all the car thing we got to talk about that according to Tech YouTuber uh oh ano raker or Josh Hendrickson who did a deep dive into spotify's car thing device Spotify had already taken several steps to open source the car thing uh even before the current deactivation controversy the device runs on Linux and it's uboot source code and Linux kernel are
available on GitHub likewise its amlogic chip allows users to easily access boot raw mode run their own code and add custom software Hendrick theorizes that Spotify wasn't interested in making this easy open sourcing more widely known because the device is essentially a potato with a weak M logic processor four gigs of emmc storage and only 512 megabytes of ram its Hardware is too limited to do much above its Beyond uh much above its Uh current intended purpose I mean part that bothers me is
that it can't do much Beyond it it's that Spotify tried to Brick it people have already shown that they can do what they want with it do it yeah yeah so like the intended purpose was fine yeah doesn't really matter that it's a potato if all it needs to be is a potato potatoes are cool I like potatoes good Apple's holding WWDC next Monday and the reportedly plans to announce how it will integrate AI Apple intelligence into their upcoming products yes their AI system will be
called Apple intelligence that's cool because that won't be confusing at all I mean it's just as useful of a name as artificial intelligence right now okay that's true we've got a video coming on how AI is a lie yeah and like really is y um it's really cool what we're doing but it isn't there's a lot of cool happening um yeah was written by Emily so she basically like went through and was like here's what you think AI is and here's what it is and here's what it's really good at and here's what it's like
not good at and uh sounds like a good video I really liked the D googley your life video yeah seems like other people did too I'm excited for part two yeah I'm genuinely pretty stoked for part two um non AI announcements around half of the presentation will apparently include improved customizability for iPhone uh as well well as new software for the Vision Pro Apple watch and Apple TV and finally oh my goodness uh oh man we've got a few more things to get through pretty quick here uh Twitter
says okay to uh unclad chests the website formerly known as Twitter has added language to its rules that formally formally allows consensually created adult content on the platform so long as it is correctly and prominently labeled Twitter has typically Been Told an of sexual content though the site didn't officially condone it therefore to be clear that is true all the way back y therefore the primary change will be the creation of an official tagging system for graphic and explicit adult
content some critics have called the new policy a way for Twitter to reject responsibility for dealing with the sharp increase in pornographic spam that Twitter has seen during Elon musk's tenure CEO U but I actually have a I have an alternate take um what I'm hoping is that this just allows things to be tagged more easily yeah and so maybe I will actually see less of it yeah um blurred out or or uh hidden behind review reveal buttons our last topic is first move to Europe second
delete Facebook European users of Facebook and Instagram were recently notified by meta that the company will be using their data for AI training the policy is global uh it's just that only European users were informed and only European users had the ability to opt out of this use for their data due to EU legislation in another unpopular policy change Instagram is currently testing unskippable ads hey nice very good nice oh actually there is one more thing the hashtag fix TF2 movement um yep it's
pretty bad so it doesn't seem like they're going to do anything about it quarter million people have signed the petition and valve is going to do whatever they want to do whenever they want to do it because they're V and they print infinite money and we all love them for it all right time for when show after dark could you please ask Andy to give me roughly two stops of neutral density filter I could ask Andy for that but Andy is not here okay I'll get I guess oh wait no no no no hold on hold on  oh
uh you oh wait do we have an ND filter on there I don't see an ND filter should be digital I can do it it's fine is there a digital ND on that camera I don't think so yeah no this FX 30 D oh now it's dark no no it's w show after dark just he's gonna he I just made it dark he made it dark it's okay it's okay thanks Dennis oh yeah he could have just closed the aperture that would have been an option that's true all right what's up Mr Daniel besser who even are you looks like we got some merch messages my wife
loves your clothes so much it upsets her that it isn't readily available in places women frequently shop how do you fix this gap between product superiority and access to the target market that's a really great great question if you can answer it um I think I have a position for you at Creator Warehouse Inc oh I see where you go we're having we're having trouble with marketing we we kind of yeah I'm just gonna be honest we kind of suck at it um and I don't mean that as a knock against
the team it's not like I have some silver bullet and I'm some kind of genius and I know how to direct a consumer Market was running the marketing like perect yeah exactly like we're really good at being a marketing vehicle for our sponsors who and we're really good at making really good stuff yeah we're great at making content but we actually we don't know much about the the dark arts of of effectively using a you know Instagram advertising budget yeah um it's a whole other it's a whole
other field essentially genuinely yeah yeah so sorry I wish I had more for you hi dll given AMD and Intel's focus on delivering powerful and efficient mobile apus do you see discreet mobile gpus sticking around much longer I do um they're great but a discreet ship is still going to be the way for a long time I think that the split is going to continue to widen for for integrated in the in in low-end gaming like low-end gaming discrete gpus are already functionally not a thing
yeah but for people who want real performance on the go you're going to  time realistically does running your components hot home office gets hot during the summer for work hours 9 or 10 hours a day will harm them or what's the best solution for hot summer days in a  office being on at all harms your components they wear out over time we did a good video on techwiki on why do computers die um and and basically you know even though we think of them as having no moving Parts like electrons
are mov yeah they're moving yeah there's stuff moving like you know charges are are are being moved around and stuff like it's uh they so so so they wear out in time and the hotter they run the faster they wear just kills things yeah and so less is better and more is worse but I can't quantify that you because it varies wildly from component to component from generation to generation if I were to try to generalize and say oh well you know on Intel it's really bad or on AMD it should be fine no no you can't
generalize um you just have to kind of keep things as cool as you can and do your best with it yep Alex did a really cool video a while back where he ducted the exhaust heat from his computer out the window and uh vented intake a from a different part of the window away from the exhaust heat directly into the computer that could help yeah and last one I have for you today I'm at an edtech startup as AC CSM third anniversary this fall but no Ray since joining the excuse tends to be startup
volatile blah blah blah in your early days how did you retain  year sort of that's not true sort of sort of my don't make me go back and find the records Ivon is right there no that is that is functionally true but there was times where you asked if you could have the increase be less that's true and realistically I think most of if not all of us could have made more elsewhere like if you I think part of being a part of a startup is understanding that at the beginning you're not going to make
you still have to see a trajectory it does sort of depend at the same time like you saw a trajectory not only did I see a trajectory for one but for two a lot of startups aren't like what we were like so realistically talking about our experience is not we started in a garage luk they called it edte startup this is prob education te I know I know I know but using that terminology like they're probably American they're probably West Coast there's probably VC money involved um this is different than the
scenario we had you know I mean sure but I think it depends on where this person started if that's the case right like basically if you're valuable to them there's two ways that they can express it money and shares that are worth money yeah it's going to have to be it's going to have to be one of those things and if your value to them is growing then one of those things has to grow um and like you know you can you can you can promise a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow but that only that only holds for so
long and I think three years is a really long time yeah like by three years in we had had that conversation about hey here's the budget for next year do you want to raise or do you want us to hire these positions we had had that a year prior by the time we were three years in we had that had that a few times that was about the two year but I think the first one was around there yeah yeah and there were still increases they were just smaller lots of assumptions there I mean sort of he called himself a CSM
assuming certified scrum master I am I I thought it was uh is there a different I I thought it was something manager customer service manager maybe customer service customer success manager customer success manager uh computer science major is another option think You' be a I mean at a company as a service module I like that I like that that's good yeah it'd be nice to actually know what the position is but basically I think no rais in three years is pretty bad essentially
something's got to be going on there yeah yeah that's definitely a conversation and and that's I mean that's a question too right like if they're not able to grow the revenue or raise more capital or do whatever it is that they're doing what is your future there so you're your future can't just be at some indefinite point in the future your future is either now or it's the future and if it's in the future then they should be like going good enough that they can show you some 
yeah um I don't have any tips for you with respect to cat Ur in uh Francis but thank you for your merch message uh okay and then um we got one more here I think right Dan um no I think that's about it that one's just a thank you oh I see an incoming one uh I ended up buying an X1 Carbon because Dan uh sold out the p1p within weeks with his review which was amazing oh okay that's not unboxing all right see you later no unboxing yes okay yeah that's a good a distinction and I think that's it that
is all we will see you again next week same bad time same bad Channel different uh cooler location yeah especially for you the laptop on your lap that is streaming and doing all the other want to see how wet my legs are yeah kind of  no oh my goodness it like honestly kind of looks like I PE you need to hydrate after this oh yeah 100% oh oh God oh God hold on okay ah we're very tangled up here but check this out guys o wait o I don't know if you can tell but it's like yeah very different color
there sweaty thighs okay bye
