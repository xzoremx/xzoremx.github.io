last Bast asks is future proofing silly because by the time one component needs to be upgraded surely the other ones are all worn out now anyway right I wouldn't say that I agree with that in fact I would say that anytime we try to create one law of future proofing we end up oversimplifying the matter the truth is that it really depends on exactly what you're doing and exactly what you're upgrading from in two in many cases you can use an older system with an older CPU RAM and motherboard and upgrade your
GPU once twice maybe even three times and depending on the games you're playing you can get a very clear benefit from that with that said if every time you make a system upgrade you throw in a brand new power supply I'd say you're wasting your money thanks nexo for sponsoring this video you can check out their grip case at the link in the video description
