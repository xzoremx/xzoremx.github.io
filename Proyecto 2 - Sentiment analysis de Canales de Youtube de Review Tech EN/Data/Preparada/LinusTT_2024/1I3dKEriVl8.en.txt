between the radiation the micro gravity and the extreme constraints on Power and cooling space is just about the worst possible place to put a computer can you guys let me in that's better now if you follow space research and exploration you probably know that space is just full of computers like this one so how do they do that well the short answer is by replacing them a lot the ISS takes regular shipments of dozens of laptops at a time which get and this is great this is a direct quote absolutely
destroyed but not every computer can be disposable and in 2017 the madlads at Nasa HP Enterprise and kokia who sponsored this video collaborated to create spaceborn one the first Edge Computing server that was intended to run for an extended period of time on the International Space Station of course it being their first attempt some uh let's say learning took place and it turned out that the super capacitors in the ssds were prone to radiation related failure who knew but
since all it was ever meant to do was run benchmarks anyway the mission was considered a huge success and in 2021 they launched spaceborn 2 whose purpose was to move Beyond proof of concept and explore practical applications for onst compute especially data analysis using AI but the story doesn't end there behind me is new space born 2 for administrative reasons it has the same name and Core specs as last time but it just took off earlier this year and it features more storage than ever over 130
tabt which is an incredible feat when you consider the design challenges I mean where do they even install these things look up oh right I guess they don't really need a ladder do they no  to illustrate why Edge Computing is needed on the ISS let's look at a use case that's focused on astronaut safety these are the Eva gloves that the crew members wear during space walks and according to this article from 2016 they were responsible for half of all space suit injuries so to ensure their
integrity between you es NASA requires the crew to take hundreds of photographs of them from every angle and then beam them back to Earth where machine learning is used to analyze them for scratches or other hazards except for one small problem that data transfer takes five days but with spaceborne oh I don't know how about 45 seconds not only is this a huge time sa but with only a handful of pictures needing to go to Earth for further analysis spaceborn can free up a significant amount of the
crew's limited network bandwidth for other more interesting things with such obvious benefits then you got to be wondering why did no one ever try to put a server on the ISS before the short answer is after seeing how the crew laptops fared many people thought that they just plane wouldn't work and even if they did there were a host of other hurdles to clear like the launch okay this is really cool rocket companies like SpaceX and Northrop Grumman have Shak test machines that are programmed
with profiles that will simulate the launch conditions of their respective rockets and if you've seen that viral video of the machine that disassembles hard drives by vigorously shaking them you're going to know that surviving that kind of treatment is no mean feed well these machines Managed IT both in the simulation and in the real world they actually lift it off at the end of this January every piece of equipment must also pass an acoustic chamber test and a US user friendliness evaluation to
ensure the station crew can install and manage it and uh oh here's a good one apparently all equipment sent up to the ISS goes through what's called a white glove test which uh thankfully is not what it sounds like basically you put on a pair of white gloves and then you just manhandle the crap out of it if the gloves snag or tear on anything yeah that's a potential source of injury I'm going to need you to file that down which f fun fact they actually do onsite and then repeat the test I
just hope they weren't filing any RAM sticks speaking of let's take a closer look at these machines machine Z cuz it's not just one in here I know it was kind of the point of this whole experiment but it still weirds me out that these are just bog standard HP Enterprise systems that you could order on their site today they don't even have lead armor or anything in this case we're looking at an edgeline 4000 which is a multi-blade system and a dl360 dual socket server we asked why these
specific machines and the answer we got was shockingly relatable we sorted the HP server catalog by depth power draw and GPU support and these were the ones we were left with all right fair enough as for why two different machines well here's the thing in a perfect world multiples of the same machine would have been better but due to power constraints they chose to have one with more CPU cores for more additional scientific applications and one with pure CPU cores but with a GPU for deep learning and AI
one thing they needed for both however is Ample Storage kokia generously sponsored this and brought us out here so let's take a look at the let's call them unique choices that they made for their storage configurations first up obviously gone is any trace of super capacitors so kokia can proudly say that their ssds are space ready I guess but but what's less obvious is why they chose a SAS interface Drive rather than nvme for their high-speed bulk storage I mean you would think this is Space Age
Technology they'd want the fastest thing possible but these drives were selected for their balance of performance reliability and especially power efficiency when you're looking at a shared power budget across two servers that is less than a typical gaming rig every single lot counts oh right and that's even under ideal conditions at any given time to conserve power for other priorities on the station the team can be asked to operate in half power mode or even to shut down entirely for
large operations like docking so the new DL 360 server this guy right here gets four 3.72 TB pm6 Enterprise drives totaling 120 tabt of raw bulk storage for scientific data and for backups then for application drives we've got a really wild config again they went with four drives but this time it's their RM sixs again they're using SAS for lower power but this time two of the drives are operating in a data redundant mirror and the other two are basically just chilling there ready to be put into
action in the event of a failure two warm spares out of a four Drive array would sound like crazy Paran oia on Earth but I assure you that in space where bit flips from random radiation are much more common it's perfectly reasonable I mean other than the overkill Drive config and the 28v power conversion that they need to run it on the ISS there's not much to say about this thing it's pretty much a bog standard server there is one cool demo that they said we could run though oh
yeah they offered to let us pull one of the drives out of this dummy machine and live swap it in into this running machine to show that no data loss will occur you want to do the honors sure all they asked is that you put it in Bay 8 see you can see the drive is actually operating use Bay s that works look at that I mean that's good rm6 that would be bad if it wasn't kokia and then let's check the size beautiful 3.8 tab exactly what we want they're not the exact drives that are on
the space station but we wanted a different capacity to show you that it's working and those are expensive look at that status rebuilding I mean this seems like a lot of extra steps we could have just looked up the light yeah the light yeah it's going success and whether you're looking for a SAS drive an nvme drive high capacity or high performance we're going to have a bunch of Kyo has great Enterprise grade drives Linked In the description down below I think I'll let you take this one
apart it's uh appropriately line this size okay let's take a look at the second server that's packed into each "Locker the el4 ,000 is a blade chassis" so the servers are basically these little slide in cards that yeah I know AR these cute or what wait pull it out and they go in on the side look at that instead of from the front wow and they managed to sneak four kokia xg6 nvme drives into each of these blades well when I say each of these blades I should say they had the power budget for four
drives but they didn't have the power budget for four blades in the flight configuration of this system they ship with just one of the four blades installed though it should be noted they do fly up a spare blade per system in the event of a failure there's just no way that that poor Locker can support both these blades and the other server running concurrently let's put you away and shift our Focus to the locker now obviously there's no real up or down on the as it whizzes around the earth at around
"28,000 km an hour but to improve comfort" for the astronauts they tend to mount directional items like plants in a fixed orientation which will put our lockers the drawers that hold our servers in the ceiling there are two of these lockers each containing an identical system load out for workload sharing and redundancy and these lockers present some serious design challenges starting with the fact that they use a standard that quite lit Lally doesn't exist on Earth Express
rack to pack the servers in then HP Enterprise had to get kind of creative they found the shortest servers they could and then they stuffed them in sideways and they're using a combination of air Cooling and water cooling the air cooling uses a system on the ISS called AAA so at the back of these lockers there's two cold air supplies and then two hot air returns that handles about 20% of the cooling for the servers op viously 20% not 100% they're going to need some more and that's where this
water cooling comes in this isn't a one: one for how it would be deployed on the ISS for one thing these fittings 3D printed mockups real fitting $800 a pop if you were even allowed to buy them this tubing cheap vinyl from Home Depot real tubing must be made of stainless steel in fact any wetted surface so anything that comes in contact with water is supposed to be made out of stainless steel but we can still illustrate how it's supposed to work so on this side these go into a heat
exchanger much like this one this is actually from the first generation spaceborn but functionally it's the same it pumps cold water into here chills the air inside the system and then takes the warm water out to be dissipated to the photovoltaic heat exchangers that are plumbed up with liquid ammonia coolant and mounted to the exterior of the station to sink that heat into space you need these kinds of special heat exchangers because while we think of space as cold and we see people you know
oh blasted out of airlocks and they freeze over or whatever in movies the truth is that for traditional methods of heat dissipation you need air and in the near vacuum of space well it ain't there air get it cheesy jokes aside the two cooling systems together are good for removing about 400 watts of heat from each locker but that's a combined budget so if this GPU server kicks into high gear well these CPUs better just chillax for a little bit now let's talk about one of
my favorite subjects networking there's four standard RJ45 ports on the front of the okay I'm going to show you on the real one ah as I was saying four ports on each Locker two of them connect both of the iss's internal gigabit networks to a separate redundant switch inside the locker and then the other two links are going to go between the two lockers at 10 GB why 10 gig well because for either backups or for multinode workloads that is a heck of a lot better than gigabit and the power budget didn't
allow for anything faster cool I guess I'm starting to notice a pattern here anyway that's all pretty standard but things become less so when you look at the station side of these Networks cables this is a 37 pin military spec locking connector these are designed for power and data but in this application just eight of the pins would be used and it is $220 for just this part now on the space station NASA provides these cables for you but for testing sake really here on Earth HP Enterprise had to make their
own fantastic what's really going to blow your mind though is for all of their expensive networking these machines do not have a normal internet connection just a private link back to Earth that NASA not only limits to a mighty 1 megabit per second but that they also encourage folks not to make full use of also even now in 2024 it doesn't have 247 connectivity pretty much every hour or two there's a period of downtime that can be anywhere as short as a few minutes or as long long as 45 minutes
and that's because they have to prioritize generating enough power for the station and when the giant solar arrays Point toward the sun they can block line of sight with the satellites that provide connectivity which oh that's a fun fact even though the ISS orbits less than 500 km from the surface of the Earth our ping times to the ISS and yes we got to Ping the ISS which was pretty cool but our ping times were a atrocious reaching nearly a second as we uploaded some of the dankest memes that
Earth had to offer LT store.com now we asked why that is and the answer was twofold one it's really old okay fair enough but also too the station's Internet relay is in geosynchronous orbit over "35,000 kilm from the Earth's surface and" uh well what I said was H well there's your problem right there it's just really far and you might be wondering well why don't they just use starlink that's a good question um someday they might but for now they don't and HP and the team on the ISS
have to work around the constraints of the current setup I mean for crying out loud it took them four years to validate that you know we can even just run a normal computer up here and actually expect this thing to be reliable they can't just switch to something and go I don't know I hope it works um oh by the way here's another fun one there's no API to determine if if their connection is up or down so instead what they do is buffer all their Communications in basic terms that means that they ping every
second and if the ping succeeds they send data and then hope that the connection stayed up during that time it's a pretty good system okay not a perfect one but certainly enough for us to learn a lot from the spaceborn project even though spaceborn 2 has been in action for 3 years there's still so much to learn two of the servers have hard Hardware raid cards for their drives for example costing both mass and power consumption while two of them use software raid which obviously doesn't
consume any Mass but could impact power consumption even more depending on the loads and one of them could be more or less reliable than the other we won't know until we try which is kind of a recurring theme here so if you want to learn more about the spaceborn computer project we're going to have some resources linked for you down below and we're also going to have a L to some great Enterprise storage options from our sponsor kokia we're truly grateful for this unique opportunity to get
realistically as close as I ever will to the real ISS a prop in a sound stage in LA but hey thanks kogia for the opportunity and for your long-term partnership
