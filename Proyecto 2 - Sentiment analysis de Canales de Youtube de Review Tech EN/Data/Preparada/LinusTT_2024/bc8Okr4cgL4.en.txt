6 years ago I invaded my employees homes and roasted the worst gaming PCs that I could find well guess what we're doing it again but this time Nvidia sponsored the video so we could not only upgrade the Winner's rig but their entire flipping setup but there can only be one so I'm going in I'm taking notes I'll be deciding what I think they need and the best part they'll never even know that I  here first up we've got Mr Robert Oaks editor extraordinaire and big liar because this laptop looks perfectly
good for both gaming and video editing I use it mostly for gaming haven't gotten too much editing in on it yet outside a little Photoshop that was not the point ah here's your problem right here uh pre-built yep I thought you work at Linus Tech tips I bought it back in 2017 it's almost 7 years old now so this is back in high school for me oh my God I feel so old the real problem honestly speaking though is not the tower a desk seems solid enough but really regardless of whether the upgrade
goes to someone more competitive or if it goes to a sightseer like Robert the first thing they're going to want to do is turn on gsync your display does support it and actually you have an Nvidia GPU you can turn it on to eliminate tearing it's just that you don't really have enough FPS this is a little confusing though you have a much better monitor that by the way I recognize from our warehouse that's not set up did you stage this to try to win a move was imp pending so I just never set it up and
now it's here so you would be powering this off of a GTX 1050 the mismatch between this Monitor and your system actually highlights one of the reasons Nvidia insisted that these upgrades should be the full setup because even if you have have a technological advantage like near instant pixel response times or high refresh rate like on this gigantic OLED monitor if you can't also take advantage of other Technologies like a fast GPU with Nvidia reflex to reduce system latency well the next time
you go down and rank you might not know was it my GPU or was it me it's probably me oh well next up we've got Oni Tam senior content writer for labs of delightful couch and wow look at this couch gaming setup and are you kidding me it's a bit far I don't even know where to begin with this okay first thing y awesome setup I love the case that you have on this you've got the dock and everything external SSD and that straight up USB to SATA just old school style adapter I am loving this oh wow
uh it was the cheapest one at Costco yes it was only just moved here for this job so that would explain a fair bit of emptiness one of nvidia's big emphasis points for this setup upgrade is RTX video HDR and I got to say Nvidia if we choose this one it's going to cost you cuz uh while it's a really cool technology that takes your SDR content and converts it to hdr on the Fly you're going to need an HDR display is this HDR I'm kidding we're next location is a Vibe I guess this explains who it is I see this
is your setup this is not my setup this is my boyfriend's setup I see you can tell by the uh the yamaka the yamaka there's probably another yamaka and a bedtime routine and a bedtime routine and another bedtime routine this is the same bedtime routine it is the same bedtime routine his diary this also has a bedtime routine in it that is one of my setups I actually have two uh you'll notice that there is nothing there this is where I sit uh when my boyfriend's lonely uh you'll note that we have uh
three different office chairs in here but I use this because the cats like the office chairs I can see that this is my setup um your battery is uh running low is it well that's cuz I forgot to plug it in I used to have a worse setup really cuz I  closet but it was the only place in the house where I could uh where I could pad everything for podcasting I like that you've got the whole heat and noise isolation from the room that you're working in Vibe yeah yeah that's professional professional braid setup um
oh and if I want some privacy I use that little curtain rod and I put this blanket on it you have a wonderful selection of headphones most of which are in one piece that one's the highest spec one it's very dead um here we have a boyfriend's morning routine yeah I that's good make bed um apparently that one's optional this is something it is yeah um technically it's foam yeah it's not the right kind of foam for acoustic treatment though I know okay this mouse is also experiencing a distended cable um I
think they call that a hernia in humans and this may be the dim monitor that I have seen in 15 years is that on purpose like is it turned way down it might be I am very light sensitive nope it's all the way up okay you do yoga uh I don't uh this is uh this is a board I got from the hardware store but this is a yoga mat that is a yoga mat um but underneath it is a board yeah it wasn't what I was asking the yoga mat was acquired from Value Village the board blue Gage fancy
the board was not why I asked if you do yoga people don't do yoga on a board I I wouldn't know I don't do yoga I think I need to go now wow that was an experience current effort level is a zero how bad is their stuff I don't even know I didn't want to touch it it was very difficult for us to determine a winner you guys uh Robert you showed us some things that you're grandmother left you I mean these speakers may have belonged to your great grandmother the point is very tasteful
desk um he uses it to hold his computer and store his grandmother's ashes on you had the most minimalist of minimalistic setups including the most minimal screen size I think I've ever seen your upgrade would probably involve binoculars got the webcam so that uh people might be able to see you from way back here as for you Jessica we dubbed your setup the H um you got zero points for your current level of effort you even made calling Papa John's Easy by having their Flyers all over the place
those aren't mine in some ways even more minimalistic than on setup there is a desk yep I don't just game like on a patch of floor no you've got a chair uh which is good while the effort level was the lowest that we saw I think your need could best be described as dire and you maxed out your X Factor score this is where Jess podcasts I think we can all agree that Jessica's need is the most um so as part of yours and On's consolation prizes uh you don't live at Jessica's
house and you will each be taking home a 407d super wa wow holy smok thank you for participating and letting us judge you uh you think I want I want to live at my house is that the prize do I get to live some somewhere else now no but the prize is that we are going to give you an overhaul however there's a catch it's dealer's choice you can give us a rough idea of what you're trying to do which you already have and after that it's completely up to my team of experts we've got the walking Hazard the silent
Enigma and Justin who's just in the team okay you guys ready we have 1 hour before lonus gets here okay that's it  those yes or no yes yeah do it put them over top all right pull bring it over fits it perfectly like a glove yeah so this is their 27 in 360 HZ monitor it's cutie OLED as well these things are freaking awesome Dell Alienware has been killing it in the monitor game and wait which way is oh this way there you go nice all right you ready to boot up woo oh tasteful yeah here we go here
we go look we upgraded your shoes oo airflow as you know you need two setups uh one of which you had already in the podcasting closet and one of which you had a desk for and that's about as far as you got well Jessica here it is your desk but now with a gaming rig an actual computer tower an actual computer tower and and I personally removed what appeared to be milk from the desk oh no there's no milk on the desk anymore Oh I thought you meant in no no no oh my gosh okay so why don't we
for starter okay so where do where's my second one of these so can stack them on top of each other you know what I will be right back I have a solution to that it's off the floor now it'll suck in so much less cat hair that actually is a consideration that we should have considered what I would like you to do is just move the mouse okay do you notice anything well there is a uh there is uh a pad underneath it rather than uh unforgiving hardwood yes do you notice anything else uh it is
Wireless yes do you notice anything else you know about maybe just the experience uh it is bright enough to see everything without squinting okay or being in a completely dark room it has  sensitivity okay leave the mouse alone for a second do you notice anything about the   autism Jessica and this is something we've observed many times and we've always thought is a little weird I've never actually asked you about it though Jessica usually games on her work computer uh using remote access so after
wow Luke and I would frequently come across oh I don't know Dave the diver or other various games it's not that we were trying to Snoop on you it's just that we go up there to play Super checks that makes sense and your computer would often be on playing games and we're sitting here going it's Dave the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] diver she doesn't have a computer at home that can run this so my point is anyway Jessica please grab that window for the love of God grab that window and move it
around and tell me you can't tell that you're at 360 Hertz I've never looked at a screen with 360 okay let's open a game let's just open a game okay we'll open a game then let's go with Alan WG to why don't we talk about the setup okay she's got an aw 2725 DF cue OLED gaming monitor this thing freaking rocks I can't not click on heads with it I absolutely love it it's 1440p 360 HZ Lightning Fast pixel response times it's literally one of if not the best gaming monitors on the market and to go with it
we've got a whole new machine 13600 k a susb 760 plus motherboard 850 W titanium power supply and to drive all those pixels add up to 360 frames per second Nvidia sent over an RTX 480 super so this thing is going to absolutely Crush any game you throw at it oh that's a slow run I don't think that's the monitor's fault that is a slow run I can run faster than that and I have asthma it's HDR yeah looks very nice I'm very happy I don't know if that's obvious thank you for telling us
explicitly we actually do appreciate that I am experiencing very positive emotions this I that is what you get walking j walking in New York just get punched by Shadow Demons the best part guys is that we don't have to be limited to just games that support HDR to get these dazzling lights and this level of cool uhhuh see that that's good you're doing good now you'll be hosting Tech tips in no time yeah let's play an older game and show you guys how RTX HDR conversion Works did you ever play the
Batman games I did originally on uh on Console I did okay well let's fix that woo so the big thing we're seeing here is that this is a game that was never remastered in HDR and yet man look at the lights of Gotham City yeah that lightning flash so that timing couldn't have been any better look thugs go get them those those could be just nice young men they're they're  not did he just take off in the air I don't know how are you liking the setup it's really cool we got you a new
keyboard yes new mouse basically everything just this desk seemed extremely sturdy yes and we felt that it was fine all right there's more check this out table management wires I know well no not just the the wires are new they are yes the management of them is also new but the wires themselves are new check this out where do they go let's play Follow the cables by the way you might have noticed we're using our new magnetic Cable Management arches of store.com here it  oh oh wow you seem surprisingly
unconcerned by that okay well anyway you're not going to be using them anymore that was my point and you won't be using these anymore either you'll be using none of that goodbye taada have a seat a closet the closet is not what's new what's new is the proper acoustic panels which go ahead lean in and talk ah uh also we had pretty limited space to work with in here which got us thinking what if there was a creative monitor that could give you way more screen real estate but was an
unconventional shape yeah so we chose the LG dual up it's a taller than normal monitor that gives you not only way more space but as you noticed before way more brightness as well and what's really cool about this is that we're using a fiber optic display port cable to run the mon Monitor and then we're using an active USB cable to get your peripherals over here so this is the same computer yes which means that if you wanted you could podcast on your I don't have to drag the whole Tower over here
yeah you just drag yourself over here and you're good to go we've got your audio interface uh we've got a usb3 hub so you can run other devices if you need to and you could even game in here if if I really wanted to feel like Batman you probably also couldn't help noticing that we managed to put a mouse pad in here Justin custom cut this to be exactly the size of your board how do the headphones feel well they don't make my head hurt okay which is good they're very light
yes and they're very soft these are the dt770 pros from beay dynamic they are amazing uh they're one of my personal favorites and the it's all about the comfort and here if you pop them off for a second the noise I ation so they've got this nice I don't know what the hell to call this fabric chinchilla chinchilla fur yes Chiller ear cup and then they are a closed back headphone but they still sound really good even though closed back is not generally my preference I cannot get
over what a difference in image quality this new monitor is and again shout out infinite cables that active display port cable I use those same ones at my house and they are flipping amazing and the best part is that you know how top fans tend to be kind of whiny right if you're  here computer's in a completely separate room now well this was an absolute blast thank you Jessica for hosting us and I hope you enjoy your upgrade it is significant yes and thanks again to Nvidia for
