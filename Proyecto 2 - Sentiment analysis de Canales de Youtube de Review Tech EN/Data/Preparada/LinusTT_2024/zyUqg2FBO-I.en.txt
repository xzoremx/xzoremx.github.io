I am at guanga digital Plaza in Taiwan and this place is flipping amazing it's six stories of shops just like this one packed floor to ceiling with t treasure but is it a good place to buy a PC I'm going to put it to the test but which shop should I choose there's so many options Sporting Goods has technology I guess but not PC h two console I think yeah ink is more Colton's thing now we're getting closer ooh these look like good deals but I want a game oh my God Jake found the one it's up a
floor but like guys if I was going to commission a system like this back home it would cost a fortune I'm talking like one of my cameraman's legs what what how much about "$5,000 and that's just the starting at" price for one of main Gear's Apex Rush systems coming with Hardline liquid cooling and while that config has a decent GPU they've got it backed up with a core i5 CPU 16 gigs of RAM and just 512 gigs of storage I mean main gear I know you guys make good stuff but who do
you think you are Apple I bet these guys can do a little bit better and I bet I can find someone to sponsor this like Corsair the allnew K65 Plus Wireless features preed Corsair mlx red linear switches and connectivity options of 2.4 GHz Bluetooth or wired us USB learn more at the link below step one is to introduce myself and set a budget oh hi do you like do build PCS like this here yeah I want to play like the best games at like 4K um I have a monitor I just need a PC okay uh my budget is
"$170,000 okay New Taiwan dollars of" course but I want something that looks really cool like can you build this can you build that yeah I build it you built it yeah I was worried there could be a language barrier with the shopkeeper but as it turned out not only was his English great but he said he's the one who built those demo systems step two play dumb I've always believed that our character is determined not by how we treat our peers but by how we treat those who might be
in a vulnerable position so I am not going to be flexing any of my tech knowledge here how does it work I don't know what parts I want I just know I want something that can game at 4K um like really really fast like like uh with um like I yeah like I don't want like the one with the floppy tubes though hard pipe okay yeah like if someone come Iron Man do I like what Iron Man sure yeah yeah sure I built a Iron Man and the Cyber Punk before oh cool okay I don't need it to have like a special
theme or anything though just like like honestly just like a nice clean look like that is pretty good okay um but can I get it by Friday this Friday yeah yeah I think so you think you can do by Friday yeah I think so okay I can give you a menu of like like menu what I use inside oh I mean yeah sure I don't know any of that though so you just got to tell me you got to tell me what's good for that price okay yeah I I'm trusting you okay okay again go around I'll just send you
a picture the okay menu and price okay how about that okay oh that's perfect okay sorry it was name right okay nice to meet you okay thank you thank you okay well that went pretty smoothly I think so I'm committing to just handing over the money regardless of what quotation comes back let's see if they give me a good deal or rip me off oh buddy got back to me do I like white or black I think I like white it is mindblowing to me that we don't do more of this back home he's just like yeah
what's your number can I just text you boom sends me a gallery of systems like yeah how do you want it white or black what's your Vibe it's great it feels so personal he ask what brands I like I don't know what brand is good just trusting you to put together the best system that looks like you said awesome and he keeps wanting to ask me he's like do you want AMD Intel I'm like which one should I get you tell me man let's go give me a good system step three payment I was legitimately pretty stressed at
this point I don't have any idea what my work credit card limit is and accounting is not going to be impressed when I hand them a receipt for some computer in some foreign currency with no tangible asset to show for it what I'm going to carry this thing home with me I'm going to have to find someone to give this thing away to before I leave but that's a problem for another day just got the quote time to pay my deposit on what I think is going to be a pretty uh sick system okay let's see if my car works
when I finish I'll write you a ticket and again great and then I can come pick up Friday yeah perfect you have it all right yep should be good great okay great so uh you'll message me on Thursday or Friday yeah okay perfect thank you very much success eventually uh shout out bank one for the you know "fraud detection this random $5,000" transaction over sees and I guess also shout out Bank to for having my back and making sure my money can be spent so end up using that card sorry accounting
department we'll get it reconciled now we play the waiting game I can't believe it let me just tap a card I didn't even have to enter my pin just like Scribble on a touchcreen for my signature and poof money gone let's  return I wouldn't blame you for thinking does the world really need another handheld gaming PC at this point here it is my friends concrete proof that satire is dead I think you can take notes faster than that like the Speedy segue  Colton well he says it's ready good luck
everybody can't believe he finished in 3 days I don't know what this this is sorry it's a computer we oh we spent 5 grand on a computer oh my God us us the best part is we have absolutely no way of transporting this thing home so we're going to have to let give it away or something oh okay all right that's probably F oh hi just uh picking up the system okay wow that looks awesome wow hold on I want to get a picture of it so you did like a thermal test already yeah awesome
I guess I should have asked this before is there some warranty on the system or how like how if I have a problem with it can do you guys fix it yeah for how long about a year one year okay great three four years you can still find me oh okay I came here on the bus Good Luck Good Luck yeah 40K AG wow okay how many computers do you guys build every day about five wow wow okay wow busy every day okay thank you thank you very much good doing business with you time thank you I
will you have any problem okay sounds good thank you you know I got to say other than the lack of a you know I don't know card or something to carry the system out of here that's about as Boutique and experience as I could have expected I mean he had it running a test suite and everything right when I walked in the door so I could see everything running including thermal testing it's all packed up nicely gave me all my accessories seemed confused by the fact that I wanted a receipt for such an
expensive purchase but other than that pretty good experience I want to know is this system so custom that if he didn't give you a receipt he would still know how to warranty it uh I mean he's only been at that location he said for seven months so I don't know how they would have known um do they just take people's word for it the level of trust seems pretty high I mean he doesn't even leave his store supervised so why did I choose a shop on the fifth floor I don't know this is
very reminiscent of our early days though know following you around a tech hall or te spot you calling weird stuff I thought you meant the early days of the channel and I was going to say yeah it was fun doing a video like this it's so hard these days because like a lot of the time people recognize me I wasn't sure if he was going to know LT it's possible he did but he just has a good Poker Face I'm not sure cuz cuz I did kind of seem like a real idiot no I don't know what Intel is you know if I
was anywhere other than Taipei I would not want to ride a bus with this thing  we okay so he said he builds four to five systems a day that about right uh in the shop yeah probably I mean looking at how much inventory they carrying probably not systems like this but okay then why were you surprised by 3 days because I thought he might have to wait for you know water blocks to come in stock and stuff like that like there's a lot of specialized Parts in here I didn't think he'd necessarily have a
4090 on hand small shops back home stock almost nothing when it comes to high-end Hardware I mean look at the stuff we cleared out of Keith's shop I don't know enough about computer components like I've heard of 490 but is the rest of this really high in oh yeah I think you guys are going to be pretty impressed when we have a look at how this Stacks  finally let's have a look at what we got haven't done an unboxing in a long time I'm Rusty you help this no no I don't need help I got
this dang it break it no I'm not going to break it I'm not going to break it okay oh right I forgot to mention really good packaging by the way it's double boxed and uses a really really nice closed sell foam even though this system is probably too heavy for the packaging if it was a more reasonable one I think it would survive shipping pretty well not that they would normally ship the systems to the customer at a store like that it occurs to me I don't know what the store is called
oh not bad wow those ubben though okay buddy's got skills let's get this side panel off this is so flipping clean it wasn't that long ago that bixy would have been considered a budget tier water cooling brand but I got to say they do not look out of place in this system and the craftsmanship of these bends is just outstanding this length right here is the hardest one to nail because this one or this one well you can always do the bend and then make slight adjustments to it after the fact this one right here
you can't adjust and he's got it perfectly parallel to the rest of the case that is awesome you know I'm looking for flaws here and I just I can't find them when an ignorant customer gives you a budget you could just not bother buying a vertical GPU Mount you could just pocket the difference you could not bother putting in the extra work of grabbing a reverse Direction fans so that from the inside you know all the hubs are facing in but they put in the work okay maybe The
Backs side maybe the cable management sucks let's have a look not bad not bad at all oh I found a flaw Andy ah he's an Andy man the peels are still on okay not a flaw for my camera operator he's into that yep I like peels removed no keep there no no and while we're back here we've got a seic vertex 1 1200 W fully modular power supply multiple opportunities to cheap out there chose not to all right time to fire it up how convenient is it that our hotel has a little gaming room look at
this are they odds you put English Windows on it may cuz they us speak English yeah maybe let's hope you ready big moment let's do it here we go wo wow oh wow buddy when the instruction is make it look awesome and you deliver this you followed the instructions this looks great man I'm just admiring again how parallel these tubes are this one coming off the reservoir is perfectly aligned with the one coming off the GPU which again he had to spend extra in order to achieve to put in these spacers
I can't find a cut corner at least not yet what about the spec maybe main gear comes out ahead there conveniently we can check that with the pre-loaded it of 64 extreme very nice it's a trial version which technically not what you're supposed to do but let's have a  here oh my God Andy what main gear just got taken for a walk they had a core i5 right this has a 7950 x3d top chip on the market okay they had a 4080 super which is pretty okay 490 they had 16 gigs of RAM I'm looking
at wait wait wait wait wait hold on oh I don't know how about 64 what do we got for storage whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoo dude they had 512 gigs of storage this has eight times that amount okay it was a little sloppy leaving my uninitialized drive that's not great it's a lot better than not having it how are we doing for bloatware though IO 64 ryzen Master furm Mark obviously those are not part of a bare Windows install but I don't consider them malicious in any way so I'm okay with
that MSI Center Nvidia drive I'm the one who put OBS on it nothing zero bloat wear I feel like this is too good to be true though no one can be perfect oh I got something Expo is not enabled and my Ram is running at 3600 megat transfers per second that is very slow for a rizon system let's see if we can turn it on to his credit though that's a nice up-to-date bios love to see that okay Moment of Truth did he validate Expo and maybe it just reset we're going to find out does that bky CPU block have a coolant
temperature LCD on it 3 hours later no post oh wait wait it changed the code changed from 15 to 64 oh who Who whoo oh oh oh uhoh the good news is the fix should be as simple as removing half of the memory still giving me twice as much as my main gear would have had as long as I can actually get it out the the um water tubes are a little bit in the way still no dice but I do have an idea it's been a long time since I've seen this really matter but I noticed that my two dual Channel kits you can tell from the
serial numbers are separated so here's the two I pulled out before which were're in a dual Channel pair and here's the one I pulled out just now one10 that's a kit and the one that's in there in this one are another kit usually doesn't make that big of a difference but if the sticks have different ic's on them it can cause compatibility issues especially running at maximum speed wait no way was that it dude okay I haven't seen that in years that's like ancient troubleshooting from the Dark Times 5600 megga
transfers that's it's such a simple error you open up two kits you just have all four sticks you put them in in any order and 50/50 chance you get it wrong let's put the other two back yeah yeah yeah let's put the other two back let's see I'm going to give it one more chance and then I'm going to pull those two sticks and we're going to call it 32 gigs yeah well there you have it it wouldn't be an LTT video without a little bit of troubleshooting and I still consider it a win for the system
configuration but I'm not super thrilled about my memory running at 3600 megat transfers per second by default and needing to spend bunch of time moving memory sticks around in order to get 5600 which on this platform would result in a measurable performance difference H I just noticed Google Chrome was pre-installed too it's one of the first things that I install so I just didn't really register it but questionable while this is some stress tests why don't we have a look at
how the shop handled all of our included accessories okay good power cable in a pretty obvious spot right here all manuals included extra cables included for our power Supply pretty much as expected gpus don't come with much in the way of accessories these days but the reason I want to open this one up is I want to see what he did with the stock cooler because that card is not water cooled by default this is s tier this is exactly what I would do if I was taking the time to do it myself he pulled out
every screw obviously to get the block on and he put every screw back in where it goes so putting this card back together is as simple as undoing it remembering everything putting the PCB back in the middle and doing it all back up if there's one thing that I could criticize it's that you know maybe I would cover up this thermal paste so it doesn't you know get goop on my hands when I'm trying to handle it in the future that's really such a nitpick though this is really good so there's my
two kits of memory one of which works at a time legit Windows 11 can't take that for granted in smaller shops but there it is right there it's worth noting that we did find some minor errors but I'm still extremely happy for the price buddy was ex extremely responsive and the customer service was maybe too much he messaged me at 2:30 in the morning last night being like did you set it up it's a fair assumption that someone who "just bought a $5,000 gaming PC is" probably up all night playing on it but
maybe not 2:30 in the morning next time still it's cool to have that personalized touch and I genuinely felt like he just wanted to know if I love the system let's go find out if we love it not bad 10 minutes of fur Mark and Prime 95 blend nothing has crashed and the hot spot on this GPU is under 70° and okay it doesn't get that quiet at idle but it isn't any louder under load so I consider this extremely acceptable let's fire up a real game casual 350 FPS at 4K anyone sure why not
well it works great I think it's time for us to take this out and find somebody to give it to we're going to keep it simple the first person who walks up and says hi they get a computer mainly I just don't want to carry it for  long maybe I'll walk to the bakery I  ridiculous if we were at the show floor  hello are  you how do I pronounce yeah hi I love your videos oh uh thank you it's a it's an honor to meet you oh cool so it's your lucky day yes it's it's very lucky for me toet no no no you you don't know
though you don't you don't know why it's your lucky day because I'm giving that computer to the first person who  D I don't know what to say I'm in shock thank you is this real you might need to get an Uber or a taxi or something I can give you some cash to take a cab cuz I think your bike is going to be uh not able to carry it all the accessories are in there all the cables and everything like that congratulations enjoy your computer and thank you so much and enjoy this segue
