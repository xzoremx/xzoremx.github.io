watch I'm going to take this Thunderbolt cable connect these two computers drag these giant files across and Mama 800 megabytes per second that is like installing the new Modern Warfare in less than 5 minutes and I can practically hear your chair scraping the floor as you jump up to go and try this but hold on a second you can't just plug two computers together and transfer files between them like that and you especially can't run a game on one PC and then play it completely losslessly
on another and yet here I am doing it what you guys are looking at is in my opinion finally the answer to what exactly is it that makes Thunderbolt special now that Intel gave the spec to the USB if and if you're anything like me your head is absolutely swimming with questions right now how are they doing lossless encoding what is is the latency like do I really have to find out after the segue to our sponsor headphone juice is now something you should be proud of these are your typical headphones that
accumulate heat while you game e Wicked cushions add a cooling gel to their cushions to keep your ears sweat free you can easily replace them on your headset check out Wicked cushions and the link below what you were just looking at is called Thunderbolt share and it's in essence a piece of software that establishes a point-to-point network connection between two Thunderbolt 4 or Thunderbolt 5 Windows PCS it features exceptionally high bandwidth and Hyper low latency which
kind of makes sense since you may recall that Thunderbolt is essentially a four lane wide pcie connection with extras like USB for peripherals display port for monitors and power for one cable docking let's start by revisiting that file transfer demo that I just showed you guys because it's a the most obvious use case for this and B the easiest to understand in terms of the data flow our files get pulled off of the SSD of the first machine they get packed into packets they flow through the
Thunderbolt chip through the thund bullet cable and then they get unpacked on the other side and dumped onto the SSD now I'm still a strong advocate for networked rather than point-to-point data Management Solutions but in a pinch guys you're at the hotel trying to back up some footage to a colleague who's flying home in the morning or you're at a land and your buddy needs to grab a game install this will allow data transfers at theoretical speeds of up to 20 gbit per second for Thunderbolt 4 and
40 gbit for Thunderbolt 5 which would bring that Modern Warfare install that I talked about before down to under a minute and other than high CPU usage during the transfer and Thunderbolts 1 M passive cable length limit there is no downside it's just ripping fast now let's push this button this is incredible even with a 10 or 25 GB network connection I have never in my life seen a PC to PC game stream with this little latency I mean I obviously haven't measured it with a high-speed
camera yet I don't have one in my pocket but to the eye I would describe the latency as none and that's because every other solution steamlink Moonlight Etc relies on the GPU to render each frame and code it with a significant loss of fidelity and then transfer it to where it needs to be where it is received unpacked and then finally output to the display by contrast this is not encoded at all and before you call BS because believe me I was thinking the same thing have a look at this pudding because the
proof is in it while mirroring we find none of the visual anomalies that I would normally associate with even a very high quality av1 stream and tap task manager over here is picking up some very serious bandwidth that is coming over that virtual link about 4 gbit there is of course some optimization taking place here Intel created their own remote desktop protocol that handles turning your displays output into Thunderbolt packets and that allows them to reduce bandwidth
by updating only changed elements on the remote display but it does basically what it says on the tin and we're a little Cy about the details but as far as I can tell that high CPU usage about 25% on a core Ultra 7 155h is just the cost of doing business when you're receiving a data stream this wide and the GPU usage is the secret sauce that makes this work so well Intel says they are going straight from GPU frame buffer on this side to GPU frame buffer on the other side no storage bottleneck they
aren't even dumping it into RAM the software is still still in Alpha with no committed release date for now so we are just scratching the surface of what a link like this could unlock in the future but I'm am already extremely impressed by what I've seen and imagining countless applications for this I mean I showed you guys it goes both ways right we can see the screen from the one we can use the controller from this one on the other one I mean get this built into windows and you
wouldn't need a silly dual screen laptop no offense no offense dual screen laptops are great um just to you know share content with a colleague you just plug their computer into yours and Boop Flawless oh here's another one this would turn every outdated all-in-one or a laptop as long as it has Thunderbolt 4 and up into a monitor also by the way while you're ated Intel didn't talk to them about this ahead of time Please Release the remote desktop application I know I'm an edge case but like I would
totally wire up my house for 25 gig fiber if I could just have all my Compu in a rack and then use thin clients for everything of course wires are pass√© now anyway let's move a couple of Paces this way where Intel is showing off their other next big thing for connectivity I already got my first taste of Wi-Fi 7 when I unboxed an eurom mesh Wi-Fi kit over on short circuit and being the cynic that I am I was blown away when for once it actually delivered on the kind of generational performance
upgrade that they claimed check this out these are real world transfer speeds at two three even in excess of 4 gabit per second I me that is faster than what 99% of people are getting with a wire right now and this easily lives up to Wi-Fi 7's EHT or extremely high throughput moniker now your first reaction is probably why should I care I mean no one's internet is that fast and okay well first of all there are some people princes need internet too but that is a valid point I mean the services that you
use online are likely to be a bottleneck before your Wi-Fi is at these kinds of speeds except that Wi-Fi rarely performs at Peak efficiency due to range limitations it's not always going to be like this not to mention Network congestion so you're going to get some fraction of that maximum speed and given that it's a lot higher than it used to be it's going to be a lot higher than it used to be also this is perhaps more important once everyone makes the switch non-streaming data transfers will be
completed so much faster that it will free up airtime for everyone else which will help to Aid with congestion that's just a small part of the justification for the speed though this will enable Wi-Fi to be used for completely new applications I don't know about you but I am tired of seeing 4K video touted as a use case for the NextGen Wi-Fi didn't you just tell me the old one was good for that and I mean AK okay fair enough but seems to have pretty much completely petered out but a PC grade Wireless VR
headset with nearly native video quality okay that is really exciting and there is so much more it's felt for a long time like each generation of Wi-Fi was all about support for more devices rather than making the one PC that I have in my basement go faster not this time one of the big keys to this is a carryover from Wi-Fi 6 reduced congestion thanks to support for the 6 GHz band part of this is that it just hasn't gotten clogged up yet like the 5 GHz and especially 2.4 GHz bands but
much more significant is the fact that 6 GHz doubled the maximum Channel width to 320 MHz and there's the fact that Wi-Fi 7 can actually utilize connections on more than one band at the same time time using multi-link operation or mlo mllo is sick depending on the radio configuration it can enable either higher overall throughput as data can be broken up and transmitted over different bands simultaneously or this is great for the gamers out there lower latency as low as 1 millisecond by utilizing the
first available band instead of being forced to wait its turn like it would on a single band let's go gamers another Improvement for individual users comes in the form of 4K QAM that's quadrature amplitude modulation which is a method for translating digital packets into analog signals by varying the amplitude and phase of the radio signal okay that's a lot to digest but in a nutshell "instead of having a maximum of 1,24" values per symbol which is the smallest amount of data that can be transmitted
we can have one of "4,096 values which results in about a 20" % transmission increase over Wi-Fi 6 all other things being equal and of course there are some multi-client things as well Wi-Fi 6 added the ability for multiple clients to transmit data to an access point simultaneously this is achieved through a technology called ofdma which basically establishes multiple subcarriers within Wi-Fi channels these subcarriers are grouped resource units which can each be assigned to a client device well Wi-Fi 7
bands on this by allowing a client to be assigned multiple resource units so you're not leaving capacity that's just sitting there unused when there aren't many clients connected okay this is a good thing for individuals as well man I love this stuff um speaking of connected clients Preamble puncturing was an optional feature of Wi-Fi 6 that is now enabled across the board and allows modern devices to utilize channels that are partly occupied by Legacy users let's say for example an an old Wi-Fi IP
camera is using 40 MHz in the middle of an otherwise unused 160 MHz wide Channel well Preamble puncturing allows a Wi-Fi 6 or 7 device to recognize that the channel is partially occupied and to utilize all the unoccupied portions of that channel so in our example that would be 120 MHz of bandwidth where under previous standards you'd be limited to the largest contiguous unused portion of the channel just 80 that was done back then to avoid interference but it left 40 MHz of bandwidth completely
unused there's more uh conversations between APS and client devices are often called spatial streams and without boring you all completely to death modern APS can deal with more than one spatial stream at a time just how many they can deal with is usually a spec on the box with the ridiculous acronym of mimo that is multi-user multiple input multiple output and the values typically look like 2x two 4x4 or hey maybe 8 by8 if you're a real baller the Wi-Fi 7 spec now allows for up to 16 simultaneous
clients worth of input and output that is 16x16 mu mimo but the reality of it is most devices aren't going to implement that I mean Wi-Fi 6 supported 8x8 but even a $600 Wi-Fi 6E router like netgear's Nighthawk only implemented 4x4 and your laptop or smartphone is probably only 2x two by the way on that topic don't let manufacturers fool you more antenna sticking out of a device does not automatically equal better mimo performance while it is true that 2x two requires two antennas and 4x4 requires
four just because it has eight sticking out of it like this Rog Rapture ax1000 doesn't mean it can do the maximum 8x8 of Wi-Fi 6C and the same will go for Wi-Fi 7 in fact devices capable of Max Wi-Fi 7 performance are going to be rare if they exist at all and they're going to come with a serious price tag but even conservative implementations of Wi-Fi 7 are going to bring us significant improvements I mean maybe your budget friendly router only implements two band mllo but that is
still double the bands that you could use before and now here's double the Segway double the segue to our sponsor are your headphones cushions H like a tiny steam room stop steaming your ears like your broccoli we get cushions offer all sort of cushion replacement for your headphones and it's not just your regular cushions with added dual layer cooling gel they ensure you keep a cool head even your team is feeding looking for a crack wikied cushion give you a crack-free comfort they use top-notch materials
