Okay it definitely wasn't all me these guys helped but as a team we have built some pretty sick computers over the years and as we were going through your guys' submissions for your favorites I got to confess I had totally forgotten about some of them me too I believe it starting with number one oh I didn't forget about this one this is number one the pyramid piecy like this was everyone's favorite no this is just number one everyone's favorite is the last one oh it's in reverse order well I
thought the pyramid PC was pretty cool it was pretty cool does he still use this not only is it in use but a custom desk was created to accommodate it shut up that's actually legitimately pretty cool it's nice when people like appreciate stuff I actually don't like this one really really I've never really been like the Illuminati pyramid meme kind of guy I give this an eight out of 10 easy how much I like it it's a four it would do a lot better for me if it didn't have the big Gody overclocking
button that turns it off that's sucks it's a me there's a power button there's literally a power button I have a cat yeah but it's just cat would be like oh I'll I'll give it a seven and a half I think we should have to do integer numbers okay eight two no way there's no way this is top 25 he literally glued rocks into a computer and you guys are like oh my God who's done it before there was imitators afterwards I don't think anyone did it did it for a reason I had to wash lips
rocks did you actually I thought did that myself I don't think you washed my rock maybe we did it together this is it looks so half ass the idea is cool the execution is like a SI and a half I think it sheded a lot of rocks yeah but I kept it for 6 years you wash them better credit to I think it was Brandon who shot this b-roll for making this pig look lipstick it's not a pig come on it's Nots he hates it cuz all his computers are ugly is your current computer even built by you his personal
rig was mostly assembled by me and then it failed why did it fail because it leaked why did it leak we unplugged the pump and then he built it again for the third time in a month it is built by me though I still think it looks great I think it counts as extra built by me if I paid someone to build it then I did it again myself he paid his paid friend to build it and then did it again himself if you want to know someone who I'm their paid friend how about this message from our
sponsor Ridge I mean you guys know who they are by now right they've got wallets they've got key cases they've even got luggage and they've got a big sale for their 11th anniversary that is happening right now so check them out at the link down below for some massive savings this is a four for me I gave it a 6 and a half but four I'm going to go with six okay 11 yeah not at all biased sure thing geod dude uh this one is okay deserving and should have been number one to five am I
the only one who was very surprised to see what a spectacular job Carl Jacobs and his team did of Glam footag this thing it looks so good in their video so he plays Minecraft on a box and then the climax is playing it on this Godly piece of computing art if I had to pick I think that this is my favorite build that we've ever done and it's nice cuz I didn't have to do any of it we spend so "much money on this I think the $100,000" price tag ended up being quite conservative yeah it was like 150 if you
like account for the Machining that sounds really expensive compared to my rocks I did say this is my favorite LTT build ever it's not very practical though I'm going to go with a nine I agree nine eight I don't like desk PCS all right oh it's the full bom PC speaking of piece of builds that Lo again I also love it wow look at that paint workor oh this is a 3D print yeah so why is it that it's crooked because the stuff inside is pressing against the walls so it's deforming the shape so
either way you just did a bad job I mean it wasn't going to fit I I challenge you to do a better job what purpose did these serve Luke I don't remember those ended up being if I remember correctly a platform so I could put I think power supply and storage or something in there our modding capabilities internally have really improved a lot this whole entire thing was also I think two days uh I think you mean two days and two nights yeah you Brandon were here twice in a row until I believe 2: to 4: in the
morning shooting this mess I love it when Luke does arts and crafts oh my God you made a stencil and it still looked like that why did you make more than one stencil you know you can just reuse them God this is insane to think that we did this to Luke's credit it was not that easy to put together a super small form factor machine back then the hardware choices were extremely limited and there weren't nearly as many inspirational guides to follow along with the whole reason why I wanted to do this was to
kind of show off that graphics card actually cuz that was a sick card oh yeah I had to use pieces of cardboard to stop it from shorting out so what the community is saying is they want our builds to be either M Deluxe or Jank garbage with cardboard not garbage nothing in between looks great there's no way that this ran anything other than thermal throttled up the butt oh yeah but it functioned not only did multiple people get inspired by The Fallout build and build their own
but multiple people were inspired by the amethyst build and build their own why you so defensive you're trying to trash on all my stuff but so far I more builds in here than yeah he's 50% of our top builds right now let's see some builds you've done I I think that's all of mine though oh you've got other builds I expect the pizza warming PC to make an appearance here the engineering Excellence is fantastic okay like three three 11 thermal throttles to Hell impact runs harder than an actual bomb
your PC to be highly performant this is not it look at the hole it needed the hole it's not even close to straight it looks like you spent time to make it crooked is the PC you've got some serious like emo band hair going on look at that look we're not raiding hairstyles today he was going through some things the KN to a box fan was my idea and I think that that actually added a lot to the video I think it's still deployed today I think we have it still it's great this ended up being
such a greater than the sum of its parts build everything on this table looks like and then the finished build it was kind of awesome I love the fans on the ram I agree with Jake actually those little Ram fans add a lot and if you want even more noctua in your life the noctua X LT screwdriver now available LTT store.com I can only really give this a seven cuz it's not that imaginative but personally eight or nine four what you just painted stuff beig and brown yeah like at seven let's say
really out of all the sleepers the Sony voo are you helped with this this is an Alex buil his brainchild for sure what was that for I believe it's for VM moding this GPU of course it is Alex is like hm computer that works how about 700 Watts on a graphics card shout out this being just about the most gorgeous GPU block that I have ever seen yeah it's pretty looks looks like a nightmare to assemble wao yeah that looks I guess it's hidden it doesn't matter that right there that's what I think of that why is
there a desk there's a desk because there was no room to put Cooling in this chassis sweet computer I love that you utilized the desk to cool it cuz there was enough space in the thing all yeah that's sick it doesn't look super sleeper to me I still think this is a super cool build this is seven and a half out of 10 I agree with L 72 you said a whole number I did seven then seven yeah seven sweet build though here it is the number of labor hours that went into building this aluminum days and
nights so many more than two days night that's crazy that's weird it was like Five Nights at Freddy's this build took so long that I now have facial hair one of the biggest challenges was getting this release mechanism to work correctly so it was had a relay so could make it so the head blew up oh wow kind of thing if we hadn't tried to do that it probably could have been done in half the time what a cool build though really cool did it overheat no it's got an AO for fooling and it's got ample it's a
little bigger than the bomb airow yeah it's a little bigger that's a feature not a bug I think the objective was that if you died in Minecraft we would have some kind of API something that would make it did it do that no hey my childhood Minecraft craft heart is given this like an eight I I really like this one I think a nine can you stop stealing my scores what I was going to say nine oh you're all eight I'm like oh I have a different score from Jake for a change oh God
glorious this one is great look at your hair I think this is better than the like emo banded hair I don't know is this about my hair now your hair minus five I aess six six come on really he's had so much worse I'm right here what is going on well we wanted to repurpose a board that we didn't care about so we grabbed one that we had already used for subambient cooling I did not think he was going to be able to pull this off this was so Co I went to go see this like in person because I thought it
was so cool the very best part about it is either that it pours directly from the spout of the teapot onto the GPU or the fact that we filled it with actual tea there was no movie magic isn't that amazing that looks like tea I don't know oh it's tea dude look I brewed this tea sure yeah that's terrible this whole thing was fantastic this is an eight for sure for me it's at least a nine for me yeah I love this a lot of creativity into it both sides of the back panel hilarious using an actual teapot
fantastic using actual really stand out their designs and everything that British flag just the every single part of this is sick it's it's at least a nine for me this man really okay ainus build and it's the tank piec not the one I would have chosen yeah tell us about this case lus it's in the shape of a tank what what did you do for this build I built it you put parts in a case yeah it's just a case but there's no like customization there's nothing cool that you did it's very RGB there no real
expertise correct no skill it was a little no creativity well I wouldn't no design work it's very creative I mean look at that though bang bang I mean the case is neat if you're like 11 you're hating on our community not on me I didn't choose it we did a weird cases compilation video and then the community voted how does that work for the one that they wanted yeah those fans don't do anything they are up against a glass panel they are for show full show it's definitely better than the bomb build I
disagree those fans also do nothing yeah we didn't rate that one oh we didn't rate that one but I don't know if it's worth a rating this is okay this is a 10 yeah yeah this is easily a 10 this was Far and Away the top Ed one from the community couldn't believe the level of detail look at this b-roll you can't even tell it's like miniature this makes me feel bad about myself don't watch any of my builds in this one in quick succession God pleas look at that vending machine most of the
coolness was not done by us this was all nerd Forge all the way they did an amazing job it was one of those things where they said it's our gift to you the machine and I was like oh my God I want someone to daily drive this thing so we ended up um auctioning it for charity at LTX raised a bunch of money for charity so massive shout out nerd Forge for that as well I do agree with the community vote here 11 yeah and not a Luke 11 like a real one yeah we should do another build with
them I think what we should do right now is talk about which builds we think are missing from this list where's your copper tube PC that was not that exciting compared to the tank oh my God I had to learn how to bend Co pipe in a way that didn't look like I ended up getting the actual final method from Bob and Rod I think the big thing was finding a bender that actually had the same diameter as the outside of the tube and then filling it with sand so it doesn't Crush well okay awesome at the
end after all the sanding and polishing he actually used this as his daily driver workstation here at work for like two or three years years until the DDC died okay this build what I mean I built it you put a kit together good job congratulations everyone can play Lego yeah audience let us know whose build is this Hey look it's me wow I wonder why why I am there oh look it's me again wow this case is this is like the stupidest case ever but also I love it it's so cool it weighed a ton it's a single what
was it just cast aluminum thing hand finished hand polished I think it was "$5,000 or something like that and they" only made a hundred part of the original idea of the compensator series was for them to be bad yeah well I mean you hope it's not bad but was it bad well the SLI was bad yeah and the case was stupid it was completely immobile I mean the whole point is spending the most money you can on every single thing like in the consumer like off the shelf standard I
would have daily drove it if I had space I couldn't lift it also they gave us number 93 I think I asked for number 69 look at this I could have blown out my rectum what seven Gamers one CPU is this the OG one boys hold on when I started you see this is 8 years ago I've been here for 8 years one of my first tasks was taking these water blocks apart and putting the normal coolers back on I lied on my job application and said that I had water cooled many computers and said that
straight to his face and I didn't break a single one they were I don't know if I've ever told you that before yes you have really oh yeah I totally lied why am I the one with the nickname liess yeah I didn't lie about anything you on the other the resume fraud Duo this brick of raw GPU delighted me more than I could have possibly expressed in the video plugging in seven gpus one movement all at once I haven't done it before I haven't done it since it's so cool that was like hard never done before yeah at
the time that was really cool remember when lonus used to do cool things yeah see he actually built a computer for I do cool stuff yeah I mean sure this was one of my favorite collabs this was really cool yeah shank is so cool and this build is amazing I missed it I wasn't able to be here for this I was so upset I'm pretty sure he SI I mean he's looked like that in one of the videos we were watching earlier yeah you want to rate my hair again oh my God the monitor so cool I forgot about the monitor this
is a 10 I really like that it's like the whole thing it's glorious isn't that monitor like stupid expensive it's an alien wear thing right it's stupid and stupid expensive oh yes this thing is awesome this looks like a normal computer yep everything's fine it looks way better than the amethyst machine cuz it's not full of stupid rocks disagree it looks boring I'm bored oh yeah are you bored now son no oh the wig oh yes there we go ratee my hair that's an improvement it's better yeah for sure and remember
this is going through the computer like there's some leakage this is just dumb what this is the point you realized that I love that bills it cooled really well it was super effective it's here it is called it this is probably the best thing I've ever done you look just like you hate everything I did I think I was like this video is horrible I'll try to make it more interesting by asking the Panago guy how to heat pizza with a computer so I understand the damn video it wasn't to heat the computer was
to keep it from cooling down so I arrive on set and there's a cold pizza sitting there and I'm like why is the pizza cold and it's like so we can warm it up with the computer I'm like oh my God no we're supposed to have a pizza on the computer warming pan and a control pizza that's just cooling down and we're supposed to track the temperature decline over time things were very well planned I've heard of this crazy thing called an insulated bag Mark me we are redoing the pizza Waring
PC we're doing it this year you know you might actually be able to heat up a cold piece of pizza now just because of how much power computers drop this is actually true like 2 490s and like a 13900 Pizza warming PC maybe viable now oh wow I think this is recency bias this build sucks it's like a four it's so stupid I love Elijah but like I definitely wouldn't want it but it's a fun video this computer was awful none of the screens work they worked no I know they worked after Elijah spent like
a week getting them to work yeah what  mean hey I like this one the hack the hack Pro speak I totally forgot about this but this is cool that were a nightmare to get going how many videos are there it's finally done such a cool chassis like blackout I love it cheese grater and this system ended up being wicked fast it looks very cool look at this system though yeah like this was sick it has a phase change cooling system in the basement yeah we still had this case like are you uh actually
someone offered to buy it yeah we still had like we had it for the longest time should I sell it for $400 I feel like it's worth more than $400 I think it's worth a lot more than $400 but it's been taking up space for I think you should just give it to them eight years I actually liked the more ugly sleepers better personally this one was awesome cuz they're actually sleep was so cool yeah see like that's sick like you went overboard on the devices in the front but that doesn't make it look too clean
it makes it look like it was a prop in a video game yeah which is sweet this machine is spectacular the monitor is super cool go look at the final shot of the mineral oil one that we did back in the house it's baby L it's baby you too like that's so cool you're a door I think you I think you have a fetish though that is so cool are we going to do another one how is that not cool pretty bubbles that was sick you use that minerala computer for years how are you going to how are you going to throw
at me for that even while it was leaking huh I did I love it sick I love it I'm just saying you have a fetish maybe so do you okay we've built a lot of freaking computers yeah like that bit in the intro I'm like I forgot some of them I I was like yeah I mean you know I forgot the chiller I legitimately forgot I forgot that Chiller Tower 100% tons of this stuff speaking of Chiller Tower oh my god oh yeah oh my God it's like evaporation man [Laughter] holy this thing still doesn't have a
million views so yeah it's a bong this is it and it almost killed the computer and lus was very upset basically there's falling water in these tubes and there's air being pushed into it and up it the evaporation of the water as it falls causes the water to be chilled below the ambient temperature then it pulls in the bottom gets pumped up to the CPU and then goes back up to the top to fall down so you can actually achieve subambient cooling without phase change cooling but it is phase change cooling
you just don't need a compressor yeah almost no power draw yeah yeah it's super cool like they use it for data centers and stuff oh God my first gaming PC there it is boy I wish I remembered all the parts of mine cuz I would have just done this as like a fun project at home I didn't have a GPU I used onboard Graphics cuz I thought it's GeForce it must be good there was a lot of really misleading stuff back then well it's still misleading remember SLI ran that's the thing like there's a reason that I
advocate so strongly for numbering and naming schemes that make sense because I fell for it when I didn't know better yeah wait you're telling me the 490 in my laptop isn't the same as the 490 in my desktop yeah oh I forgot about this one though this build is amazing it helps that I thought the OG Xbox console itself looked super cool getting all that stuff in there not easy oh it was a thing some people were pretty upset at us for stripping it oh my God this card covered in masking tape why is it taped
like thator from metal shards yeah oh my go right cuz he s off the connector hey look at all the metal that was in the  card what was that I have a bit of a thing for hot rodding stuff through the side of a case apparently I get credit for this one cuz uh this is me but look at the side of this computer that's sweet that's cool passive cooling baby yeah that's wicked so here's another all radiator PC y so that's what the water looked like I think that face encapsulates how I feel about this
computer so far sus those are usually filled with oil right yeah so like you we've cleaned it out oh yeah it didn't matter though oh yeah yeah 100% it worked great though this thing cooled  Dam she's a 10 boys she's a 10 the side pan if only you could actually order that from AliExpress wait did he ET it on the wrong side yeah oh God the Colton dancing is is the best part no the best part is this segue to our sponsor delete me ever feel like your personal info is on a global sharing
