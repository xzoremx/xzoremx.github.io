when I was a kid they had a special room in the school for kids like me who wanted to learn about computers but then suddenly poof out goes to the computer lab and in comes these things Google's partners have sold 100 million Chromebooks in the last 3 years 100 million though kind of makes sense when you consider how many of these devices are purchased by schools or by parents who were forced to buy them by schools but it may not just be schools in the future come think of it with that many
of them out there there may be one in your house right now and you better get used to it because Google has made their linux-based OS so polished over the years that these students are growing up with an experience that may just be good enough for them to not think of this as a Chromebook but just as their laptop could 2020 something finally be the year of the Linux desktop but dressed in a chrome costume I believe it will which is probably horrifying to just about everyone so let me explain after a quick
word from our sponsor build Redux they build fully customizable gaming PCs suitable for any budget pick your favorite games and see how they perform using their online pc Builder it's simple head to the link below and create your new rig today Chromebooks originally launched with miserable specs I mean even iPhones had more storage space not to mention useful apps you might want to fill it with and given their limited functionality not to mention their short commitment to
software updates compared to a Windows or a Mac OS machine it's no wonder that people saw the first Chromebooks for what they were underpowered junk but Google's been playing a long game something that softpedia recognized way back in 2015 when they said Microsoft is engaged in a silent war and is losing just four years after being introduced Chromebooks were slowly eating up market share not at home but in schools which I mean kind of makes sense most students especially below the college level only
really need email a web browser and the Google productivity suite and getting the schools on board was easy due to the cost the cheapest iMac which is what many schools used to have in their computer labs is over "$1,200 now so uh hm let me see I can" have 30 of these and they don't even move or I can have 150 of these h tough call Google also helped the schools manage these enormous fleets of machines by investing heavily in administrative tools for the Google workspace
environment account management shared access to files and storage support for group collaboration these have all made it easy to adopt the Google ecosystem and that's even ignoring the general ease of use and convenient Cloud synchronization so in this way Google's kind of The Pusher giving kids their first hit hooking them while they're young if you think about it do you know anyone who buys an iPhone just because they already have an iPhone and they just need a new one familiarity is King
but come on lius I can hear you saying I mean how does any of that help with this supposed long game if Chromebooks are still underpowered e-waist well that's the thing Google recognized that problem and this is the fix Chromebook plus promises a new minimum standard for Chromebook devices delivering improved performance power powerful included software and longer support up to 10 years all while targeting a $400 starting price this unit from Acer is right around that Baseline of Chromebook
plus it has a 1080p 15in display a core I3 12 Gen processor 8 gigs of ddr5 RAM and 128 gigs of storage and we saw this thing for as cheap as $270 at Best Buy now there are entry-level Windows machines around that same price or in some cases even lower but they make awful compromises on everything from performance to display while also running a heavier operating system and by the time you're looking at something running windows with a 1080p display you could be paying 50 to $100
more for that Windows license well you know what's not heavy and has no license fee Linux which has always been the Beating Heart of chromos just now it's a lot easier to unleash these days it is literally one checkbox to enable a Linux terminal and to start downloading Linux native software like blender just a simple command and blender's installed classroom takes about 30 minutes to run with BMW sitting at around 15 minutes so all right it's not the fastest thing in the world but
guys if this was a Windows machine at this price in these specs you'd be very impressed for about $250 $ this is very usable for day-to-day tasks and in a pinch as we've shown you can even do some light real work on it and it's not just blender Ken live is a video editor that works on here as well as audacity which is a powerful open- source audio capture and editing program the list of native Linux applications really is long and continues to grow with the help of the open source community and of course
some corporate players who have played a role as well with a huge driving force behind the recent gaming Renaissance on Linux being valve who has dumped significant resources into the proton compatibility layer allowing tons of non-native Windows games to be played on Linux and as of quite recently I this loading bar ever goes away even Chrome OS time for some distractions from my studies let's give it the old restart look I didn't say it was fast this is very slow with screen capture
running this could be a problem I I will try yeah you won't be kickstarting your Twitch streaming career with this setup I'm afraid o yeah I'm going to stop screen recording all right yeah this will work oh okay yeah I think it's basically just when it needs to animate quite literally anything it struggles tried plugging it in no improvement I don't think it's a performance issue I think it's more of a proton translation layer issue let's try something that I know runs a little better Hollow
night all right this is more like it   game this is running great too look obviously you're not going to be playing AAA games but within the confines of what the hardware can handle you can use proton DB to show what game games are natively supported or you can use steam link to remote into a different computer or a cloud-based gaming service it's all pretty cool right I mean when I was a kid I would have loved to be able to play even simple games and have an affordable device that I could call my
own and even the camera is reasonably decent so is the microphone and I don't even have anything too negative to say about the keyboard considering the price now you might still think that these devices are just e-w and I get it it's not like I'm going to be switching to Chrome OS as my daily driver anytime soon but how many people do you know who basically use their computer to call man on the weekends or pull up a recipe for baking you might not agree with me about this but guys mark my words acceptance
for cloud applications even heavy ones like 3D modeling animation tools and video editing is at an all-time high and Chrome OS will work its way into the market as a daily driver operating system for for many people after they leave school and join the workplace where the onboarding process could be as simple as adding their work account to their Chromebook that they already own might not be this year and it might not be next year but I see you Google and I'm kind of into it if it means that the
year of the Linux desktop can finally move Beyond meme status what we'll never move Beyond meme status is this segue to our sponsor red magic they recently released their new flagship gaming phone the 9 Pro specifically engineered to strike fear into the hearts of the enemy team with the brand new Snapdragon 8 gen 3 processor their ice 13 cooling system "and a 6,500 Mah dual battery it can" handle even the most demanding games for extended periods of time plus with 80 wat fast charging you can get back into
