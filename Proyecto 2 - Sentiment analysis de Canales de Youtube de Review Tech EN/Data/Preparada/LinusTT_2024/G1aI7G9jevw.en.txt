5 years ago I stood on this very Street and I told you guys how much I loved amd's roadmap if it hadn't been such an ethical issue I would have bought their stock obviously that wasn't Financial advice and it still isn't but man did I ever nail it because the hits keep coming and it's all at Intel's expense there are a lot of reasons to be excited about the new CPUs that AMD just announced but I'm not here to just talk about that because there are also reasons to we only cautiously
enthusiastic so let's talk about that but first this enthusiastic segue to our sponsor pulseway Monitor and take control of your systems while you're on the move and respond to it alerts right from your phone with pulseway you can try it for free today and secure 40% off any plan including their month-to-month options who wants 16% more performance for reportedly the same price yeah me too and that's what AMD is claiming to deliver with the ryzen 9 950x considering that there's no bumping
boost clocks or cash and their base clocks are actually a little bit lower that is a very respectable result and enough to absolutely blow the doors off of Intel's consumer Flagship The Core i 94900 k now these are amd's Z numbers and you should take them with a sodium tablet until we get a chance to run them through the lab but the performance leader is rarely the one that's going to be caught stretching the truth and there is no doubt that the performance leader right now is AMD unfortunately that's
all AMD gave us as far as performance numbers go they are not sharing benchmarks for the rest of the 9000 Series lineup though they did give us specs for the ryzen 5 and the ryzen 7 that would indicate a similar performance uplift over last gen with a reduction in heat and power consumption to go along with the performance D until that's sicker burn than you'll get from a core I9 it gets even better for the gamers out there precedent suggests that the five and the Seven class chips are
going to be single CCD SKS making them the goto for minmaxer gamers that is at least until we get an x3d variant which AMD hasn't announced at this time the most exciting part for me though is what's not new while AMD has been hard at work on a new motherboard chipet to launch alongside these CPUs it's going to be on the same am5 socket that we've come to know and they've recommitted to their long-term relationship confirming support for am5 until at least 2027 this is such great news if you
already have a 600 series board you've got to love just drop in performance upgrades but with how strong some of these new boards look I suspect some people are going to be tempted to  for one thing USB 4.0 is now standard on all x870 and x870 or extreme motherboards which means Thunderbolt 3 capability which is an optional part of USB 4 may become more common on AMD and the same goes for PCI Express Gen 5 which is now on all x800 series chipsets for both the GPU and for nvme storage
though how many ports are required to be Gen 5 remains to be seen pcie Gen 5 has double the bandwidth of Gen 4 which while we aren't likely to actually use it to its full potential today means that devices can use fewer lanes for the same performance level that's going to pair nicely with the higher speed Expo certified memory kits that AMD is promising for this generation but wait there's even more am4 users are getting new Chips that's right the ryzen 9 5900 XT and ryzen 7 5800 XT are coming to
give you a nice little performance boost for your older system this puts am4 users on par with the 13700 K and the 13600 K respectively all of which is pretty great but is anyone else feeling like something's missing like look over the spec tables again it's going to be kind of familiar maximum of 16 cores same boost clock same cash mostly the same TDP yeah IPC is up or instructions per clock so we're going to get more performance but does this feel a little bit like the Habit that Intel got stuck
in during the years between the 2000 "series and 7,000 Series where each" generation gave us modest speed increases or IPC increases and not much else I mean to be clear up to 16 cores is great compared to where Intel left us with four but there's something much more important missing here ryzen 3 I mean AMD strategy of selling their last gen product for a discount is an okay option for gamers and enthus and certainly amd's pocketbook I mean you can't blame them for wanting to get the
most possible back on their R&amp;D investment but it just stings a little knowing that unless you're one of their most affluent customers you're not going to be able to take advantage of the IPC and the power efficiency gains on this generation at least not if things keep going the way they are so I guess I've got a bit of a challenge for AMD guys it's easy to be the hero for Budget Gamers when your products aren't good enough for you to charge more but can you be better than Intel now that you're
the ones on top cuz it really doesn't seem like it at the moment case in point the top end first gen thread Ripper launched at $999 now even the cheapest one costs more than "1,400 that is where performance" leadership has gotten AMD and it smells like complacency I hope it's not the case but I'm starting to feel like we need intel to step up their game to keep AMD motivated to deliver better products for gamers rather than the other way around changing gear somewhat abruptly
AMD also announced their ryzen AI 300 series so Windows 11 recall is coming to x86 so woo sorry that was about as enthusiastic as I could pretend to be about that with 50 tops of neural processing compute these new chips are capable of the newest AI features and they were very clear about this they are doing it without emulation a roundabout acknowledgement that arm might be more competitive on Windows than they might have hoped they also made bold performance claims about General non AI
Computing performance saying that they could beat Apple silicon M3 in many workloads though it's tough to make an Apples to Apples comparison there and then against Intel I'm not even sure they see core Ultra as a competitor especially against anything that utilizes amd's Radeon 800 series integrated gpus AI or not AMD looks like they may be the better option for performance battery life and thermals as long as you don't mind paying the AMD tax through the grape vine I've heard that pricing for these
upcoming stricks mobile chips is going to be pretty friendly that is to amd's shareholders in other good news for those folks AMD unveiled their epic Turin lineup which seems destined to capture even more market share from Intel's Bel leaguered data center division just like its predecessors did it boasts up to a truly daggering 192 cores and 384 threads on a single CPU and while they didn't show any specific performance numbers for that particular CPU in the teaser AMD is claiming a 2
and2 to 5.4 times performance lead over Intel's Emerald rapid xeons depending on the workload I mean it's kind of a foregone conclusion that you're going to win when you have twice as many corses the competition but still impressive nonetheless seems like Intel's main selling point for the data center product seems to come down to manufacturing capacity at this point unless they've got an ace up their sleeves that uh I don't know about all of these new products are going to be
hitting shelves starting in July which is very exciting news for amd's customers but in spite of that I'm not going to be making the same bold statement predicting that their stock with Skyrocket that I did 5 years ago while they have somewhat ridden the wave of AI excitement and may continue to do so I mean they did announce new GPU products as well as a one-year Cadence for AI processor refreshes I just don't know if I believe that they can close the gap against Nvidia though I do hope
I hope for a message from our sponsor pulseway what would you do if you were out of the office and a critical service on one of your systems crashed I mean you could drive in and try and sort things out that way but with pulse way it could be so much simpler you'll get a notification on your phone letting you know something went wrong and you can fix it right there and that even assumes that you have't already set up pulseway automations which can just sort it out for you in the background also if you
want more control over system patches you can tell pulseway what where and when you want them to go through pulseway does it all and on flexible terms including a commitment free pay as you go option and exclusively for our viewers they're offering 40% off of all of their plans so start your free twoe trial using the link in the video description if you guys enjoyed this video maybe go check out the one from 5 years ago let me know how close do you think I got it
