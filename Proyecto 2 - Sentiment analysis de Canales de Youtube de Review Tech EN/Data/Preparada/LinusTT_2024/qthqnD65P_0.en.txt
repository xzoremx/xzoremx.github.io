and welcome to the WAN show we've got a great show lined up for you guys this week no for real we actually we say that every week every single week we say that but today we don't mean it today we have a great show lined up for you um there's a Wi-Fi takeover attack vulnerability in Windows and all windows users have been warned to update now there there is a mitigation there's a mitigation now but you should update your windows now if you are if you're out of date this is
one of things like dude what was the one blaster this is like blaster on Windows XP where like you know if you've got a if you you're installing off of a disc okay you're installing off of a disc do you do you remember this I don't remember this dude if you installed Windows XP off of a disc like non-service pack Windows XP at uh post Blaster you're and you had your ethernet cable plugged in you would be completely destroyed before you even could install antivirus yeah it was crazy it was crazy
all right what else we got this week oh  no we're going to be talking about this dude I have no excuse I'm going to have to switch to an iPhone really I mean what do I have what excuse do I have left I don't know so we're going to be talking about WWDC what else we got this week uh YouTube is testing serers side at injection you heard it here first it's over uh not really but you know it is what it is also the nas software that you've been kind of uh teasing for a long time we
have some news it's not here but we have some news we definitely have an update for you guys so that's the NZ software that I've invested in to as kind of like um well I think of myself as an angel regardless of whether I'm investing in something or not but I've definitely taken on the role of angel investor in the sense that I was like here's a bushel of money have fun create the thing yeah yeah or  don't oh we are matching shirts oh my   intentional the show is brought to you
today by MSI grammarly and vessie and of course our chair partner secret lab why don't we jump right into our first topic of the week which is of course the Wii takeover attack that has got all windows users being warned to update now Microsoft has confirmed a new and pretty alarming Wi-Fi vulnerability in Windows which has been rated 8.8 isn't that great out of 10 in terms of severity using the common vulnerability scoring system the vulnerability assigned as cv-20 24-30 78 very memorable does not require
an attacker to have physical access to the targeted computer although physical proximity is needed since it uses Wi-Fi and exploiting this vulnerability can allow an unauthenticated attacker to gain remote code execution permissions on the impacted device that's bad that's super bad so they can just execute code very bad very bad all window all windows versions what do you mean by all windows versions you mean like 10 and 11 you don't mean 95 do you because I don't think that has Wi-Fi could you make that
work somebody's probably somebody's probably done it don't don't don't tempt them yeah hack a day and those people you know what those people do they said it couldn't be done so I so I committed six years of my life to getting working like Apple Air tag find my support on Windows 3.1 like we we know we that's I believe you I believe you do something productive I think it's like all reasonably modern um what do you mean those people I you know who I'm talking I did read a warning somewhere that they
were saying if you're running like not currently supported versions of Windows that you might want to you know upgrade your windows because those are also impacted o so this is big update I was kind of B update conspiracy the a lot of this a lot of this kind of especially the like advice from Microsoft it's just like actually I I suspect it's less conspiracy theory and more not giving a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about it's like yeah we told you it wasn't supported come on figure it out get on with it but
you could tell there's a felt like there's a little bit of come on come on in the waters you can move the Windows button over to the left and bring back the show the desktop thing come on in the search sucks and there's ads everywhere oh my God you got wrecked with that I heard it happen I'm not going to spoil anything else about scrapyard Wars 9 but I was searching for dude what no dude what was I searching for I was doing a similar thing it was some application that I need it was it frame View
no no no no no no no I was trying to turn off sleep yeah yes I searched for sleep in Windows search I remember what you got too dude no you you didn't see my screen though no but I heard you it literally wasn't even there it was not one of the results so I searched for sleep and pressed enter Because you know that should probably bring up you know power control and sleep and all that and it would have back in the day and it would have back in the day and instead it loaded up Sleep Country [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
Canada which is a terrible terrible website why buy mattress anywhere else bad mattresses because there's better deals and better mattresses maybe exactly got them that was funny though we were instructed to do that at the same time I type in sleep and at the same time I hear Sleep Country [Laughter] Canada that was so good that was one of  it's going it's going to put a lot of pressure on our editors  ever I I season 4 has a pretty special space in my heart it's going to Rod
right yeah it's going to be tough it is the best season ever okay it's it's you haven't seen my side yet no and even just seeing my side is going to be very strong so like I could see it I just you know Season 4 is kind of a little special to me at least I don't know it is the best season ever all right um I'm I'm very excited and and you know what the the editing team's going to do a great job and I'm not worried about that um there's a few moments and again I won't go into them but there's a few
moments especially synchronized moments that I think are going to be insane to see in the edit like just absolutely nuts to see in the edit and there's like not one there's a few so yeah yeah it's going to be great all right so let's continue on with this yeah Microsoft has confirmed that with no special access conditions or extenda circumstances none of those are needed apart from the proximity requirement an attacker could expect repeatable success against the vulnerable component Microsoft also
warrants that an attacker requires no authentication as a user before exploiting this vulnerability nor any access to settings or files on the victim's machine before carrying out the attack furthermore the user of the targeted device does not need to interact at all there is no link to click no image to load no file to execute now I wanted to add at the end we're not Security Experts nope especially not me Jake sent this in the infrastructure chat like 20 minutes before we went live and I was just like
this is breaking news that looks serious if you're interested in this you should find like Security Experts online or something and read what they have to say about it we don't know much about it we just read it right before the show thanks Forbes whatever just go update your system come back if you want to learn more check somebody else out that's it um should we move on to WWDC just Dive Right In um or do you want me to do a topic while you do that I can do that no let's
Dive Right In all right WWDC as even as as a relatively low uh how would I describe myself as a light uh Apple ecosystem dabbler you know I I've used the devices I mean I people forget this it's it's amazing how many people think I'm just like some kind of apple hater and I and I hate the company and I hate their products or whatever well when you're using this now you'll be an Android Hater I I know right I daed the iPhone 4 for like long 3 or 4 years I daed the iPhone 6S for
over a year I was going to say a bit yeah yeah for quite a long time um I've never gotten into Mac OS like that's that's never really been my jam there's stuff I need to do like I have work to do um and Mac OS is great for certain things especially especially with apple silicon like the battery life has been there's been nothing comparable on the window side at least not yet um I'm a little jelly of MacBooks right now I did I don't know I don't know if it's in the dock but I saw that there's some early
Snapdragon Elite or Snapdragon X Elite benchmarks that are looking not as exciting as as we might have hoped which is really disappointing so I'm I've been kind of getting hyped and now I'm like a little more cautiously maybe I hope to be optimistic at some point anyway um we we just really haven't had a response to that but other than that I there's there's nothing that really draws me into Mac OS and being in uh being in the industry that we're in which is kind of a lot of
different Industries like we do some media which Mac is super friendly for but we also do some uh maker stuff which Mac is super a lot less friendly for like I don't think solid works is supported at all and that's something that we have multiple teams that rely on so it's just like if we're going to be on an ecosystem we have to be on something that we can all be on otherwise we're supporting this like random random mix and we actually are supporting a random mix we are these
days but it's relatively limited on the Mac side and not going to lie it is pretty annoying uh we're we're working on making it less annoying it is possible for it to be less annoying um but even like our our like Remote Management stuff we like basically need another system for Apple you basically need two systems so even as a light user the only Apple product that I daily drive today is my airpods Pro twos even as a light user uh WWDC was legitimately very exciting this year so uh we have a full
video on WWDC so we're not going to go through absolutely everything but the team did put together a bullet list of kind of everything that Apple announced and bolded are the ones that they suspect that I will be most excited about we kind of glossed over it in the video a lot of things bolded but dude T9 dialing oh I didn't actually hear about that all right right so they're catering to you specifically someone at Apple finally listened and you know what I don't think
it has anything to do with me I'm not I I I don't actually have a big enough ego to think that someone at Apple was like I've been doing this a lot this show so far let's win over the Canadian someone yeah let's let's bring him into the fold it's time you know I I I don't actually think that happened but what I do think has happened at Apple and what a lot of these things feel like to me is of an attitude adjustment okay these are all things the things that I'm most excited about so the ability to really
though actually for real customize your home screen layout yeah and put an icon anywhere you want it shouldn't I don't feel like it should be that huge to me but it's huge to me my my home screen has always been almost blank and it's important to me to be and dude I am not going to put stuff I need to interact with at the top physiologically it doesn't make any sense for me because I have small hands and I can't reach it I can reach the bottom everything I need to do frequently there you go is in the
bottom right so that's where my email is that's where Chrome is that's where my okay I have a folder called social that contains things like teams because I don't have a real social life I just have my paid friends uh but but so like media social navigation storage and docks uh email Chrome that's all there and then everything else that's kind of out here is stuff that I need once in a while and so the way that iOS worked where I just had to like stack up garbage or put uh unnamed folders to to
take ups oh so stupid it's just such an unnecessary completely asinine workaround and you guys won't have to hear me whine about it ever again because Apple has finally just acknowledged that the only reason they weren't doing it was just user hostility and outright stubbornness like it just had it had nothing to do with that this was difficult or something they couldn't do it was just because they didn't feel like it and it was the same way with T9 dialing there was I've talked about this
before and I get it you Johnson you don't understand T9 dialing and that's fine it doesn't matter you can just not [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] use it because it's not in the way because T9 dialing doesn't get in your way you can continue to type on a keyboard like a caveman instead of using T9 dialing like uh I don't know um whole man you know well I mean look they both existed at the if anything if anything  Advanced but the point is that oh man T9 dialing doesn't impact your ability to
search for a contact with your keyboard it doesn't matter you can continue to do that but it's something that I've said time and time again an a skilled Apple developer could literally Implement in probably an afternoon plus all the time it takes to validate all the other stuff but in terms of the actual development of that feature it is negligible by modern standards it would be very fast and the only reason that they haven't done it is just I don't know because Android has that feature and I don't
know having something that Android had first except that half the things that they do Android had first so I so I've just I've never been able to understand it um but it's great it's freaking awesome it's so much faster it means that you don't have to program favorites you don't have to uh you don't have to remember anyone's number you just start dialing their name you don't dial the number so so you Martha who doesn't understand what T9 dialing is I've tried so many times to explain it and had
people argue with me that it's slower and I'm just like I actually can't anymore like you've just you've not listened and now you're you're yammering at me and this is not a real conversation because you haven't heard a thing that I've said um so it's really really exciting to me but but what's exciting to me about those two things in particular is those are two things that Apple absolutely knew they absolutely knew that competing platforms had them they absolutely knew that they were easy
to implement and they absolutely knew that their users wanted them yeah so they knew all of these things they're not intrusive to users that don't want them exactly they knew all of those things and they didn't do them because I don't know F you that's why that's the only reason I can think of um and here they are and here they are at the same time and here they are alongside a whole bunch of other really cool stuff that basically eliminates any reason that I would need to stay on it I shouldn't say
any reason side loing is still a huge one for me but eliminates almost any reason that I would need to stay on Android I respect that being an important reason do you actually do Sid loing I actually need it there is one stupid smart home appliance that I have that is not approved for sale in Canada ah I imported one from the UK and because I'm on a Canadian App Store and Play Store account with a Canadian credit card I cannot install the app for it unless I side sideo it that's
frustrating yeah so no side loading does matter unless it doesn't to you in which case that's great but if you do need it you do need it y um don't tell me what I can and can't install on my phone if I get the thing and I decide I'm going to you know take the risk and use this thing that is not for sale in my country then I'll then I'll use it it's not up to you um so that that's that's definitely something that's holding me back but man this is great RCS support RCS is coming so it really does feel not
like just some stuff that they're doing to you know think differently and and be apple about it this really feels like oh crap the legislators are coming not coming they have come the legislators have come it's time for us to appeal to our users in a we don't have you held hostage anymore um stuff that you want here it is here it is here it is be so happy about this and remember iPhone remember iPhone is great and all this that is good and it really is it's really good this looks awesome
chat GPT integration um you know that's cool the fact that apple is paying for it so you aren't paying any more than what you're paying for your shiny ey device or your iCloud subscription or whatever else so if Siri can answer the question she'll answer the question and apple actually has some of that running locally which is super super cool and then if it's too complicated for Siri then it'll fall back to chat GPT and if if you have a paid chat GPT account you can bring some of your paid features
over but otherwise it's just free I don't yeah I don't think Apple's actually paying for it um I think just like no one is um I think Apple is is paying in quotes through distribution not cash paying an exposure sorry sorry sorry excuse me uh so whatever the compensation is if you want like Advanced features you do have to pay yeah yeah so but in terms of the basics Apple has sorted it out and you will basically get uh I think they're using GPT 4 Omni yes as far as my
understand goes so you'll get the you'll get the latest chat GPT which is super cool uh they've got clean app AI photo object REM yeah the photos app redesigned so it's now a lot more similar to Google photos which is legitimately really great um let's see what else we got you canap Yap app locking and hiding oh app locking and hiding is super cool what's that you can you can basically um you can basically have apps hidden so that if a different user is using the device um they they
don't even know that it's installed and no notification will pop up so the joke we made in the video was uh like if I had grinder and I didn't want yvon to see it um then I could I could like lock that I could hide that app entirely and even media that that a different user though oh cuz this is not okay this is for this is on ipados Yeah okay or and iOS actually it's not phone I was still thinking phone and if I handed if I handed it to my kids or whatever then can I can lock away certain apps which
is super cool that is cool um the iPad calculator is super cool might want like Reddit or um Twitter places where things might get posted that are you don't neily want  see what else we got here a Mac OS yeah the iPhone mirroring thing on Mac OS is super cool it's like kind of like a remote desktop is thing you can like take take phone calls and stuff um what else we got window tiling yeah Mac OS is looking a little bit better yeah they finally have like suggestions for window
layouts when you when you drag the thing over that's nice yeah it's like that's what I'm talking about though it's stuff that just obviously should have been there a long time should have been dealt with ages ago and they're just like it's like they're just it's like the entire team is just assigned to finding those things that people have been whining about for 10 years and just just get it done just get it done so cool someone mentioned in terms of like the app loocking oh took with some
antitrust antitrust is good man uh someone mentioned along with the app locking thing that like banking apps um and any if you if you have like uh some form of I don't know I was going to say government apps I can't think of any that are currently active but I know like the co passport stuff was a thing for a while uh you can have those locked down that's pretty nice someone pointed out yes taking phone calls your Mac has been a thing for like a decade with what is it continuity or whatever it is um
yes but the the the like the the basically just having like your iPhone just be like a little thing it's pretty cool mhm so yes you could take a phone call but you could also do like anything else um I have to imagine that they're using a lot of the same work that they did for the Vision Pro for like desktop projection mean now that everything's running on the same the same silicon essentially um so someone said oh where' it Go Safari reader mode is Crazy by the way it will it will like deemphasize the
unimportant parts of a page whoa yeah so it's like not add block but it's essentially Linus Vision it's like a it's like a focus mode that's pretty cool actually yeah I might actually use that because I use my have I told you my three paragraphs trick what is your three paragraph trick whenever I open an article I always skip the first three paragraphs if it's like in if I'm in like my Google news feed and I click on something I immediately scroll three paragraphs down because it's like it when when the
article title is like something that I'm interested in the first three paragraphs are almost always fluff because they want you to scroll down to get through the ad makes sense so I just skip them and go right through it and the I find the the third or fourth paragraph is usually when they start hitting the like meat of the article um Macky Bean full ping shot said for Windows snapping Mac OS couldn't do that before because Microsoft actually had a patent there's got to be ways
yeah I'm sure they could have figured out around suggested layouts not actually window snapping that's a way that you could think of to work around it right yeah and that and they're doing it now patents expire after what like 15 years or something like that it hasn't been that long so they clearly they clearly figured it out yeah got be ways man so cool oh there's unannounced but discovered in the iOS ios8 beta voicemail notifications including transcription that's nice custom
charging limits 8200 % something that just should have been a thing like back when they had that whole debacle around the batteries degrading they should have launched that at the same time it should have just immediately been a thing there's absolutely no reason for it to have not been a thing um flashlight beam pattern adjustment okay that's super cool uh visual side button press indicators U mixed language keyboards for example Spanglish okay that's super cool seriously um yeah I'm I'm sure we
could talk about a lot more of this stuff guys you can watch the video you can watch like all the bajillion videos and articles covering it but for me really what I wanted to talk about on W show was apparently it's been 15 years Windows snapping was announced in 2009 yes Windows snapping but Apple's had just the like side to side one for a while okay it's the like multiple layout suggestion one that I think came with Windows 10 as a power toy first and then was integrated something it was it was
not as long ago okay yes window Aros snap has actually been 15 years um that was that was launched with Vista if I recall correctly uh yeah I know right the the weird one that I was discussing with someone last night um is 2015 is only 6 months away from being  ago crap yeah a we that's a weird one stop it yikes oh yeah um but yeah yeah the the the attitude shift that seems to have taken place here just the fact that so many of these things are things they could have done five or 10 years ago uh
oh sorry they had split screen but not snapping I had to buy an app called magnet to enable window snapping um I look either way fine fine either way doesn't change the point the point is they're finally addressing things that have been clear deficiencies that their users have wanted them to address for very long time while also doing cool Innovative Apple things like the satellite text messaging thing is so cool that could be a literal Lifesaver an actual Lifesaver um awesome I I love
it they briefly overtook Microsoft as the world's most valuable company uh but lost the lead before close apparently love it I'm excited I I I I'm you know what I'm going to do it I'm going to try I'm I'm going to I'm going to daily well look I've been looking for a new phone for a while you've been what is that note 9 yeah yeah for how long uh ever since I dropped my fold in the pool Dan has my fold now how's the fold treating you Dan it's good I um I'm traling it with my dad actually really
your dad's using it that's right how does he like it I think he likes it a lot uh he uses the fold not very often though yeah that was my thought as well I have technically two folding phones now and eh you just so you just have like a double thick phone for no reason basically what it ended up being H yeah I don't know I think uh lonus you had a better use case for it where you could have scripts and chat kind of simultaneously while doing production and stuff like that right I didn't
really use it for that that much I mostly opened it up to like read articles yeah yeah exactly especially because so many modern sites have so many ads on them that on a candy bar form factor you like can't actually read the article like complet breaks it so there's that anyway I've been looking for a phone for a while and you guys suggested very stupid things to me unfortunately well one of them wasn't that stupid one of them was the LG Wing was a very stupid suggestion but the
fairphone 5 wasn't stupid until it was super super underpowered and had just like gamebreaking bugs like the fact that the the ringer volume could only be earsplitting or completely off which just doesn't work for me uh okay um so this might be it then I might just go iPhone it's fun do it for a while but I it didn't feel like it was ready you keep going back to the pixel yeah I never want to and I know you hate it every time and then you just like keep going back it's like what kind of relationship is this
that you're in I think this time I if I if I had to do it again I probably would have gone with an Experia actually but I realized that like months after the fact not not shortly after the fact like months after the fact I'm going to convert you trying other people just quietly has pretty great phones um Sony has a lot of quiet everything yeah nobody seems to really care over here well I I had an Experia a long time ago and I really like so much I'm I'm the one North American who
actually cares Dan okay okay Dan he's got me pretty so when when this finally goes down the tank which hopefully not for another like couple years but um I I suspect it'll be iPhone versus xeria oh yeah and tap to cash in Apple pay looks sick yeah it's like splitting splitting bills forget about it like how how how was that not a thing like the fact that genuinely pretty cool isn't the animation like sick too that was one of those things that I'm not sure I haven't actually I I I saw an animation of
something and I thought it was that but I'm not sure and it looked really cool that was one of those things that just killed me when like almost 10 years ago someone told me uh no it couldn't have been 10 years ago it was a long time ago it was between 5 and 10 years ago someone was like yeah in some ways China's behind but in other ways North America is laughably behind and one of those ways was contactless like cashless payments they were like yeah you can buy a banana with like WeChat for 15 cents
and just like there's no fees and like it's F I mean you know the government is watching you but other than that just the convenience of just pulling out your phone and being like yeah I'll yeah I'll take one banana from like a roadside vendor and this was this was back when when I don't even think Apple pay existed here yet so it was just like the Dark Ages essentially you know you were you were still pulling out your credit card and like swiping a magnetic strip whenever you went down to the States
like at least you guys support pins now brutal yeah that was that was ridiculous like we had pin authentication for like years take your card though they'll they'll take your card go to the machine plug it in bring you the machine fun why did you do that part this is uncomfortable let me I don't know anyways uh you know who's not happy about this stuff Elon Musk Elon Musk was furious at the news of a partnership with open AI immediately threatening to ban the use of Apple devices at his companies even
by guess what why because well he tweeted an image to explain uh if you check it out on X I will share my  because you're giving all of your data  AI but I think maybe he doesn't understand or maybe I don't because I think it's opt in right because you because it's not like apple doesn't have their own AI stuff he uh he knows that like like like Tesla has had more user data scandals than open AI right well open hasn't lasted for very long been around for very long but he knows that Teslas have
been pretty big quite egregious watching People's videos yeah like uh because you have you have all your cameras in your Tesla and there's been uh Tesla employees caught just watching People's videos and stuff yeah like not good not and then and not just watching them but like sharing them on like internal discords and stuff like group chats sorry their internal sorry their internal group chats um like he he knows that right yeah kind of weird I don't he knows that I think it's
just because of his like ongoing war with open AI so he's just trying to like make noise you see the you see the lawsuit apparently some Tesla shareholders are mad that he created a competing AI company when Tesla was supposed to be his AI company like I could see that it's it's almost like he's been this way all long and the fact that you didn't notice is kind of on you um I'm sorry I I know that I've been kind of branded as an Elon hater but to me his character has been on full
display for a very very very long time uh the big turning point for me that made it just so obvious and I'm so sorry if if this wasn't obvious but um it it it just it is to me because of the space that I work in um and the thing that made it so OB obvious to me was when they dissolved their uh their press relations for Tesla yeah because it was it was after a streak of just sort of uncomfortable questions that their press relations had had to answer where he basically made a statement without
making a statement that he was accountable to nobody and didn't have to answer anybody's questions and um dissolved it and I was like okay well that tells me everything that I need to know about you you think you are not accountable and it's been so clear in basically everything he's done since then that he thinks he's not accountable you know that might have been the worst move that he could have done uh at all because I feel like if there was someone in front of him he'd probably be doing a
lot better right now cuz I think a lot of the like downturn of uh public perception of and public perception of some of his companies has largely been due to honestly just his Twitter usage if he just like didn't tweet things I bet you people would still think he was a God but anyways um moving on I guess I think we're done yeah um YouTube testing server side ad injection according to reports YouTube is now inje injecting ads directly into video streams to try to defeat ad blockers YouTube has been
using client side ad injection where the ad and video are delivered separately to desktop and mobile clients and the player is programmed to pause the video at certain points to play the ad now YouTube is experimenting with serers side ad injection which places the ad directly into the video stream before the content is delivered to the viewer and if it's like a mid video ad just sort of at the same time right it's acting as if it's the normal video feed so it's you can't detect it that way 
plane ads yeah remember when we had talked about having a free tier I have big memories of this we had a conversation you were like yeah basically like a lot of our savviest audience and that's going to be a lot of the people who are most dialed in who are going to be a lot of the people who subscribe on float plane are just going to use ad blockers anyway so there's like no hope and I was like but like what if we could just what if we could just encode several versions of the
video with like the various campaigns we're running right now and obviously that's a super rudimentary like stupid way to do it and you were basically like yeah but the processing and storage are going to be ridiculous and this is something that could conceivably work but one of the challenges is that if it's encoded into the video they could just use the slider to skip it which is something that you know for all of its faults the other way of serving ads does not allow we had this like whole
conversation about it um and to be clear I'm not I'm not imagining that I invented this idea but it was funny to me to see that YouTube is now testing a feature that we had a conversation in our like crappy boardroom about that would have been a long time ago seven years ago I remember like bits of this I I I I remember enough to like know that it definitely happened I just don't remember the conversation super super clearly um but yeah that all makes sense this this sounds like effectively the
same thing but more sophisticated cuz it's probably like um just in time setup jit instead of like trying to transc the whole thing ahead of time um so they can like insert it that way uh but anyways it's it's interesting to the technical side of me um but yeah so they're they're experimenting with doing server side ad injection which places the ad directly in the video stream before the content is delivered to the viewer this makes most forms of ad blocking harder not impossible but harder many ad
blocks work by disabling the javascripts that inject the ads into the video stream obviously this switch will affect that functionality if it works that way it's not going to work at all incidentally this also affects sponsor block um oh as they take User submitted data about where the sponsor segments are located in YouTube videos this extension offsets timestamps to skip the sponsored content but the varied length of integrated ads will affect the length of the offset and affect its ability to
crowdsource accurate and precise data this is what I was saying the the idea that we had inter or you had would have actually worked with sponsor block cuz the idea was to like bake these things in but if they're doing this in like a just in time format where they have the video file but they're streaming stuff ahead of it right um or or like along they're just like picking different chunks and I might be misusing just in time because I don't know exactly how they're doing this so I might be saying
the wrong thing but they're doing it a little bit more live than than the plan that we had um which is going to mean that it's not the same for every single user every single time you're going to get different ads which means that things like sponsor block will will  now I'm sure there are I can think of ways that they could still make it work mhm because if you can detect what ad is playing mhm you might be able to have some data on how long that ad lasts the solution is going to be the same
solution that everyone is using these days AI oh yeah you could recognize an ad you could recognize self-promotion so the whole thing could just be man that that oh wait wait wait wait wait yeah so you could wait no at the very best though all you could really do is just like like like blank it out so it could be kind of like you could just you could effectively like turn off your TV while uh while YouTubers are promoting their merch or while while an ad is running and then it could like come back on kind
of thing because you wouldn't be able to like you could get the chunk analyze the chunk be like bad chunk and then just like I would I would love a like crab Rave ad blocker so like any anytime it detects an ad it just like play crab R it' be so annoying but it would be so funny well you heard about how bad lonus Le development was it was nothing compared to luk Le development yeah we are working on that  funny oh man anyways uh this doesn't this doesn't make ad blocking possible
as we've been kind of discussing ad blockers could still function using detectable metadata and UI elements like a clickable ad link um or a variety of other things or even like yeah I'm thinking like User submitted like hey this ad that looks like this plays for this long long skip whatever blah blah blah uh discussion question at what point do you think youtube/google will be satisfied with their levels of ad block if the platform is able to defeat ad block what do you think the effects
on the platform and user base will be one thing that would be really interesting about sponsor Block in particular to me is I think it would cause a bit of a change in the YouTuber sponsor read meta CU right now I think that a lot of Savvy users are just skipping it um and so some channels in particular have like really long or like um like really long placements like right at the beginning of the video and stuff like that and I'm I'm just wondering a minute and a half right at
the beginning is one that I saw recently crazy and so I just I look at stuff like that like ours have always been designed to be easily skippable um so the first one is about 10 to 15 seconds which is supposed to be one tap of uh either a double tap with your thumb on your phone or of the arrow key on your keyboard um and then our intro is I think about 8 seconds so basically two is supposed to just skip you through it um and then our ending one is supposed to be such that
the well the video is over who cares just navigate away or sometimes we'll put a little bit at the end to reward the people who you know watch the sponsor integration but um it's supposed to be pretty easily skippable it's been really fascinating lately you can kind of you can kind of follow Trends and audience sentiment towards things because we've been doing that method for n years or something like that where we've like we've had the two spots we've had a short one at the beginning and
then a longer one at the very end and um I'll I'll see I'll see sometimes an uptick or a or a downturn in comments about it oh L got two sponsors of video or people will be like completely fine with it and and it's it's it seems to be more related to what else is going on on the platform and just how generally ad saturated people are compared to anything to do with us changing anything cuz we really haven't um but I would be I would be I would be very interested to see if this made
Behavior like the you know minute and a half at at the beginning of the video just kind of go away because I don't know what percentage of people even use extensions like sponsor block but I suspect it's I suspect it's reasonably High I mean see it talked about a lot I don't think yeah I don't know yeah I have no idea I'm just I don't see it talk that much I see it around but not that much I don't think I don't think  block yeah that's and I think it's pretty majorly like just the Youtube
Hyper audience not like like Norm's no ad block I don't think Norm's no sponsor block is what I'm trying to  um Dan what else are we supposed to be doing let to merch oh it's merch messages time hey why don't you uh hey if you have sponsor block why don't you just skip this part except I actually think it's the most interesting part of the show so get [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] wrecked I guess yeah um all right what are we doing Dan oh wait should we talk about like a reason you might want to like do a merch
message oh right that is what we're supposed to be doing uh if you're new to the show it's merch message time that's right don't leave a Super Chat don't leave a twitch Bick or whatever they're called twitch bit um I know twitch B it's like a purple Bick yeah it's a pen um don't leave a twitch bit or whatever just leave a merch message go to LTT store.com and in the cart you'll see a little box when we're live for a merch message merch messages go to our producer Dan there he is ah so cool they
go to producer Dan who will reply to them or forward them to someone who can answer your question or just pop them up on the bottom or curate them for me and Luke to reply to you we''ve got a couple of things going actually we've got one thing going on on the store this week if you have like a a baby shower coming up or just you know you've got a friend who's having a kid sometime soon or had one recently we've got a bundle going right now so you can pick up the ABCs of gaming board book which is one of the
highest rated items on the store it is literally five stars almost across the board out of over 300 reviews there is one that is one star let's see probably didn't get it yeah nice uh it's basically five stars people love the ABCs of gaming and then you will also get or you can also get the wait why is it not in here I never okay we have a little bit of work to do on uh on our store uh is it a is it a plushy what what is the uh the shape order oh it's a miracle anyone manages just to buy it at
all okay there it is anyway uh shape sorter toy so this is this was painstakingly designed by one tin and stack to have unconventional shapes that's right who needs a circle and a square when you can have a laptop and a game controller and almost all of them will not go through the uh if I remember correctly there's only one that can go through a whole that it's not supposed to there's two if you like really if you like really find a way anyway the quality is great absolutely love this
thing again tons of five-star reviews overall Five Star product and if you buy these together you get free shipping for your entire order so if you're someone who needs to gift something fun and Tech related or just I don't know a gift for someone who's having a baby or had a baby recently and you wanted to pick up something else from the store then uh now is your excuse to pick up the ABCs of gaming board book and the shapes sorder toy and you will get free shipping on your whole order so you can
pick up what ever other stuff that you wanted to grab without paying for shipping that is worldwide my friends so enjoy it anywh who um do you want to show them how merch messages work Dan yeah sure so let's see what we've got here first one's up from Phillip morning lldd is there an ETA on any or any idea  pans uh yes I saw I think they're in production right now so that means less than 3 months but but more than one yeah yeah hey W.D over the years you've gotten to see some fairily
momentous Tech advances and Innovations looking back what are some severely under or overestimated oh man someone reminded me of uh a buzzword that we totally forgot about shoot now I forget Yeah in our AI is a live video we had like you know internet of things and yeah 5G you know some some of those Buzz words it's just like remember all the stuff they were telling us 5G was going to do and I was just like basically the I was looking at it going like yeah yeah okay I get it
it's like way more throughput and the latency is going to be way lower or something right but like how how's the latency going to be that much lower like it still has to like you know bounce off of there and relay over there and like isn't a lot of it just like switching time like it moves at the speed of light regardless of how many G's you have right um oh man Big Data that's the one remember Big Data well big data is a thing of course it is a thing yeah but like just
the way that okay the way that we were talking about it was so optimistic and what's funny is we're actually oh God yeah okay what's funny is we're actually finally some of that is finally coming to fruition like with machine learning right now oh yeah with llms um like that that that all that that data Gathering um seems to seems to be actually mattering finally but man the the the kind of I I remember I can't even remember what like stupid presentation I was in where they were basically like
yeah yeah big data is just going to like enable this and I was sitting here going like I mean we're all on like you know iPhone fives right now like it's not it's not going to do any of that stuff um yeah man Big Data Big Data was awesome uh what else did we what else did we what what what are some of the other like really funny ones 5G I'd say is has been the biggest flop cuz 5G I mean remember I don't think it changed anything remember when they changed the remember when they changed 4G to LTE
yeah so LTE stood for long-term something um stands for yeah what what long-term extensions or something long-term Evolution 5G could have absolutely just been part of long-term evolution and we could have just stopped calling things G's because as far as I can tell other than the millimeter wave stuff that functionally doesn't exist unless you happen to live like right next to right  it I'm sorry I don't see I don't see why it couldn't have just been yeah yeah LTE plus LTE Pro Max uh I just I don't I'm
sorry I don't I don't don't really get it it doesn't seem like 5G was was much of a change and it seems like the carriers agree because a lot of them are just popping up a little 5G thing on their on their branded phones when you actually only have an LTE connection cuz function functionally it doesn't make a difference for most I mean think about it for watching a YouTube video it's not like you need any more speed than 4G LTE anyway for uh accessing a web page I mean realistically your isp's DNS is
slower than the actual download speed like that's not the it's just not the issue I don't actually need it to be faster and man the stuff they sold us that 5G was going to do like it was going to enable autonomous cars I'm sitting here going like you can't you can't drive a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] car over a Cellular Connection I don't care you could have the world's most magical Cellular Connection you're not driving a car over it like get real please I'm try to find like um key features and benefits of 5G
technology here I'm G to find a 5G infographic yeah here we go here we go uh 5G fast it's dozens of times faster uh not an evolution 4G it's a full new mobile system connecting everyone using numerous Services connecting objects dozens of billions as if the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] a dozens of billions it's reactive for realtime Services connected cars online gaming so much this is just in internet envir environmentally friend what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are you talking about friender than what
reducing cost and energy consumption of what I don't know it's just it's just stupid solderless PCB edge launch connectors like what okay what does that  anything oh god oh man yeah oh yeah oh oh HD video internet of things only shows up on 5G there was no internet of things on any of the previous G's also this is amazing 2019 20 to 40 gbit per second what are you talking about what the heck so we didn't have HD video on 4G oh no yeah yeah yeah yeah 100% we we couldn't do
that also what does SMS have to do with  nothing oh Lordy that graphic annoys me yeah I know well they were basically all like that man like oh we're going we're going to have man remember connected cities and you know what eventually we're going to we're going to have that but 5G is going to be in the in the rear view mirror like way way back there by the time anyone is driving around in a functional connected City I I I 100% remember the the buzz word but I'm I'm trying to look up like what okay
connected cities draws its inspiration from something something it integrates Brownfield and Greenfield development into a unified what the vision is for compact highquality walkable developments focused around existing and new Railway stations groups of settlements some existing some new are linked using existing rail corridors and clustered around a hubtown together they form a connected City unhappy elf says this is a terrible take why did we go past 3G then uh okay that's not what he
was saying literally at all if you want I can take this one sure go for it so he wasn't saying that at all he wasn't saying we don't need more speeds he was saying they were promising the sun moon and stars when it was just faster internet um you weren't going to you weren't going to suddenly be able to do new crazy things we were already able to do those things yes it's just like a little bit faster and honestly when you're on your phone you very rarely need it it's nice it's good and you know
technology ever Marches On we will use it more and more over time now that it exists more apps and things that could use a little bit more bandwidth will probably do that this will also be part of an advent of probably lazier development we see this in a lot of different ways back when you had to fit everything onto a a CD or a cartridge there was a huge amount of effort going into making sure that you could fit as much as possible and now it's like well everything has massive ssds let's just
not care about how much data we're using at all that type of stuff anyways and nobody's making fun of it getting faster and better I said it could have just been it could have just been 4G long-term Evolution I mean we're making fun of buzzwords yeah not technological advancement technological advancement good yeah it's faster nice that's good buzzword nonsense that promises the sun moon and stars as as Luke very eloquently put it is is not good oh this wasn't on the doc but you just reminded
me of this and apparently you reminded it's silent in float plane chat as well we got to talk about cod cod yeah Cod salmon tuna you know the the 300 gig okay no that's I'm not even interested in that okay what I am interested in is the fact that not only is it a 300 gig game but you are going to be streaming textures constantly oh really you need you must be online okay but is that artificial in order to stream textures like game textures I do not understand so  okay I didn't I didn't know this part 
gigs it's probably all like uncompressed and like how how is this oh man I continuous texture streaming I remember this from earlier this week there was some like hilarious contradiction in all of this too I was man I'm trying to I'm trying to I'm cuz I think the texture streaming was to oh yeah I okay okay okay don't quote me on this but I think someone from somewhere Justified this by saying that the texture streaming like the always online requirement and the texture streaming
was to account for like like data limits and not making the 300 game 300 gig game bigger even bigger and it's like wa a second so your solution is that instead of downloading it once I'm going to be downloading it over and over again  me the only way that that logic makes any sense is if you know I'm never going to play the whole game is if you know your game is so bad I'm just going to play it for a little bit so that way I only streamed as much texture as I need I'm trying to figure
some some people have like monthly band with uh caps that are actually like difficult to deal with 300 gigs is apparently for the mesh data and they are streaming textures the mash data is 300 gigs I'm sorry but this is just like the am the amount of engineering a worst solution that goes on sometimes just blows my mind because they would have had dude they would have had to put so much work like they they probably built like a significant amount of data center think about how big a Cod game is and I don't
mean big like in gigabytes I mean big like in cultural impact how many people play a Cod game oh yeah streaming that kind of data to that many play like dude let me let me see dude they they quoted the monthly active players uh in in the just steam charts Cod has a lot of monthly active players I am blown away by this how is streaming the data over and over and over again a solution by the time I look at that rock six [Laughter] times no I'm serious though and okay it's it's possible that not all texture
data is streamed like it would be pretty asinine if like character models were streamed um yeah but like okay well okay here pitch Me Pitch me okay it's it's it's not 300 gigs but sorry ke yeah that's the whole pack or something like that I don't care differentes honestly I'm not I said I wasn't even mad about that what I'm mad about is this texture streaming nonsense so put your computer away put your we're having a conversation I'll put my computer away let's have a conversation
okay I am I am I am I okay I I'm the owner of like infrastructure expenses at Activision okay okay and I'm trying to sell this hold hold on hold on hold on no no okay okay just just let me get there okay so I I own infrastructure expenses I I want to manage infrastructure I want things to be as efficient and cost effective as possible okay okay name one texture in the game that I should put on my infrastructure for people to download over and over and over again instead of just once one
texture that that makes sense for uh I'll wait uh well the the the I got one okay a garbage can and Spider-Man no wait the DLC live shop the DLC live shop and all the new skins oh interesting okay so this would help them avoid having to do an update creep every single time pretty good there you go was that pre-informed Noe on the spot that's pretty good uh you know you play yeah got hundreds of skins yeah that's he wins a point there so much so basically this is a way for
them to advertise a lower install size you know I bet you they're going to that's 100% the reason they're going to do both you think they'll just if you if you've like streamed it enough times it'll just be like okay and it'll download a permanent copy I would like  this so my argument was going to be that we have the initial download size so someone can play the game uhhuh but then we we allow them to play more quickly we reduce a barrier to players getting into the game by allowing texture streaming
this is a thing already the problem and the reason why I didn't pitch this already is because the way that normally works is once you stream it to them they keep it and then you don't have to stream it to them again right because you you just allow downloading while the game's running this is like like blizzard has done this which I mean heavily related company blizzard has done this for a really long time you download like 40 50% of the game and then it is playable but they're like
you'll still have to stream some textures when you're in the game but when you're streaming those textures and other various things you just have them yeah and it's part of the game install so now so now this way oh Lordy this is so this is painful this actually hurts my brain yeah uh Dan is 100% right though that is the reason to do it I still feel like they'll make you do update when they do that though mcxl  billboards which is probably more accurate than what I said they're
probably both right to be complet well I I feel like I like Dan I think Dan should definitely get a point for it but it it'll probably be more like what you're talking about where it just still think they're going to make you update um and no I don't necessarily think they'll make you update though because they could just they could just feed that to you while you're lobby while you're loading in the lobby or whatever like they could just it doesn't have to be streaming streaming uh but it could
be but they want the store to be pristine the second you load the game they don't want the store to look bad because your internet connection is a little bit rough that's my yeah I'm not 100% convinced on the store they might be updating the store daily the Billboards would explain why it matters for single player though because in single player the Cosmetics wouldn't be relevant but Billboards and ads would be the reason why they would need you always online for single player
that's a thing right in COD uh I'm not sure I mean probably but who knows I don't know this is brutal dude yeah brutal a AWA 1992 says you guys please stop giving them ideas if they haven't had them yet trust me when it comes to ringing blood from a stone Activision has had the idea already and if they could patent it they would vented blood ringing machines blood ringing crucibles that's not what a crucible is but okay it's  any that sounds like the intro to some like fantasy movie yeah all right forged
in the ring of blood anyways what are we supposed to be talking about um I was going to give you one more merch message or we can move on up to you no sure do it yeah do it one more hey LDL what are your thoughts on the new thermos siphon developments for PC Cooling and is there any kind of cooling Tech you'd like to see or attempt to put in a PC uh thermos siphons are super cool we saw it initially with ice giant um they're apparently working on uh a more AO form factor um type of thermos siphon wait
Frost giant Studios dang it no I mean super cool but no um wow they are a very small company you can specifically search for them and they still won't come up neat well ice Giant's also like a really no offense very generic ouch got him uh anywh who ice giant is apparently working on some kind of prototype for a more AO form factor type thing I don't see anything on their site uh and knock to a showed off a thermos siphon that was in like an AO type form factor and uh was essentially
a pumpless AO but it uses face change so it's a thermos siphon um super cool if if they can achieve aiol like performance that would be amazing there's still going to be some challenges they'll be a little bit less flexible because they're gravity dependent you have to have the radiator above the CPU block uh otherwise you you  um yeah cool in terms of other cooling technology I mean I think we're going to see I'd love to see water cooling get cheaper but like I think it's gotten
about as cheap as it can get yeah uh I think we might see some Innovation though because of the amount of thermals and power that's going to be going through these data centers so we'll see like data center Innovation for cooling and then hopefully that'll trickle down to us I don't think it will cuz it's less about cooling the actual chips at this point it's more about cooling the the whole thing right I mean yeah oh the the fact that heat pumps like people I man I saw so many articles about heat
pumps over the last six months I'm just like yeah like who's buying an air conditioner these days just get get a heat pump I didn't I thought everybody knew that but I I don't know apparently this is like like whoa like uh like like big news six months ago I don't know I was I was super confused by it um cuz it was it's been like kind of common knowledge here maybe it's just cuz we're in this like temperate place where buying anything that's just air conditioning is like completely
worthless cuz you're going to use it like 3 weeks out of the year um right like so we were just like well yeah heat pump yeah something that can do both cuz you know we need like we need like two months of heating and like I don't know 3 weeks of cooling well used to be that way nowadays our Summers tend to be hotter but this when we need it we really need it but we don't really need it for usually that long um no big HVAC does want you to know about heat pumps FR big big big HVAC will install a heat
pump for you tomorrow gladly it looks almost the same um all right why don't we oh oh we've got a couple of things uh we have a float plane exclusive that is available for 48 hours over on lmg Clips so it is it is I guess semi-exclusive check it out guys uh you can if you are not subscribed at lg. g/ floatplane you can watch this float plane exclusive we have two float plane exclusives every week which is pretty cool this is Colton gets a float plane tattoo this one's from a
while back but we've got a lot of other really great exclusives on the platform I can show you some of the more recent ones here we go how do we test materials at Creator warehouse this one's apparently doing really really well Emily and Jonathan react to DC oh cool we've got all the stuff from Dan week last week Dan designs and builds a table Dan Suzuki Cappuccino uh we have actually a ridiculous amount of content like actually a ridiculous number of exclusive videos on
float plan now the library is huge and it's worth a subscription to float plane just to kind of watch some stuff and hey maybe you don't keep the subscription forever but go check it out there is good Lord so much to watch am I even done yet I'm not even done yet like it goes on and on and on okay there you go finally man look it's baby what are some of these it's baby L is doing flow plane exclusives wow crazy meet the team Colton kitching Potter yeah I know right look it's Baby Jake look at his baby face
anyway what am I supposed to be talking about yeah so we've got a preview over on lmg Clips um and we have two items remaining from the charity stream just two the Corsair 6500 X showcase build and the probably TSA approved regular prototype screwdriver at lm. charity leftovers all right Dan uh wait what are we supposed to be doing two more topics two more topics Luke what do you want to talk about I want to talk about uh I had it picked out already but I moved the script where did
it go n software update oh yes so I have to confess I have not looked through the package yet that's actually kind of fun I like that cool we have an update and screenshots from ashtech the company oh I said that right the company that is making hexos I mean no one's ever heard of them before so you are officially the way prounce it ashte if they say otherwise they are wrong have decided this it's a Nas software geared towards Tech enthusiasts and content creators current Curr being led by Jonathan
penoso and again if if he doesn't think that's how you pronounce it this just how you pronounce it now um and Eric Schultz with their mission being to ensure users have complete control over their data and privacy was actually spelled wrong in the dock there's two  pazo okay that does actually have a way  pronounced okay we're off to a great start in my defense there was a letter not there you know you know the amount of criticism I take over supposedly favoring the companies I invest in if this is any
indication decide that someone's last name is different and also their company  knows anyways anyways ah um their mission is uh to ensure that users have complete control over their data and privacy while filling a gap that delivers high performance and ease of use now you want jump to the photos and I'll keep reading sure I'll jump to the photos I do not  file oh wait no no I do oh that's so weird when I moused over it hold on this is so weird check this check this out
check this out okay so I Mouse over it it goes you do not have access to this file and then I clicked it and it was all there huh I don't know neat different account a bit yeah yeah it must it must have oh yeah yeah yeah okay I opened Drive in a different account that's definitely not logged on on this computer don't look at it you know why I said different account I bet cuz you saw over my shoulder that it was saw the  mhm anyways hexos is based on true nass scale as we can see on the login screen
which is I'm assuming what we're looking at now yeah uh which we use here at lmg TR scale not hexos yet at least um and then photo two ooh one downside people have brought up before is trass can feel a bit more geared towards CIS admins or people with more nass knowledge in general which is why hexos is aiming to help by making things as simple as possible while still allowing people to do more manual configuration if they feel it's needed um so this is like a wizard type of um
uh setup here so it's like here's our recommended configuration based on your avail devices you can totally configure them manually if you want but this is the recommended configuration so we've got an SSD pool uh one tab of usable storage and it explains in simple English one drive can fail without data loss and you know what nice that's okay because the advanced user doesn't need you to tell them it's raid one they can clearly see that I have two 1 tab drives and one can fail without data loss so
that's raid one good to know hard drive pool 32 terabytes usable one drive can fail without data loss we have five drives we are clearly running raid five or Raid Z1 sorry to use the uh to use the traz terminology it lays all of this out very clearly for me super cool yeah photo 3 photo 3 hexos will be supporting applications such as Plex Home assistant and more with simple oneclick installs where some Nas softwares require VMS to be started or Docker containers which I'm assuming you can still
do it just also has oneclick installs yep which is neat um and this is the main reason for this um the main reason for this from from what's up what's the purple button at the bottom say it says go to the dashboard yeah okay okay uh the main reason for this is that a lot of the configuration that you need to do for a Plex install or for a home assistant install would be the same on 99.9% of systems yeah so essentially all xos is doing is being like okay why don't we just like theate
of those things um it's not even just Nite it's just it's just um most people when they set up a Nas they just want to be able to V via SMB or whatever Apple uses these days they just want to be able to access their files on the network without faffing about with it or play some video it's it's not because they're super excited about the home lab necessarily not necessarily excited about the results of it yes and so why don't we just set it up so that it just works and if you want to Tinker with it
you can you absolutely can so um anyway okay photo four here we can see a sneak peek at the dashboard as as well with pretty basic information that most people would want at a quick glance they are still working on more and I have ashex word that I will be able to show off a beta version in a video pretty soon that's exciting but in the meantime if you're interested in the project you can head over to hexos hos.com to sign up for their newsletter and there's a note from Elijah that says
I'm building a Nas for my upgrade if they have a working beta in August I would be interested in Daily driving it if the company is ready very cool so um unique username in float plan says I hope there's a lot more to this not terribly impressed to be honest and that's fine yeah you can totally still use trz and it'll be awesome go for it yeah but they're not trying to beat tress but if I had if I had if I had a Creator come to us and say like hey I want to I want to set up a NZ uh this
the IDE idea here is that this will be sorry this will be simple enough that I'm not going to be on a call with them every single month helping them do an update or helping them set up a user share or helping them change their password or whatever but with the power and performance of Tres that's what it is and so if it's not for you it's not for you I have a spicy question yeah hit me how are they monetizing this I don't know yet hopefully somehow yeah because they'll need to somehow yeah they got to
make money um I I know they definitely have some ideas but the last thing that I'm going to do is like commit them to something I mean I think you I think you've had some idea from our conversations not on the W show of uh how uh how involved of an investor I am yes yeah yeah yeah I just I just notic I like jumped to the website and was like where's the pricing link and then I was like there is definitely not one yep yeah I'm sure they'll figure something out all right good luck to them yeah my
phone's blowing up hold on it could be something important one moment please yep no worries do you want me to do another topic um yes Roku makes some smooth moves permanently enables frame interpolation for some Roku TV owners on Roku OS 13 claim that action smoothing has turned on on their devices and there is no way to turn it off in the newly released Roku OS 13 Roku TV TVs now offer Roku smart picture that will optimize the image based on what content is being watched this is
activated motion smoothing for some users who never had access to the feature at all in the past interesting Roku has told users to use the expert settings menu in the TV but some users claim that they don't have the action smoothing option or access to the expert settings at all Roku has had a history of aggravating users with OS updates in March of 2024 they updated their TOS in a manner that locked you out of using their system unless you hit agree incredibly annoying if you already
bought the device you could decline the updated TOS by sending a physical letter to the company that included yeah they've they've been in the news for each person op kind of thing a couple times yikes dude yeah it's pretty brutal what did they change in the TOs while they added a clause of for forced arbitration yeah these guys are wild yikes oh Roku uh stop cheap TVs that um hate you yeah very cool just rather watching my phone um anyway the main reason I wanted to talk about this is it just kind of um I
thought it might might spark a conversation about products that materially change after you've purchased them and how that's not cool big Tech um in some cases we've had stuff taken away and then given back like some of the features that Google removed from their smart speakers when they were in um when they were in litigation with Sonos and then um ultimately put back but some of once that was resolved uh like that's not optional you guys and I don't really understand why um users why Regulators
aren't stepping in to make it clear that the features you advertise for the product are not optional yeah that's not like if I feel like it um the ability to turn off action smoothing is not optional if that was in the product when I bought it yeah or if it didn't even have that feature there's notes in here saying that it turned on action smoothing for TVs that didn't even have action smoothing so people couldn't turn it off because there wasn't in the settings cu  it like yikes dude yeah t tack uh
brought up Plex yeah we haven't worked  since wow it's been a while I feel like 2017 no no we've worked with them more recently than that hold on uh the last time we worked with Plex was in 2022 so it was about two years ago it was mid 2022 and basically I sent an email to our business team um that was pretty much this hold on I'm just going to zoom it ever no I'm not going to zoom it askar it whatever okay we don't have to show it yeah so I sent an email to our business team that was this and I was
like here's what they need to fix um here's what I'd like to see fixed and if we work with them again then they need to fix this and um we don't work with them again it's been two years cuz they're just too busy appealing to their shareholders by becoming more of a traditional streaming platform it's like okay I get it but that isn't what you sold me yeah and it doesn't seem like they're moving in a good direction no it really doesn't seem like it yeah yeah um more stuff there's more
things yeah what else you want to talk about Dan what are we supposed to be doing oh yeah I want to talk about this I want to talk about this games games games the whole topic is just called games games games multiple game announcement showcases just wrapped up and some of them were kind of huge actually uh the biggest ones include Sony state of Play Summer game Fest Xbox showcase which was kind of insane uh and Ubisoft forward some of the heaviest hitters revealed are doom the Dark Ages have you seen
that look sick looks sick it's like medieval Doom I have to confess I have never completed a doom game do you enjoy starting them at least I play it yeah I enjoy benchmarking them but I have the slight crack on benchmarking them I like Doom games um this one looks very cool in some of the stuff I've read about it it says like uh they wanted to go back so they they had they had some fun with some of the modern Doom games tons of bullets lots of movement stuff like that they wanted
to go back to an older kind of Trope of Doom where like every bullet matters it's a little bit slower oo so ammo ammo is in important again you have a shield um you have to kind of like play defensively and Counterattack and things like that see looks really interesting um Gears of War eay which I believe is like a prequel to Gears of War it looks really cool uh Perfect Dark it's probably a name you haven't heard in a little while been a minute um this one I know you know about cuz you sent it to
me ano uh 117 tax froma nice that looks great I love the theme love the theme yeah Roman anos sounds like sick awesome very excited I hope they don't even deviate a ton from what they're currently doing time to build some roads yeah let's go yeah really um Civ  question yes do we need another Civ game until it's been another couple thousand years and there's some new civilizations you know like okay okay it just hold on it just no it feels a little bit to me like Civilization has gone down the EA
Sports path where it's except there's no roster change no I don't agree okay that's not that's not not true that's not true they add game they change the gameplay every time they actually change it quite a bit I I um I just feel a little bit like I've seen enough Innovation on Civ and I don't I don't need another Civ I'm sorry I I think that's fair I play every Civ and have enjoyed every Civ Civ 6 has probably had the least incremental enjoyment out of any of the ones that have come out for
me personally um so I'm not like super hyped like I have been every time a Civ game has come out for Civ 7 but I would be very happily proven wrong and I'm very ready to probably enjoy it and I will almost certainly play it because I have always really liked Civ games um so6 is theme song slaps they all slap Baba yetu is like one of the best game songs ever uh anyways Dragon Age The Veil guard really really really really enjoyed Original Dragon Age and have never looked back uh personally but it
is what it is and many many many many many many many many more the Xbox game showcase was wild to watch because if I remember correctly every single game that was announced was also announced that it was going to be launched full feature on Game Pass day one which is like pretty wild um to me it sounds like a horrible step to a dark future to a lot of other people they're like Yay free games it is what it is um and there was other preview trailers for things like Star Wars Outlaws and stalker 2 heart of
Chernobyl which I'm really excited for uh but yeah which are either of you most excited about and if it's not stalker 2 why not yeah I'm really excited I didn't play stalker good game it was during the busy times of my life I was at NC at that time um and I was like building a career and I did game but I played left for dead and Team Fortress too based games I was I was one I was one of those I out of these what am I  for man I was like yeah I was like just  out it's going to either be stalker 2 or no17 I
think this is going to be surprising actually kind of stoked for Dragon Age really I have you watched the trailer I haven't oh is it bad that's a shame a lot of people think it's good I think it's bad I I loved Origins the like watered down barely even DND D Dragon Age that's not even not the first one oh oh I'm sad yeah I I I have had a hard time getting into Origins wait hold on yeah Dragon Age Origins I thought that was the first one I don't know is it I thought Origins
was like actually super good yeah was I don't know I thought it was good yeah that was just the first one though sure I don't know yeah that one's great whatever I anyway what I loved about what I what I loved about it was that it wasn't super hardcore um Origins was I mean look the only experience I had up to that point are you sure you're talking about Origins was I you talking about Inquisition or something no okay yeah this isn't a controversial opinion everyone liked
Origins everyone univers liked it's a yeah are you sure Origins is like yeah people like Origins I don't know I thought I thought people didn't like it cuz look look the only experience that I had with d and d style games before that was I tried to play Never winter nights 2 and I was like what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is this and I got confused and I like gave up and then I and then I played Dragon Age Origins thinking that like yeah I probably wouldn't get into it but I super got into it and it was awesome um
and it didn't it didn't seem that hardcore and I I I saw a lot of criticism of it at the time so I wonder if this is one of those things where our memories are are just kind of uh like we don't we look back and we're like oh yeah that was great but then we forget that the people who remember Dragon Age Origins are the ones who thought it was great and all the people who were like watered down I mean Gog has it rated 4.6 out of five steam has it rated 9 out of 10 um Google users have it rated
95% um okay I mean yeah like I said I thought great this is apparently Dragon Age 1 I loved Origins okay yeah uh where do I find on web uh where do I find my uh oh here we go yeah games just because you apparently don't think that I can remember what games I've played um well no you said it was controversial to like Origins it no no hold on a second you're the one that said it was controversial that's why I'm wondering which one you thought was I'm just going to I'm just going to
check a thing and you know see if maybe I yeah see Ian xmus this is this is exactly what I remember maybe I can't remember you said it was controversial it wasal played I remember what games I play Luke xith said Dragon Age Origins was great the sequels got progressively worse that's exactly what I remember as well I everyone liked Origins and then it went downhill from there okay I didn't play any of the sequels and this looks like a the from the trailer which means next to nothing so don't take this as
anything this next one looks like a progression down the path that they've been going down I apparently I apparently didn't care at all about Awakening yeah see like that sounds about right okay but I think no that was an expansion pack for Dragon Age Origins but was I thought that was two no it's Origins 2 Inquisition and then whatever I just uh not line it's you the dummy what are you talking about I know what I I all I'm saying is I know what game I played yeah he's right about the game
that he played and he liked it CU it was good so that makes sense okay well anyway I didn't look at the I didn't look at the trailer for Dragon Age whatever we're talking about um look at the Gameplay trailer go look at the gameplay not the trailer okay I have not seen the gameplay I've just saw the trailer and the trailer was not interesting ano has a bit of a pattern where every other one is good and every other one is bad so yeah I don't know it might be great Rome is a great setting
for ano F but I have no idea um if it'll actually be good I've got some hope because all of the expansions were really strong they like actually were for 1800 so 1800 was a sick game still is and yes New Ano means no more DLC I mean they did so much more DLC than they committed they kept building like super awesome DLC for that game I don't think you can complain about there not being enough DLC yeah n 1800 was a super well supported game and the DLC had value oh yeah like they'd launch a DLC pack and
there would be a ton to do like it was actually an expansion which was really cool honestly thought ano and Civ were the same rip no they are very different they're quite different yeah like turn based versus not turn-based why not keep playing 1800 you can that's fine oh yeah you totally can that's great thing about it because Rome is such a good setting we're hoping that yeah 117 is yeah it'll just be like it'll be fresh you know yeah fresh fresh is good fresh is good all right what are we looking at oh
we should do sponsors we should have done them a long time ago Dan I blame Dan the show is brought to you by MSI does your PC look like you just picked it up from a scrapyard our sponsor MSI is here to make your next PC shine uh their Meg Pano 100l pz case has a 270° panoramic tempered glass window providing a great view of your setup and if this look is too fire for you you can cool it down with a 360 mm Radiator on the top side and bottom it also fits up to 10 120 mm system fans it's compatible

last month and because they're so comfy Dennis's dad borrowed a pair from him that's awesome and refused to return them being waterproof doesn't mean your feet need to suffocate either thanks to their diatex technology V's shoes are breathable light and stretchy and their storm burst line is great for slippery sidewalks and mossy logs on Trails since they have extra traction and now you can get the storm burst in a low toop rain or shine here or there it's always a great occasion to wear a pair of vessis
so go to vessie Doc /ow to get 15% off  purchase all right well that was fun uh yeah hit us with some merge messages Dan sure um hello w. dll aside from comex what are some of your favorite things you saw did or ate in Taiwan also any news on when beanies will be back in stock I love soup dumplings oh agreed I think we're working on beanies but I bow no idea you know what overrated dude every time I go to the restaurant that everyone recommends I'm like eh it's fine and it was fine yeah
it was good Ivon liked their soup dumplings better but honestly one of the places that Dennis recommended that was super close to our hotel I liked the soup dumplings better they were there was there was a place that Dennis recommended that there's a photo of you jonno and I sitting there eating dumplings from like I don't know 2019 or something or something yeah yeah that place was killer don't remember where it was nice but it was awesome I don't know yeah yeah no soup dumplings man I love
soup dumplings uh I I ended up at a really um unusual dinner so I play badminton over there and I have like I have like kind of like badminton friends in Taiwan now cuz I'm just like that white guy that comes here once a year and is like decent or something so like they know they recognize me every time I love that I love that they don't like know you from YouTube yeah no no no you're like random white badminton dude yeah some of them know now sure but after the fact but no I was I was so
cool I was 100% random white badminton guy yeah that's like awesome fully embraced you before they knew the YouTube stuff which is awesome very like oh they're so brand for the Taiwanese people so friendly um anyway so on the subject of being like ridiculously friendly having only played with these guys a couple of times over the last 3 years um they were like oh your wife is coming this time well we'd love to take you out for dinner after badminton on on this night and so we
went to like a super authentic hole in- the wall with our like badminton friends who like speak English like you know kind of you know about like you know you'd expect and um and the food was great uh we just we had like like pork rice and just like I actually I'm going to be honest with you I don't know what half of it was sure that's a common occur but it was great so you asked me like what the food was that was good and I'm like I don't know whatever was on those plates that's fair pretty all right I'm
trying to find right now there's a there's a place that I stayed with Emma um that was like crazy cool I'm trying to figure out how I would be able to share it with the stream um and I'm having a hard time doing that cuz it's all like Chinese characters so like I don't really know how to share that but um I I stay there with Emma you show up at 2 p.m. on one day you leave at 2 p.m. the next day I wouldn't call it an Airbnb because you like do stuff like the the host is hosting not like oh
here's a key and then bailing out but you stay on a farm um with Native with a like a native Taiwanese tribe it's a it's a it's a son and mom that run this thing there's two different groups that can stay there at a time when you show up one of the first things that you do is you go cut down bamboo and then you like cut the like side branches off whatever haul it back cut it into sections because when you look at bamboo the Rings are solid through so you you cut it right before
the next ring so you have one side that's solid one side that's open you stuff rice inside of there cap it off with cabbage and water and then cook it and you make your own rice in these like bamboo things um so you kind of prep your food pretty quickly you do a like art project where you're you're uh taking like wood burning uh irons and and burning into wood like whatever you want um you go up into the mountains and pick tea that you're going to drink later because the native tribe Farms
oolong tea so you get to pick tea you get to like be up the mountain  short and destroyed I didn't see that coming at all he never does he's too tall sneak up on him bite his ankles I actually do have a bag of it for you too but anyways um it was it was amazing the the next day um you you take some more of that rice that you made and they have a stump that they've hollowed a bowl out on it and they have a huge club and you put some of the rice in the stump and you bash it with this big Club you'll
take turns doing it and I had no idea Mochi was just rice that had been like beaten really hard that's what Mochi is cool I guess I don't know so you make your own Mochi and then they have honey from the farm that they pour on this Mochi that you just made like you you get a stick roll it around it so you have a little bit of stick on the stick pour honey on it and then roll it around in crushed peanuts and you have honey crushed peanut Mochi it's so good it's so good it was amazing anyways this
place you can find it you might have some trouble someone said apparently a season of Amazing Race featured this Village Insomniac and float plane chat said that oh this is like a house it's not oh okay yeah all righty then um The Village there is a village but this particular thing is a house I remember you telling me that the first thing they told you was like how did you find us yeah so yeah so I show up and it's like beautiful day you're way up the mountain so you get this Effect
called the sea of clouds where the clouds are slightly below where you're at it looks really cool I have some really cool timelapse footage I took on my phone um and he's he's like serving us this like freshly Picked Oolong tea really cool Vibes and stuff and he's he's cheerily kind of trying to converse with us through Google translate or whatever and then he gets a fairly serious voice and is like how did you find this um because I'm assuming we're like the first white people they've
really had I don't know that's just my guess um and and I I explained to him that like I we had some change of plans because of the earthquake that happened in Taiwan a lot of the things that I wanted to do were closed um so we decided to go into alishan which is like te country um and I was just looking around on Google Maps which is something that I like to do instead of looking on like Trip Advisor I'll just look on Google Maps and just click on things that are kind of in the middle of
nowhere to see what's going on um and I found this place and the the pictures on Google Maps are like in insane they're so cool and then they have an Instagram and you have to go to their Instagram to get their line contact and you have to talk to them online to book an appointment when he says online he doesn't mean online like on the internet he means line messenger yeah yeah so I didn't even have line before so I oh man dude got it dude I I am I am a popular boy online because of the badmington stuff
yeah I uh check check this out check this out this is my uh this is my badminton address book give a second I never launched this app so it's uh takes a second basically like who and they all have the the shuttles the shuttle emojis that's pretty great anyways if you can try to find it it's a 605 Taiwan chii County alishan Township and then the name is like 11 like the number 11 and then some stuff that I can't say  sure yeah that good luck no idea what that means all right have fun y if you
can find it say I sent you what else we got for this week uh TI it to the judge what oh wait are we supposed to be your merch messages mer mess that was one oh oh nice hey dlll uh it it feels like back in the day when a game didn't run great they would blame their own Hardware while these days it feels like people only blame the game developer what changed um okay so a couple a lot of things changed uh one of the things that changed is that the hardware was moving really really fast uh it was more
affordable in some ways like a full platform actually cost about as much as it does today I mean probably more than it does today if you account for inflation um like you go back and you look at like a London Drugs cataly log from you know 1998 it's like oh yeah computers were really expensive um you buy a computer today like you can buy a tricked out system for what a dang it Luke for what a computer would have cost back then yeah like an average mid to low range laptop was like three grand
yeah like computers are actually like pretty cheap today yeah um but what has changed today is that the upgrade cycle is a lot slower now actually like you expect your computer from 5 years ago to like run a new game because that's how things work um developers are not uh necessarily targeting you know the next thing that's coming with their games um because they don't really need to like games can look really really great and still Target Hardware from 5 years ago so when something comes out that really
pushes your Hardware um I think that it's a little bit jarring especially when a lot of the time uh what's what happened for especially like the PS3 Xbox 360 era was that the only reason it wouldn't run well on your PC was that the port was really badly done and and by badly I mean like it was really hard to Port games across those three very different platforms so there's there's a lot of things that have sort of contributed to uh people's expectations changing it used to be that a game
wouldn't run well in your system because you didn't upgrade your system like like you know you weren't direct X compliant like things were moving so flipping fast and then for a long time the only reason something wouldn't run on your PC was cuz the game developer didn't optimize the port correctly nowadays I would say it's not really either of those things and it's probably just kind of somewhere somewhere in between um or it's it's sometimes one sometimes the other but
that's I I I think that's probably where our attitude shifted if I had to guess yeah yeah sounds good sounds right all right thanks I don't have anything to add really there's like I mean there's the it used to be kind of fun and also normal that people would do really small incremental updates you'd have conversations with people about how they bought a CPU or uh a couple more sticks of Ram or something and those were you I would more often have those conversations in someone buying a new
computer and now it's completely flipped I very rarely hear of anyone upgrading individual components I almost exclusively hear people buying a new computer and often way down the line four years five years often um and we had this discussion earlier in the show there's been a little bit of developer laziness and before people freak out I think it's been fairly reasonable developer laziness they don't have to do the things that they used to have to do um the constraints aren't there anymore
so why bother waste a huge amount of Cycles on trying to make these little efficiency improvements when you don't need to there's almost no reason to do so um a lot of games art styles these days aren't even that hard to push so who cares um it's fun and interesting when when companies do it but it's like n it's probably okay that's kind of a cool idea stay the path says I'm on a three-year upgrade cycle GPU motherboard CPU Ram monitor repeat that actually hold on that's a
long time to not upgrade your GPU 9 years no that doesn't seem quite right unless you mean you do it every year that oh that's a that's really often to upgrade your monitor though mind you monitor's been moving really fast okay maybe maybe it's May maybe if you're doing one of those things a year and like a threeyear rotation maybe that's  right or you could just do it whenever things are too slow and that would be fine too or when it feels right but for budgeting purposes I can see how someone
might like to have things schedu like a business you know yeah yeah yeah um what oh yeah so uh tile it to the judge life 360 hacked Life 360 the parent company of tile announced this week that it had received emails from a hacker who claimed to possess tile customer data after investigating the company found that someone had gained unauthorized access to a tile customer support platform 404 media interviewed the hacker who claimed they had gained access to multiple internal tools and
this is great including the one that processes location data requests for law enforce yeah he's reading ahead for law enforce ment the hacker sent 404 media all the data they scraped including names physical addresses email addresses and phone numbers which the outlet was able to verify by trying to create tile accounts using some of the emails as well as using some emails to contact affected users when Tyle was contacted by 404 media the company suggested it was not aware of what data had been
taken until 404 media shared data samples for verification after which Life 360 updated their announcement so this is pretty bad discussion question how worried should consumers be about the current state of data security terrified fairy all right I don't even know what else to say we've been talking about this on W show forever everything is like you should treat everything as compromised basically our next topic way more trouble than it's worth second recall for robo taxis weo has issued a
voluntary recall of its mapping software after one of its driverless Vehicles hit a telephone pole while trying to pick up a passenger last month no one was hurt but weo said the issue was that its software assigned a low damage score to  pools were they playing GTA or research by wayo suggests their driverless cars are safer than human drivers being 6. s times less likely to be in a crash having said that there are far fewer autonomous there is far less autonomous driving data compared to
human driving data and uh not all human driving data is is equal there's a lot of different circumstances and the way that you sample it does significantly impact um the the the assessment um there there were some there were some there were some stands extremely upset about us talking about how Tesla's full self-driving on Hardware platform 3.0 is effectively a lie um because they were extremely upset because they stands um that was in our ai's live video where we basically
like yeah it's got what like 150 tops or something like that Hardware 3.0 and it's one of those things where um yeah it's it's really cool technology and it's like it's it's super cool but what it isn't is ever going to be capable of fully autonomous operation um and whmo even though it I I actually don't know exact what Hardware they're using but it might be of a similar caliber uh but the difference is that weo has a sensor array that is vastly different than what Tesla's doing where they've essentially
committed to just trying to do everything with cameras I think have they backed have they have they gone back on that are they back to putting lar in the vehicles I know they definitely have vehicles I don't think so that uh I know they have vehicles that are all cameras now apparently it's still all cameras that's such a yikes and so for for to see stands in the comments there being like Lis has no idea what he's talking about it's look how good it is now it's definitely coming guys
that's yeah it could get twice as good as it is today and it would still not be able to handle edge cases and it would still it's still not going to be a fully autonomous vehicle it may be able to operate autonomously under certain ideal conditions but that's not what you were sold and that was my whole point I found an article from The Verge from May 7th saying that Tesla bought over $2 million worth of lar sensors from luminar this year okay so are they back to lar now
well they're not in cars as far as my understanding goes but maybe they'll put them in the semis or something I'm not sure maybe the semi could be like actually autonomous that's that's something that's really interesting to me is um something that I I just kind of couldn't wrap my brain around and then never thought about again was one of the challenges of these vehicles is that because they are because all of their sensors are integrated in a way that is visually pleasing they can't see for
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] right like they they have only a human a human level of of a like um a human's point of view whereas something like a semi oh yeah effectively like cuz you look at some of the like that episode of Silicon Valley where where he rides in that driverless vehicle that has like the giant like sensor array on it um something like that always made a little bit more sense to me because I couldn't figure out how from a driver's perspective you could possibly hope to have enough situational
awareness to have a computer operate this thing whereas on the semis I could actually see them having enough awareness of their surroundings that it could make a material difference just being up higher just on the front though no it could be I don't think they' attach things to whatever they're kind of be out and back yeah okay that' give you a pretty darn good view and then you know you'll still have the classic blind spot they'll still have that blind spot but like realistically then put a sign on
the back of the semi that says if you can't see my mirrors I can't see you and your mirror is a camera like I I don't I don't see the difference there oh no I'm not saying it's like worse or anything just yeah sorry semi you guys want me to call it a semi we call them both we don't care Canadians are like that ZZ who gives a sh what do you say semi semi yeah whatever yeah I know I've heard both I don't know sorry America we use metric and Imperial Lori all right you know
what let's do it they're lories to me from now on good old Lori yeah oh man anyway St get over it um what else we got deep cool coolers are now illegal in the US what yeah the US Department of the treasury sanctioned 16 Chinese companies including deep cool for supplying Goods to Russia deep cool allegedly sold over $1 million worth of goods to two Russian companies I hope it was worth it for a million dollars yeah uh one appears to be a small logistics company the other company sells computers
um yeah whoops well way to go deep cool what's crazy about this is by the letter of the law if you have stock of deep cool coolers right now and you sell them you're like breaking the law why what does that mean I don't know if you're newegg.com and you sell a deep cool cool even though you like bought I thought you meant stocks like stock market stocks no no no no no if you have if you have coolers in stock yeah so that that kind of blows um that is rough yeah yeah brutal sorry
Newegg and other computer sellers um it's one banana Linus uh plasmor says I'm not a Tesla stand but when folks say GH no liar I often challenge them to describe in technical detail why it's required uh because cameras are subject to very very very Distortion from small amounts of element that is very very common water there you go there's your very technical um explanation of why liar is necessary as a backup to cameras and why cameras are not enough on their own um which
everyone knew um back then and still knows now I think I think the wisdom that I've heard is that the like if you're 100% relying on light Arts it's bad yes but then if you're 100% relying on cameras it's bad bad yeah yeah yeah so just do both yeah yeah yeah obviously it costs more but it is what it is yeah it costs more but if you actually in good faith ever intended to deliver a fully autonomous vehicle then you better make the investment yeah uh it's there's a game the second highest player count on
Steam this game has uh it's it's called banana oh God I saw this when I was um when I I was just like walking somewhere today and I was reading this and it was one of those articles where like when I was by the end of it I realized that my mouth was open I just couldn't believe it sorry sorry go on go on uh it's a game where you click a JPEG of a banana it's a copy of a game called egg uh and that's not me saying it's a copy of that game one of the devs just admitted it in an interview with polygon
uh but the more you click the picture of this banana the higher the chance you'll earn a banana skin I think we would prefer it was called peel but anyways uh you can sell these banana skins on steam's Marketplace most of the Skins sell for cents but rarer ones are worth a lot more according to  really one skin sold it's got to be Market manipulation for "$1,378 " 58 it turns out that many of the players aren't real as people are using Bots and fake accounts to try to get rare drops
I'm sure people are just using Auto clickers as well stuff like that wow wow what does it say about society that thousands of people are clicking on  buck I suspect for the average person they'll pay more on electricity trying to do this than they'll actually make um yeah we don't have to discuss it any further I just thought it was funny I think it's just like a worst version of cookie clicker I feel like Cookie Clicker is just happening again but this time it's a banana and there's no other
mechanics in the game but it's also real money in other news as part of the  added trackers Alliance missions to the game the first of several so particularly mad about this but I'll wait to explain why the first of several missions enabling you to live your best bounty hunting life this that's a quote the first mission is free the first one's always free but the second mission costs 700 creation credits that's equivalent to $7 except you have to buy "at least a, creation credits to be able"
to afford it in addition the quest seems to take about 15 minutes based on the length of a full gameplay walkthrough  pickle some people seem to be arguing this isn't that big of a deal because speedrunners are able to beat balers Gate 3 10 minutes or less okay's no J that's a joke it's calm down there's no way that's not a joke Luke Luke I'm so mad the reason why hold on hold on look into my eyes settle down this game broke my soul Luke settle down I'm so mad Luke you're still mad Luke settle down he's
twitching his face is twitching when I first sat down to play Starfield I decided to look into nothing nothing this is how I like playing Bethesda games I like to just explore the world as broken as it is and which sometimes is kind of fun yep yep that's fine it's okay yep remember the like eyeballs yeah it wasn't fun in Starfield yeah okay one of the first things I tried to do when I was really excited about it was I found the trackers Alliance I was like oh sick there's a
bounty hunting faction that is so cool I remember you telling me this yeah because I was like okay in in you know in in Elder Scrolls we have like the Thieves Guild The Fighter Guild the Mages Guild whatever so I was like okay there's going to be that cuz it's a Bethesda game and the one of the first things I found was The Trackers Alliance and I was so excited because I was like cool bounty hunting Mission storyline eventually end up being the like Kingpin of the Bounty Hunter guys this is going
to be great this is going to be super fun it wasn't a faction it was a mission board that there was no reason at all for you to interact with it gave you very little credit credits the missions were incredibly shallow and boring it would just like pick a random unimportant NPC as far as I can tell what would happen it was it was just like pick or generate a random unimportant NPC in the middle of absolutely nowhere 99% of the time you would warp there land bang it's an incredibly easy game so you just kill
them easily every single time get back on your ship warp back hello I got a very incredibly small amount of money nice so disappointing they add the missions to the game finally I'm sitting here thinking okay they've sort of figured it out with Fallout 76 it feels like I'm not going to jump into it but some people are actually having fun many years later so that's cool maybe they'll do a cyberpunk with Starfield right and I'm hearing about the new update that's coming out there's a new expansion
coming out all this kind of stuff you know maybe they'll figure it out maybe they'll figure it out and then this drops and I'm not even going to update the game let alone launch it nice go yourself nice Japan passes a dma like law um and I don't mean direct memory access I mean uh digital markets act uh so this is similar to the eu's um digital markets act law um so it labels designated providers um it labels it requires companies labeled designated providers to abide by certain rules like the dma
Google and apple have been named designated providers and under the law they will be required to allow thirdparty app stores allow app developers to offer thirdparty billing services and other requirements there are exceptions for privacy and security according to the verge providers not following the rules can be fined up to 20% of the domestic Revenue specific to the infringing service increasing to 30% for repeat offenses basically taking all the money that they make from these
infringing Services pretty cool a discussion question aside from fortnite coming back to iOS and Japan next year what do you think are are the biggest benefits of this law I mean I think the biggest benefit is just that this is putting more pressure on Apple and Google to behave nicely kind of like I talked about with where Apple's attitude is clearly changing to be less customer antagonistic and more okay if that's what you want then we should probably do that because you're not just locked into
our ecosystem we actually like have to earn this again yeah this is a good thing love it it's a very good thing you should like competition regardless of whether you liked uh the iPhone exactly the way it was or whether you want other people to also like it um because it will just get better it's a good good thing yeah um the Raspberry Pi speaking of good things this doesn't seem as good Raspberry Pi has gone public in an interview shortly after the 2012 launch the pi inventor
eban Upton said they're designed to be cheap enough that a child can buy one with their pocket money however in recent years it's become next to impossible to buy a Raspberry Pi at retail price with most C being reserved for business customers with this IPO Raspberry Pi limited the hardware manufacturer will no longer be a subsidiary of the nonprofit Raspberry Pi Foundation the it says charity but I think it's more of a not for-profit don't quotee me on that um the foundation owned more than 70% of
shares before the IPO and will reportedly sell up to 10% of its holding shares have climbed to $4.20 nice after Tuesday's IPO at $2 80 and I mean pounds sorry not dollars these are GBP the response of the community has been generally negative calling the move perhaps the end of Raspberry Pi as we know it and the beginning of the end with one reditor declaring let the in ification begin sounds about already been happening though I mean it's already basically been happening it's been clear that
they're they've lost their way for some time at this point uh which kind of sucks cuz like it seems like they could have just you know still been really profitable and done reallyy I mean my okay my one the one thing that I could hope for is that by raising this cash they able to invest in more manufacturing which would be good because then maybe we could actually bloody well buy one at MSRP that's that's my hope that's my hope yeah um Oliver Bryant says terrible news no way
we can ever stop this from happening  anyone yeah yeah money kind of ruins everything yeah like I I'd like to say that like it'll be fine but I don't have a lot of speaking of money how about this message from our sponsor no in all seriousness Dan why is the Savage jerky on the table are we allowed to eat it I think it just gets left I don't know oh okay business hello um well I'm going to try barbecue Bandit and I have no idea if there's supposed to be a lower third for it so
why don't we call out the regular sponsor that we're definitely supposed to talk about secret lab hey look my chair is secret lab um and then I'm just going to like eat some jerky because I'm hungry um anywh who uh Dan I think it's time for after dark sure yeah absolutely cool let's do it I uh I had Conrad change the banner to after dark button color so I stop pushing it it happened  times there we go one of these days after dark should have flying toasters as the icon some people will get it Conrad don't
listen yeah there's lots of work to do oh he's already done it no no no no no okay uh let's see what do we got here hey D what goes into the decision to discontinue items is is it there're no longer selling well or are there potentially other factors like potential revamps for example sweatsh shorts RGB sweaters or  it's just a screen saver that came with it yeah yeah yeah um sorry I completely wasn't listening because I was Googling after dark why do we discontinue items what's what's what leads to that
decision okay yeah um sometimes it's like if it's not selling anymore or if the supplier that we were working with is we are no longer able to work with them for some reason or another you might be able to guess um yeah well there's lots there's lots of different reasons a lot of them they wouldn't guess yeah um so sometimes we we have something new coming that we think kind of um makes the old one not necessary anymore there's there's a lot  reasons do you have any updates
regarding the backpack you gave to the minor no I don't know that we will yeah hello D I suspect it will end up similarly to the first one eviscerated yeah uh hello D I love using my airpods primarily because of its spatial audio for movies and TV how important is 3D audio such as Dolby Atmos for you and do you think it's being implemented well in Mobile um I got to confess it's not the most important thing to me ANC is probably closer to up there ANC is super important having
having a really strong Center channel is really important to me um I sometimes struggle to hear dialogue over the score and um I find that for me not like when I miss something it distracts me for an extended period of time me too I often just have to go back yeah um and so yeah having a really strong Center channel is really great for me I I I personally find that most movies too like even ones that are like best enjoyed on D be at oh God I can multitask I ke it even ones that are best enjoyed
on umby Atmos I love the I it we'll have at most a handful of scenes where like a helicopter goes over and you're like whoa that was cool where you can tell they just like they put it in just you know so that it's there yeah like it's not really that integral like if you if you told me that for the rest of my life I could only have at most a 3.1 setup I'd be like okay right um like it's not bad obviously if I was building a dedicated home theater room I would I would put lots of channels in it
but yeah know I I I just it's not that  personally I'm a high school student that has been programming as both a hobby and career do you have any advice on what languages or Technologies or even soft skills I should learn for a career in webdev after college work on your people skills I'm actually serious yeah learn to present learn to sell sales is is if you can sell you can you can kind of parlay that skill into success in any field and when I say sell I don't mean sell like a widget I mean I
mean sell sell yourself sell your ideas learn to pitch learn learn to pitch ideas it's so important because you can make your own career path that day like unless you're at an enormous company there is there is room to to talk to people and and to negotiate on just about anything and if you have a really great idea and you can sell it then you can end up working on stuff you want to work on not every day every career has has some slog in it but you can end up working on things you're passionate
about and excited about a lot more often um so yeah work on that cuz sometimes you also have to understand that you're not you might be selling through the person that you're quote unquote selling to like the the person might even buy your idea really quick but then they need enough ammo to sell it to the customer or to sell it further on in the company so you need to give them enough to make their job easy so that they actually want to do it it because it might not be their job really their job
is managing you and if if you want to do this new thing you need to give them enough ammo that they're going to be able to fight for it easily so they actually want to do that um yeah I agree with all of that it sounds like you're you're already flexing your actual development skills well enough um but the people skills thing will help a lot because it's actually pretty hard to get managers in the development space so there's a surprisingly easy career path there because there's and you have to know the
development because you have to be able to speak the language and I mean that figuratively and literally right like you have to be able to communicate between the normies that make business decisions and the developers that do the work right um and a lot of the time those people have absolutely no Common Ground no hope of of of interacting with each other in a productive way um um so it's a really cool it's a really cool place to be like I mean okay even for me I'm relatively
technical but I don't know development so if I was to try to work on a project like um you know let's say I wanted to do the Badminton Center thing with the  scorekeeping how would I have any idea if someone's just completely bullshitting me on their resume if someone told told me this takes a year I'd be like okay right and and think about that even if you scaled way up right in an enormous organization you need people who can call developers on their [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] right no that doesn't take a
year stop playing banana clicker and get to work this should be deliverable in two weeks you know or or whatever it is right and so that's a really valuable skill and I mean yeah you're not actually like doing the work and you know middle management sucks or whatever but it has a value in that it reduces waste you might also be able to find a position um where you do kind of like half and half you still do actual like you're you're actually still submitting code but you're also managing people
it's not always but it's you can find it I'm a tech for a large OEM regularly let into server rooms with no ID verification and left alone for hours have you ever had anyone try to access sensitive areas by social engineering employees physically I don't think so I don't think so I've caught us having some pretty notable vulnerabilities there and we're working on it but I don't think it's ever actually happened which isn't an invitation no  actually sort of but for a different reason I don't want
to go into the details oh and it was absolutely caught by uh Alex D he did a great job I think it was him I heard through great fine of of what happened um I know it was he was involved I don't know if it was actually him that that did it but yeah someone noticed something was fishy and stopped it person was not allowed in the building nice yeah it was good nice yeah we're still a small enough company that like people legitimately will mostly recognize everyone who works it wasn't
just they not recognize it was like they they sniffed it out was sus yeah it was good good job I I this is all I heard it third party I don't know but the information that I heard third party was very good great great job done getting my almost 9-year-old son a PC any tips on setting up a PC for kid-friendly use or controlling the environment a little more steam family sharing is a good start but any other kid gamer tips Windows does technically have management tools they kind of suck
um other than that other than setting that up um steam family sharing yep steam family sharing super good um there's no substitute for supervision so just making sure you're kind of on top  do hi W.D I'm using my steam deck to beat some Nest games that I never could as a kid nice you've talked about your favorite SN or Genesis games but what's your favorite Nest game I didn't have a Ness me neither um my friend did yeah my friend yeah Axel if you're out there thanks for letting me use your nest Adam
if you're out there thanks for letting me use your nest they both start with a so I don't know what's up with that but nothing I mean it's a one in 26 chance it's also a pretty common one I yeah it's way less than one in 12 than like X or something yeah exactly what are you  but yeah I don't know I I gu yeah duck hunt I don't know I enjoyed it he only had like three games had like do hunt Super Mario Bros and Blade Blades of steel or whatever the like I I I could still I can still hear it in my mind I
can't say it in that low Fidelity yeah I think it's blaz the Ste like yeah it was so bad that was probably pretty good actually oh man next up yes uh this week my dad got a topspec MacBook Pro to browse on nearly "$3,200 I've since got him to return it" for a base model air have you ever had someone unnecessarily get the top-of-the-line product Oh that's interesting that's got to happen in the automotive industry all the time any car why you got to make it a personal attack any car older than uh you know 5
years um man yeah I'm trying to think in my life people generally ask me before they buy a tech thing yeah I'm trying I don't I don't have a lot of experience I don't think it really happens that much um I mean there's definitely people internally here who have spent way too much money on Tech stuff that I'm just like whoa I mean do you even watch the videos you edit but um not like in my personal life I don't think this is a spoiler doing scrapyard Wars made me want to do like a home theater build or
something oh just cuz it's so affordable now seems like a good time dude you can get a GPU with like RTX like HDR whatever like you can get like a 2060 PC with a decent enough processor for like next to nothing it's the capture card that's going to kill you cuz I don't think the used market for good capture cards is going to be that great I have a capture card though I have an external capture card that's solid then you're good to go buddy yeah I mean I could I can actually I can verify that I'm on
Marketplace right now yeah yeah okay like a good brand name capture card is still going to cost you money I mean this $25 Rando one might be fine but if you want like something from I I mean wow it's like basically Elgato or Rando there's name for media I didn't realize how much they ran that now it makes sense I guess but yeah man elato is like like do these do these guys have effectively a mind share Monopoly or like what what is going on here like there's one a media Elgato Elgato Elgato uh Elgato
Elgato you green of all people Elgato Elgato Elgato elato like this is  who hey DL I know lonus is a big fan of badminton and badminton gear are there plans to create uh are there plans in creating and selling badminton related gear for LTD store.com or the pro shop at the new badminton location I don't think that we're going to do the kind of volume that we would need to do in the Pro Shop to create specific products for it but we will sell like our water  think and I think one of the last ones
I've got here really expensive what's expensive uh I have an old epam Avio not 4K are like 400 bucks not 4K oh okay and I did not spend $400 on it still it's like 200 bucks at least what are those worth now I don't know it didn't cost me that much back in the day I don't know if I got it from here or what probably probably we had a handful yeah you have like an avd I think so I don't think they've come down in price basically at all I think they have fpgas in them that would be my
guess yeah that'll do it makes sense last one I've got for you here hi D what's a piece of tech that you've never had to upgrade over the years despite new versions of it being released all the time oh I still have um I still have my old Harmony remote from like when I did a review of the Harmony remote so  2011 no it would have been more recent than that oh goodness not by much uh 2014 Oh I thought this was like before so I am still I I still have this harmony remote deployed right now did you have one
before this nope this is my first one oh weird I got it and I deployed it and I used it forever yep Harmony remote SE  setup okay all right that's it um sorry for the shorter show um there was a a loss in my family yesterday and the reason I'm bringing it up is that it may impact our schedule next Friday okay um whatever work I'd like to keep the streak alive but W show maybe at a different time next week so what we're  um I will have to be in the city at around um is like Morning Edition before
when show would normally start yeah uh um so with that in mind I would really rather do um you want to do ultra late or Ultra early not my kids not my wife but immediate family so I'm probably going to be there were a couple people who noticed in chat today I'm a little off today I'm a little off today um I thought you did splendidly thank you um I would like it to not be after cuz I'm probably going to be obliterated totally so we may have to do a bit of an early W show next week Morning Show sounds fun
to me okay so maybe just let the let the crew know and uh we'll uh we'll maybe do that if that works yeah all right thank you guys we'll see you again next week same bad time same bad Channel bye I am tired and it's time to go home yeah
