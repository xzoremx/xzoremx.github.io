I hate karaoke it's loud it's dumb and I'm already both of those things hey what the heck it's such a good intro but look it's not about me karaoke is beloved by millions of people including my kids so when my daughter asked for a karaoke machine for her birthday well what kind of father would I be if I said no the kind of father who didn't want to navigate a nigh impenetrable wall of AliExpress junk and air written review use to find a setup of reasonable price high quality and low complexity is a
real challenge but as we dug deeper we found ourselves immersed in one of the most wholesome and dedicated communities on the web so if you're like me you may not love Koke but you may love rabbit holes so grab a shovel and a mining helmet and start digging with me but before we go it's time for the Segway to our sponsor Corsair their 3500x case is like a window into your soul thanks to its wraparound glass Aesthetics and support for Back to Front motherboards because if you're like us your soul is
really just a bunch of PC components  link here's my wants list the system needs to be easy enough for kids to handle ideally take advantage of speakers that I already own it should have as few proprietary components as possible and be reliable and repairable so nothing that's E-Waste the second that I open the box I would like it to have four inputs so that my kids can enjoy it with friends and family but if I have to settle for less then I will in the last 17 days I have learned far more
about karaoke machines than I ever cared to we've come up with three solutions that meet linus' criteria with varying levels of success but it wasn't easy at least on the English internet there is surprisingly little good information out there about karaoke machines even Reddit where there's a community for everything was kind of dead honestly the biggest problem though was the one requirement lonus didn't mention he didn't want to spend a fortune on this which pretty
much eliminated a commercial grade setup with wireless microphones so lowering our Ambitions we picked up a Yamaha m6x it's a nice sturdy and compact mixer that has nice vocal effects that can go a long way to providing that karaoke bar feel and the mixer has virtually no noise and is relatively simple to use use for adults we'll get to that later first what mics did we get quality no offense to lonus and his kids is not that important for karaoke but what is is durability thankfully sure kind of
nails both while we could have gone with the perennial favorite the sh sm58 we decided to save some money and go with the entry-level pga48 it's all metal sounds decent but it's hampered by some obnoxious handling noise that might take some practice to avoid you'll also need some practice hooking it up XLR C cables to plug this into the mixer qu in to RCA from the mixer to the AV receiver maybe some adapters some cable management products from LTC store.com by the time we've got all the accessories we need
we're looking at a pretty hefty bill for our cable noodle salad down here and we don't even have any extras like mic stands yet but before we invest in those we want to listen to the system so let's just plug the mixer into the AV system plug our computer into the HDMI port on the TV and just kidding just kidding you thought he was going to do that the output coming from this mixer should not be fed into your typical home audio setup the quick explanation is that your home audio
equipment is designed to play finished files that are leveled and compressed and stuff like that whereas the signal from microphones can have really loud Peaks that can actually damage your Hardware it might not be super likely but why risk it that's why we snagged this PA speaker from the office for testing it also gives us the option of running the music through the into the PA or we can have the vocals on the PA speakers with the music running through the home theater which will
reduce the total number of cables but also make balancing levels a bit of a pain in the butt another benefit of the PA though is that we can move it to reduce the likelihood of feedback which is great but how are we going to get music into the speakers YouTube's a great place for tons of karaoke tracks but it has a few problems queuing stuff is a bit tedious and quality varies greatly and your favorite tracks might be ripped from your grasp at any moment if YouTube decid besides that they're
not worthy also downloading from YouTube  be thankfully there are other platforms like iunes which is the best name ever or better yet karaoke nerds where you can find high quality karaoke tracks for purchase or streaming and you can even request karaoke versions of your favorite songs to be made that's pretty cool unless you're willing to tip for their services though you're going to be waiting a long time for your song to be karaoke fied but you should consider doing that because thanks to these folks
the internet is full of bar emptying hits from bands like swans and Captain beefart is that I've never heard of them you've never heard of Captain Bart anyway I think it's time to show my kids I've spent more than I intended and we could have saved some money if we'd gone with cheaper stuff but the good thing about it is this is mostly Pro suumer grade audio equipment that should hold its value reasonably well let's try it out okay girls you know how sometimes someone gets a birthday present but
everyone kind of shares it yeah yeah that's happen  first what's that what do you mean what's that maybe your older sister can tell you wow it's a video game what the got here hold take these okay what is it karaoke  it say you're not going to try it John they're camera shy so I guess it's going to be me and Adam trying out the setups there's three different ones and I kind of wanted you guys to help me pick which one that's not great didn't you say you wanted karaoke what
remember no that moment when the parent has a better memory for what the kid asks for for a birthday than the kid does yeah you did it was a while back  I guess you get to hear me and Adam try  broken I could let go I can't keep a straight face you know what it sounds  Wonder remember when I said there were three options though let's talk about the all-in-one packages when you first look on Amazon you will be inundated by hundreds of options that are all variations of the same five or six
products being sold by a myriad of alphabet soup drop shippers and from the research we did most of these systems fall short in one way or another the big one is just how proprietary so many of the wireless mics are but we think we may have found a good one we were turned on to the icario Shell S1 by a Reddit user named David _ PGH and he seems to have put the entire Reddit karaoke community on his back supporting them with endless knowledge and recommendations he responds to like
every threat rad shout out David it's people like you that make this world a better place this really is the whole package it's a portable powered speaker with two wireless microphones and a place to store them a 10.1 in touchscreen running Android 13 that is pre-loaded with get this karaoke apps that makes sense right on the main menu we have YouTube which is actually just Mozilla Firefox but don't worry about that that just makes it better than being just YouTube and caraun which
we'll talk about in a little bit while it only has two wireless inputs we can plug a wired mic into the back for three panels of audio along with auxiliary in and out HDMI out and we can run our own songs off of a USB drive the microphones sound great with strong directionality to prevent feedback very little latency great range unlike many karaoke singers and very little handling noise there's no cables to trip over and while you can still surprise yourself with how loud
the thing is I don't have to worry about blowing up my home theater system when someone drops a microphone or messes with the settings of course there are downsides the components here they are not repairable replaceable or resellable so when the battery goes on these mics and they will they will be gone and unless we can access the bootloader on this Android tablet which I mean if any Community is going to do it it might be the karaoke Community they're crazy dedicated but
you can't count on that let's try this thing out want it that way so that's the clean original mic mode and then we can go to karaoke hello W that's just a lot of Reverb that's a lot of Reverb I have a super um okay okay this one's called profession not professional but profession I want cartoon we got oh my God what's moner oh my God hello hello children the speaker quality on this thing not great it's loud it's acceptable between the mic and the speaker it handles your Voice better
than it handles mine I wonder how much of that is to do with the speaker itself or if it's the microphon I imagine the microphones would usually be biased to be good across a broad variety of voices but feel them they are very light not a lot going on in here hey they they put the charging ring all the way around the base put them inol you just Chuck them in there and then and turn them off though because oh yeah cuz otherwise that'll happen but you don't have to worry about it happening to your
speakers that's true you heard us mentioned caraun earlier it's really really cool an amazing "service with a library of 61,000 plus" tracks of highquality remakes of songs with accurate lyric timing adjustable background vocal levels key changing to suit your voice easy queuing of tracks and like 400 tracks for free just to test out in case you don't want to Shell out $10 a month for the subscription but honestly just paying 10 bucks for one night of karaoke that's that's kind of
worth it this thing is honestly great and one of the coolest things is you can bring it to a party and be doing karaoke Within seconds with no one needing to be taught at $280 it's not cheap but it undercut the price of our quality DIY setup so yeah sure you could go with a cheaper all-in-one system but this actually a pretty compelling package there is a third option that Bridges the gap between an all-in-one and a DIY uh most in-one type setup if you will the one we have today is from soundtown but
also there's like another company that makes the same thing I think it's kind of another drop Shippy situation but unlike other Solutions this has HDMI pass through which means it will work seamlessly with the rest of your setup and converting your signal to digital will lower the risk not eliminate it of damaging your AV setup so if you want to hook up to that instead of getting a dedicated PA speaker maybe try it at around 100 bucks this thing is a great deal coming with two wireless mics that
don't sound half bad and if you want you can grab some cheap mics and plug them in via the quarter-inch jacks on the front sadly they're going to be on the same two channels whatever it should be okay you're all seeing the same song and thanks to convenient HDMI pass through this could be the easiest solution of any we've seen so far all right let's try it hey now you're an allar get your game on go play yeah so the quality is not the highest but it's simple you have the cables probably already and you just
need a laptop there's no doubt in my mind that the Yamaha mixer blows away the other Solutions if I was going to host it and use it in my home 100% the Yama but this is for kids to use and I don't trust them to be able to deal with this when it does get messed up and also you could damage stuff with it just hot glue the buttons in place yeah and have fun reselling your Yamaha mixer I think it might be Sound Town population me the Quick Change double a batteries that's pretty appealing compared to some
proprietary Battery Solution you can plug in more micro phones so it is adaptable and if maybe if you do keep the mixer for other reasons or you have another mixer you could split out and have two inputs anyways to your point if it was for me and it was something that I knew I was going to be there to configure I would absolutely go DIY yeah this is awesome this is great it sounds so much better and you're going to be able to use it for other stuff you could use it at your desk for streaming and
stuff like that like with that said if you're kind of willing to spend the extra 300 bucks for like 50% of people in this world I would say this is a great option because you also get a speaker it's all one packed easy to use system it's pretty appealing if I was moving around or I was like Street busking look at this it's got the little like strap thing on it yeah comes with the strap too regardless of which setup works best for you we hope you guys learn something today like this message
