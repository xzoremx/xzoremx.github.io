what is up everyone and welcome to the W show I've been called a hater so many times for calling out the obviously misleading statements from one Tesla CEO Elon Musk but um apparently even he agrees with me now because he tweeted out earlier this week that full self-driving um may have some significant challenges working on their Hardware 3.0 uh also in the news this week let's see oh man this app company is installing cameras in nightclubs that anyone can tune into that and that's that's a that's a
service they offer wow that sounds horrible for like a variety of reasons yeah we're going to talk about that what else we got this week uh Nintendo says well there's challenging scalpers outright I'm talking about that come at me bro they're like we you won't be able to that'll be interesting uh also I don't know man Apple dless vpns in Russia yeah yeah that sucks so Apple never cared about your privacy yeah  the show is brought to you today by ecoflow Squarespace Corsair and of
course our chair partner secret lab you can check them all out down below this is great just o 53 goes never thought Zuck would be my favorite billionaire uh yeah I mean he's definitely got the image kind of cleaned up lately but let's not forget that the Zuck is imperfect at best you should always remember the the quote from back when he was at I think Harvard when he was talking to his friend about how or whoever it was that he can get them basically whatever information he wants
on basically any student at the school and the guy was like why did they give you all this information he's like I don't know they're idiots or whatever I guess they trust me they're they're idiots or something like that yeah pretty good uh any who let's have a look at our source for this full self- driving it's way worse than that they trust me dumb nice yeah so that's that guy just don't forget anyways all right so uh one Mr Elon Musk xed uh sorry for the delay this release
has had far fewer interventions but suffered in driving smoothness part of the issue was too much training on interventions and not enough on normal driving so this is something I've talked about a fair bit before where it's not you know can you go down the street and then hang a left and then hang a right and then pull into a driveway that that's not the the hard part that's not the challenge we're solving right now the challenge we're solving right now is the edge cases and that's where just and
I've talked about this before there was just absolutely no way even if they were an order of magnitude ahead of the competition back when the hardware 3.0 was released there was absolutely no way that they were going to be able to achieve true autonomy with that level of Hardware uh continuing to read his tweet um it's like a doctor training too much on patients in the emergency room versus training on preventative care our nextg AI model after this has a lot of Promise
approximately 5x increase in parameter count which is very difficult to achieve without upgrading the vehicle inference computer so it's that last little bit that I've kind of been looking at going oh so we're finally acknowledging this now because for years now uh the official stance of Tesla which doesn't have a PR department anymore because I guess they're just not accountable to the press or the public um the official stance of Tesla which has basically just been whatever Elon Musk tweets has been
that Hardware 3.0 which they began shipping when I think I think it was like 5 years ago might might have been more than that uh first shipping no no no yeah I can't can't immediately find this right now ah as of mid April 2019 so this was about 5 years ago they started shipping Hardware 3.0 and uh theyve said at the time anything with this level of Hardware will be capable of full self-driving with an upgrade um was that during the window of time where he had to bring the company
to a certain point for him to get that like insane payment package I'm not sure but it's interesting that you bring that up because I do not see how there's not going to be an enormous Reckoning they have sold Millions upon Millions upon millions of vehicles since that time that they have told people are going to be capable of fully autonomous driving I mean remember when on a regular basis this company talked about how your your Tesla is going to make you money passively fing people around while you're at
work I love that idea I love the idea too it's a great idea it really is that's a dyst I wouldn't mind living in to be perfectly honest with you but it was obviously not true even at the time and as we went on it became more and more obvious and yet they didn't acknowledge it they still haven't acknowledged it in any official capacity other than this you know tacked on comment at the end of a tweet that I am very surprised that more people aren't talking about and that more people
aren't extremely upset about too I mean this is right on the heels of the Tesla shareholders voting to approve that what was it like $56 billion pay package or whatever it was um so I'm sorry guys uh this likely means that the past stated plans to upgrade Hardware 3 Cars to full self-driving via a software upgrade are not feasible it is unclear at this time if this will also be a problem for Hardware 4 uh which my understanding is extremely powerful quite a bit more powerful than the 3.0 Hardware but not
nearly as powerful as the upcoming five level Hardware Hardware 4 started shipping in January 2023 January 2023 oh wow oh that was that recent yeah okay so only about the last year and a half but something to note about Hardware 4 is we don't have a good idea of what its capabilities are because right now Hardware 4 cars are operating in kind of like a hardware 3 mode so so they're using like down imagery or something like that and the models are still small enough to fit on
Hardware 3 because splitting their development to working on uh to to training models for two completely different uh Target devices has not made economic sense um especially since as far as I can tell In fairness to Tesla their goal still has been to earnestly work on trying to achieve full self-driving on Hardware 3 uh it's just that it wasn't possible because we just we weren't even close yet yeah we weren't even we weren't even close yet so that's um that's a bummer I'm sorry that you that you uh got
Bamboozled what I want to know now and the main reason that I'm bringing this up is not to to dunk on Tesla because this is not something new for me to be talking about here um the main reason that I'm bringing this up is that I want to see what the accountability is going to be for companies that do this that advertise a feature is this a false advertising it should be but what what is the actual consequences for false advertising like Luke where were the consequences for Google when they got
into that Tiff with Sonos and just removed features that they advertised on their smart speakers totally agreed yeah where is where is the real meaningful compensation for that happening and guys I'm I'm sure that the chat is going to start flooding with examples of times that these major companies we're we're not talking about companies that are making an an existential choice right like if I'm if I'm you know Joe's startup okay and I I've released this product and it had this feature and then
I get hit by a by a major lawsuit from Amazon or someone you know right someone with just colossal resources that could squish me like a bug just keep keep me in litigation hell forever and I basically go okay look guys here's a situation bankruptcy or compliance we've got to turn this off or we're done we're out there's absolutely nothing this off or we turn everything off exactly we are not talking about that sort of a situation someone like a Google could could pay they could pay
temporarily to license the feature or they could they could continue to keep it on the devices and pay whatever fines and penalties or they could and if they win the case they could like uh sue for those back or whatever yep or they could recall they could recall the device that's totally an option yeah you can recall something you can offer people a refund which in my mind is the the most possible Financial liability that you should ever have for a product that you're selling as long as it doesn't
destroy something else at the same time right like if I sell you this microphone and it stops working or it stops working mode that I like and I removed that mode I I think the most Financial liability I could possibly have is the the price of this microphone um okay so let's see have you guys have you guys hit us with some other examples here oh surprisingly you didn't I'm not yeah I'm not seeing a lot Spotify dropping car thing in less than two years yeah bricking the device was
really really bad um wh just had a drive car drive in oncoming traffic okay all right well never mind um what would be your ideal what would be your ideal  this like what should the con let's go let's come back to Tesla now they sold they sold two things right realistically they sold a car that was capable of full self-driving but capable with a software package that not everybody opted for and then they sold a software package as a beta so I'm sure if you get right into
the t's and C's they covered their butts and made it clear that this was aspirational but they charged enough money for it I mean it was priced anywhere between like 5 and 10 grand at various points um in in the past 5 years right so they they sold this software package that theoretically had the capability of achieving full autonomy so there's almost there's almost two different customers we're talking about here the ones with the hardware platform that is supposed to be upgradeable too
but maybe they haven't paid into and therefore maybe aren't really entitled to complain in the same way I don't think so much and then you've got the people who actually bought the functionality but who you know I think Tesla would be very quick to point out but who have been enjoying this beta functionality all this time for all the limitations that it might have what are what are they entitled to what should they be entitled to if you could write the law for selling  I feel like if it if if it was very
clear that a false promise had been made those users should be available for a full refund I don't think the company should have to automatically full refund everyone because there might be people that are happy like you said with the thing that they got and they don't care about that particular feature um they might not want a refund they might just want their thing but the people that get the full refund should lose access to the thing as well cuz I'm trying to think more broadly for like what other
companies this could possibly happen to so they should be able to have like a retroactive way after the date refund if they want it but they should probably have to give the thing back okay well yeah I mean it's a software upgrade you lose the software upgrade but you can get a full refund of the price that you originally paid okay but what about the car that part yeah I don't know cuz they because there it's like I'm trying to I'm trying to think of other scenarios and there's definitely times where you
might buy like you might buy an Xbox yeah I was actually I was going there I was going GTA 6 yeah yeah you might buy Xbox GTA 6 buy a PlayStation 5 right now it'll be the best platform for GTA 6 you're going to play GTA 6 and GTA 6 doesn't come out exclusivity deal sure you know whatever whatever goes down I might want to be able to return my PlayStation if if the reason why I bought the console is the future of that game if I'm like I'm going to buy a console now um I'm going to buy one of
them I want it mainly for this game but I'm going to buy it now play some games up until then whatever I would be pretty frustrated but should they be entitled not sure how to compensate those should they be entitled to account for depreciation because if I'm Tesla I could be looking at a car that is 5 years old that I'm like what I'm buying back at full retail price that doesn't make any sense I mean you drove it who defines so this is this is an issue that I have with understanding Automotive
stuff who defines depreciation is that blue book there there's like a central body that does it right this is be honest with you you don't I don't know who Blue Book is okay but they do it but are they a government agency are they I actually have no idea who Blue Book is yeah me neither I don't know who like runs that yeah and even then like is is that can that group of people be easily Auto Nation who's that yeah I have no idea that's hilarious and guys guys Blue Book
is uh it's a car dealership company yeah okay and Blue Book is i' I've found values in there that are so that are so far off like so so far off meaningful that I just I just wouldn't trust it at all and just is irrelevant to me because I want it to be not like Tesla that decides yeah obviously I mean Tesla is full of as we've heard Top Gear 1224 uh I forgot about this Tesla literally told people by now before the price increases like once everybody figures out what a great deal this is
this is to get a fully autonomous car okay people kept on saying Kelly owns it Kelly founded it um Kelly Blue Book is owned by Cox Automotive Cox  yeah yeah I uh I I I don't I don't know what the right solution is like I I I feel like I feel like I should be entitled to something and not like a $12 check from a class action you know what I mean yeah the class action checks where the lawyers take all the money anyways are always so diso system is so broken and it's frustrating to me that nobody who's
in a position to fix it seems to treat it like a priority or not even priority as as something that even is a problem like it is mindblowing to me whenever I go down to the States how much of the billboard and TV advertisement space is taken up by lawyers because you can the the math is simple right yeah a law firm cannot afford to spend on Advertising more than in the long term anyway more than they bringing in Revenue right it must be significantly less than they bringing in Revenue which
tells you how big that industry is in America the fact that they can spend so much on and like how many people even get in a car accident and yet I can't drive from the airport to my hotel without see seeing 32 Billboards for what happens in case I get in a car accident driving from the airport to the hotel it's wild some of them are super specific too which I find always to be interesting did you get injured in this really weird specific odd way that you've never heard of before call me I
specialize in that it's like okay um something random says well they should just have to upgrade the computers in the cars and that's a potential solution here but I mean if they did that I think that' be fine yeah but at what point okay tell me this though if I'm Tesla should I be on the hook for upgrading some car forever that you've been driving forever I mean if you said it was going to work I it's one or the other guess yeah I mean I guess that I guess that's true
maybe you just shouldn't promise things that you can't deliver I guess yeah then's the consequences I mean as if they offered an option like hey we'll buy it back at market value or we'll or we'll upgrade it or what are the odds they do any of this zero I I I I have no faith if they if they did it then that's fantastic right um I just I I will be the first to talk about what a cool and amazing company Tesla is if they actually deliver on full autonomy for those Hardware 3.0
vehicles in any way shape or form so if they somehow manage to create a Magic model that works on them then I will I will and and it actually gets certified at what was it like level four was what they were targeting I I forget the exact details uh level four autonomous cars what's level four let me double check like double layered level four is considered to be fully autonomous driving uh if they can actually achieve level four autonomy with the current Hardware I'll be the first to say I was
wrong I suck um I I I owe Tesla and Elon Musk personally an apology um and you know what I'll say the same thing if to no cost to Tesla owners they upgrade the hardware to something that can do it I don't think they will I mean we have we have that would be cool though if they did that that would be very that' be cool we have a long history of this company's management short changing People whether it's not paying rent on the buildings you know for some stupid social media company they acquire or
whether it's you know stiffing people on their um on their expected payouts forur their Severance like what whatever it is there's a there's a long history here of just kind of being a nozzle so um good luck everyone sorry y'all here's an interesting one uh shraff 2K in full plan chat said what about the cyberpunk Edition Xboxes sold that can't play the 2.0 update or expansion ooh cuz that's an interesting one because that's time that they sold that's not on Microsoft or Sony at that
point at the time that they sold I'm sure they could play all of what cyberpunk offered yes but then the software updated but tell me this if I'm the console manufacturer and all that ever goes gold on my platform is the shipping disc which I mean it's a miracle that went gold in that case at all but that's a whole separate conversation uh how could I possibly be liable for some future update that the game manufacturer rolls and and in this case I don't see how anything would prevent the
manufacturer uh would prevent the console maker from basically saying like yeah we're not going to accept any future updates to this game on these platforms as long as you know you see project red make sure that the the highest level that they were certified to run remains available on them I mean I I I see a I see an easy solution that doesn't leave anybody holding a bag there so you get what you paid for and you don't get less but you don't get more yeah you don't you don't get any
new content or anything like that interesting sheesh I mean I'd be pretty annoyed yeah yeah I'd be annoyed too but like realistic really hard time reselling it at any good value but there's a lot of precedent for this already too like look at Minecraft if you if like exactly right you see where I'm going with this like there is no way look at World of Warcraft would you seriously buy World of Warcraft today and expect to run it on a Pentium 3 wonder I I was going to say I
wonder I mean you I don't think you'd even be able to install it no you wouldn't cuz you'd have to install it on like XP I have I have screenshots of wow on XP so like here's the original system requirements um oh let's go found this on imer here we go 2004 uh yeah okay oh man photo here we go Pentium 3 800 mahz or AMD Duron 800 MHz 256 megabytes yes megabytes of ram go recommended GeForce FX 5700 class card or above man man ATI dude always got such a such a they always got
this shaft man in the GeForce 5000 era the FX series was a piece of yeah and still they couldn't AR themselves to put an AMD equivalent card in here they couldn't put 9600 rad on 9600 in here I had an ATI card back then no acknowledgement of AMD what or ATI rather before AMD acquired them no ack ement of ATI whatsoever that is just man no no wonder they just never no wonder they have never managed to get there I think I think their uh their discret card market share is down close
to 10% now like it's between I think it's between 10 and 20% like they are just a complete non-factor you're still running yours yeah uh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah no driver issues still running 7900 XTX driver I haven't had really any issues with it at all nice to be honest with you other than when a bunch of water spilled through it well that's recently that happened again um this time it wasn't my fault but wait is it still alive yeah it lived wow whole system lived yeah that's actually pretty
cool both servers lived mostly uh one of them a bunch of the nvme ebays in the front are dead okay uh you can probably get a replacement part you know what I guess it's story time it's story time so I came home um the night after after the day that I found out about my sister's death I came home after W show that night and I had had a very challenging 24 hours already and I um heard like I was getting some food or I was about to get some food and uh no one no one else was home yet so the house was empty I
kind of come in I was going to get some food and I heard like a weird like  noise like something like that that he's checking in on and I was like what where's that coming from I go into the computer room upstairs I go okay yeah no I don't see anything in here and uh but but it's louder in here and then it dawned on me it's because it's under me so I went down into the basement got louder and louder louder I got into the mechanical room oh no the loop for the systems so
there's two Loops in there one Loop goes to a heat exchanger and out to the pool and the other loop goes to the heat exchanger and goes to the um uh goes to the systems okay so it's the loop that's going to the systems that is running dry so I immediately pull the plug on the pump I'm like okay okay what's okay what's going on here okay why is this Reser rning dry can be super bad for them why is this Reservoir empty and I go well maybe it evaporated like maybe maybe it evaporated and got
an air bubble cuz it's not empty empty right um and I was like yeah I noticed the coolant was a little low but like I thought I you know real you get a little bit of evaporation um but you know I didn't think it was that yeah I didn't think we were that close right like I I I would have topped it up and I go okay so there must be a leak where is it and that's when I realized that the server rack had peed itself so so it was dude it was gallons of water um and what happened was the fact that gallons of
water went through that rack and not hold on we're getting to that okay so at the bottom of my rack I have a lead acid battery UPS from Eaton above that I have a lithium battery UPS from Eaton above that I have an aircooled hard drive server from 45 drives storinator above that I have an air cooled nvme server it's like ancient it's likeon V3 or something like that yeah or V4 maybe I think it might be V3 anyway it's that weird simply double one that has two 24 Bay things one in the
front and then the lift up one in the back that's an important detail for later above that is EV Von's water cooled but self-contained it's not cooled by the whole Loop so self-contained water cooled gaming rig for you uh my one that is it has a valve in it so I it can be self-contained if I needed to like go to a land or something but it could also be just the valve can be opened and it can be run through the pool Loop uh not the pool Loop the the internal Loop to the heat exchanger and
then above that are the five one use for the land Center so I started at the bottom pulled out the UPS um the lead acid one was off obviously so I I pulled that out tipped it water just comes out of it like okay  uh H don't you have a saltwater pool okay for the love of God guys there's two Loops okay one Loop out to the pool and it doesn't take in pool water okay it goes to a heat exchanger there's another loop that's just inside it's running it's running regular water with
some iodine in it it's fine the tubes that go to the pool are are sealed and they go around the walls of the pool to take the heat yes yeah not they don't go into the water of the pool there's no pool water anywhere okay I'm not saying it went well I'm just  idiot I do this for your entertainment are you not entertained there was a new Gladiator filming or something I don't know about that I don't know yeah we'll see how it goes um okay so anyway I I pull out the lithium one which is still
on by the way at this stage in the game it's wet on top and I'm like okay let's get this unplugged get this battery out like immediately yeah yeah yeah all right I'm taking my time here because I just I don't have the mental or emotional capacity to think about what happens if all of this is dead at at this stage that I'm at right now pull aon's machine tilt the water off it pull up my machine tilt the water out of it I'm like stacking up computers around the room on their sides so that
water will drain out of them at this point so I start so I start pulling out I start pulling out machines I start pulling out machines it's the third one it's 1 2 3 4 5 the third one out of the one U that somehow the fitting corroded off a block so it was literally just gushing water out into this system yeah this was not a leak this was a a nozzle it was fully flowing the faucet  um where was I going with this you just pulled that system out the third third uh one system why did I start story time
though 7900 XTX is still running fine oh yeah right right right right right so let's continue telling the story okay so I pull the system out and I realized holy crap yeah all those gallons of water went straight through the rack so any screw holes in the top and bottom of any systems like just it went through so I start looking more closely at everything that I've pulled out there's of water or that like beaded water on motherboards um thankfully most things missed power supplies for the most part
which would be a more catastrophic situation like you can have a short on a motherboard and kill a motherboard you can have a short in a power supply and burn down the building it's a lot worse right um so I got everything out and I kind of went it's time to go get that food that I needed it's all off now yeah it's off now yeah nothing's in any immediate danger of being on fire so the Wi-Fi is still working that's at the top of the rack so none of my family's going to complain about any of
this um well actually the kids are pretty upset that their gaming rigs don't work but well we'll get to that later um and then the next day I come back it's a weekend thankfully it's Saturday so I start to put things back together I put the battery back in the bottom ups and I kind of go okay she's dead Jim now interestingly I found one of the same model on eBay that obviously is like shipping damage just crap like the the chassis is so busted but they claim works for 500 bucks which is like
a tenth of what it's worth and I thought that might actually be kind of a fun video resurrecting my water damaged uh ups but could be kind of Niche I don't know anyway I was really tempted to buy it and eBay's got a feature now where you look at something and then go away from it and like the seller can send you an offer so they offered me 10% off it so it could be even less than 500 bucks I was thinking about it I haven't bought it yet but I'm thinking about it it's a kind of neat feature actually so I put
that back in like we know you'd watch flow plane yeah I know you guys you guys watch everything um so so I put that back in and I'm like okay this clearly isn't working so I don't even have the like Nemo whatever four-prong stupid connector now to power my pdu so that's my fancy power bar that goes at the back of the Rack or to go into my 208 volt is it 28 or 2 208 or 240 volt on that one 230 I can't remember but my my 200 plus volt Outlet that I have at the back of the rack so I'm like okay I'm going to
have to run to the office and get like a like an adapter magig or I'm I'm going to have to find something or I'm going to have to go get a pdu that um oh wait no I realized I was an idiot because I could have just plugged my pdu directly into the wall that was funny look I was not in a great state of mind so then I find that the lithium One turns out is way better sealed probably because of the lithium batteries it's actually IP rated not for water but for dust oh but if you have a
dust I yeah you're probably sealed a little better than something that just like doesn't have an IP rating yeah fired up immediately totally worked fine kept a very close eye on it for many hours and it's working now so we're 50/50 so far for survival now I turn my attention to the hard drive server this has my onsite redundant copy of everything that's on the nvme server however um a fair um it's been a while since I've like manually copied it and my automation stopped working at some
point a while back and I was like I will deal with this and then I didn't anyway you know that you know how in the mechanic with the broken card oh speaking of uh fixing things like that that thing that you have me cced on to to fix I took you out of the loop so we'd stop spamming you but it's moving forward that's super cool okay we'll talk about that later uh anyway so the hard drive machine I look through it I'm like okay water only ended up on the motherboard which means that worst case
scenario I pop all these hard drives into a different chassis or I replace the motherboard and we're probably Off to the Races but hey who knows press the power button she fires up immediately couldn't believe it there were puddles of water on that motherboard that puddles sir this whole story is so interesting to me because in you know early 2000s if this happens they would all be dead any amount of water on the board is dead immediately so much resiliency these days amazing okay I plug in the envyme
server cuz I'm at a 66% success rate dang they be survivors right so I plug in the nvme server this has the most recent copy of everything zero drives detected which is good news because it's not it's not like half of them or a couple or something exactly so it's running a raid Z2 of some sort I think I can sustain two failures and it's like a super wide stripe because YOLO uh anyway the point is not a single Drive is detected now this is a lot less convenient to move to a different
chassis I mean where am I going to get a computer that can accept 24 nvme drives yeah but I had an idea okay if it's a back plane that's dead what if I crack open the chassis throw it on the test bench open up that that Middle Bay of 24 drives and start throwing them in there first drive lights up put all 24 drives in oh so tedious and like the tension's pretty high right so oh yeah so so I put in all the drives I fire it up and the pool doesn't show up but that's okay because ZFS things so I'm able to
just repport or whatever the terminology is and server survives we're at a 75% survival rate here folks we have a component dead in one of them but nothing too serious I actually lied about the order a little bit the first thing that I did after I got power back to the rack was I checked yvon's machine because she had to get some work done and hers worked so sorry we are at now like 80 something 80 something low percent survival rate yeah next my gaming rig goes in no problem um next
two and then this was where I actually found out which rig was dead because I I popped number five back in I popped number four back in and the number three was the one that didn't appear to have water on it from the top but that's where the fitting corroded right off that was the first one that I wanted to that I that I that I opened up because mine and yvon's rigs could run self-contained so I didn't have to turn the loot back on yet so I didn't test five I didn't test four I
opened up three and that's where I found the fitting that corroded off opened up the block and there's a whole bunch of buildup there so something galvanic corrosion was happening somehow within that block and I'm still waiting to hear back from Ek on what exactly their theory is they have some ideas they've sent me already I'm not sure that I necessarily agree with them but there's clearly uh something eaten away and there's clearly something deposited somewhere else which to me is pretty
clear pretty clearly galvanic corrosion which shouldn't have occurred in that Loop yeah everything in that Loop was brass copper or plastic mhm um so TBD basically I haven't I haven't explored it any further yet because I want to make a video about it the shoot date is next Thursday so we you you guys will be getting a proper update uh so I haven't tested systems 5 and four because until I crack open every single fitting I'm not going to know what's corroding and what's not but what I did do was I took
one of the other systems and popped open one of the fittings and they are immaculate perfect so it's that one very much in particular for some reason yeah so so story time though I have I I did I did try to fire up system 3 on the bench it's dead makes sense that's the one that it was flowing in on yeah so it didn't leak through any holes or so I lost a UPS I lost system 3 system four and five are still TBD everything else survived except for an envyme back plane realistically that's fantastic I I could
not have possibly hoped for better for a better result especially with how much water flowing through like that's amazing yeah so I'm I'm pretty happy I forget how we got onto this topic but um we were talking about old gpus oh yeah right so my 7900 XTX oh right still working great ah so it's yeah so it's survived that even yes cool in spite of everything that's good to hear yeah I'm I'm pretty it was some good news at a time when I could use some good news yeah um I'm
glad it worked out as as well as it did because it certainly didn't have to all right what are we supposed to be doing ah yes topic two Luke would you like to pick a topic sure maybe one of  uh app company installs cameras and nightclubs a new app called two as in the number like not twwo but the the number two and the KN and IGT allows users to access live streams of the Interiors of local partner nightclubs this is supposed to be a way of helping users decide which nightclub they want
to go to but many clubgoers are upset at the idea of having an unknown number of invisible strangers watching them while they're trying to have fun uh also known as stalking uh according to the apps Founders they have introduced live stream blurring to ensure the anonymity I am just waiting for this feature to become pervasive everywhere cuz I mean realistically there are places where this sort of thing makes sense people pay mad money for it to having a weather cam having a weather
cam at the top of a ski hill that makes a lot of sense oh yeah having a lineup cam at something like a fery yeah that makes a lot of sense and occasionally some pretty wild stuff is going to get caught on cameras like that and people are going to end up embarrassed but if this becomes a norm right cuz I could easily see the same thing happening for a coffee shop I could see the same thing happening for a gym would yeah look look at the look on his face oh that's so bad but imagine
imagine gy is very bad imagine a normie okay who doesn't think about the Privacy implications of this stuff and is like oh wow so I can easily see if the gym is busy and decide if I want to hop over there would they sign that release there's so much easier ways though it doesn't matter would they sign that release because this company tonight or or the the many similar companies that are going to spring up are going to pitch this as as a complete you know uh prepackaged solution so you you know
Rando gym owner don't have to do anything they just come in they put their camera in and then all of a sudden we get a whole family family of new subreddits r/ Liv stream gym fails r/ Liv stream nightclub fails it's going to be great SL Club creeps um yeah I my my biggest thing that I immediately thought of was that you just have stalkers all over the place especially at nightclubs you'd have stalkers you'd have jealous uh suspicious spouses you'd have all this type of stuff and like the
the weird kind of like Gorilla Marketing that could happen for something like this to try to get someone to pay like a more premium subscription so that they can like better monitor if their partner is out clubbing when they think they're doing something else notore Max says they could have a feature where you can only watch for like 10 seconds because realistically that's all it should take to see if a club is overcrowded there are lots of mitigations that's actually a really
good idea that is a pretty good idea there's lots of mitigations that could make something like this less horrible but the thing about mitigations there's ways around them is that as soon as you implement them the arms race has begun and there's going to be people figuring out how to bought it so that they can continuously have a feed and they'll Stitch the whole thing together afterward that is good though it would stop most normies it St suggestion casual voyerism got to give him that
credit absolutely there's there's also there's other ways to track how many people are in a building without a video camera um sure yeah I mean you could use something like um like infrared you could use millimeter wave um there's that Bluetooth thing that tracks people when you move through malls and stuff yeah you could if you could if you were doing it anonymously you could just detect how many Bluetooth devices are in range given that pretty much everyone in their dog has a phone that would
actually give you a pretty good idea you're probably not bringing your airpods to the club yeah or if you are then that's fine because over a long enough period of time and a great enough sample size it would become just sort of a statistics problem then to figure out you know what constitutes busy versus what doesn't knowing that it's not one to one Bluetooth devices to people gray Bart in flo plane chat said my university has ocup space sensors in the gym and library that anonymously track
Wi-Fi and Bluetooth signals to estimate the number of people in the space yeah just do that it doesn't need to be a camera but what if you just what if you just want to see if the scenes hopping but this is I I I suspect the reason why it's a camera because these types of Technologies to do this with without using a camera have existed for a long time yeah but they're more expensive are they yeah I would think so than constantly live streaming video um oh that's a good question I mean the
constant live stream doesn't have to be like quality though yeah okay what were you going to say um the the cameras at the ferry I think that's just like very old it's existed forever I don't know whatever it's just been there for a long time they could have something better but it's been there for a long time the cameras at the ski hills that actually makes a lot of sense oh yeah you want to visually see it it's a different scenario um and usually they're in places that are really obvious there's
only one camera it stares at like a post so you can see the the like meter stick on the post to see how much snow they're actually is if if it's buried um that type of stuff all make sense a camera inside of a nightclub constantly filming doesn't make sense to me uh the public webcams aren't typically live they do still frames every however many seconds according to QTC MV 30 of what uh whatever like car lineup or whatever that makes sense as well but I mean if you were trying to track a person he'd
still be able to figure it out see their car there this is wild this is one of those things where there's just so many other solutions that it blows my mind that an entire like startup slash app development sense yeah someone someone was like you know what the best solution is this horrible thing that is obviously not the best a really hard time believing that this is just like ignorance uh I I feel like they're  voyerism or lazy it's got to be incredibly lazy just never looked up any potential other way
of doing this man now I'm I'm such a firm believer in hanlon's rais like there is this could be very adequately explained by incompetence 100% yeah they're just dumb they were like oh web commodity webcams can be had for $4 on Al AliExpress let's build a subscription model around it here's a here's a potentially like a psychology question um if you're a really busy nightclub that does really well yeah would you want this oo do you want to advertise that you're full do you think
more people are going to come and like line up to or do you want to advertise that you're not full I have no idea I would ask you guys you know what clubbers prefer but you probably don't know either let's be real it's Friday night and you're here you you want to go to the full ones you want to go to the full ones yeah you wouldn't go to a club that has like four people in it I mean that's true but like do you want to go to a full so is it a webcam right I forgot Dan's other life
he was like a DJ or something right I mean that kind of depends what you're what you're looking for right I mean do you want to go and like really party hard do you want to go and have like something casual you know Dan I'm it's Friday night and I'm here yeah I've been here and also Saturdays like for the last forever you know they're open late right go at like 2 a.m. I've gone to a club I think one time ever uh I went with Nick light and we went because there was a DJ going there that we liked
their music we went literally just to like listen to the music and then left when the DJ left that's extremely valid I've done that thank you you know you go and get some bottle service you listen to your DJ and then you go home I had no intention of like socializing with women I just I wanted to go see the DJ I enjoyed the the set and then I left that I didn't drink anything I don't I don't remember but I don't think Nick drank anything we went home and probably played League of
Legends you don't remember but you didn't drink anything well no I know I didn't drink anything um I don't remember if he drank anything this is hilarious ious I love it I mean look I would laugh at you more except that I have never been to a nightclub actually that's a lie no that's a lie I have been to nightclubs in Vegas during CES in my like vendor relations days and I don't really count those for real I was like going there to make connections like it was I was not there because I wanted to
be there I honestly forgot about all of that I've technically done that as well I think I've actually seen some very famous performers there but I don't know I don't know DJs yeah so like I don't remember but but there there were there were events where it was like oh yeah this is like a big deal oh one of them one of them like um uh oh hold on uh I know yeah yeah this guy uh John Legend was there at one at one at an event one time like the amount of money that these companies spend on events
sometimes is Absol absolutely wild oh who's that who's that crazy good female singer I forget her name uh give me give  singers uh I don't know man was it was it a Dell I can't remember it it was someone Super Famous that Google hired for uh for an event at one point and I was there I was like well I was wild might have been her I don't I don't remember I'm not going to I'm not going to say who it was cuz I  um at a recent event Google I think it was Google had a a dude there playing
music that I think is really cool no I don't no I don't think it was aele was someone else some someone like that like someone with a really amazing um that's how you pronounce it with really amazing vocals or something anyway I give up what were we talking about oh yeah right right cameras and nightclubs we don't like it any of them cool all right Dan what's next oh it was Alicia Keys I think it was Alicia  available why why so mean well I mean he's not wrong here we go but why
here dang yeah what is it what is it exactly W she'll make herself available yeah yeah I'm I'm I'm I think it was I think it was Alicia Keys um anyway she was great um yeah everybody callage whatever Dan might say about her I was meaning exactly that yikes oh you're meaning that she would be expensive yeah Oh I thought you meant like appearance definitely has I know that's what I uh that's what I wanted to interpret it as but no like appearance fees are normally seven figur
yeah I mean not for her apparently but oh just about almost got him uh okay well oh yeah explain merch messages oh wow ooh it's an exciting day for Merch messages my friends lime day is officially back that's right right now uh well sort of it's going to be July 16th to July 19th on LT store.com this is one of our biggest deal events of the year because hey we figure if Amazon's going to make up a bull nonsense shopping holiday then we might too we might as well participate too except ours is going to

anything's blah blah blah yeah anyway New York Islander says I love my polar fleece it was my sweater of choice for family parties over the fall and winter buy another one then all right cool I know it's summer but there's get you know that the seasons change predictably right there will be an opportunity to wear a winter garment again I don't know about that oh man do we have shorts on sale right now uh not today yeah but like we oh like just for sale at all I'm actually not sure it's a good question
oh there's one other update before we do merch have the swim trunks so the way merch messages work you add the item you want to your cart there's a little box where you can type what you want to be your merch message it'll go to producer Dan who will reply to it or who will blast it up on the bottom of the screen down here or who will forward it to someone who can answer you or who will curate it for me and Luke to respond to on the show Dan's going to show you how it works in one moment after I just give
you guys a reminder that the lmg garage sale is tomorrow yeah it's from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. at the labs building which is just on Google Maps um we have 4 00 plus items keyboards mice headset speakers computer components we actually found some backpacks that we can sell at the garage sale that may have light scuffs or marks but are perfectly functional no other LT store items will be available for purchase you must find street parking somewhere we do not have a big parking lot and it's credit debit
only so either street parking or use um um or use the public transit that's the word I was looking for should we fly in for this no you should not you will definitely spend more on your plane ticket than you will save people ask that every time I know don't it sounds like a talking point at this point but I know it's not this is not reverse psychology don't fly out for this not fly out for this it's not like a meet and greet it would be very bad and dumb do not yeah cool all right Dan you want
to show us how merch messages work I just got like a thousand well that's what happened you should have thought of that yeah it's my fault really yeah uh let's do three why not hello Darius van and cook any thoughts about the current state of game optimization it feels like AAA games lately have increasing minimum requirements with barely improved graphical quality uh oh wait hold on I just want to say something really quick you guys are ordering up these track jackets and
joggers like buy the bucket full um if you'd consider buying something else you know theoretically loss leaders are supposed to serve a purpose where like you buy something that has some margin in it and we don't totally lose our shirts um I'd be pleased as Punch If you would also buy something else because these are priced well below our cost uh we're just trying to We're just trying to make some room in the warehouse you know um so yeah maybe why don't I pick why don't I pick out a couple of items
for you that have decent margin okay that are relatively new arrivals perhaps um oh God why do we have a sold out item oh I have a comment here from uh from nickl oh you could pick up a retro monitor pet cave see look reviews are in already and they love it see look great cave my cats love it so you could pick up a little pet cave it looks like a cute little CRT monitor hold on I'll get to you in a second Dan first I need to find some stuff with Mar you could buy a screwdriver uh you could buy do we have
backpacks in stock yes we do you could buy a backpack you could pick up our stylish dip dye hoodie uh what else you could oh you could get a desk pad you could pick up a desk pad we have we have desk pads uh there they are we have lots of different colors and styles they they really are a great deal but we do we do have some margin on them especially if you buy a smaller size the smaller size ones have more margin you could buy a T-shirt oh no our margin sucks on t-shirts uh retro
monitor cave is almost sold out there's only about 10 left oh what yeah we burned through almost all of them last week on The W show oh balls 14 left 14 left uh H you could oh you could buy a Labs phas pullover hoodie you know what buy buy a Dropout the Dropout stuff is so underrated yeah it's so comfortable buy a Dropout hoodie or Dropout uh track pant or sweatpants it's all very comfortable yeah they're really good it's my favorite stuff to put on after I like shower after a workout yeah drop
out sweatpants go get them see look literally five stars good stuff okay yeah please buy something other than just the Lost leader and as Nick light says uh we're losing loads of money  LOL okay what's the best rain gear on LTT store oh we actually have a really nice uh we have a really nice jacket here you go um get this one I know it says windbreaker but it's um if it was on any other store it would be called waterproof but we call it water resistant because we're pedantic like
"that uh but it's rated for 10,000" millimeters which is 10 meters of water resistance rating um dual layer membrane Aqua seal zippers we we should we should probably Market this differently it's a really really nice jacket very nice sorry for not being super communicative I've been using you carrying the show as time to help Dan not get buried oh right that's a concern a lot of them a lot of them are like wow this is awesome thank you okay cool Dan got this I'm fine I'm used to this why
don't we do a couple merch messages then maybe Luke could pick them so that Dan can keep clicking on I'll be okay okay Dan's got it don't take his JW he's got it I have one thing to do here union  union who know what is the what everything is fine here what is the past trauma that I'm triggering here Dan no nothing nothing nothing all right uh let's see uh didn't I already ask you one and then you told me to shut up let's see I what what is about the AAA games Scrappy DP asks
which is more profitable the tracksuit  tracksuit easy yeah D you could say that   streaming I wonder how much Wan shows cost you oh dude I could tell you what don't tell them oh like the float plane streaming costs oh I have no idea just one W really what is one wanch of wait wa wait we're fine full plan's fine but I thought we don't even I thought I thought we don't how many I thought you didn't even know how many people watch live how can you possibly know how much it's costing we
know how much data goes through well then why don't you know how many people are watching cuz quality levels and all this other type of thing I bet you could approximate I've told you forever we can approximate it's just not accurate oh yeah this has always been the case how much does l show cost oh a lot I'd have to like look it up but like you said you said you could tell me and then you're just going to give me a giant this second well realistically AJ's probably looking it up already if he's around
almost certainly what I more meant was the total over the years though okay so what's that I I have to look it up well then why you I feel I feel like I didn't mean I could tell you right now I was telling you that's something that I can like that's a number that I can give for you and it's really high wait hold on wait hold on how do people on float plane know how many viewers there are they say there's about 800 something viers they are also guessing based off of the viewer list but as I have to say every
time the viewer list doesn't work 100% because there's different add-ons people can have in their browsers that block things that result in the viewer list not showing it so the number CTO be able to do this we can oh dude no problem no problem I'll 100 times more the developers we have right now we'll solve all these different problems for you not an issue problem we have with Flo plane we can solve very quickly it just takes lots more money than we're spending right now no no issue um but yeah the
viewer list is always less than the actual amount of people watching right because if someone has ad block on or something like that or basically always there's at least a few people in that category and it's not just ad block not all ad blockers were blocked this in our audience privateers uh it's been a while since the last time we like checked which things will actually block the viewer list um if I remember I'm not going to like go through them right now but a lot of the popular ones don't um
because it's been like they've UND it's not a problem and it's it's been reported enough that it's not a problem but there are pretty much always um some that do block it got it it is what it is it's not something that we've like worked on because who cares fine yeah I'm over it yep merch message sure Dan hello Darius man and cook any thoughts about the current state of game optimization oh right you read this feels like AAA games lately have increasing minimum requirements with 
okay it's diminishing returns on Fidelity so like they're they're making improvements they might even still be making 10% improvements but it's 10% on something that's already really high so it's hard for you to be able to really tell and if this highlights anything I think it's the cleverness of old school developers the kinds of the kind I remember watching this this video on like how they did scope Reflections back before Reflections weren't a thing and it was like it was this Wild Thing where
there was like there was like a fake alternate version of the Skybox of the like something and it it would invert it and just like it the whole thing was fake the whole thing was fake but you would never notice notice it in a thousand years of play of playing the game um and and so a lot of what you're seeing today is oh but we did scope Reflections but real and it's super computationally intensive scope reflection yeah it's super intensive but the the meaningfulness to you the average
gamer is basically zero so it feels like okay so look at something like vegetation do you remember the first game that popped up where they showed like oops uh where they showed actual reactive vegetation yeah a character model like crouching through ferns or something what game was it was it crisis 2 or somethingis I don't know it was it was it was it was something but they there was like this like kind of viral thing where they showed a a player character like crouching and going
through like some dense vegetation and like a like a fern like like like almost like it was on a hinge like moves out of the way and then goes back super cool Conrad said volumetric Footsteps in sand snow and mud yeah like snowrunner having like your tires make proper imprints into the ground stuff like that's crazy but the thing is that not really anymore but crazy when Happ we were able to do a big leaf thing on a hinge you know 15 years ago or whenever that game came out
was it Far Cry it might have been Far Cry uh Far Cry is such a good game you should play it you've never played ital I watched you play it you streamed it one night um okay so we could do that 15 years ago so now okay you can have like you know 25 hinges on this plant you know for this bunch of leaves and this bunch of leaves is that making that meaningful a difference to Everyday gameplay if you're going from you know 10 polygons to 12 it's like whoa world changing if  it's that
AAL so there's a big so there's a big kind of diminishing returns Factor here and another another key thing to understand is that when you're looking at new games that are coming out how good they're going to look is so dependent these days on where we are in the current generation console life cycle so what I suspect is that we're going to start to get and and realistically we already are starting to get now that we're deep enough into PlayStation 5 and Xbox series we're
starting to get games that really do look and behave meaningfully differently from the games that were designed for the last generation consoles and as developers continue to squeeze more performance out of these current gen consoles we're going to start to see them to we're going to start to see them utilize them in ways that are more meaningful to gameplay whether that comes in the form of more destructive environment Ms or whether that comes in the form of more interactive elements in
environments like the like the the accurate you know tire tracks in the snow does that change gameplay a lot no but what I bet you would find is if you go back and play an older game that just has two versions of the snow texture one with a tire mark down the middle of it and one without it right you're going to you're going to you're going to be playing that game and you're going to go man this feels like janky and cludy yeah um it's it's small less noticeable stuff yeah so I think part of it is that it's
not as exciting to go forward as it is jarring to go backward um and lighting is a big part of that lighting is so hard we're also not running into as much of like uh like when we were growing up you see like the first 3D game yeah and it's like oh wow and then you see like the first 3D game that doesn't look like butt yeah and it's like oh wow and then the first 3D game with physics that like actually matter and stuff like there's these really big like oh my goodness technological jumps and now we're we've
we've passed a lot of those I think in in the sense of the things that we've traditionally done in video games and the the the hurdles that are the most obvious to jump over there's still stuff that people are going to figure out to do that's really cool technologically um but a lot of the obvious ones are done now um so when a new game comes out I don't think the graphical Fidelity is necessarily the main thing that people are are looking for um like what I I don't remember the name of that game
that came out recently but it was like megabytes it was Tiny animal well people love it because it has an art style the art style itself matters now there isn't so many limitations to art style anymore I mean look at Star Citizen um like they're just they're just cranking everything so I don't know yeah I think that's it all right let's see D Gro question mark I I don't know remember  exciting oh boy but it like actually was yeah like that was that was crazy yeah wow the bottle comes out like look
at those face yeah yeah you know like it's and and it's not just you completely flat like there's a nose you got a polygon there yeah that's that was nuts that was wild and like the hair the hair is like like 20 polygons it's not just painted onto the circle that is her head yeah textured it's textured look at these textures like that looks like you know like old and stuff yeah wasn't half lifee one the first game with the bones people had bones I don't remember that maybe if I
understand correctly that it was like the first game that used skeletal models I think halflife has always been like the new tech kind of thing I don't know if that's accurate or not uh some people people in chat are saying I think so there was also there was a huge amount of innovation movement for a long time there the TitanFall games a bunch of the Cod games and stuff like that we really working on like parkour stuff sliding different things like that that's where a lot of technological
advancement was for a while tral it feels like lighting yeah is like the main focus of the industry lighting and Lumen and you really won't notice it like I said going un and then you'll go back and you'll be like this just looks so flat and dull it feels old don't why lighting color HDR those going that's a oh that's a big one right like if you're running one of the latest games and you're running it on a non HDR display I I would make the argument that for a AAA game that's really designed to
be played on you know a thousand nit Peak brightness display in HDR you are probably not having the full experience of what it's supposed to look like because of how much they're investing in that lighting technology in that game yeah and like obviously lighting and character movement these are things that people have worked on forever but there was a bit of a character movement Renaissance a little while ago with those games that I mentioned and lighting has been a huge Focus for a
while now I don't necessarily know what'll be next but nanite I've been seeing some interesting stuff with uh procedural animations so you only have to make like six poses I mean this is all real engine five stuff but that's too Cutting Edge to be included in like the next couple releases um like simplifying things now that that we're getting into super high resolution stuff uh like polygons and and that sort of doesn't even matter anymore R Racing is another big one but again that's
lighting right I don't know remember when ragd doll physics was the new hotness yeah that was a huge deal wasn't that halflife 2 with the Havoc engine was another huge leader in that I could watch this over and over and over again for the rest of my life and still find  oh my gosh do you guys remember this Benchmark I never seen this before yeah it's a it's a ragd doll physics  Mark I also do remember the first game I don't remember what the game was but I remember um yeah someone said Prince of
Persia was the the big movement game uh sorry I'm going to come back to what I was just saying in a second but Brink actually um search like first shooter game with parkour movement Brink comes up I was so incredibly excited for brink and then they just like borderline lied about a bunch of stuff and it really pissed me off and all my friends quit like almost right away there was supposed to be uh like a single player campaign but it was just the multiplayer maps with like a storyline intro video
thing and then Bots playing the exact same game mode that multiplayer played it was just it was BS Brink was Brink was rough but it brought parkour movement to the 3D space right in a really interesting way that's cool and like all long time ago rink was released 2011 it's a lot older than a lot of people think it's like vaulting and sliding I hate that 2011 is a lot older than people think it really is though yeah yeah if okay uh Dan hit us again sure uh d grock i often wonder how much
foresight successful business people have starting out in early lmg did you envision having a logistics Department a clothing line Labs or a racket ball SL land Center no no I mean I think having a Testing Lab yes yeah that was something that I had wanted from day Zero uh but it was very expensive and continues to be very expensive it's a it's a it's a big challenge to do scalably um in any kind of meaningful way like yeah we could we could test one thing um no problem but building processes around
it um has proven to be extremely challenging I mean we knew it was going to be really hard and you know we're not giving up um but it turns out we were  hard okay last one for to the team for smooth the lab's website navigates by the way oh they've got that they've got a um for oh hold on they've got a new review up and this is hilarious this will be the true test of whether LT Labs can be unbiased or not it's a review of the Intel Arc a770 this is a bit of an inside joke but
Gary head of labs is uh is very hopeful about Intel's prospects in the consumer GPU space he's been in the industry a long time a very very very long time he's been in the industry a long time and he has been on on pretty much every side of it um so you guys probably know he worked at Asus before he was here but before that he worked as a writer at anandtech for a number of years and so he's he's seen the industry from a lot of different perspectives now he's back on the media side and what he has
recognized is that Intel for all of their warts um could be a viable competitor to keep Nvidia honest and keep them somewhat focused on Gamers um anyway so so we we joke about him being biased towards Ark because he really is rooting for it to succeed but he would never allow that to Cloud our conclusions about a product so that's the that's the background um but anyway product overview uh so this was written up by Oni I think right yep there you go written up by Oni um so this is this is
handwritten this is handwritten I believe actually I'm not sure I'm not sure about the rest of it but oh look we've got our interactive Luma field slides so there's our scan of it and so if you guys want to see the latest iteration of the site uh you can interact with the charts you can actually change the uh colors of the charts oh how do you do that Luke I forget how to do that's in your profile settings so if you click on the Cog wheel in the top right you can do uh chart data color presets this this can
be very helpful um if you have a variety of different uh like Vision alteration challenges things so if you if you're color blinded different ways you can you can adjust it or if you just have an easier time looking at a different set of colors you can save it but it's set for your profile so you don't change it for every chart you just change it overall yep thanks I forgot anyway so the a770 it's a competitive mid-range card and as long as the price is right it's actually pretty
viable it you got to admire the commitment I actually think it's really cool that they decided to review this so far after the fact partner cards are available for as low as $280 yeah making it pretty darn reasonable I hope battle mage doesn't suck dude um we've got some other new reviews up so those of you who are upset about the AI voice on PSU circuit uh you yeah here we go uh guys you do not have to listen to it so the power supplies that we cover here we've actually oh we just got a fresh one up
the tough power GF A3 750 watt you can see these are actually getting like they're kind of getting views like it's not a lot obviously but for a unit that anyone cares about if we can scale this if we can do you know 5x that or 10x that this will be very sustainable in the long term I hope um but anyway if you're not into you know AI voice videos you could just read the articles boom look at that testing was incomplete due to Hardware failures this happened with two different samples and this is why what
we're doing is important guys because testing a thing one time is fine for making YouTube videos and it's something that we have been able to do for a very very long time but building a process where we can go through and we can methodically make our way through the product cataloges of the major manufacturers and separate the wheat from the chaff is really freaking hard um it takes a lot of equipment it takes a lot of people power it takes a lot of time and investment and we're
finally getting there overall Labs does not recommend this power supply and if we weren't doing this man there's categories that are basically dead in terms of independent validation and testing exactly and that's YouTube is where a lot of the money is these days and there's no money in written so um yeah I'm I'm so stoked I'm so excited for what the team is doing uh there was an interesting thread on the subreddit asking how will LTT Labs make money and to answer that um they won't for now but
in the long term uh LTT Labs plan linch tips.com I'm going to see if I can find it but I I wrote up uh a blog post like a thousand years ago where I basically laid out what the plan is for labs and guys it hasn't changed uh the plan for the lab is still the same uh let me see if I can lab's Vision here we go I think  it oh goodness this is going to take me a minute so Luke do you want to stall for time for me sure you want another topic um no doesn't want another topic
if you are on the lab's website and you do want to leave some feedback I know it it might look like a cookie Banner but it's not at the top of the page there is a bluish Banner that uh is asking for feedback there's a link there to a Google form if you want to leave your feedback there it would be appreciated um as as much as I like talking to you guys in flow plane chat and wherever else it's very hard for me to take notes while I'm on the show and it's a lot better if you just leave it through the
feedback form okay I found it um and actually just as an example of how it's hard to do this sort of thing scalably uh we had some criticism of our battery life our our battery longevity test that running it at 720p uh is stupid essentially um and you know what you're right there's arguments that you could make for doing anything else uh you could do General web browsing uh you could you could take you could take uh network connectivity out of the equation and just you know
perform local tasks you could uh you could manually determine you could manually force uh which decoding engine you're using from YouTube you could that you could run it at a higher resolution you could run it at 1080p uh there's all these different things that you could do and there's these these different arguments you could make but at the end of the day we have to settle on something and the reason that we settled on 1080p playback at 200 nits is that that's a bar that every device can
hit so yeah looking at the latest thing you guys also have like an so that that's your like low bar test right do you also have like an expected use case test I thought so we have a stress test okay so we have we have uh an endurance test and we have a stress test what we would love to have in the longer term is a general usage test and a heavy usage test but not you know with power viruses but right what you've got to understand is that so I had someone helpfully comment and this is a good suggestion it
legitimately is a good suggestion I had someone helpfully comment in the uh in the form thread on that uh laptop testing video that we should really be benchmarking every laptop uh away from wall power and it's like yes you're you're not wrong that's a really good idea but think about the scalability if we were testing one laptop no problem hey John from Labs do you mind uh benchmarking it again with uh with the the on the battery okay but how are we going to scale that how are we going to
ramp that up so that every laptop that rolls through the door is going to be able to run in in a in in an automated fashion all of these different battery or all of these different performance tests where a human is going to ultimately have to be the one who you know disconnects things or or reconnects things if we run things away from Battery as well like the the number of interventions is something that we have to consider in all of this and you know yeah in the long term we'd love to have
a robot that you know plugs it in and then unplugs it and you know make sure that the that the charge state stays optimal so it would have to if so robots are hard yeah if you had a if you had a a laptop that had really poor battery life you might even have to be constantly monitoring uh the constantly monitoring like Hardware info to determine the current charge state so that you could stop the test plug it into charge for a little bit unplug it and then run the next test like there
there's there's the complexity of that is no problem when you've just got a human running a test but the complexity of that when you're trying to figure out how to create a workflow for this is very challenging um so we're going to guys we're going to we're going to figure it out isn't that what interns are for no uh we're going to figure it out but it's going to take a long time and maybe it will never be perfect but we're going to continue to try and do better and better and better
and better um so back to back to the question of how will LT Labs make money well it's going to help create content ideas for LTT which it already does um affiliate Revenue I do do we have links already yep oh yeah you guys should use them yeah I mean not on this power supply in particular we don't recommend this power supply but um hey there's that uh also don't have links on the arc no well that's cuz you can't buy that particular card oh um affiliate Revenue advertising on site this one is unlikely
I hate banner ads so there's that they also don't make a lot unless you do them in really annoying really intrusive ways uh we're getting into less likely things certification program/ third party validation um I've laid out my Arguments for why I don't think it's great uh turning our testing knowledge into our product development process so you are probably going to see some Labs knowledge in some of our future products uh pay walls um if we start testing things to a degree that the only people
who need to know are you know people making procurement decisions at large companies then yeah something like that could happen I want this to be a resource for consumers though so this seems unlikely uh direct sales products through the site um man sometimes I'm very blunt um I think it would be a very interesting outcome though cuz we're in this kind of dystopian hellscape right now where we actually shot a video today that was really interesting to me um we built the Home Depot gaming
setup yeah right my brain just about broke too when this was pitched in writer meeting but you can actually get a shocking amount of gaming stuff at the Home Depot what yeah especially online and one of the one of the questions that I just uh it wasn't in the script or anything but just ended up being just a conversation between me and Tanner on set was like when did every trusted retailer turn into a Chinese Marketplace like when and why happen yeah yeah that's true so also just in
case anyone was like what like I was yeah apparently what if someone started then from a place of trust and then was like Hey now that you're educated you can get something good that could be industry changing and for the better in a big way yeah I didn't expect things like like knockoff Apple keyboards to be sold at the Home Depot Home Depot it's bizarre  weird anyway is it sold on Home Depot first party or just third party sellers on the Home Depot website that I don't think this is going to be a
hot take I don't think that matters largely because of what lonus was just saying any website any store that has built its reputation for tons and tons and tons and tons of years and then has oh it's a third party seller it's not you know the most obvious piece of information that you're going to look at while you look at this page and you can just order it and buy it whatever it's it's weird um stores that have third party stores on them is very odd I don't like that Amazon does that I don't like
that a lot of these other places do that I think that should be left to places like eBay where that is the point of the website New Egg turned to garbage yes their main competitive advantage against Amazon was that they hadn't en ified yet and then they did it and then they did it and then they just did it so much worse now I I used to like that it was like a little bit of a Haven from that I didn't know that you had the same complaint I could tell that like I could trust newe to have probably somewhere
reasonably close to M MSRP pricing somewhere close to a representative selection of what is actually currently available in the market like that's the other thing too I I can't even tell what Hardware is in production anymore Y unless I what like call up Zotac and ask for our price list you know because it'll get they'll have ancient like refurbished cards all over the site now from random Chinese sellers I don't have the page up anymore but when you said you can't buy that a770 anymore um I I
almost reacted and was like yeah you can because I had just looked it up but then I realized oh it's almost certainly just a seller whatever site I was looking at it priced it three times what it should be because I guess they're hoping that someone's going to come across a positive review for this card and like buy it or something I don't and look being at NC I would occasionally see people order like long obsolete stuff for ridiculous pricing I'd be like why did this happen why I mean they must
need it for some specific reason but many times it wasn't something that they would need for compatibility with you know some weird arcade software you whatever right I'm technical enough to know probably that they just straight up didn't need that but they ordered it anyway and often at a completely ridiculous price and what really sucked is that as NC a lot of the time it was just a pass through listing from a distributor a distributor not like a Chinese you know Rando yeah so an actual like distributor
who just happened to have one of those that they like found and it ended up in the feed and they would sell to us at a fixed markup so we weren't even like making ra on this ancient Hardware you were just paying $600 for some old GPU and we were making you know 40 bucks on it or like okay great rough yep Zotac that's a throwback that's not a throwback Z's a zek's a Nvidia partner now I I think they're doing better now than they were 10 years ago yeah they seem to have a pretty good they seem to
have a pretty good reputation these days yeah when I first got into computer stuff no no slight to Zotac but when I first got into computer stuff Zotac was the kind of not as good brand they like oh you got one of those like I guess you wanted to like save money on that part of your computer they don't have that perception anymore and for good reason in my opinion red Fogle says did some digging your titanium heat exchanger is probably responsible for killing your water
cooling titanium sacrifices copper one small problem um the other fittings are perfect there's no reason for me to believe that that specific one is going to be the one that access the sacrificial anode also the fitting is made of brass which my understanding is um is that a similar spot like basically you need metals that aren't too far away from each other on whatever the scale is it's been a while since I've looked it up and I'm spotty on the details but uh copper and brass are extremely close to
each other so it is possible that uh you know titanium would find brass instead of copper as well but I I sincerely do not believe that that is it I I have a better Theory that's based on my conversation with EK all right oh sponsors my goodness are we at sponsor time already good gravy uh the show is brought to you by someone I'm not on the dock anymore whoops I can get it no I got it eof flow power outages got you cooking your pizza by candlelight um our sponsor ecoflow wants
to keep those bad experiences in the dark and bring light to your life and your pizza with their new Delta Pro 3 what the these are getting more and more unhinged I like this one it's a portable backup solution designed to power your home appliances the Delta Pro 3 can energize almost anything thanks to its "4,000 excuse me watt output via 120 volt" or 240 volt you can even expand this "capacity to a whopping 12,000 Watts with" their extra battery kits wait that doesn't sound right why would the for up
to 48 kilowatt hours that it can deliver more wattage if you oh because you'll have to have three of the of the actual like generator units okay * four that makes sense there or of the of the of the of the yeah okay whatever you guys get it charging the Delta pro3 is a breeze with its seven total methods of charging these charging methods can also be combined for fast um fast multi-charging solution yeah that's pretty cool because it can actually be charged at such a high rate that it's
like kind of not that conceivable that you will be able to charge it at its full speed off of like one plug um we are using the Delta Pro 3 at our smash Champs Badminton Center to provide backup power for our networking systems in case of outages it's really heavy to learn more check out our video from last week or check out the ecoflow website Linked In the video description these things are super cool they actually have fast enough failover that you can use them as a UPS as well

supposed to be I think game like this means just wirelessly all right learn more about the k6 five plus wireless at the link you press a button in the video description not this nice you can game for like oh well I automatically inserted word with my eyes nice yeah lus is getting worse hey it's over guys got him I got some more merch messages here for you all right hit me Dan all right let's see if I can find one uh hello wait hold on why don't we do a topic or two first we
we've done very few topics yeah okay all right according to xf1 Senior Systems engineer Dan Drury know as engine mode 11 on Twitter Formula 1 cars have an IP address when asked if this meant that the car could be hacked jury replied that the external actors aren't the main concern with this system it's the internal Electronics team who might accidentally connect to the wrong car or Flash the engine control unit of a car that is already running Drury then implied that this kind of thing had
happened before and had destroyed the engine of the car in question according to Drury he had the unfortunate job of trying to deploy Wi-Fi track side and the amount of noise and overlapping networks in the pit Lane gave him an aneurism discussion question would you be comfortable driving this type of car if you knew somebody could accidentally remote detonate the engine I mean there's lots of cars that are very hackable and there's certain reasons I am happy that I still have the car that I have um
o actually I want to derail this you had a big budget let's say uh 100 Grand US whoa so you got a big car budget that's like a lot of Canadian dollars that's a lot of can it's like "135,000 something like that 130 140,000" Canadian so you can basically buy any any car like functionally like obviously okay you're not getting a tricked out G wagon but you wouldn't so it doesn't matter um so you got you got 100 Grand and really what I'm getting at here is moderner features versus less moderner
features but like you could get a really nice older car for that money or you could buy something new that would also be really nice but it might report your driving habits to your insurance company for example a hypothetical example it's not like that happened recently in the last month or so um talk to me 100 Acuras stop it Dan I like that I was thinking you get seven cars in seven colors and then you can have one for every day of the week yeah I think the biggest issue at that point
would be parking them no you just leave it just like like you go millionaire mode but like under where you only wear it once except it's cars yeah yeah exactly uh an old imported Japanese Helix would be cool um the the only like I think I don't know this might bother some people but driving electric cars is I find very not satisfying so dropping the gas engine makes me kind of sad also it would be incompatible with where I live we have one parking spot that you can charge a car in and uh Emma already has an
electric car so like me having an electric car would be like actually genuinely very annoying um I'd have to like live off of the plugs here which a lot of people do which a lot of people do do or I'd be having to swap our our parked positions like constantly that would be a pain in the butt which would be very annoying so like I don't really want to do that if I if I did do that um there was uh you mean hux yeah that's what he said right I said Hilux I don't know whatever do
people call it hux it's a Japanese word anyway so yeah fair enough I have no idea um what's the name of that b the the uh the cars have those like tall vertical oval headlights oh rivan rivan there was a somewhat recent rivan announcement uh  r3x is that it but I thought you didn't want an electric I don't but then like what else is super modern that I would want I don't know one of these one of it's on my screen one of these yeah r3x r3x it didn't look quite the same as what was on your screen but
I don't know I L because hon there's a 0% chance I buy one yeah I know so like I guess what I wanted to know is would you would you give up that peace of mind of knowing that your car cannot be remotely accessed for modern Creature Comforts and performance that's the question I think I will have to eventually I'll be somewhat forced to Canada is making it so that uh all new cars that get sold their electric cars all electric cars are going to have these types of features in them um I don't think
there's any getting away from that even though it's completely unnecessary you don't have to have an electric car that has all these smart features and we could have cheaper cars that don't have them um I don't think anyone's going to go that route I don't think there's going to be cars that are available that way um yeah I don't really want them like I I'll I'll drive my my partner's car and I'll like intentionally want to drive in a certain way but her like Lane assist thing will
like and I'm like that was actually dangerous pretty much every time it happens cuz I was like I knew what I was doing I was intending to do the thing that I was doing I was driving with intention and properly and then the car was like nope go over there and it's like Whoa man I don't know I found that especially bad when you're driving like construction areas cuz they'll traffic cone you across a line I'm not supposed to signal right now but if I don't signal the car is going to try to rip me
over and it's like man this is not cool actually I don't really like those types of features I understand they might help some people that's cool whatever I don't want them personally um I also have no interest in my car being tracked I have no interest in any of that type of stuff I don't need any of those features I don't care my car doesn't have apple uh play my car doesn't have uh whatever the Android one is Android auto I don't care I just Bluetooth my phone into it it's
fine it's pretty nice I don't care Android auto was a game changer for me I would never buy a car without it why what what particular feature uh just Maps I just put my phone up yeah but it's like it's wireless now so you just don't do anything you just literally have your phone in your pocket and you're just in your car and then everything just works I get in my car with my phone in my hand and I go and then it's done which is which is fine but I don't I don't need to spend
like an incredible amount more money to automate that I could do that just fine I'll be all right right I don't know I love it I'm not against it to be clear I I don't have a huge issue with like Android auto being in my car I just don't care at all because my phone can do the thing already gaining no functionality B Bob says Luke just disrupted Android auto yeah with with with phones no people like this stuff I I understand I'm I'm not in the majority here um I just don't care I yeah that's
fair yeah luk is the biggest Tech leite I don't agree either um I just don't care about that yep um I care more about what my car can do how resilient my car is those types of things see I'm surprised you didn't come up with something cool like this was posted by langly man in the chat you could buy two of these 94 RX7 5-speed manual extensive modifications dang I I almost after a cold shower you know my car that I have outside was almost RX7 I was shopping for rx7s before I got that one the
reason why I didn't get one cuz I don't fit very well in the car yeah that's fair it's very small po cool though rotary engine well maybe this guy's done a lot of work to it it might be something else at this point but oh there's there's no way you could still call it an RX7 without having a rotary engine and come on yeah people still would the good old wanker modal wanker modal W wanker whatever I thought it was wle it's wankle I'm just okay I was just trying to get you to and
then I like did it wrong don't wor oh my God it's so funny I can't people like enthusiasts for this stuff are so predictable every single time I I say that they immediately unironically correct me it's like guys I know I know that's Pro that's probably like that's probably my phone blowing up from someone internally who's upset about it just relax I know yes wankle okay I'm 6'4 and fitting in na Miata I've I've actually had people tell me that I should try sitting in a Miata
my biggest thing is um I'm like tall average I'd say um but almost all my height is in my torso it's weird I'll sit next to people that are many inches taller than me and we look the same height and then we stand up and I'm like short compared to them it's it's it's odd um I I constantly get people that will because like if I sit up my chair is at the bottom his is at the top and if I sit up properly I'm still taller than he is people constantly at shows will come up to me and say that I'm a lot shorter
than they expected did you know this really I get that every single time I go to a show at least one person and the the answer is always because they see our Delta and expect me to be like enormous right okay and I'm like well no my torso is just really tall and we're often auto correcting for like leg length I don't know whatever it is what it is so I I have traditionally had a bit of an issue with sitting in cars but everyone tries to like scoot their seat up to give me extra leg room and I'm
like yeah that's actually not the problem that's like not going to help me very much at all actually my legs are probably fine for Luke it's tough to be luke it's all right actually um what else we got today ah yes the FTC tells tech companies to fix their bloody warranty policies they've sent warning letters to azrock gigabyte and Zotac for placing warranty void of removed stickers on and in their products according to the FTC this wording May discourage users from maintaining and repairing their devices
in violation of their legal rights furthermore the FTC warned that implying that continued warranty coverage requires the use of specific parts or Services may result in law enforcement action according to the letters companies have 30 days to review their promotional materials and warranties and to correct any violations I like that did they send them to other companies or are these just the companies that are like interesting to our audience uh I don't know that's a good question it would
feel pretty weird if it was like singled out to these three companies to be honest eight companies okay that makes a little bit more sense ays Health blue Air medify air oransi treadmill company in movement ASRock Zotac and gigabyte companies that market and sell gaming PCS Graphics chips motherboards and other accessories this is good though yeah it's good more do it yeah do it okay what else we got today oh we're supposed to do a couple oh we're supposed to do topics or merch messages
Dan well it's up to you uh we're out of order now uh we still got about I don't know 45 minutes until when after dark so you're in charge um let's do those three cuz we got to do them at some point sure sure yeah can do let's see um hello w. Dill pickles lus now that you're officially 5 months post beard how's it going personally think you look much better without it um wow that's a controversial take I I I still H should I go get it yeah I'll go get it yeah I'll be right back all right is there
another one I can answer uh yeah I think I have one here for Luke nice um hi guys hope you're all well Luke hope your brother is enjoying his job I've been in the service here in for 7 months now has your brother told you about any cool Tech used at work uh he talks to me about like the the different features on the trucks like I I went to his Hall to tour his Hall one time and he was showing me some of the features on the trucks that were really interesting and cool um the
wildlands truck is super interesting um but outside of that I don't I don't particularly think so unless we we we've probably had this conversation but yeah I don't know I don't think so unless you're talking about the features on the trucks got another one for you you're talking me about new helmets that are getting soon they look super sick I don't know yeah go for Yeah question for slick I think that's you right yeah do you feel that roles of tech lead and engineering
manager are distinct particularly for software engineering roles uh if you have both yeah I don't think you necessarily need to have both I think you can have a person who fills both of those roles but I think it's also uh like if you have two people doing those two roles they're different roles but I do think that it is possible for one person to do both if that makes sense um I I don't think a ton of people are going to want to do both they're quite different things one of them is
more management of people and the other one is more management of like tasks and quality and standards and different things like that um so you could find someone that wants to do both but I often find that people that like doing the tech lead side of things don't want to deal with the more management side of things and the managing side of things people often can't do the other side so it is what it is Tech lead is closer to an IC yeah exactly yeah  actually okay so to catch those of view up uh who
don't know about this I'm working on a little painting project uh on my bike so uh ignore this part that's kind of a lighter shade the inner part has the effect layer applied to it and unfortunately right so I'm keeping the beard off until at least until hold on hold on we'll get to it I'm keeping the beard off at least until I finish this so that I can maintain a good seal with my mask now looks pretty cool right well one small problem when I spin it if you look here you can see it's not
even so I didn't manage to get the mid coat even enough this has to be blasted and completely redone unfortunately yikes yeah oh we're getting there y I'm learning a lot though having fun um get it balanced at a tire shop yeah yeah  what that's good that is pretty good so uh anyway the good news is that the evenness on the frame seems good enough and that was by far most of the work that I've done so far and because it's not in motion the same way you won't notice as much if there is a little bit
of unevenness um but the wheels absolutely just need to be need to be completely redone you should take this opportunity to do a mustache no I really don't need to do that you could though sideburns into mustache so I think the sideburns are still potentially an issue with the mask if they go far enough that's true but the mustache is a classic because it doesn't interfere with the mask you just got one of the whole head mask things right and then it just seals at the neck
no okay I got one more here for you and then you can move on uh hi LDL I'm an intern at a company who makes lii and know that's not a spelling mistake have you ever heard of this uh if so any thoughts love the vids keep them up yeah it's it requires um direct line of site in order to to transfer data right yeah light to transmit data and position between devices yeah it's super cool if I recall correctly there's also a wireless power that we made a video about like ages ago and like not
you know dangerous microwave your flesh Wireless power like like totally like working Wireless power like you just like a wireless powerhub and uh as long as it has line of sight to a device they negotiate a link and like you could just charge a Dev like your phone if it had a receiver for it you could just like pop it on the desk and it would just sit and charge um but they just haven't seen the kind of adoption that they would need in order for um them to gain any momentum
neither of them as far as I can tell what does uh what does what does lifi like do these days why does it matter now I can't remember military security oh yeah okay yeah any areas that are susceptible to electromagnetic interference yeah okay I could see that being kind of useful but I just don't really I just don't really see what the point of it would be for consumers I don't think it is super consumer like the the second thing on people also ask when you just Google
lifi is why did lifi fail uh but people clearly still make it not just because of this merch message but because there's like stuff possible to be purchased so I'm sure there's industries that use it and probably use it quite well but yeah I I don't think it picked up on the consumer side yeah I still remember I still why why charge technology I still remember when I saw these guys at computex they had a they had a train running in their booth that was being powered wirelessly it had no
batteries in it um and so we invited them out to kind of do a demo on site for us and we basically just have their their wireless transmitter uh somewhere I forget where it is um yeah somewhere where is it yeah there it is so it was like a light fixture that had the wireless trans power transmitter in it and it could power this train I think we showed the train running in the intro yeah yeah yeah there you go so I'm sitting in the middle of it to show yeah there's no wires there's
no no uh no cables no Tom Foolery Just Wireless power being transmitted to these uh these little trains that's kind of wild yeah and it didn't take off because this has been debunked guys there's nothing to Bunk or debunk it  about um the problem is that the cost didn't make any sense to integrate into devices that was the Challenge and so when I talked to them at this point 6 years ago uh they were thinking less along the lines of you know convincing phone manufacturers to to work a you know a
receiver into their extremely space constrained devices and we're thinking more along the lines of like retrofitting facilities for example so um you know like if you're a cafe you have your wireless power transmitter in the middle of the cafe and then you have receivers built into the tables and now you can offer phone charging through a USB cable like at the table um but you don't have to go like wire up all your tables right so that was one of the ideas that they were exploring but it just
didn't clearly didn't work out cuz I'm I I doubt these guys still exist at this point I haven't I haven't heard about them since then oh dude do they still exist hold on a second what are what what are they up to okay what's y charge up to uh air cord okay Partners no drop down that's uh not a good sign yeah belon though okay various sensors embedded in the displays L for detailed store Insight oh interesting okay okay so they y spot advertising display why Fred smart locks that's a pretty good use
case actually those little displays in stores cuz you wouldn't want to run power to every single shelf and then along every single shelf if you could avoid it but having something in the in the roof of like one of those like industrial style open roofs is easy to do air cord products come on show me products air cord applications electric Shades digital signage smart faucet electric tooth um I mean really is this is this a mockup or is this a product your toothbrush current
limitations battery power is limiting blah blah blah live in stations now this this all looks like this all looks like mockup still to me where is an actual deployment of this charging pad game controller like no no no no okay digital signage do you have any actual yeah bunnies these are these are different things man um what what's what's bunnies linking to different things uh yeah I don't know bunnies you're you're you're being exhausting  um I can't tell what these guys are  anything marketing it
sales why charge Europe okay hold on a second why charge Korea you should just call them just call them right now yeah what do you guys do I mean they're apparently hiring although I uh I heard about this recently apparently it's a thing that companies will do where they'll post a whole bunch of like fake job postings on their site so they look like they're suc to make it seem like they're successful and growing thing so half of these could be fake for all I know but apparently
they are hiring people whether that's true or not I have no idea do they still post on social  anyway good luck guys I trust an actual engineer rather  demo I I don't know what to I don't know what to tell you I personally looked at the train there's no battery in it so it has limitations which we very clearly discussed in our video it has has many limitations in terms of the number of devices that it can Target at a time in terms of the amount of power that it can transmit but it very much works there's
nothing to Bunk or debunk or unbun or whatever exactly it is that you're talking about it might not be good for a lot of consumer applications might not make a ton of sense but it definitely works and it's definitely real all right what else we got today want to pick a topic uh sure let's see ready so we already did our main topics that's good we're moving uh fake news sites are pretending to be local American Media Outlets a network of websites likely based out of Russia
are uh are producing large amounts of AI fabricated news stories while pretending to be local American News sources they are using a combination of relatively generic newspaper names like the Boston times as well as the titles of old defunct news outlets the story themselves seem designed to appeal to a certain American audience uh using charged political narratives and tropes the most prominent of these fake stories was the claim that the wife of the president of Ukraine used American
military aid money to buy A4 million euro bu Bugatti from a shop in Paris the claim was quickly debunked uh as the forged invoice published alongside it contained several errors likewise Bugatti released a public statement denying the allegation not that they'd probably be super public about their client list anyways uh nonetheless the claim was spread widely over social media particularly through American political influencers additionally a study by newsguard has found that prominent AI chat Bots are
absorbing information from these kinds of websites and will often regurgitate political propaganda as fact citing propaganda Outlets as legitimate sources I don't think anything here is new no it's not new but it's um what what's interesting about this particular um network is just how how big it appears to be and how quickly it seems to be growing so just a just a shout out for our American friends out there just because a website looks kind of trustworthy just because
there's a lot of other sites publishing the same story does not necessarily mean that the story is true I I would also say this is probably happening more or less everywhere it's just most likely being pushed on the timing yeah yeah for there also election stuff Brewing up here though yep oh 100% 100% it's America is probably one of the juiciest targets it's probably happening there a lot I'm not trying to say y that I'm just saying this is something you should be aware of everywhere so just just
watch out guys because the power of chat GPT has made it has made it extremely easy and extremely fast and not just chat GPT like there's there's so many large language models these days that can create powerful uh emotionally um emotional content that uh generates a strong reaction from people and the the the longer this goes on the better they're going to get at it because you know they're going to be feeding back into these models what went viral what didn't and they're going to be looking
for patterns so please watch out guys yeah and in other but related news because I I thought these two things would actually connect somewhat interestingly uh is Apple D list vpns in Russia Apple has folded due to pressure from the Russian government and removed several VPN apps from its Russian App Store Russian citizens will no longer be able to download or upload update these apps in Russia at least because you could be a Russian citizen that isn't in Russia um though those who already have
them will be able to use them the Kremlin has enacted strict online censorship for its citizens including blocking many dependent news outlets and popular social media sites the government recently banned advertising or popularizing vpns including publishing instructions on how to set up a VPN back in March Apple also removed an app developed by the team of now suspiciously deceased opposition politician uh Al uh this app would have advised users on how to coales around specific
opposition political candidates rather than uh splitting their votes across several candidates this is the whole not having ranked first or ranked Choice voting issue however Apple has not sold products in Russia since the invasion uh and I think this is not surprising yeah uh because I think there's a lot of issues with Western countries right now where having a free and open web which is fantastic has resulted in a lot of battle for mind share by everyone in the world in a way
that I think people wouldn't necessarily expect and if I was an authoritarian government I'd be looking at any country with a free and open web going oh wow that's easy to take advantage of and then you're having that thought and going huh maybe ours shouldn't be the same I I yeah I get it um I mean Luke's saying he gets it in terms of why Russia is putting the pressure on Apple what I'm trying to understand here is how Apple can bang their drum about caring so so so Huggy muggy much about user
privacy while also folding to pressure like this and look it's one thing if Apple's just like yep we're going to we're going to value your privacy as much as we feel like it um you know so deal with it like if they were upfront about it I this I wouldn't even talk about this um but they don't langly man says I take it the Russian government has not responded to Linus's offer to buy  time uh what else we what else we got Nintendo says there will be enough switch Twos for everybody Nintendo's
President says that the company has a bold plan to reduce scalping at the launch of the switch 2 by making enough consoles to meet demand that is that is an interesting approach I think this is interesting for a bunch of reasons the company likewise claims that the semiconduct shortages that caused supply chain issues in 2022 and 2023 have been resolved and will not affect the next console's launch Nintendo's president likewise stated that the company isn't in any rush to embrace generative AI
saying it poses potentially serious issues with IP infringement he likewise expressed that the company will continue to create valuable experiences for gamers that cannot be achieved through technology alone should I just invest in Nintendo and be done with it like they they seem to on the one hand they seem like just butt heads sometimes but on the other hand they seem to have a Clear Vision you know for the next hundred years keep doing the thing we've been doing for
over a hundred years I mean it's kind of worked out it's kind of working out for them isn't it yeah um the interesting thing about this for me though is how well do you think the switch 2 is going  do with the right games great and nintend has been on a bit of a wi had a lot of the right games did it though yeah name them uh Mario Kart 8 that's one Super Smash Bros okay two Mario Brothers which one whatever one came out on the Wii U exactly well I don't know  [Applause]
switch wow that was a short list Galaxy no like they had all the like The Usual Suspects they had all the usual suspect Nintendo games you would expect I'm pretty sure yeah breath of the wild know breath of the wild was on the Wii U but realistically the switch had sold more units than the Wii U by the time breath of the wild launched and that was a launch title so like let's not let's not let's be real here breath of the wild is a switch game Splatoon was actually a great game um that came out on Wii U Wii
U had a bunch of good titles genuinely okay but I think Nintendo is defining like Banger as like 30 million units now it didn't have a ton of 30 million I mean I think didn't sell a ton of consoles it had good games they re-released them on switch and then they blew up okay that's true they were that happened many times Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is literally just Mario Kart that's fair and it exploded on S that's fair um I don't I don't know man it's it's tough I think that they might be to your point
walking into the same trap as last time where people think that it's basically just you know uh well my thing is that I I think to somewhat of a cycle it's like aren't they on an every other console cycle just like a lot of other things are on an every other whatever they make cycle like Wii U was bad Wii U was great then it was GameCube before that right yeah GameCube actually sold we did it flop the GameCube was not very competitive but Nintendo 64 was a killer wasn't it uh Nintendo actually like
struggled a fair bit there GameCube sold 2.74 million units and N64 moved 32 so GameCube was a big step down from the success of the N64 and the N64 compared to the PlayStation one uh sold a third as many like Nintendo was was crazy yeah PlayStation  killer well I hope it goes well for them it's it's a fairly bold take to say like we're going to combat scalpers cuz there's going to be enough switch Twos for everyone yeah that's a that's a really strong T they may be right I mean
the rumor is the hardware has basically been finished for over a year and game developers are just like working on games now so they they may pull it off where they're basically they insane launch list we're going to have a great great game library and we're going to have ample availability let's go I do wonder if there would be a I I do wonder if there would be like a negative impact to having enough though like think about part of the hype cycle is people can't buy them yeah think
about how often it's in the news like when someone scalps it or when it reaches a new high on eBay or blah blah blah blah blah as annoying as it was for everyone that you couldn't buy ps5s like at all everyone was talking about how PlayStation was winning the war because you couldn't buy ps5s yeah and you could find an Xbox on a shelf yeah so I wonder if the Optics of there being enough switch twos will actually be terrible Wonder that's why they're seeding this maybe trying to like tell people early
there's going to be enough it's still interesting I promise oh man we've got a few more  uh YouTube adds takedown requests for deep fakes YouTube has added the ability for people to request the removal of realistic synthetic impersonations a image video or audio while deep fake misinformation can be reported by anybody only the relative person or their relative only the relevant person or their Guardian will be able to request removal of these kinds of fakes that makes sense however a request
doesn't necessarily guarantee removal there are other factors that go into the decision such as whether the synthetic impersonation is clearly marked as AI generation whether or not it's realistic enough to be believable whether the person is shown doing something reputation damaging or whether the impersonation is a work of parody so it sounds like there's a lot of gray area here YouTube is likewise rolling out an erase song feature which will allow creators to remove copyright claimed
music from a video while keeping the rest of the audio intact that's super cool love that and should we move to after dark is there anything else here that you particularly feel the need to talk about um no no no no oh actually the EU charging meta is not bad under the digital markets act so saying that meta's EU specific version of its social platforms where users can choose either a paid ad free subscription or a free account with targeted ads doesn't go far enough to comply with the spirit of the
law according to EU Regulators meta must offer an equivalent non-personalized service to users who choose that to not have targeted ads I love it the EU has previously laid similar charges against Apple for their anti- steering rules preventing thirdparty Sellers from directing customers toward other payment options m Microsoft has been charged over its bundling of teams with the rest of their productivity Suite on the grounds that it gives teams an unfair distributional advantage over other
messaging services love it good job EU you screwed up some stuff recently but this is good all right let's do it it's  Dan and wow after dark is brought to you by private internet access I think right I don't know yes yeah you can get a special deal exclusive to us by using the link in the video description in terms of why you would want a VPN hey if you don't know there's a solid chance you don't need one but if you're a filthy pirate then um you might want to use one if you're in Russia get a Android
and side load it yeah I guess I guess I guess I mean we're not this is not legal advice no like you could end up dead yeah so careful with that yeah all right Russia watch out I'm not saving you from this one Luke go ahead D on hey from the UK uh would LTT ever consider doing more formal merch like suits I work in a formal setting but would still love to rep some merch no that would be the most Niche thing ever uh thank you for the wonderful suggestion we'd sell at least
four yeah we could do we could do LTT uh LTT produc cosplay outfits while we're at it you know nice that might sell just as many we'll we'll do the tuxedo and The Mask so you can cosplay formally yeah that's pretty good oh did you get it now the mask yeah anyway don't uh let's see what I thought you were talking about the mask cuz he wears a suit in that show that no no no no no no no I'm talking about Tuxedo Mask oh from Sailor Moon oh no I thought you talking about uh here one sec see
look he wears a suit yeah no I know yeah the mask you know what I did watch Happy Gilmore recently it holds up shockingly well I watched it with my we talked about that earlier in this show did we- oh it was preow never mind I haven't heard this story before okay forget it anyway I love Happy Gilmore still and uh my son was like busting a gut uh watching it with me it was great yeah no this would be the cosplay uh my understanding is you would probably get sued into a bivion I mean
really can they sue you for making a tuxedo and a mask Ian he doesn't even have a mask so our mask would be an original addition to the outfit all right all right if you like Adam Sandler no no no no no no no to be clear I'm not saying that I think every Adam Sandler movie is great um this is a funny conversation I had on set today uh during the pandemic uh Tanner in his so apparently tried to watch all 50 or 60 or whatever Adam Sandler movies why I don't I don't know but um a
game that Tanner started playing was is there a woman in this movie who finds Adam Sandler irresistibly attractive nice and it was all but one nice literally even his like first like self-funded like indie film apparently had a woman character who found him irresistibly attractive it's just like is that bad that's a very normal Trope in stories it is but it just seems to happen a lot in an Adam Sandler in Adam always the main character isn't he yeah oh yeah and there's almost always going
to be a love interest for the yeah I don't know so what you're saying is that your film written by you directed by you and starring you which will never happen would have you be irresistibly attractive to a member of the opp wanted to have a love interest part of the thing which is extremely normal especially in comedy things then yeah probably okay but you'd be irresistibly attractive obviously I mean I I wouldn't argue against it to be very clear I think it's just easy normal like I'm just not surprised
I guess is what I'm saying I'm not saying it's necessarily good it's not deep but he's probably writing a comedy so that part of the show/ movie is probably not supposed to be super deep so like I don't know I mean you'd probably go with the nepotism route and just hire your current partner and then you would also save money it's so much easier yeah yeah then you don't have to fight about the scenes yeah exactly yeah yeah all right let's see I have personally experienced new egg and
Amazon selling returned used motherboards as new and trying to hide it there are security and antiche Hardware ID bands uh concerns with this thoughts that's terrible that sucks I'm sorry to hear that I think that's been a thing that people have been talking about for a bit I haven't experienced it luckily I think man the more I think about call it out every time it happens the more I think it's time for ltab store.com just like we only carry stuff that we validate is good and we only we
only sell you know not scummy stuff and we just are what do you do with stuff if you end up like if okay this thing is good we buy a certain amount of it we have a certain amount of sell through rate of that thing and then a new thing comes in that we review that we think is better um with the stuff that now isn't as good well you have to assume that just because it isn't as good relative to new stuff doesn't mean it's not good if you if if something changes just like throw it all out no um
what we would probably have to figure out is some kind of negotiation with manufacturers where based on our purchase terms we can we can stock rotate inventory if they screw it up I mean stock rotation is a thing it's difficult to negotiate but it is a thing and maybe they should not screw up their  work Mt Economist says wake up babe new  really more oh yeah if you want to do it we'll figure it out oh yeah well no it's going to be up to the management team I I don't just make unilateral decisions
anymore nice hey sorry hey Lan Duke and dinus this is for lonus but what improvements do you think need to be made to Baby Tech besides just security to make it semi- worth picking up also when more tall sizes um man I got to be honest with you we didn't use much we used a baby monitor so just uh just a live audio feed uh I i' I'd love to have better range on that I guess um I know a lot of people use video ones now they were expensive back when back when I got a baby monitor and
I also I just like never really felt like I needed it like it's in a it's in a cage like what do you what do you need to see exactly it yells when it's mad um and you know what there's edge cases right where something goes wrong and your video baby monor monitor could have been the you know the thing that saved it or whatever and so you might swear by it you know personally but we it never really came up for us I feel like that's a statement only someone who's had multiple kids would say cuz like that
that sounds like something that's similar to like something that I'd hear Colton say I mean yeah but what do you really want it's in a cage it'll yell if it's mad sounds sounds very like everyone that I know that has multiple kid sounds like that well look you just what you realize is that there's only so much time and energy and and this thing is sapping both of them from you at at a rate that is as as great as you allow it to be like our first child okay I'm not saying
it's bad to be clear it's just our first child every bottle every Soother you know anything that could have possibly gone in his mouth man we were on it with the boiled water and the like we had like the special like we were so worried about using the same towel to put things on to dry it out twice because it might have like milk molecules from the last time sitting bacter on this towel from from the last time so like you know if he dropped one of his little like like
tooth Soother toys or something man that was going straight in the pile to be disinfected and then you know cleaned and then we could give it back to him after it had been you know air dried or whatever and then by the time it was our second one it was like a quick rinse under the sink here you go and then by the time we came around to the third one wipe it on the pants pop it back in her mouth and she's good to go right like it's because you don't they're all fine you don't have time for that and I think
that's something that a lot of um a lot of people struggle with because when you have just one you allow yourself to parent them too much I think and so we really uh I mean I knew a lot already cuz I'm one of five so I and I'm one of the older ones so I um so I I witnessed a lot of these changes over time but I really have learned even more that having too few things in your life to take care of can cause you to over care for them in ways that can actually be detrimental in the longer term so it
was it was definitely it was definitely a good thing that you know the last one didn't get kind of uh pampered in that way I think yeah yeah yeah yeah and Tall sizes sorry tall sizes when oh uh I think we're just waiting on the next big t-shirt order like like all the all the grading which is what it's called when you work out the sizes all the grading is done um and spoiler alert there might be some deals on blank t-shirts for lime day so once we blow away some inventory and some of the colors that are not
moving as well then it might be time for a restock and we might be bringing in the tall sizes I think that does not mean we're a go for lime day to be clear what Dan and I are communicating telepathically right right now okay did they come in packs of 50 I mean no we could Group by if you did I think that's what's going be a 50 pack anyway we're very excited about tall shirts okay I'm going to be the reason they're out of stock there's like a small army of people at the company that
are just instantly going to buy a large amount of this is the thing about like tall sizes is the people who want them are like obsessed I suspect there isn't a huge amount of us but the ones that do exist will that one like lanky siiz shirt that we had sold like I couldn't even believe it it's crazy cuz I mean we have four options I will instantaneously replace all of my t-shirts and I'm not kidding I am I am the same I can buy from one company right now yeah sorry I'm just checking what our
total loss is today like when I go to the gym I do certain workouts I don't own a shirt that can keep me covered same yeah sometimes I'll wear like a a muscle shirt a shirt I don't want yeah a shirt underneath it just to keep everything like yeah yeah reasonable yeah guys you are not doing a very good job of buying other stuff other than the track joggers and to help make up for it no they are not get on it you guys K you're killing me here um anyway what's next oh let's have a look here uh our
company offers fiber connections for home and Business we can support up to 10 gigs nice our company does not offer 10 gig to business customers though we only offer them Dia which why not offer both sorry A dia yeah I think that's uh I had a quick Google of this earlier that's like the internet thing so like like so you're talking like a service like a site to site um location I mean dedicated internet access provides business with a private connection to the Internet so
it's not it's not split shared bandwidth across cross neighbors blah blah blah blah blah oh okay I think T us just does this by the way for like everybody or at least they did a long time ago or something I don't know I don't want to say the wrong thing okay uh so they can get a one gig line but it is definitely only theirs is I think what he's saying with Dia like you always get one gig no matter what interesting yeah the only the only reason that I could think of is that the
rates that you could charge these businesses just wouldn't make sense cuz they would have to literally 10 times the amount of the 1 gig connection um whereas you can offer 10 gig to to regular consumers knowing that out of a hundred people you know only a few of them are going to be using it heavily at a given time um and so you're going to be able to share that you also don't need to guarantee that they're going to be able to get those speeds all the time because a consumer connection if it dips
to 6 GB a they probably won't notice and B they're going to have no recourse because you don't have any kind of SLA with them that guarantees that connection speed so that would be my guess is that they can't guarantee 10 gig speed all the time I agree at least at a reasonable cost so they're just like uh screw it let's just rather than have a product that we know we can't fulfill let's just not offer the product yeah so maybe they'll offer it eventually that's just me guessing
though I'm guessing yeah hey the land Duke and DUS with Nintendo saying that there won't be a chip shortage do you believe that it's just that or that there're using lower powered Hardware both I mean that's one of the ways to make sure that you don't have a shortage of a chip is to use an older process node where there's lots of capacity and ampere would be I think a pretty good example of that where like older you know cheap Tablet S so's are are not going to be built on such a Cutting Edge
note as what what is that tsmc 7 nanometer I'm trying to remember Nvidia ampere is it 7 nmet uh yeah ampere is is the largest 7 NM chip ever built yeah so ampere was 7 NM however I've heard rumors that the the switch to S so is going to be like 6 nanm or something like that anyway the point is that um you're kind of in that middle ground where Cheapo garbage stuff is not going to be manufactured on that node and the latest iPhone is past it already so it could be like a nice
Middle Ground where there's ample capacity I'm just I'm just guessing based on you know some small amounts of things that I know about that business  manufacturing hey lldd question for mostly lonus you play a lot of beat saer have you ever been into other Rhythm games Guitar Hero DDR Etc no I would probably enjoy the crap out of DDR though oh yeah you would like I've played it a couple of times and it seems like a blast but I suck so much and DDR machines are almost always in public
places where I feel super self-conscious playing them as a complete beginner so I just would would rather not it's actually one of the reasons that I didn't play much in the arcades in Japan they're way more affordable than here which is super cool like I would always read stories or watch videos about how like you know arcades are where people will hang out all day at the arcade and I'm like with what money cuz when I was a kid going to the arcade was freaking expensive I mean I still I don't know if
I would say it's necessarily cheap but I would go with my allowance and I'd be done in like 15 minutes like and that was my allowance like the the idea that you could hang out in the arcade was ridiculous to me but over there like you you give a little bit of money and you like play for a while even if you're not you know expert tier um but when I was over there man like some of the people really do look like they live there like they're so good that I would I would feel inadequate sitting down at the
machine next to them putting in my money and like they're like going like this on  like I don't know man um yeah beat saer great I've never really gotten into another rhythm game though hi dll lonus is a longtime lover of ano 1800 myself are there any ano 117 updates features quality of life changes that you're hoping to see this is going to be super unpopular but I would actually like to see um I I'd like to see a little bit more military I love ano 18 I know I know right hear me
out as someone who has always enjoyed RTS like purely military RTS it is something I do find myself missing in ano sometimes the the The Siege mechanism in ano 1800 where ultimately you conquer an Island by destroying the um by by seing the the main Port essentially is pretty shallow and I I would like to see different options yeah um I don't know that I would want to see it be more of a focus of the actual gameplay but having The Siege mechanics be better would be cool I also wouldn't
mind seeing the entire thing replaced with trade blockades um so instead of just destroying one building if effectively the way to besiege an island would be to defeat its Navy and prevent um prevent essential shipments or something like that um I I think something like that could be really interesting because you can you can blockade uh an island but the AI seem to just cheat like Luke and I actually started a game a new game recently against like super hard AI with like sort of everything dialed up
against us and one of the things that we noticed was that while there were definitely some missteps cuz neither of us had played in a while there were things the AIS were doing that didn't really seem possible with the starting resources unless they were just getting free resources they seem to be they seem to be cheating AIS um and so I would like to see a fair a completely Fair AI that has to rely on exactly the same challenges buying from free Traders and stuff like
that that was pretty frustrating to run into um  like a bit harder of an AI to write than for most games I also don't I know was a weird game I also don't know what would be involved in this but I would love to see the management of trade routs be just somehow better like just I I don't  team hi dll last week Luke mentioned that he was was trying to take public transport more often I was wondering why and maybe if he's been having a positive experience I love talking the VTA in San  split uh
no well that's Vancouver Public Transit for you that's why yeah so I try to take more public transit often when I'm away from home here it's not really possible um getting from where I live to work on public transit  is would be a horrible experience um now getting to and from seemingly basically anywhere when I was in Taiwan yeah absolutely take public transit the buses were better the trains were better the the high-speed rail existed um all that type of stuff I would love it if we had high-speed rail
from Vancouver to like Colona cam loops that would be awesome I think would really open up BC in a big way cuz there's a lot of people that just are not willing to do that drive because there's some parts of it that are like actually treacherous especially with all the deer and stuff like people's parents tell their kids not to do the drive when they're like when they newly have a car this is a thing if you could travel there if someone from Colona or Cam Loops could take a train so they could
come into Vancouver and see like a Canucks game yeah and let's say drink at the Canucks game so they're able to safely commute home on the train instead of driving you know nap on the train while they go home nap on the train do whatever if people from out there hope Colona cam loops Etc could take High-Speed Rail into Vancouver to work the West Coast Express and then go back yeah uh and then and then go back home after work because they're on a train that's super fast that would really Open
The Province up we have this weird problem where everybody's stuffed in this weird broken sink corner and it just sucks um and privatizing public transit was not the solution no you know why the UBC routes are always like overpacked because everyone who rides them has a go-kart and they're not profitable so they don't care Transit shouldn't be profitable it's not the point of it it's infrastructure for crying out loud that's what our taxes are supposed to pay for why don't we have a Sky Train in
Langley well it's coming isn't it yeah but like our SC they voted it down last time don't even get me started on the scar train cuz I argue with people about Vancouver Public Transit do be like it's really good you got the sky trms like and especially back then it was like there like two lines and Vancouver is the entire Greater Vancouver Regional District it's not just the city of Vancouver and as soon as you go outside of just there it's atrocious it's horrible UCR Buffalo said too many
people think feel they need their autonomy too I'm not saying to take autonomy away I feel like you have more autonomy if you have the ability to highspeed rail to colon or Cam I was going to you could decide to Z out there really fast even if you don't have a car or if your car might not make it the whole way or whatever else GM Sho says this is me whenever someone complains that the US Post Office isn't profitable it's not the point it was it ever profitable I mean okay maybe but still
it doesn't matter like the whole rain snow sleep hail blah blah Nothing Stops the mail like that's not cuz that's profitable that's because that's just public infrastructure that like is needed uh equipped says Japanese rail is private however Japanese culturally are very annoying Parts about that is an extremely different place also that than North America big time it's really annoying in Japan when you have to like switch stations but the stations are right next to each other the only real reason why I
need to switch stations is cuzz they're different companies yeah like what's happening and like I couldn't find but the train in Japan is light years ahead of where we are obviously I couldn't find the platform for a train I was trying to take because technically the like part of the terminal that I was standing in was owned by the other one so they so they had no signs for it I ran into that problem I was so angry like actually extremely angry yeah there are there are some signs for
the competing was before people freak out but yeah yeah not enough and not at that station okay any thoughts on tras scale dropping support for True charts and removing 700 out of the 800 apps   uh lus is invested in an upcoming Nas software support for true that is to be fair mostly tuned for individual home users that don't want to get super into the weed so it might not be dealing with what you're talking about but dud I real quick I hadn't seen I I hadn't seen this   
uh true charts has been May 27th it's I I I think it's the other way around I just moved to scale I think it's the other way around someone in chat pointed this out and I Googled it and it looks more true um yeah a AOW 101 or a chow 101 I'm not sure said true charts is dropping support for True scale which is the other way that it said and I googled that and started founding finding more information on it interesting I think that I think it's the other way around scale users introducing Talos Linux
our alternative will be based on Tallow they already cut Tre Nets with the true charts with a new update I I don't know I'm not 100% sure what way it's going  sure scale already dropped it yeah I'm not sure sorry guys I don't know enough about this to have any thoughts on we don't have a talk topic prepped on it or anything y but if if you're a user of these things maybe keep your eyes out yeah that'd be that'd be a bummer I will I'm on they're moving away from kubernetes not true chart specific okay
that also makes sense okay hi lldd just started playing ano 1800 what dlc's would you recommend none start with the base game yeah which is a great Rich experience and then when you're bored which will be after many many dozens of hours yes then have a look at which DLCs you like that sound appealing yep and honestly it is very likely going to make sense to add one it probably makes sense depending on how they do the pricing to buy a season at a time yep because there's like four or
five seasons or something or by the time you're bored by like the whole whack cuz I think they're done development on the game so maybe there'll be like an all you can eat depending on the bundle sales yeah but if they don't have a bundle sale for the whole whack what I was going to say was that you could get one season at a time because it actually comes with a lot of content in that one season like their their expansions are actually sick they huge amounts of content like every time so uh if you're
not like 100% sure you're going to get them all you could peace meal it or if you're like yeah this game's amazing and buy them all that's also a very acceptable way to play the game it'll just be a lot of information hitting you at once when you buy all the updates because it is a huge amount of content yeah I don't know if uh Luke did this one or maybe maybe I did but how would you recommend configuring an old computer as a Nas I'm looking at raid Z1 but I don't know how many drives I should end up
with oh man this is a long conversation that um G Forum you know what yeah try posting try posting on the LT forum and see if someone is willing to kind of have a look at this for you but I think there'll be more Nas recommendation stuff when that company yeah so I'm I'm invested in a Nas software startup and hopefully they will be not hopefully their plan is to build out you know with Wizards and stuff that will make it easy for people like you to just throw together hardware and kind of go hey
configure this for me that's that's the idea I built a carbon copy of our John's bone Nas video first time I've ever done that and that's been fantastic oh yeah or you could just follow one of our previous Nas videos the Johns what one is amazing that's totally an option y I'm planning on moving from the little Nas that I have now to like a more serious solution when that software releases as long as they do pricing model that doesn't make me want to gou my eyes out I'm a design engineering manager for
a major defense company and do a lot of VBA automation to keep my team lean is VBA really bottom of the barrel it seems to work for us zero formal coding uh it works for a lot of people I don't know like I've got a I've got a buddy that does a bunch of VBA stuff for his work but he he has no formal um training in like software development and he was able to make his team a lot more efficient just through VBA stuff I don't know I mean if it work if it's stupid and it works is it stupid yeah I
don't know seems okay people are saying that VBA is about to be removed that sucks I don't know I lmgd lineups you said even today that you've had no issues with your 7900 XTX but have you played any hell divers 2o I haven't I and many others with a card have been unable to play oh really I'm very sorry to hear that I have not tried to play hell divers 2 it sounds like I kind of missed the hype on it though it's it's down to like 10% of its peak player base lot a lot of controversies but that was
a really high peak okay okay do you relx are you emotionally invested in Hell relax are like are you offended are you mad I'm a little off brother are you this was a very annoying news article to see you go around this happens with like every single game what what don't what P world's not as popular as it was when it started exactly are you serious right now there were articles of that why are so few people playing Dark Souls right now there are articles a lot of people
playing Dark Souls well Elden ring yeah especially cuz the new expansion but but I'm pretty sure there was articles about how few people were playing Elden ring months after it came out like it's it's oh whoa people play a game and then stop playing it eventually what's happening and especially with a game like hell divers that was like incredibly wildly popular yeah it's going to decrease over time relax the fact that still 10% of people are still actively playing a game that
is effectively the same thing over and over again is a lot I'm surprised it's that much I'm trying to figure out what you hate right now how long has it I mean it's obvious you're a hater I just I'm not sure what it is that you hate do you hate hell divers 2 for being the same game over and over or do you hate people for not playing it or do you hate people for playing it a lot nope I hate the reporting it's garbage boring lame reporting anyway reporting that like oh this many players are still
playing and this is our thoughts on it is interesting but oh my God Only 10% of players are still playing whoa headline is so junk it's so annoying I would have expected you to understand that negative sentiment sells I understand it I just don't like it there you go there's your thesis statement yeah yeah I definitely have missed out on being able to be a noob and have no idea what's going on though and so that's something that I kind of I kind of wish I had jumped into
well it is it is a fairly small Lobby game so you'll play with the maximum of four people total so you find other people to play with drag everything down they're getting up about the meta like it's a co-op game and people are angry if you don't use the discovered optimal layout okay but I never ran into this that's been a thing that's been reported since the beginning of Hell divers 2 since the first week people were talking oh I'm getting kicked out of lobbies cuz whatever and I'm sure that happened like
once never had that problem once and I have always used weird builds in that game so like I think this is a very small issue that people glommed on because it was almost entirely positive reporting about the game people are like there's something negative let's talk about that all the time yeah people in chat are like it's not a thing yeah I don't know I I really don't think it's a big deal there's toxic people in every single community that you can voluntarily join and exit
any time there will be toxic people in that Community assuming it reaches some amount of critical mass speaking of toxic communities um can we discuss how   "5,876 oh okay hold on if that's wait" views okay if that's the number of people who have like and exited scrolled past it at all yeah then I believe it total views but it is cuz it doesn't say viewers yeah it is an absolute G if you're watching on Twitter say something ghost town oh nope don't say anything because you're a Twitter user no one
cares what you think oh I don't think previous chat is visible know but I've been in there for like 5 minutes oh it's dead really oh yeah no it's dead great great great great uh a couple more for you here hello dld what is most high-tech company or place that you have been to that was seemingly low Tech before going oh well I don't go too many places that I expect to be low Tech yeah um it's not the kind of thing I go out of my way to do I feel like I usually have a pretty
solid idea of the technical level of the things that I go to yeah every once in a while I'll go to like a restaurant that is um oh no I I did I went to a restaurant recently where it was like where where was I I traveled recently where did I go oh yeah yeah I was in I was in um oh man  called I think it's the other way around so Cannon I was going to say I I find more places that I'm surprised how lowtech are instead of how high-tech they are I was in Centralia  um population here that's not going to
be true about Taiwan everyone knows Taiwan is high-tech yeah I was in Centralia Washington which has a "population of just under 19,000 people" last weekend pretty small and I was in just like kind of a kind of a a bar eating establishment and they were extremely why his drinks confirmed uh they were extremely like I don't know they they were they were very they were very techy like it wasn't like in Japan where you know there's no menus everything's just a QR code and you like order on your phone
and it just appears at your table like it wasn't it wasn't that but the servers very much had like a really nice app interface on their tablet that they took your order with like it's um it's still pretty common here in North America for the server to take your order with like a pad and paper like that is absolutely still a thing and it was just this like kind of you know small town USA vibe that they had going on and and and no they were like they were they were on it they were very high-tech and like they
like their app allowed them to you know put in customizations and notes on the order which is not something to be taken for granted not all of the interfaces allow that so yeah I was I I was yeah I was I was impressed I'm apparently pronouncing the name so wrong Calia I don't know whatever who knows who cares I'm never going back no I'm no I'm kidding we actually had a wonderful time we did a little glass blowing workshop and we made our own blown glass bowls and Bubbles and stuff and um we also we
went to Great Wolf Lodge which is fine um you know the kids had a great time then good enough great time accom two and a half days was exactly the right amount of time to be there yeah um there's there's constantly places where I'm I'm stunned at how far behind they are tech-wise like uh places that still take orders and I don't mean for food I mean for like products that you're expecting to pick up in an amount of time later uh on pen and paper like there was a wedding I went to and I had
to get a suit for it and it was like in the wedding party so you have to you you all get the same suit or whatever so I went to the place that we're getting the suit from and they just rote everything down yeah and then they gave the stuff to the wrong people and they gave the wrong stuff and I'm like this probably could have been I remember this story if you had digitized everything in the  goodness oh well Luke what are your thoughts on test driven development do you have any other preferred methods to
ensure your team delivers reliable high quality code uh the beta site um test driven development having some tests is really good I think having tests for absolutely everything is only realistic in a good way for uh like absolutely under no circumstance can anything go wrong ever or people die type of scenarios um I don't think it makes any sense for a website um unless like that website if something went poorly someone would die uh which maybe that exists I don't know but it's definitely not flow
plane um I do not want revs doing test driven development um yeah the last one I've got for you today trying to brainstorm this one I got man I got nothing you got nothing Conrad why have test driven development when you can have users yeah release on every Friday before a Wan show into production oh I got one okay what product do you think was absolutely ruined by a company Philosophy of bad faith toxic company relationship with its consumers every blizzard product boom mic drop we're done here all
right that's pretty good yeah I don't disagree see you later next week same bad time same bad channel oh that is actually it okay bye I didn't realize it was done and there it goes front coming up in the rear we've got a Joshua oh and they're gone people like them  tracksuits still alive I think so put it back put it back put it back the show's not over I have a gift for you what that I saved to give you on the show okay you're no you're G to you're going to really like it all right here you go
don't read it don't read it yeah just open it you want me to open it yeah just  it just open it okay hold on hold it up have you never done an unboxing video before life good Lord you you could read it maybe spaceborn computer and then there's an altitude in "that at 17,500 mil hour are these flown" patches can you just finish opening it for crying out loud God you suck at this sticker of the same thing okay very cool I know where that's going to go another sticker my computer is
spaceborn International Space Station HP  two how much of this do I read out loud any of it whatever you want I don't care uh subject return of official on behalf of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration I am pleased to certify that these items were flown on board the signis vehicle and transferred to the ISS over the period of May 24th 2018 through July 2nd 2018 while docked to ISS these items traveled more than 29.9 million miles these are this is a flown
patch that is so sick I can't take full credit for this uh this was this was gifted to me when I went down and shot that video for HP Enterprise so um wow realistically I knew you would appreciate it far more than I would so uh I used to watch a lot of the footage when a lot of these names were on the on the ISS so that's that's I recognize the name that is very cool thank you very much a you're very welcome that is awesome yeah 100% regifted Ginger kit ELO but for real for
real like look could put this in my like Library like realistically my policy and you've seen me do this is that I don't accept any anything not because I consider it like a like an ethical issue if I take water bottle swag or whatever but because I just I don't need more stuff I I'm I'm I'm at a I'm at a stuff limit in my life and so I I don't I don't collect things I don't like acquiring stuff one second yeah yeah yeah go ahead alive I'm going to just I'm going to at least mute his mic Dan
and I are both trying to his mic at the same time um so I don't really take stuff but this one was something that I was like okay this is actually like the coolest thing ever and while I don't need to put it in a collection of stuff that I that I don't stuff um I I I knew I knew Luke would be into it so so I I I accepted it be because I was going to give it to you so it's not really a reift in that case it's the way that I see it Oh uhoh what now uh uh okay see you later nothing but see you bye this is
