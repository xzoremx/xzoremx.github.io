blaz it Bear Creek asked how can you tell a good pre-built PC from a bad one and this is a complicated enough answer that we've done an entire series of videos multiple times breaking it down because there are so many little things that separate the good from the bad packing quality the preconfigured software the preconfiguration of the bios for performance tuning all of these things contribute to whether you're going to get a good experience or a bad one in the games you love of course the
