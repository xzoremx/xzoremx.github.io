12 years ago I promised lukee that if he stuck with me he would never go hungry again or without a gaming PC anyway the problem is that his tastes have gotten kind of expensive and I think it's time to convince him to let me out of this one-sided agreement with the help of our sponsor Lexar who is helping me make the process as painful as possible I'm never leaving this agreement okay that's not your line as painful as possible well like after build it myself or something no you have to watch them build
it are you ready to be the very best like no one ever was I mean yeah I'm actually kind of excited for this that's  idea bye Luke don't worry we got this under control oh like I'm not like helping like advise or anything we'll see in a bit how we did okay bye luk computers are always Pok√©mon themed but instead of rock type like his previous Geodude build we are going full grass type with one of the original starters from Pokemon red and blue Bulbasaur plastic baggies full of green
stuff you sure we weren't going Afroman themed it is weird that there's condensation in those bags afrand I'm thinking it might be easier to get some of this stuff in place before we build the system who wants to be on decoration Duty me please got it I see you guys manag to find the most hazardous glue got CA and this giant hot glue gun what could go wrong everything we're going to decorate it to look like a Bulbasaur habitat yeah exactly oh wow there's grass is this computer going to
suck like his old one no it'll suck in a completely different way oh you picked the parts for my old one I don't know I didn't do any of that weird stuff that's on you man okay all right sort your supplies trees yeah so make a tree pile isn't Craft Time fun I think so that was a matter of time and then here's a bunch of flowers what about this what about this what about it here's what we're going to start with my little ladies these tubes right here they're pretty white and pretty boring
right now it would be cool put this on it maybe not why don't we put these vines on it you look busy why don't you help me build see I looked away for how long look how long I looked away for someone needs to actually build the computer up you get he's just gone better the girls are actually doing their jobs and the boy isn't yeah that's true that's actually true right now at least all right we aren't going to be covering the CPU and Greenery so why don't we start here we've got the ryzen
7 7800 x3d this is a great chip 8 core 16 threads that boost up to and amd's 3D V cache that helps it outclass much more expensive chips in the right scenarios specifically gaming however most 7800 x3ds are great we tested over a dozen of these for a recent video and Luke will be getting the absolute worst of the best that's still pretty good yeah you don't need to do that to make it the worst the very worst bin we could find but a really good CPU but a really good CPU it's fine with me do you
remember how to install a CPU think you can figure it out I did it wow wow thanks come on boy come on little the one building the computer today so you're going to have to actually figure it out okay NOP no your confidence now he'll it's it's basically Lego he'll figure it out lift this up nope not that you already lifted that no not that this don't bend those pins cuz then the board is dead and this is a really nice board we've gone with an azrock x67 Tai Chi it's a little wide eatx but uh so
that's fine just means you need to be careful when you pick your case it's also got this Nifty White marble pattern that a partially matches the case that kicked off this round of upgrades yes my friends Luke thinking this case is cool is the whole reason that he was like yeah I should get an upgrade right now like okay that makes perfect sense yeah and yeah what's up with that I didn't ask for an upgrade at all how did this happen I mentioned that the case was cool to Jake like a year
and a half ago it's on Jake then and he was like oh you should do like a build upgrade into it and I was like go we just be like migrating Parts like I don't know maybe I'll just do it on my own time and also we'll be even funnier when we cover it up with a whole bunch of greenery so you can't even see it this thing just broke yeah no no that's fine that's supposed to break off we've all been through that part it feels wrong when you do it yeah who who put this did you
put this in here me yeah oh okay you got it oh that's all oh wow okay good job okay see I had Faith close the arm the  oh Dad it got tangled hi oh okay so hold on hold on hold on that's very Tangled why did we think this was a good idea ah where are the ends I don't know I found one my love do you know what a rhetorical question is no it means it's a question that you don't actually expect to be answered I found one though okay and yours is wrapped and looks so how did I get such sassy
kids I think that's not a a difficult  rhetorical I think that you are ready to start working on this there are some things that you can't cover up youngest child working on most critical components let's go we've got to be able to plug in anywhere there's a plug I think everything else is fair game good advice all right yeah yeah oh wow oh wow the beautifulest AO most beautifulest hair okay it's most beautiful not beautifullest I know they got more sass something you would do though wow good
job we chose this board not only because it looks good but also because it's got PC e Gen 5 Active cooling for the vrms though apparently we'll be covering those with grass four ddr5 dim slots for "our 64 gigs of 6,000 megat transfer per" second Thor memory from our sponsor for this build Lexar uh these guys went all out on the looks of these modules Norse print on a tasteful aluminum heat sink designed for Superior heat dissipation it supports XMP and AMD Expo overclocking and comes with a limited
lifetime warranty that probably won't cover child related damage so Luke you better pray my kids don't break it when they install it do I push this I mean uh yeah but the angle matters so don't just like shove it normally it would matter which slots you're installing in we're using all four which should be fine you can run into some compatibility issues with four sticks of memory but this is single rank memory so this is scary I don't want to break it I mean I don't care I care a little bit actually Lexar
sponsored the video so be careful not to break their stuff wow hedge henge um okay why don't we get why don't we get this glute on this hurts me me goodbye infinity mirror oh man hello Infinity glue why does it hurt you never coming off but look how beautiful it is now how you doing kiddo one more are they all clicking into place yeah wow okay good job yeah nice not bad all right maybe the tech tips are hereditary do you think you can handle the glue gun yeah so we just want to use a thin layer over
the whole area that we're gluing okay you have a little bit of time before it sets there you go so we're trying to make it straight uh is that the right orientation no it's not on straight that was so perfect it's not on straight okay that's fine I mean it's just Luke's computer the next thing we're going to be hooking Luke up with is two of lexar's award-winning 4 TB NM 790 pcie Gen 4 drives Lexar claims read speeds of "up to 7,400 megabytes a second and" rights of 6500 megabytes a second which
is well within the requirement for your PS5 console Gamers out there you can even choose to have a heat sink or no heat sink meaning it can fit into all kinds of tight spaces like the tight spaces we're creating for ourselves by putting plants all over this why are you giving him 8 terab of storage because Luke's a gamer so so he needs a lot of games I guess mine only has like one terabyte and I'm a gamer well Luke was born first so so firstborn privilege he's he's o yeah got him I have
garbage oh man I think we're going to try and put them under here cuz I think we can put two here under yeah so you got to take these screws out first and then every time you use this you have to say LTT store.com LTT store.com nice good job LTT store.com okay well no like every timec okay not constantly okay my girls I have something for you guys to decorate who wants the long one and who wants the wide one long want the wide one please okay that worked out great as for you you're going to have to take
this heat sink off because there's a heat sink already on our motherboard Precision screwdriver coming soon to LTT store.com there you go good job this screw is so small it would be shame if it fell on the floor how's your confidence doing uh Still Still decently High to be honest he's quite competent in general no no not that a little bit lower they screw into a little soon there I'm picking these slots because they're both under one heat sink which means Luke will have to do less removal
of grass covered heat sinks whenever it's time to access his ssds so consider it yeah okay watch your fingers I'm just going to glue this down yeah that's never coming off we got hot glue right on the screws by accident by accident that's okay can you help her though yeah would you like help no thanks I tried Luke I really did try fine I have a new task for you then Lee and Lee are Super Bros and they put their fans on the cooler ahead of time normally I would actually change the
orientation because I prefer to have the fans pulling through the radiator fin so that's it's a little bit easier to clean Luke doesn't have any hairy pets or anything like that though they're all feather friends so we're just going to leave this and screw this into the case that's it Birds produce a lot of dandruff cool the place you're going to be installing this is at the back there is this okay to take off I would leave that for now yeah yeah I'd leave that for now you're still pulling it okay
wow do you want to show the camera that bottom right thing is this is yeah you know the GPU is going to cover a lot of that I mean I've heard this is kind of in style though the Little Triangle patch these fans need to spin so we can't put on anything that gets in the way of them spinning but what we can do is we can decorate the hubs in the middle they're Infinity mirrors but now they're Infinity Bulbasaur you want to put shrubs on there you want to put bushes on a fan you can't do that trees might not the
best idea cuz I don't think they'll stay on very well shrubs I like the shrubs thanks David really helpful stickers I think stickers are a really good idea this seems like a perfect opportunity to talk about our case we're building this whole mess in the leanly o1 vision and the best thing about it is how much tempered glass it has to show off my kids's incredible handiwork okay the real reason we chose it was that Jake really wanted us to include this part that he machined in high school for a
water cooling setup that Luke never got around to building and this case fits it do you have any idea what he's talking about yeah then you guys didn't use it this the stand cuz like this went like that so there was a plate that was machined for the bottom of the reservoir yeah so it could stand on this little Post David says it was supposed to be the stand for jacked Bulbasaur ah okay we didn't use it no the vision variant of the1 is especially good for custom water cooled rigs but something that
complex was a little bit tough for my kids so we're just going to put that lean Le AIO in and call it a a hopefully the daisy chain compatible radiator fans will simplify the install I don't remember the last time I was this stressed out doing a PC build that's because you barely ever do PC builds the back is so short # liess use the use the nerling use a what ouch have you show him how to use a screwdriver yes which way righty tidy I don't know right can be either way right or right um it's really good
Gres wow this is something this is too yeah okay how about this is also technically a thing what if you guys overlap the fan and then we just kind of cut along the outside and then we just kind of wrap it like that and then we can kind of sticker bomb it I don't think I've ever heard you be such a fan of stickers before it just looked really good it did yeah wait is that the kind of screw that was in there I think it was a thumb screw what's a thumb screw this kind kind that you can do with your thumb dad
I don't think it was a thumb screw oh okay then put in whatever kind realistically it doesn't matter what kind of screw it is it's Luke's computer so who cares I don't want to wait half an hour for Luke to do an update I don't want to wait half an hour for you to get this power supply installed we game together sometimes and one time me updating my games took quite a while but this won't change that at all cuz that was internet speed what's a power supply I'll give you two hints
power and Supply so it makes power well no it supplies power but that's basically making power no it doesn't make Power IT Supplies it and if that's unexpected supplies okay that didn't really land no wow you guys did a spectacular job here I think we're ready to install this in the case do you want me to show you guys how to do it or do you want me to give you something else to decorate something else to decorate please all right I'll be right back didn't even look at the oh
a little bit for a second there no they're really not that interested in the computer can I show you guys where this is going to go oh my brown kind of works what we doing and then maybe you can tell me if you have some cool ideas for what we could put on it no thanks yeah no you don't want to decorate it actually yeah the GPU is going to go right there so with that in mind you guys have any bright ideas for what you want to put on the back or on this side of it or on this side of it maybe like
Vines o we could put some vines on yeah Vines yeah and then maybe on the back we could put grass and we could make a field and that could be where our bu lives sure yeah okay all right so supportive yeah fine yeah definitely flowers you guys can put flowers on this  okay we should only need two pieces if you guys use them efficiently and there are some places you can't cover we can't cover here because that's going to impact Cooling and everywhere else is probably fine realistically also note I
said don't cover this immediately the one place they want to put something time to get this radiator installed I'm not supposed to be doing this so you're doing it and it goes in this spot here yeah probably not gets really good really good crates oh look at that you made a little cutout for the power connector good job dad this has dots on oh that's fine we can just cut a new uh a new bit for that okay how's it going I did it good job Reddit so he got the rad and the fans by
himself no oh so thermal compound goes on the CPU is this safe yeah it's safe okay so oh no yeah wait but put it up against it yeah you're going to have to squeeze like you uh didn't inherit your mother's strength she has fortitude but not strength yeah know okay let's get this glued down first sound good good okay this is happening I'm excited about the trees truthfully this is a bit of a side grade for Luke it's an Asus 4080 knock to a OC Edition it's got 16 gigs of gddr 6X
little overclock on it most importantly it has these sick gigantic noct to a fans that are dead freaking silent while keeping this thing running nice and cool and they're going to have some insulation to work against now in the form of this grass it smells bad yeah it's hot glue honey yeah it's a great card and it'll run anything you throw at it but realistically the biggest reason we chose it was noct toa's trademark Brown aesthetic it goes perfectly with our forest theme or it'll look awful in
a white case I don't know all remains to be seen yeah I think it looked great oh it stinks it's this is actual Moss what how does this work fluff the Moss it's Moss is that okay though like is it going to rot well we fluffed it is it going to rot now it's fluffed more what happens to more natural look like dried out Moss over time sounds like a Luke problem yeah it's also a lot of glue well it was all was all flaky I didn't want it to come off there Moss oh wow good job you guys is Luke going to have
to water his computer I mean it depends if you want to keep your moss green you might that's true you tested all this stuff ahead of oh yeah it all works okay or at least it did it did great he plugged in all the power nice that one goes there it only goes in one way so just try it one way and then if it doesn't go then try it the other way and then if it doesn't go again then you must have screwed it up the first time and tried the other way again USB baby what if it doesn't go the third
time uh well then try again wow will really like it yeah I think so you guys are going to decorate the GPU support and then when that's done it's going to be time to make a field and some trees and stuff for Bulbasaur should we make this a pond paint no paint GPU support ah nice going to put on RGB cables watch me fail no no dude you got this you got this oopsie okay so we have two of them dad at the end can I make one of these things where you put it around your head you can do it now if you want yay but
how am I going to put it together I have no idea I can hot glue it to your head if you want yeah please not too my yeah please wait we are getting really close to putting it together and decorating time got a rear fan here ah ah David what do you what our tree stand look at this our tree stand it's our third fan in the bottom and then you can stick trees in it I don't know whose ideas are worse the kids or the adults what that's a good idea edit's notes make a code that says Luke's PC to get
5% off stuff in the LT store you're not allowed to give discounts on LT store editor's note make a discount on the LTV store he figured out the code if you clap they can't say no no so this is going to go here you guys need to think then anywhere where there's going to be stuff in the way you can't have tall trees but we can have flowers yeah you can have flowers here or little bushes and stuff so I was thinking maybe Bulbasaur could live in here and we could have some trees kind of out here
and he could have like a little hidden away area okay you've already seen this Bulbasaur but have you seen this Bulbasaur can we vote I vote for Big Man little Bulbasaur is going to live up here somewhere and then big fat Bulbasaur can go in the front he's not fat he's big bone so guys can you make a forest and a little habitat for Bulbasaur on the back of the GPU so this is going to be the front corner so maybe have it face this way amazing contribution little man oh man that
works we might need to put some hot glue oh I feel like there's going to be some extras for this one lm. g/f flat plane let me put it this way Jack Bulbasaur is never moving so you want flowers on the tree and I we could screw you don't have to do all of them at least one of each color them that's the face of a man who's regretting his decisions yeah let's go he's he's starting to run out of energy how's the front part look wow it looks like he's it looks like he's like crashing through the trees that
look aming but it's so sick he's like here's the big moment you guys ready this is the big moment Bulbasaur is the big this is a pretty big moment wowe sticking out of this wall please I like that this implies that you're jacked Bulbasaur please turn on computer please this would be so much work to redo at this point I guess before we press the power button I should talk about our seic 1000 wat Prime TX power supply uh Luke ran into a few power supply related issues during the Radeon
challenge so we wanted to pick one that he could trust it's got a hybrid fan that only kicks in at 40% load for that Zen state that Bulbasaur so much enjoys and it's 80 plus titanium certified against my better judgment we have used lean Lee's streamer RGB cable extensions I am not a fan but neither is  wow it's beautiful is that beautiful or what the sticker bomm with the RGB behind it actually looks kind of amazing on the fans yeah like unironically looks really cool hey David oh
yes yes there it is who can be trusted to do the sticker perfectly me B are sticking his tongue out okay let's out okay I just broke it by the way that really hurt I was trying to play it cool did you did you bleed it Hur oh yeah is your blood in my computer oh yeah nice and definitely tears wait hold on if I uh started spinning if I break this  one normally there is logic to that but I've had yeah it's a seven blade fan yeah yeah yeah sorry about that bro I don't think there's any way to balance a
seven blade fan fewer than seven blades nope well I tried uh we we'll put a new fan D in back nope but it looks Sor every perfect and what about this shape I cut in the middle and the flower I know we'll put it back on don't worry we can take that off and we can put it on the new fan here we go look at that wow it looks great though it does look great and I helped that bad news everyone I think Luke is going to absolutely love it uhoh what we're trying to figure out right
now is a whether he and I are actually related because if we are he should be pretty good at Halo and two whether this computer can actually handle a gaming load we did put some stuff in there that shouldn't obstruct airf flow CPUs at 52 gpus at 35 degrees yeah see the nocta fans just don't care at all no that's wicked are these temps right that's incredible that can't be right actually crazy can be right cuz it was like it was do do you have Halo framec it's quite the growth yeah the bulbasaurus
are having some protein they are you know what under a heavier load it would probably get hotter cuz you're probably right Halo is probably frame capped still still pretty good Lexar asked us to do a quick Crystal dis Mark run to validate their claims about the performance of this drive and there it is everything's performing EX exactly like we would expect in spite of the situation in there you want me to look away it's a labor of love ah children worked on it don't be too harsh
okay what no this is amazing what do you mean oh my God immediately puts us back to the camera thank you Luke you've forgotten everything that is so awesome I love how it's like swole Venusaur too he's not just like chilling at all it's Bulbasaur not Venusaur man this is actually so cool and it's most ly not broken and we think it might work I suspect this like you know uh stuff coming out of the bottom is probably going to continue um well given that we used real moss I was going to
say it looks really realistic where did you get it from so this Moss here and this Moss here is real I mean real in the sense that they're organic it came from outside we need to put came from outside we need to put the bottom panel in what is it Bulbasaur no like what's in it what are the components is that just part of the mystery I guess I don't get to know I guess you'll find out what's in it why we chose it see it's grass a GTX grass yeah also that fan might be missing some blades what well
the kids I mean you can't be trust you did you did I'm not surprised that lonus may have been the biggest problem with this build LOL fan deal with it is that you no I approve of this message though this may be one of my favorite builds we've ever done actually no joke we just filmed a video on our favorite builds this would have been in it 100% for me yeah this is super cool the little details like nothing lining up at all they kind of get lost in the overall package like I I honestly
didn't notice at all the first time I looked at it and like now now that you've watched it you can probably spot some but it doesn't seem that major cuz there's so much going on yeah and look this fan totally still blows some air technically not very much but technically yeah it looks sweet I I'm I'm super super stoked and I'm super stoked to tell you guys hey why not go check out the video where we spilled a can of Coke into a computer and then spoiler fully recovered it oh no damage so there's
hope that I'll be able to survive with the Moss I said Coke not Moss still green yeah for now I think it'll be okay I think that Fan's buzzing a little sounds like a Luke problem
