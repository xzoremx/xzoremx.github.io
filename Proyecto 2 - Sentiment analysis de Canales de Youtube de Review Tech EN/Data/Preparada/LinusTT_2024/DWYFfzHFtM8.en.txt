amd's ryzen 9000 is a true generational step forward I'm talking bigger level one cache tsmc's new and improved 49m finfet process and a double digigit IPC uplift thanks to its Zen 5 architecture and the best part they're claiming they finally got a non x3d chip that can on average beat their Giga Chad 5800 x3d all while using less power as for Intel well they're in the middle of an absolute dump fire to the point where I actually think the more interesting question is whether team red can slay
themselves or whether you should just skip this launch until they inevitably come out with an x3d variant of these ships that is so strong it makes me forget to to segue to our sponsor MSI need a laptop msi's got you covered with their summer sale event check out their sweet deals on laptops like this cyborg 14 using the link in the video description because of amd's staggered launch we're only looking at the ryzen 5 9600 x and ryzen 79700 x today compared to last gen
they boost slightly higher and level one caches increased but the other caches are otherwise untouched as our core counts compared to last generation however thanks to tsmc's manufacturing process improvements AMD has managed to pack an extra nearly 2 billion transistors into these little guys about 26.2% too bad that wasn't enough transistors starting with f123 we see our previous generation x3d chips leading the pack now AMD never claimed that the 9700 X would be the new gaming
champ but what they did say is that it's "supposed to beat 5,000 series 3dv cash" chips in gaming on average we found that the story was a bit more complicated than that but we'll get to that later for now I'm happy to tell you that our new 9000 Series chips beat everything else on the field except for Intel's 14900 K and let's be real I can't personally tell the difference between 381 frames per second and 378 and I certainly wouldn't want to deal with the extra heat power consumption or cost
moving to a very CPU bound Esports title in rocket League wow do these things ever rip do I need over 800 frames per second no but is it cool that our 9700x is heads and tails about everything else absolutely and the 9600 X isn't very far behind now it's clear that any of the CPUs we tested will do this job just fine even our inexpensive 14100 F but if you were looking for a generational gain it's clear that they can be found like in returnal where our 9700x wins again not by much over amd's goed X 3D chips
but if we narrow in on the Apples to Apples comparisons against the non x3d predecessors we're looking looking at gains of over 20% now considering these processors are barely different when we compare the spec tables and that they're using way less power that is pretty dang impressive and makes me very excited for the inevitable x3d refresh of course those aren't here yet and we haven't finished painting a full picture of these you might have noticed that most of what we've tested so far has been at
low settings instead of ultra so let's change it up a bit and look at maxed out Total War Warhammer 3 this is still a fairly CPU dependent game which is why we chose it cuz we're testing CPUs but you can see that once you start to turn the details up things get pretty close at the top of the charts to show you why this matters we also ran this title at low where you can see that the AMD CPUs do pull further ahead but realistically if you're spending this kind of money on
your CPU you're probably not going to be running everything at low so it's worth taking all of these results as what they are an illustration of how much faster these CPUs are in a completely non GPU bottleneck scenario probably the most interesting thing here though is our little 14100 F that could just chugging along down there but we'll come back to that later first I want to talk about our results from our x3d chips the 7800 x3d does typically beat the prior generation 5800 x3d but not by as much
as you might think both in averages and in all important 1% lows so if you're a gamer realistically our recommendation from 2 and 1/2 years ago hasn't really changed other than that you might be able to save yourself a buck with the newer cheaper 5700 x3d we didn't actually run the numbers on this chip but it's only marginally slower than its big brother and when paired with a budget board and some ddr4 memory it is an outstanding value x3d is weakness however is in productivity and this is
where the fun begins intel was already behind in huget bench Photoshop but now AMD has increased their lead with a 10 plus% gain over their last gen 7000 series in handbreak our h264 results were disappointing with the last Generation ryzen 7 beating the new hotness but av1 encoding is a whole other story thanks to am5 switch to a true 512-bit data path instead of double pumping 256 we see a similar Improvement on the 9600 X in blender but curiously the 97 100x isn't going to give you a
reason to upgrade over last gen perhaps it's not as powerful as we thought it would be more on that later and unfortunately that trend of barely changing continues with go do compile where we have some marginal generational uplift on the ryzen 7 and then slightly better results on the ryzen 5 7zip is a tad better for both in compression but then worse in decompression and while cinebench does see an improvement it's minimal so what's going on here as it turns out a lot of it has to do with the lower power
consumption that we mentioned earlier in cinebench our 7700x consumes an average of 144 Watts while the 9700x is steady at 88 Watts that is almost a 40% decrease in power consumption while netting slightly more performance and here in this part of Canada where power is cheap it's hard to get too excited about this kind of efficiency but for other parts of the world you could save so much on power you could treat yourself to a PTM 7950 thermal pad from LTT store.com and check this out sure
our 14700 K is streets ahead in terms of raw numbers but it's using almost 250 Watts out of the box to get there that is almost triple the power for just under twice the score and if you toss out those ecor we can see that in single core testing on both the 97 and 9600 X Intel is losing by a wide margin now part of this could be because AMD seems to be leaving some performance on the table check this out in cinebench our ryzen 7 refuses to reach the advertised 5.5 GHz boost clock capping out instead
at around 5.2 and I know what you're thinking well that 5.5 is just a single core boost it's just for gaming except that on our ryzen 5 it does manage to hit its maximum advertised boost across all cores in multi shaded workloads not all the time mind you but sometimes our ryzen 7 doesn't seem to be defective it hits 5.5 in games and even in other stress tests like occt linpack and outside of games it's using the same or a similar power envelope to do so so what gives here and I know what you're
thinking it's got to be cooling right well here's the thing this might be clear to some of you already but less Watts means less heat so where AMD was already crushing Intel now we're seeing even better performance these chips run so cool I'm talking a 22° drop on average on the ryzen 7 and 16° on the ryzen 5 so for anyone who hates seeing High CPU temps AMD just dummied Intel and did it efficiently so it's not thermals what is it we'll get to it first I want to talk about where this
efficiency uplift comes from it's partially thanks to amd's new two aead branch prediction this is going to be really simplified down but here we go let's say you're running a program and that program is trying to get from point A to point B without Branch prediction at every fork in the road it has to stop and figure out which way to go then go down the right path with Branch prediction your CPU can predict the path ahead of time removing the need to stop and think at each fork with two ahead
prediction the CPU is guessing the next two steps and by dual porting the instruction fetching AMD is is able to basically check the guess work about twice as quickly which speeds up the entire process now there is still a penalty if they get a prediction wrong but it's not any worse than how they were doing things before so it's all gains baby so what's not to love here well there are a few things we are not getting the xdna 2 AI component that is present in the strix point mobile
counterpart to these chips instead AMD is claiming that the CPU can act as an aii accelerator which is a pretty honest takedown of the whole AI frenzy that AMD themselves is participating in but it could make a slight difference down the line especially for power consumption a bigger issue for me though is that more ryzen 9000 chips are coming but everything AMD has announced is going to be more expensive than what we're looking at today which continues amd's troubling trend of ignoring their ryzen
3 customers we also think that while efficiency is exciting to the data center folks who are eagerly awaiting epic Turin with its Unthinkable 192 core counts most desktop users might have preferred to see AMD give these chips a little more juice by default and it's finally time to talk about the weirdness that we observed we tested the 9700x with PBO enabled and with its power set to unlimited and what we found was that it easily Drew over 140 Watts putting it in the same neighborhood as its
predecessor in terms of power consumption and resulting in some measurable performance gains of course though this is technically overclocking and with the recent reliability issues that have plagued Intel users I can understand why some of you might shy away from this so I guess what I'm saying is I wish AMD had just officially under warranty given these things more juice so that we could reach those advertised boost clocks across all course like we did once we enabled PBO
also last thing the lowest tier am5 b840 motherboards that are supposedly supposed to help make this platform more affordable don't officially support PCI E Gen 4 so if you do try to save a buck on your motherboard you could end up seriously limiting your graphics and your storage bandwidth which just just it's one more knife in the side of amd's budget conscious customers with that in mind we thought it would be interesting to see how amd's new offerings stack up against what you
can't buy from AMD right now a CPU that costs less L than half as much money fits in a cheaper board that does support PCI Gen 4 and comes with a stock cooler the results aren't amazing but when you don't even have a competitor in the weight class you kind of forfeit the fight and Intel's 1400f puts up pretty respectable results at less than half the price now it struggles in productivity and struggles even more in CPU bound games but if you're on a budget it's a pretty compelling value of
course though it's based on a platform that has no future upgrade path and you aren't saving that much compared to am4 which by the way AMD just released another refresh 4 with the XT lineup and they also confirmed that am5 is going to be supported until at least 2027 in conclusion then solid chips even better if you're adventurous and turn on PBO but not really for gamers so I'm kind of more excited to see the matchup that's coming then between the 9800x 3D and Intel's AOL link which supposed is
dropping hyperthreading all together huge move and I don't think anybody knows what that's going to mean for gaming performance as they go to a purely big little architecture just like nobody knows what on Earth would happen if I didn't segue to today's sponsor Squarespace tired of your online presence looking like a geoc city's nightmare we feel you instead of dragging your feet on coding a site you can literally just drag and drop designs with Squarespace blueprint it's designed
