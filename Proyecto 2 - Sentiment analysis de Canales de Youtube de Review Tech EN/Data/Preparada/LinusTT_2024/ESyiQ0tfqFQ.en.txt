well there's no way that this is not the place robot vanity plate nondescript barricaded building that's D brand for you and as part of our circuit board collab which you guys will know about if you saw the video where I wrapped my car in glow circuit they brought me here to their headquarters to show you guys for the first time ever how the overpriced sausage is made the only trick is they haven't shown me how to get inside the building that's the key huh very funny they didn't expect me to
injure myself playing paintball and bring a cane though did they oh no I broke my cane and then knocked the key off I didn't see where the key went oh oh no I got it I got it  it and I didn't even need your stupid stool D you brand got him fancy see being short is an advantage look at that boom I'm in already ha don't have to wait for nothing don't burn your wallet on holiday gifts this season actually wait do burn your wallet our sponsor Ridge oh I accidentally turned it up sorry Dennis
our sponsor Ridge makes wallets as tough as you are and they're up to 47% off for Black Friday check them out at the link in the video description um is this hand sanitizer or is this some kind of like oh yeah it's just hand sanitizer okay sure I guess it kind of makes sense that they're shut down today it is Rememberance and stay hence the uh poppy it's a little weird you may have to lose the light Glenn there's glowing arrows on the floor man this place is a Vibe oh sick check this out you guys here it is
glow circuit glow-in-the-dark Skins baby all right this is where the arrows lead welcome to dbrand everybody I'm not sure what I was expecting but it certainly wasn't a completely unguided Tour all I have is this manila envelope with what is supposed to be all of the instructions that I will need welcome to the dbrand factory we had better things to do so this dossier will be your tour guide and of course file 4 fo9 do you know how many people actually think that I'm under 5T tall because of
their memes stop number one the mezzanine this is where dbrand administ functions are carried out marketing customer service hostage negotiation money laundering you name it additionally there's a table where they film their tutorial videos this is it I don't know why but I kind of expected more wait no this makes way more sense this is the table where they do the installation tutorials if you just got your dbrand pixel 9 skin relax this is going to be easy anyway we've
got a black magic 6K couple of LED panel lights oh nice little recorder with a pass through to a screen in the back that's actually a really nice little setup I'm a little surprised to see it just in the middle of standing desk SL sort of cubicle land but oh my gosh of course here it is the one and only Illuminati PC that ridiculously Overkill totally impress tactical creation 100% deployed and here's a part of it that I never got to see I was told that they had to create a custom desk to
hold these three ridiculous monitors that you can't even see from one end to  other are you kidding me this is so stupid there isn't even a chair at this desk anyway what is the point of it being a Sit standand also the the mousing area compared to the amount of space on the screen that's it for stop number one now we've just got a map F in here okay all right under me is inventory then order packing more inventory and then over on the other side shipping assembly manufacturing and
raw material so that's it it's all here one roof enrichment okay it's a basketball hoop all right enrichment let's go check it out before we get there though this is interesting this was uh not on our tour but they knew who they were letting in here on supervised didn't they development samples for all kinds of products that as far as I know haven't been announced now none of that is probably going to make it into the video but there is one thing that caught my eye to review all right we got some 
that are you getting into the mouse pad business and you're doing some competitive analysis huh I'll save you the trouble fine quality packaging okay natural rubber back very grippy high quality Stitch to edges vibrant prints did you put a hole in it look dbrand save yourself the trouble stay in your lane it's already as good  be yo Glenn I found a fatal flaw in the   whoops shop some of the best LT store deals of the Year this Black Friday you can save on magnetic Cable Management
screwdriver combos t-shirts water bottles and more at lmg dogblack Friday and today only we've got an exclusive exclusive deal where you can get a free Corsair mouse and keyboard when you buy the LT backpack all for the normal backpack price of $249.99 holy crap that is a really good deal again lmg gblack Friday next STP manufacturing floor and good gravy are there ever a lot of steps to this every one of the machines behind me is working on circuit board right now at some stage
or another starting with this guy right right here the surecolor s8600 L solvent printer this is used for doing the base color of circuit board including the LT panone which is 1655 C hey check this out they've got a panone deck right here so we can actually compare what's coming off the printer with the target wow that is really close damn uhoh I just rued it uhoh it was too wet um well they'll uh they'll find that probably I'm going to go find a little pen or marker or something and I'll I'll
put a mark there anywh who these printers use six color cmy KO for maximum color accuracy and can cover over 98% of the panone range these are some off-the-shelf oranges just to give you some idea of how far off it would have been if we'd gone this route yeah these are really not that close it seems kind of impractical to just print one color across an entire sheet of vinyl like this but apparently these can do up "to 1,000 square ft per hour fun fact by" the way there was no panone LT orange
until I think it was Sarah just picked one before that we just did whatever we thought looked nice now to check out the laminator this applies a protective lamination to the ink once it's gone through the solvent printer which  necessary wow you do not want to get your hand stuck in there the laminate and the vinyl are apparently pressed together at a line pressure of 14.28 lb force in which Nets out to "about 57 PSI or 8,200 lb a square foot" that pressure is to ensure that there
are zero bubbles between the vinyl and the laminate and dbrand notes here that they used a specially selected laminate to ensure maximum bond strength for the ink from The Next Step which is the 3D UV printer 3D UV printer okay that sounds pretty cool and here it is the star of the show man is this thing ever cool I've seen videos of it already but in real life this is a whole other level so it works much the same way that a typical fdm 3D printer would right where you're
taking your spool of you know ABS or pla plastic and you're depositing it down and then you're cooling it and letting it Harden except instead of plastic it's using layers of ink in this case five layers to give the finished skin that uh that almost texture that I personally find even enhances the grip a little bit so each layer goes down then and is instantaneously cured by the 400 W UV bulb that you can actually is right there in the print head giving it an incredibly cool look as it's printing
out because as you guys might know UV light instantly Uber charges glow-in-the-dark materials so it looks freaking bananas as it's coming out of the machine and this is it the finished roll it has so much texture to it that I bet you guys could probably even hear the sound of me scraping a nail over it now as you can imagine machines like this which by the way cost well north of six figures each not exactly intended for creating cool textured skins for phones so what are they actually for
dbrand actually left us some example images that wow weird but anyway let's say hypothetically you wanted the customer outside your store to see this image but you wanted the customer inside your store to see something else this is just one layer and as you can see it's pretty much completely see-through no good that's what you'd see from the other side but if we do two layers ah now we got a nice vibrant image from the one side oh no we can still basically see that from the other side okay okay
how about three layers hey that's more like it Dennis from the outside sweet sweet respit on the inside but okay the inside customer is not really seeing anything that's where layer 4 comes in nice white background and finally a five layer print Dennis on the outside of the store me on the inside of the store and basically completely opaque from both sides cool right wait why the heck did we contract someone locally to do the window prints for our badminton land Center I could
have just asked dbrand to print them before we get to what dbrand calls the bread and butter of their operation there's a couple quick things behind me are the design stations the file for "circuit board contains 70,000 individual" Vector objects and was designed with a team of actual PCB Engineers with the goal of having something that perfectly repeats but is also plausibly the first layer of a high performance PCB design super cool and they left some samples here of what happened when they were
using a laminate layer that didn't bond well with the UV Inc you can see the whole thing just comes right off pretty brutal who says there's no research and development in stickers maybe they're not so overpriced after all and here they are the glorified crickets or industrial flatbed Cutters that are the Beating Heart of D Brand's operation they produce T of thousands of different SKS and if they didn't do this onsite there's absolutely no way that they could operate with the agility that they
do you can see right now one week before launch they are in mass production of all three different colorways of short circuit so we've got the orange and white the glow as well as the blackon black with each of these machines "capable of outputting 5,000 units per" day here let's find one that's running and have a look wow I can barely even see where it cuts that is flipping wild also this is cool they pointed out in their notes that some vinyl cutters will just have the blade on a rotating
head and it'll just kind of drag it around as it cuts but on theirs it's a programmable axis which I guess gives you better Precision plus or minus 0.05 mm Precision very precise once the finished Skins are manufactured they come to assembly for what they call weeding every single one of their designs contains anywhere between one and dozens of parts that need to be manually removed from the finished output before they can be sent to the customer one of the most tedious is
apparently the top of the Xbox series X where you have to remove every single one of these vent holes before it can be sent to the customer okay again maybe not that [Laughter] overpriced de brand estimates that they weed roughly 1.4 million cutouts per month in this facility and all I have to say about that is when I'm done this Xbox series X top you better apply it properly don't screw it up so I have to do this again let's get out of here and head to order packing these markings on the floor give
me the impression that I'm not supposed to hang out here this feels a little more like arts and craft stations than order packing stations but that makes sense because d has their thing right where they do their little handdrawn Post-it notes and stuff they've apparently created hundreds of LTT themed Post-it notes in advance of the launch to distribute with circuit board ERS and oh no this one in particular is a little on  today oh man oh my goodness these are so funny there's so many of them every one
of them these operators gets a machine optimized pick path in the morning so they go out and you can see inventory land is all around us get everything they're going to need for the day and then they plunk down at their station to pack everything securely and of course either pick a pre-drawn Post-It note or even create custom ones according to the requests of their customers oh my goodness how is every single person who works here so much better at Art than me I've been asked to do a couple myself
but guys if you get mine you're going to be disappointed I'll tell you that much line of Shrek tips featuring Shrek the lineros why don't we do a couple Glenn do you art not I'm not anymore not anymore well that's a lot better than me so I think we're going to do some roll reversal here give me that camera see if you can figure out the workflow here  nice giving a thumbs up that's a thumbs up right yeah I well it's either that or a middle finger I mean either would be on brand for
debrand anyway so that was it that's their workflow right that's the whole thing looks like it oh dude okay all right all right all right all right I'm going to I'm going to add some embellishments I I'll add some embellishments all right oh man I don't know okay well here let's try and give the shirt a bit of like an aqua okay you know what we're going to count that Glenn and Linus collab okay one more I'll do one more I'm going to I'm going to try and do Sarah's whale you know what if it's not
going to be accurate anyway screw it  now there and uh there you go if you get one of those then I'm sorry I realized we never really took a look at inventory land there you go  right wow are a lot of these uh but my focus is dinner time we flew in this morning and we're flying back to Vancouver tonight so we haven't really had a chance to have a um oh okay wow this is quite the lunchroom hey I'm sure this is some kind of coded insult so uh you guys are more than welcome to try to interpret it I have no
idea what any of that means no way this is so cool I assumed that this was vinyl it's not this is all hand done that is incredible fliping love it uh apparently this is our dinner Glenn I feel like both of our dinner is not going to fit under here that well delicious and nutritious dinner lunch Le Fiesta nachos stop five time to leave  dinner I I have never tried lunch Le Glenn have you tried lunch Le no I'm not oh boy if it's anywhere near as bad as it  um I'd write them about an eight out of 10 for
stess so that's something I mean it's tasty uh I really don't like fake cheese I like my cheese drippy bro I'm checking the fridge you want to raid the fridge Glenn let's raid the fridge Glenn you want anything from here I don't even feel bad about stopping their print oh my gosh they actually stock Lun Le the nacho that wasn't just  meme okay step five you know what I agree it is time to  lunch Le oh cool blank vinyl rolls if you're ever wondering do they actually use
genuine 3M vinyl I saw this I'm like is this part of their day-to-day meing or is this part of today's specific meing and I'm actually not sure should we should we poke our head out here uh-huh is this a Lambo Power Wheels that that is freaking sick and it has a little phone hookup in here so you can crank your tunes oh man with my ankle being the way it is okay by the way the other major project we're promoting right now is of course our day pack which conveniently has pockets on both sides for your water
bottle and your fold up travel cane   this okay no I'm in I'm in all right time to go home see you later
