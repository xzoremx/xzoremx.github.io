what is up everyone welcome to the WAN show wow that's all the energy I can muster today sick in any other Universe where breaking the streak was an option I think I wouldn't be here today but let's go what are you two topics and I almost pulled all nighters so we're going to get into why that was and uh why we're here anyway uh what else we got today oh right tick Tok is B but no for real this time but wait no maybe not you know what no you're right that topic sucks it's
boring okay Mozilla blasts dating apps for dropping their privacy standards and this is um a bigger deal even than it sounds like I was floored when I was reading through this okay what else we got today uh Gamers escape from Escape from tarov it might finally be over if the cheaters weren't enough we've got a doozy for you uh also nice I don't know what else uh net neutrality might be back uh FCC votes to restore Obama Obama uh era rules repealed under Trump we're restoring Obama I mean you look you see
the you see the pictures the day he started his term and the day his term ended we're going to restore him boys we're going to we're going to put that black hair  haunted dude seen some stuff oh boy just  this wait what pretty sick  awesome yeah dead dead in the corner oh man that's great that's awesome pretty cool hey did you see that on Reddit uh I saw the post but I never ended up actually watching it I I meant to but I think I just forgot oh my God so that's pretty great it's amazing it's
like it really raises the question why did we ever bother to try to create our own intros for anything you know that the LT uh 3d1 is based on uh just a random viewer that created that and then we we reached out to them we had it tweaked and uh and now we use that as well wow that's pretty great yeah it's it's pretty cool like that must have been correct me if I'm wrong guys if you're in the audience and you're going like oh yeah that's really simple or something then by all means let me know
but that looked like a freaking ton of work to me absolutely incredible uh we have one of the most and I I'm not just blowing smoke we have one of the most talented viewer bases is out there when I see stuff like that it just absolutely blows my mind so that that was super cool um I feel terrible for not knowing the name of the person who submitted it do we have that handy Nate yes that's a by Nate C absolutely killed it um he remade a special version for me without the ending credit so that I could put
our sponsors over it uh even supplied the font that was going to be for it um super awesome that is so cool did we give him did we give him money I I don't know we can follow up if you want okay um yeah let's uh yeah I'm going to send a message to uh to Vance and I'm going to make sure that some money leaves our bank account while you do that you were talking about amazing we have a very creative Community uh escape from tarov has a very angry Community uh escape from tarov developer battle State games
has angered fans by releasing a new 250 Us doll version of the game you heard it right after taxes and fees and everything else this is like almost 400 Canadian or something like that I don't remember exactly um but the the fees and taxes are pretty brutal as well it is wildly expensive have you not heard of this no yeah okay this is why I wanted to include this topic dude you done nothing but shoot videos and inhale paint fumes this week so I have no idea what's going on yeah $50 uh version of
the game the pricey new unheard Edition uh includes access to an offline PVE co-op mode which uh supports all of the quests and everything else that the main game does all able to be done in PVE Coop that's actually pretty cool like I would probably enjoy that version of the game more because the reality of it is I love the concept but I'm not sweaty enough to play tarov yeah hold on though that existing at all is not why people are mad we'll get there in a second cuz
people love the idea that that's a thing yeah totally people have been begging for this for I don't know it's the whole time the game has existed so yeah totally no problem um as long as they're not plastic bagging those are banned then everything's good sorry my brain's a little stupid today okay this this uh PVE co-op mode will will have persistent progress so when the game wipes it won't reset every time um cool yeah so those things those things are good have like like like
Boulder's Gate or whatever like you could have like a campaign that you're playing with your friends yeah and you're and you're it's a co- mode so if if yeah if you can't play all the out of that yeah exactly me too I would there's there's um cuz like every time I touch tarov it's wiped like I just I it's not the kind of thing that I can commit to playing every day or every other day I genuinely think every time we have played you've had a fresh character so it is what it is um yeah I think it's
fantastic there's there's unsanctioned they don't like it uh this is I don't know the where the legality lies on this but there's like this thing called spt tarov where it's single player tarov and there is an unofficial co-op mode thing but those are all uh battle State games fights against those and doesn't like those those are uh they they think they're bad so this is like an official one um the Games official Twitter account has confirmed that this mode is exclusive to the $250 US pre- taxes
prees unheard Edition this is a big deal really big deal I have hold on I have a big question here yeah how did they know  it I just hit my face against the mic that made me face pal so hard um this is a big deal since the yeah there you go this a big deal since the $50 US Edge of Darkness Edition which is no longer available for purchase promised buyers free access to all subsequent dlc's and there is actually on the subreddit uh there's a screenshot of a tweet are they arguing this
is they're arguing that it's a feature not a DLC well what the heck is a DLC yeah  tweet go for it can we get together and Define what exactly DLC means because as far as I can tell it's a catchall term it's content you okay well tell me this do you download this or do they mail it  you I would it would be so funny if if they mailed this to everyone to like try to get around it that would be hilarious I that would explain the cost yeah uh I still don't think so um there there's a there'ss
what they're mailing You Luke I I have you ever tried to mail a box of weasels like we don't know what they're mailing oh man no sleep less is a heck of a thing um the uh what was I going to say there's there's been quotes from them before about saying how like EOD or Edge of Darkness is supposed to be the the highest tier they're ever going to release um there's a screenshot of a tweet that says you don't need to buy anything at any stage if you have EOD you don't even have to pay for DLCs in
the future you're all in for all of it coming um it's it's yeah and this would also tie in with the fact that EOD or Edge of Darkness with this all dlc's thing has existed I think since 2017 or 2016 even yeah I'm not sure but it's been at least 2017 and um the only thing DLC a that has been available to them has been a very recent release of something called tarov Arena which oh no way I would argue the bought aise of future yeah and bought promise future content and then well they delivered
partially and then decided that they're altering the deal pray they don't alter it further I mean is the tarov audience this Stockholm syndrome that they just this is their game that's the way that I see it every time I play tarov dude I'm like look if I wasn't living and breathing The Meta of this game there is absolutely no way like I couldn't I couldn't possibly hope and some games aren't like that some games you can drop in 6 months later and fundamentally kind of know what you're
doing you know you you jump into Team Fortress 2 it's like oh there's new hats you know whatever I'm probably G to get beaned by a you know flying squirrel or something um but but but tarov it really does feel like if you're not on top of it you just have no idea so presumably then this is the game that a lot of these people play and this is going to sound crazy this is going to upset some people but $250 over a span of let's say let's say it's a year let's say it's a year that
they this going up you know they they actually yeah that they actually have this be the top tier or whatever um that's 20 bucks a month compared to what some people out there who play one game are spending on their Cosmetics are spending on their microtransactions it's not even that crazy now one second I would never pay it absolutely not yeah and theoretically I'm trying to say is dude people are going to pay it yes and and some people already have some streamers already have uh which was a little
disappointing battle st's going to learn nothing uh I think they're going to learn something actually uh their player Bas is their player base is extremely on fire right now the uh the subreddit is on fire people are trying to spin up uh like lawsuits because again there was a version that said you get all DLC they've been quoted saying that you don't have to pay anything again because you own all the things and then now they release something that is uh incredibly more expensive than it was before um and
there's there's there's there's continued issues we're not even through the main body of this this topic there's a lot to talk about here you mentioned there being no other I got to jump in I got to jump in for a second though because timestamp guy nokey he's coming in correcting me on Team Fortress 2 says you often use TF2 as an example but they haven't added any new weapons since jungle Inferno 2017 metas pop up every now and then but nearly everything has been static ever since okay well let me
tell you something Noki I play Team Fortress 2 once every approximately three years yeah so sorry yes you're you're you're probably right my my big moment for TF2 was when they started adding all the like Rando weapons and I was just like oh okay now I have to pay attention to this game a lot you're right uh it's not really a huge issue anymore because valve has kind of moved on to other money-making Endeavors but uh it was an example back then and I should have clarified because
I should have known that they haven't added any weapons jungle Inferno 2017 thank you very much Noki and can we just get a little bit of appreciation for Noki those time every week like an absolute Chad yeah all right thank you uh flow plane customer support Joe in in FL plane chat said offline co-op progression servers are slammed with 20 to 30 minute Q times people are buying it so I'm sad um which this is like man that is the most if EOD buyers so people who bought the Edge of Darkness Edition
that said they got all the free DLC and they never need to pay for anything again if those people upgraded their accounts that's like the most I feel like this is like an outdated term but that's like the most beta thing ever they just scammed the hell out of you oh wow it's going to be you with the hot takes today yeah they just scammed the hell out of you and you were like all right yeah please take more of my money uh you just abused me here let me let me financially support you further
so yeah that's that's a little weird to me I don't I don't support that at all but but anyways uh moving forward I'm going to try to get through more of this topic and then we can we can discuss oh no no I'm not actually I'm going to tangent again you said there's no other games um funny timing uh there's a very recent game now in early ACC is it an early access no it's you can just request it I think they had a play test recently or something I'm not really sure what's
going on with this but grey Zone Warfare is a game that has like a it's it's not the same thing but it will probably capture a very similar audience so uh uh during this battle State Games I think most notably Nikita got in a direct argument with another game called Arena breakout infinite that they are claiming um is a direct ripoff of tarov so maybe there is an alternative for people um but we'll see oh my God I just I just read the next bullet point this is unbelievable in an attempt to fix the situation
battle State game Co Nikita bu took to redit to announce this is great they're giving Edge of Darkness buyer access to the offline PVE mode this is less great for six months yeah that is unhinged yeah that's not the next bullet point though there's more uh this is a super you know super hardcore game you die you lose all your stuff um and this edition of the game is directly unquestionably pay to win in multiple ways uh you've you've played why would you have a Pay to Win Co-op game Luke no no why would
you have PVE pay to win this this the the features are in Co-op but also in the main game so there's there's things like uh let let me see if I can find yeah here we go wait no this is update regarding the EOD Edition uh man you know I hate to I hate to generalize but can Gamers grow a backbone a little bit Yeah like The Gaming Community has to be one of the most whiny communities but when it comes time to actually just do something or better yet not do something just don't buy it they can't
and I realize I've probably gone on this rant before but like this is just embarrassing I mean look I don't think you're allowed to use the term beta mail anymore maybe not I don't know it's for real it's just like you're you're getting you're getting abused and then giving them more money yeah it's like it's I I don't maybe there's a more correct current term I don't I don't know what it is um but yeah let let me read through some of the the features of this addition um
fine I'm not even going to read through all of them because one of them's like digital copy preload which is like who cares so access to that PVE mode that's cool um I wish there was other ways to buy it so you didn't have to spend an amount of money that most people don't even have to spend on video games at all let alone uh one of them uh increased stash size so that's like mostly a no way you you get a bigger stash so hold on it's so much worse it's so much worse oh no um expanded PMC Pockets so while
you're playing you have a Li mited amount of inventory Space the game works in it has a very complicated and important economy uh and being able to take more things out of the raid will make it so that in future raids you're going to be better geared because you have a better financial situation and having increased pocket SI a cumulative effect yeah so before you know whatever it'll have a Snowball Effect because if you can take so much more stuff out you can carry out more stuff to sell you can
and then you can buy more cooler stuff which means you can kill people even more easily and better and raid their stuff and take even more of it this is ridiculous and it makes it so that if you're trying to do a run where you're trying to be very economic you can actually bring less stuff in because not only do you have more pocket slots before you had four one by one pocket slots now you have two one by one pocket slots and two 2 by1 pocket slots so you have tall I'm beginning to think you can
put like full siiz magaz to think there is isn't I I don't dude I don't think that there is a scandal big enough to make Gamers wake up like literally this version of the game could be could be called give me your money [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Edition internally that could be internal code name that that could leak and Gamers would do it anyway yeah yeah uh so in addition to the the pockets and the stash size you also have an increased uh like uh reputation standing with one of
the the characters in the game called fence so that you can sell more stuff on the flea market which is like player-to-player selling and you have more slots on the flea market so you can put more things on the flea market which is directly going to mean that you're going to be able to make more money faster which is a huge portion of the game uh you get a unique in-game melee weapon which people found was uh just an asset from the unity asset store directly taken they didn't do any form
of modif ific to it it's just literally straight up an asset from the asset store I don't remember if it was like a free asset or like a $6 asset or something but they a joke you're the asset yeah pretty much um increased mail retention time so like if you if you buy insurance oh yeah uh if you buy like Insurance in the game or something like that like look most people don't play tarov so there's a lot of people watching this that are probably going such a big deal this and I get
this I get this every time that I talk about something that Apple's doing that is super anti-consumer as well where you know you'll have the usual crowd of well Linus just hates Apple just don't buy it you you you'll get you'll get that sort of that chorus of of bad takes where people are are missing the big picture here the big picture is that this is a this is a precedent now and outrage we we have a limited capacity for outrage right we were so outraged and I know we talk about this one a lot we were
outraged about horse armor in Oblivion nowadays we're basically like men this game this game's great because all their uh DLC is cosmetic and not balance shifting or you know what uh we can maybe allow for that this this skin this really popular skin um is kind of more camouflaged on this map and that map you know what we'll still accept that you know what I mean realistically could farm for ammo for that super op gun so you don't have to buy you don't have to buy ammunition so I guess that's okay
and I know that slippery slope arguments are not very good arguments but when you are slipping down the slope actively tumbling Head Over Heels like what's going on with this tarov situation where they are taking a game that where balance is everything to the experience and messing it up and charging you a bunch of  um my connection didn't actually die there I just my brain is slow today because I didn't sleep last night and I ran out of steam so I thought if I just stop moving then maybe they'll think
that it was the connection I uh I brought up the trailer and got some like visual representations of of the some of the Pay to Win things so here's your in stash size here's your increased PMC Pockets you can see how uh these ones are taller so you can fit full siiz magazines in your pockets now that was never possible before um so now you could go without attack rig um so you're you're spending less money on doing future raids your character skills are just increased this was already a
weird thing in my opinion because people who could play the game for a living would have higher base skills because it would take an obscene amount of hours to level these skills up um and now people that uh maybe work for a living and then spend money on the game can also have increased skills and that can directly make it so that if you play exactly the same uh the person with the higher skill count could beat you cuz some of these things are like you won't bleed as as easily or you're uh more accurate or
reload faster with guns you can run for longer you can carry more stuff you can uh jump higher what like if your if your strength is high enough in the game uh you can jump onto things that are other people can't like it's it's being able to have higher skills is directly pay to win right uh and then down here improve starting equipment set um which is less of a big deal in my mind uh and then moving forward idea every cool idea that battle State Games implements here is something that
we will see implemented somewhere else when inevitably Gamers just lie down and take it and there's no consequences so so here it is this is my call for anyone who is actually into tarov because they're the only ones who can who can make a set a precedent here who can say look this is too far don't play it yeah like seriously set a calendar set a calendar I look I get it it's your favorite game that's chill set a calendar notification for yourself for 6 months at least a temporary boycott will
send a message like yeah it might not affect their wallet because realistically you already bought the game anyway or whatever um but what it will do is it will cause their concurrent player counts to decline it will send an actual message that they can actually understand it will degrade the gaming experience for new people who come in and they're like this thing is empty um and to be clear it's not about punishing them it's about punishing battle State Games it's about like look we are your Community we
are what makes your game good treat us with respect act like you deserve respect and you might get some there that's it yeah oh wow uh six months six months boycott don't play whoa the uh the top oh no what now the top tarov streamer right now um I believe is streaming modded single player tarov which is a little unheard "of in my mind uh 5,000 viewers are" watching this person playing a a modded version of the game which is like super not okay with tarov um I was just
wondering I was going to go see like how many streamers are currently playing this I I wouldn't go after streamers that are playing the game it's really rough when like if your if your entire income stream is based around like playing this one game even if the company that runs that game does something deplorable it's it's rough to kind of fully pull out but maybe encourage people to to try out Alternatives like grey Zone Warfare um or potentially it's not out yet and I
know nothing about the game at all but Arena breakout infinite alternate games that are in somewhat of a similar style that you think they might like and their audiences might also like um but I wouldn't go around don't don't go around like harassing streamers for playing it but yeah rough I uh I was already done because because their response to the whole cheater situation was a giant nothing Burger um and I'm not down to play a game like this with a bunch of cheaters and then when I first heard
this announced I didn't see the price tag and I saw the uh the co-op PVE mode and I was so stoked cuz I was like we're back this game is super sick it's not going to wipe I can play with like lius or Joe or or whoever else there's a bunch of different people that I play with um it'll be fun we don't have to deal with any of that kind of stuff and uh then I was like no yeah no I don't want anyone to buy this so I guess that's never happening uh there there's other weird stuff too like there's an
there's an item that you can get I think this might only be if you have the unheard Edition or something I'm not certain where scavs the Scavengers basically the AI characters in the game won't shoot you if you are uh 60 M or more away uh but like only if you have this version so it's like it's it's it's super pay to win um I don't think anyone that like enjoyed the hardcore realism nature of tarov should should honestly play anymore I think this entirely broke the game but it is up to you guys make
your own decisions moving on though next topic we're going to see what happens apparently that streamer got permission to stream that version of the game really from Battle State apparently what apparently that's what Flo plane chat is saying unprecedented times anyway we can move on to our next   cool that's weird I don't know what that means okay uh but anyways um do you want to talk about Mozilla uh blasting dating apps this one's really interesting to me yeah according to into the dating apps
yeah yeah we're both very active in this in this realm according to recent report with Mozilla dating apps are growing increas aggressive and invasive when it comes to collecting users personal information having declined significantly since the last time Milla reviewed their privacy practices in 2021 uh around 80% of the apps reviewed share or sell or sell personal information and do not guarantee users right to delete their data most apps requires users to opt out of precision geolocation
tracking and do not appear to adequately protect the data that they collect at least one Catholic group was able to out a priest after buying grinder Scruff and Okay Cupid user data grinder is also facing a class action lawsuit alleging that it unlawfully shared UK users HIV status with vendors something which which grinder admitted to doing though it denies doing so for commercial purposes what what a you just did it cuz you thought it would be be fun like what uh due to the nature of dating
apps much of this information can be incredibly personal and revealing including religious affiliations political beliefs and sexual history these companies also automatically aggregate information from users devices social media third parties and the metadata of uploaded content like photos match group who own over 40 dating apps including Tinder hinge match and Okay Cupid say that private DMS are scanned by automated tools and may be viewed by human agents if the bot Flags potential
illegal or unsafe behavior however DMS are also reviewed mind in order to evaluate train and improve their automated tools okay this one blew my mind because basically if it they left it at the beginning if they left it at okay there's something potentially unsafe here it has to be reviewed by a moderator you know what I kind of get that because inherent to a dating app you're going to have monstrous things happening you're going to have human trafficking potentially you know like
you oh yeah these platforms do have to be moderated to at least some degree yeah however saying look we can review basically anything we want for the purpose of evaluating training and improving our automated tools that's basically saying yeah it's like selling a camera that's like yeah I'll just and I'll just tune into it whenever I feel like it um cool cool like I I haven't I haven't used a dating app before so I'm going to sound potentially kind of out of touch here but
I I I I don't imagine that this is clear to the user when they sign up for this thing like guys let me know are you on one of these platforms and was it was it clear that they might be you know collecting and sharing your sexual history and uh you know any infections you might have or man like reading your DMs yo like what I've I've heard tell that some of the younger Generations are are trying to go back to more archaic versions of dating skipping the whole dating app thing which I think is
fantastic very good job keep going wow it's buried in the to I'm sure also become these apps have also become significant more gamified and addictive in part to cope with declining revenues and market share as Millennials have gotten older and settled down gen Z users have become the largest population of singles however they are typically less interested in hookups and casual dating than previous generation did I just get [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] shamed I think so our whole I think our whole generation did
which you know sounds probably about accurate you know what free love man yeah man uh uh yeah the discussion question is there an inherent problem having platforms involved in something as intimate as personal dating uh I don't think it has to be but it looks like it obviously is if you respect yeah if you respect user data then no it shouldn't be a problem you should it all if you just make it so that you can't read DMS unless you're like basically delay is brutal yeah I don't
know why it's so delayed you're not that far away but I I'm noticing the same thing um if if um it would be nice if they couldn't read any DMS unless one of  conversation in float plane chat says when I was at this place we had a presentation by Tinder exacts on data usage and getting to profitability and it was a very creepy conversation yeah bet I don't I don't doubt that I don't doubt that at all but like this this really does seem like the kind of thing that could be
done and it's it's just it's just people you know power corrupts absolute power corrupts absolutely or whatever right like because people who enter personal information in a dating app compared to a political survey or compared to uh you know um a workplace profile survey or something like that assuming that they have um an earnest desire to find a partner um I was reading about how people will answer questions much more honestly and transparently because by hiding it they all they're the only
person they're hurting is themselves and so all they had to do was say okay and our service is to pair you up with someone and you pay us for that and we don't have to have growth forever we don't have to have Limitless growth I uh at risk of sounding like um like uh like like an anti- capitalist man the the the inchid ification of everything just does seem inevitable when you have this mindset of needing growth forever yeah like I understand it to a much greater degree now but especially when I was
younger I would I would come across a news article that's like big company X has missed their their estimated earnings that per share that analysts were expecting from them by 2 cents per share and their stock price tumbled 10% in other news they made 10 billion doar this quarter and I would I would I would listen to that I'd be like sorry what so they make so they make you know hundreds of millions or they make a billion dollars or billions of dollars in this time period but they didn't do like as
good eror as we expected and that we were that we were gambling on that we had kind of priced into their their their gambletron share price so so what they need to do a bunch of stock BuyBacks who who announced like huge huge stock BuyBacks just now I forget who it was but uh their share price went I think it was Google don't on this until I find it Google surges after buying back billions of dollars of its own stock a day ago uh 70 billion dollars so do you know why a company buys back stock there's two
potential reasons one is they're expecting it to go up a lot um and so that could be you know good value to to own more of their company if they're super confident they're going to like do awesome but you know the real reason they do it I I've had is that their share price goes up which is and the personal in yeah and the personal Investments that the executives have in that company and that the shareholders have in thatan go up it's just to enrich them personally and you know when you look at
a company like Google over the last year or so you know what were the big bumps to their stock laying off a bunch of employees and using that money to buy a bunch buy back a bunch of stock uh I was talking about this on the pre-show but I was I was watching the John Oliver bit on um on Boeing Bo really fascinating you can basically Trace back their decline into crappiness to the moment that they started spending their money on stock BuyBacks instead of on making a good product why don't we have systems why
don't companies Implement systems that punish terrible terrible long-term thinking I don't understand it guys yeah I I always had this theory that maybe not stock bybs to the tune of 70 billion dollar but I always had this theory that smaller size stock BuyBacks were based around uh a lot of companies do stock is compensation so I was like how do you how do you just keep doing that forever so you you probably have to buy some of your own stock and then it makes this like cyclical thing where you're
increasing the value of your stock by buying your stock and then giving stock to your employees which increases how much they want to potentially stay or try hard or whatever if that works who knows a little more complicated than that you can issue more stock without necessarily buying the stock does that dilute the value of the stock that you currently have though because you added more um I this is like I genuinely don't know yeah yeah every company Works a little bit differently okay if if Ivon Umbrella
Corporation group of companies had some kind of of Stock Program um I personally would want to I would feel that we should take a Bitcoin like approach uh where not necessarily that you use gpus or as6 to Mint more of the stock um you know I just like the stocks that's why I buy all these gpus no um so so not from that point of view but from the point of view that they are finite and in order to issue incentives for example we would have to actually you know be profitable
we'd have to actually own what we give someone um I don't know how that would work and maybe I'm just you know naive but you know from my point of view it's it's always been frustrating to me that um if I if I have something that's worth of value that someone can just like decide oh yeah no actually it's like   yeah oh well this is not Financial advice guys not Financial advice I'll be the first to admit that when it comes to when it comes to stocks when it comes to to you know real world you know big Le
Finance stuff I don't get it and I think I think part of it is almost just like a rejection of it like I actually not sure if I if I care to get it I don't have to play the game so maybe I just maybe I just won't maybe I'll take my ball and go home I I know that's a the majority of it for me I I hate it it just feels so yeah I'm I'm just not I'm not going to get into all the reasons why we'll get to a new topic uh EV company blows whistle on potential corruption this is
uh this is one that hits genuinely close to actual home uh the government of British Columbia Canada is investigating Al ations of potential conflicts of interest in how provincial lowc carbon Innovation grants are admin are administered this follows an allegation from CEO uh Chase Barber of Edison Motors who claims that mnp a gigantic accounting firm involved in administrating grants reached out uh to his company after declining their first application reached out his company
after declining their first application okay uh according to do together a little quickly today folks yeah yeah it's it's genuinely not their fault I I I'm just trying to piece it together um by the way just quick shout out Edison Motors these guys are doing absolutely incredible work if anyone from Edison is watching right now we would love to do a video together I think actually Alex from our team may be in touch but just want to just want to indicate my my super willingness to come over there and
check out what you guys are doing cuz it's outstanding it looks absolutely incredible that would be awesome uh according to Barber uh rolling back just because it's been a little bit the CEO of Edison Motors uh mnp offered Edison Motors a service to help them apply for future grants which included a success fee of 20% of the grants value ew uh should the application succeed it's unclear from publicly available information whether these grants included the ones that mnp was
helping administer i' I'm going to pause there's more of this topic but I've heard of this a lot before with government grants where they're effectively impossible to get unless you partner with a company who takes a significant portion of the money which means that your government tax credits which are supposed to uh Power Innovation and business growth within your country uh are being diluted by middlemen that is the only way to actually get the business of being a worthless middleman is a business
they're growing that business they should we should find a way to delete all of them um anyways I'm going to move move on uh Barber says that he raised concerns with the energy Ministry uh in person and shortly after his company was disinvited from a promotional event by a government funded Lobby group for vehicle electrification Edison Motors is the only company in the province that manufactures heavyduty electric trucks mnp threaten Sick by the way and they're actually like genuinely very very cool
uh M&amp;P has threatened to sue Edison motors which is a small privately owned company according to Barber the company can't afford a legal battle with a billion doll company yeah uh neither could like most people so I I don't blame them um Barber sorry uh and stated that he personally lives with his parents because as far as my understanding goes he has invested like everything he can into the company which is the like driven dedicated that's what we should be trying to encourage dud yes
that's what we should want out of Entre rurs people doing everything that it takes to kill it and we should be supporting that they've been pushing limits of Technology they've been pushing limits of quality they've been doing all these things that like like we we British Columbia should be very proud of this company and be trying to prop them up not trying to step on their neck so this is very frustrating uh we've got a couple discussion questions even if mnp hasn't technically done anything
wrong shouldn't Edison Motors be allowed to raise concerns without the threat of a company crushing lawsuit yeah absolutely I mean you should be able to raise concerns about anything ever and the worst case scenario should be you know hey we've um we've investigated your concerns and we don't agree with them like you can't be punished for for re I mean honestly though there's so many things that are like this I mean uh the US is finally growing a spine about the whole realtor
thing uh how difficult it is to sell a home without a realtor and how how those fees have Absolut abely ballooned in recent decades to the point where the simple job of being a sales rep and helping you list your house and fill out some paperwork has turned people into these multi- gazillionaires um and to be clear I I'm not down on anyone who's busting their butt as a realtor I understand that it's one of those like being a twitch streamer yeah where where the the the 1% that are
crushing it are sort of over represented in our in our perception but actually most of them are struggling to sell a house whereas those few that are suceeding have you know a team of people working for them and they're basically just parasitically taking money from them um I get that but also just The Business of Being a middleman should be fine but it shouldn't be this lucrative and you know what Luke I I don't want to get too much into it but we've as a company had experiences that
strike me as not that dissimilar to this oh yeah I've directly been involved with some of them yeah and none of this should be necessary you should be able to fill out the paperwork the right way and submit your application according to the process that is on your government's website and it should be processed in priority sequence and then it should be dealt with um okay you know what fine I'm saying it Ivon is still faing some kind of credit that we've been due since I think
2018 like what I'm sure if we knew someone that wouldn't be the case and the big the biggest problem with that because like if you're hearing this yes that's that's a very very very very very long delay that is pretty ridiculous it's 2024 now that's 6 years the biggest impact of that to me is not something that we necessarily even felt that much which is if you're not as that was when we needed the money exactly we're still here six years later we needed it then yes if you're if you're a smaller uh
startup company you need everything you can possibly get because you don't have a lot of assets yet you don't have a significant amount of cashlow yet probably um all all these other things you you need that Capital to be able to keep progressing so by holding it for this long and making it so hard to get what you're really doing is only enabling large companies to be able to get this this uh this money which in a lot of cases they probably didn't even really need it might benefit them they might be able to
do a little bit more from it but they probably didn't like need it and the companies that really needed it it could have made or break their whole company and then they'd be they be fine after that are generally unable to get it so very frustrating so shout out Edison Motors these guys are doing super cool stuff uh we love collab with them and see if we can get them some much needed attention see if we can drive some business their way honestly what I suspect is that their bottleneck because
the product is super cool what I suspect is that their bottleneck is more just Capital which is probably why this is so frustrating for them I'm speculating right now but you know when your Tech is that cool I suspect it's production capacity that's holding them back right now not having a cool product my grandpa used to work in financing for semi-trucks um it these things are expensive I I'm I'm sure a new company trying to get into the space isn't going to be able to produce a a enormous
amount of them all the time um there's a there's a lot of cost involved so yeah sponsor time all right you want me to hit these o yeah let's do that but we've got a bit of a scary merch update  messages sorry we'll get those after sponsors I think um um okay let's do it Luke's going to do it today because my brain is bad yeah yeah yeah okay um ag1 starting with ag1 spring has arrived just like all the beautiful nature out there your body is thirsty for some nutrients so wake up with the bees and

the Kahala Highway and going to check them out super let's go I love their shorts that's great yeah that's how I found them too actually yeah super cool yeah I didn't know they were from here originally and that's amazing yeah yep oh yeah I ended up deep diving them a little bit after I found one of their shorts and then figured out they from here which is pretty cool uh I think we need to do some announcements do we have uh is there store stuff or anything yes uh merch yeah yeah we do we have a date
for the screwdriver bitet pricing increase oh good lord okay I warned you guys about this a little while ago but there's not much more warning here they're going up starting Monday April 29th so if you want to get some screwdriver bit sets they're going from $6.99 which apparently is not profitable so cool um to $9.99 which apparently is is better um thank you CEO Taran so make sure you get those at $6.99 while you can they're going to going to be going up on Monday April the
29th we also have restocks of some of our graphic te's including the neon hard drive sensor and retro GPU I have no way of screen sharing with you guys so you might just have to kind of imagine what those look like but if you want to send a merch message um those might be some things you want to pick up I need a nap before I go to this party tonight though so I don't know if we're going to get to every merch message but uh yeah we'll we'll we'll definitely try and do a few Luke luk week what is luk week
uh luk week yeah we're doing uh something special on Flow play next week and it's all about uh me I guess we will have a few me Centric videos including the iconic chicken re no no no no no if we're going to have luk week if we're going to have Luke week we need lonus week yeah and I hear I know I understand your argument every week is lus week and you know what that's fair but I think we can all agree there's no such thing as too much lonus week no I I think I think we I think we should is it
actually no I'm totally kidding it's just funny that after all these years we have luk week all you had to wait was uh 10 and a half years on a platform that he's in charge of hey whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa so the whole idea was the inventor he was the inventor of Brandon appreciation day and it's taken him all these years to get his own appreciation week it's not it's not an appreciation week my goodness there's going to be other people as well it's not just me I didn't choose that it was me that
started this ah um I I don't know I just knew your ego was going to oh my goodness going to take off at some point I was asked and I just didn't say no took long you've got one chicken recipe  God yeah so there's there's a video tell us what you're doing tell us what you're doing there's a video where I I cook and talk about the chicken recipe and I get I get already to try it um there's my thoughts on the gaming industry and a video of meeting my so there's three videos coming so your hall pass is
Arty uh yeah so the whole like yeah that CAU a little weird don't worry about it cuz the chicken recipe it has a 100% success rate so I I thought about this and I think I think for it to be a success or a failure there has to be a a goal applied so there was no goal applied with already so I think we're fine I see okay yeah I think we're I think we're good um and then I guess I guess we have a teaser here's a teaser of what to expect next week so Dan can you uh play audio from my screen uh yes
if you want to go I'm there I'm not getting any audio from you oh it's not playing yet here we go there we go audio approach the desk at the okay hold on hold on hold on oh oh is it not working year is 2002 I approached the desk at the rental store with a freshly minted copy of the Elder Scrolls 3 morid after handing over my change and scurrying home I proceed to play for roughly 24 hours straight more captivated by this finely crafted world than anything I had seen in my entire 11 and a half years of
life you got me even boo yeah wait is it it's just audio okay no the year is 2002 I approached the desk at the rental store with a freshly minted copy of the Elder Scrolls 3 morid after handing over my change and scurrying home I proceed to play for roughly 24 hours straight more captivated by this finely crafted world than anything I had seen in my entire 11 and 1/2 years of life even boobs I woke my dad up the next morning by professing my love of this game and begging him to
buy a real copy of it to replace my rental version to my surprise he agreed my dad and I would take turns playing on a shared save file where one of us would read through the players guide and direct the other who would control the character these are some of my favorite gaming memories ever we use that players's guide so much it barely holds together at this point the cover has been missing for decades I was driven to get into software development because I wanted to work for Bethesda for Todd
Howard I wanted to make things like mwind this piece of art that means so much to me to say this is my favorite game ever would be an understatement fast forward 21 years to starfields release and I tried with every fiber of my being to find that diamond in the rough but it just wasn't there okay uh I thought that was going to be a shorter clip um but essentially i w really long wow Luke Luke week is apparently takes an entire week yeah apparently yeah I I so that's like a it also changes
significantly from there but I end up talking about how like yeah so Starfield sucked but I'm not going to go through all the details as to why um because it just that's been done to death already so here's my thoughts on like how the gaming industry is going why it's going that way different companies y y y it it yeah hopefully it's interesting the people that have seen it so far liked it um like previous themed weeks we will be doing some LTT store giveaways that you
can sign up for on float plan so if you want to see that content and get some potentially free stuff be sure to sign up and if you want to see what else float plane has if you're not on float plane for whatever reason we're also releasing the car break-in prank for 48 hours on lmg clips and it's live now did they know the show was starting at 100 p.m. is it actually live now dude we've been driving a lot of uh subscriptions on float plane lately yeah it is live now it went up 35 minutes ago we're back
pretty close to to cracking 3500 there's apparently extras oh there's for the Linus tries influence drinks video "now ni 35,000 sorry yeah I was just" bugging you um yeah float plane's been rocking it lately uh got exclusive talking a bit more about the humble PC uh that one up two days ago yeah there's so much the the 90day Scorpion chair challenge video is finally up that went up two days ago as well oh was it Elijah week there's like three Elijah exclusives in a row either that or the
social team has just figed fig out that that guy is solid meme gold anytime you point a camera at him yeah I don't think it actually was but I think it just uh you know became that anyways which is which is great uh but yeah check that out hopefully you guys enjoy it uh let us know how it goes and that's it oh LTT Forum folding update our team is once again participating in the boink pentathlon which runs from May 5th to 19th we strongly encourage anyone interested to participate the LTT team
Place third overall last year which was easily our best so far participation is typically quite low since boink is a bit more complex than folding at home but people are willing to help out if you want to learn so check out more information on the Forum which is I mean there's a there's a URL for it but if you just look up the LTT forum and boink pentathlon 2024 uh topic made by one of our very own moderators lead eater you will you'll find it and it'll be good and you 
yeah uh we can do merch messes all right what's our next topic merch messes merch messages hello LDL have you heard about mram and what do you think it will do for PC insecurity due to its ability to  uh returning the I I haven't actually particularly heard of this but retaining the data when powered off uh could be potentially kind of bad there was there was tactics in the past where you would I don't remember was it like was it like liquid nitrogen or something but you you would cool ram
down to very very very low temperatures and then swap what system was in and then you could pull information out of it um that was an very interesting pull potentially really bad information like if there was a um in in some cases plain text essentially storage of um critical system information or user inputs yeah yeah now is it super realistic for people to be able to get into a computer uh and like super freeze its RAM and transferred over to another computer you know I don't know um but it was a really
cool thing um and if that is now able to be done without the uh difficulties of cooling and whatnot that could be a little sketch but yeah one sec here there we go sorry I don't have my double tabs I was in the middle of responding to another one hi lldd from France I want to buy a cap since the first announcement but I think the logo is too big how do you choose where to place a logo and have you considered a free ad version for a  price I mean we have pretty subtle logos
on a lot of our stuff I think they just  like uh like giant logo for a higher price uh yeah maybe they do mean AD free yeah I think they mean AD free yeah pretty sure they mean AD free okay Sor yeah I think they mean sponsorship stuff free uh or like uh branding free um I don't know I think honestly we generally strike a pretty good balance like even on the hat yeah the logo is pretty big but it's like it's black it's black on black it doesn't stand out a ton and that's kind of a thing right is
wearing a brand on on your baseball cap I I I think the the the start of that product was actually people not really buying the dad hats and a lot of the feedback that we got being that they weren't obviously LTT enough so I think this is just one of those things where you're not going to be able to please everybody uh I really like the new hats it's possible that if they sell really well we will explore that fit in different styles but for now we're really focused on the regular l TT hat 
Pro yeah fair enough okay and last one for this section howdy guys curious your take on the EPA regulations causing automakers to make changes that may negatively impact reliability examples being Toyota's new Direction with  engines man regulation is one of those things you can't live with it you can't live without it I don't know the right answers here sometimes it's really obvious like you know hey you actually cannot discriminate against your customer as as stupid as they look those
Broadband nutritional facts things in the states make a ton of sense given how predatory that industry has been in the past but it's obvious that sometimes we end up with regulation that up harming consumers rather than helping um man I was reading about another car one that was to do with all electric targets or something like that and it was it was looking pretty ridiculous to to be clear I'm I'm I'm Pro you know sustainable energy or whatever but just you know signing a law
and saying okay go innovate um Good Luck  yeah yeah I don't think I have a lot to add there it just it just sucks like um planned obsolescence is a is a terrible thing um and making things like almost intentionally unreliable is bad but at the same time you don't you don't want to stifle a company from being able to make like a bleeding edge version of something or or an ultra high performance version of something that that just has to lose some of its reliability in order to to push those limits so I don't
know uh I just became aware of a controversy apparently the edit of our lonus tries influencer Foods um pushes pretty aggressively to the float plane exclusive where I try more of them um I haven't watched the video unfortunately I do review every LTT but I don't review every short circuit but people seem pretty upset um and basically you know what I'm tired of just taking responsibility for everything I didn't see this so yeah I will I will message the appropriate people internally and we'll
try and find a better balance hopefully we can put this behind us is it that bad I haven't seen it have you actually watched it I'm not sure oh okay all right H this video was a 16-minute ad for float plane I don't know like again I haven't watched it but you also got 16 content yeah were you ripped off I I don't this felt deceiving uh all right well yeah I'll I'll I'll I'll take this to the people internally who made this call and uh you know we'll try and get this sorted out but the thing is
we are a you know we're not a big company but we are a big enough company that believe it or not not everyone knows absolutely everything that's going on all the time and sometimes you know we're going to make a judgment call that's not going to be right I think it's pretty clear that the community has spoken and they're saying this is this is not right this uh so we'll you know we'll we'll do what we can we'll get  guys uh no more merch messages okay uh stop with the rational explanations I want to be
angry uh check out the escape from tarov Reddit there's lots of anger there so much salt if you got if you got something I got a sodium deficiency you got head straight there you're good just you you'll be taken care of entirely um Nintendo issues takedowns over Garry's Mod content following community members noticing that Nintendo related fan content was being removed from Garry's Mod Gary Newman has confirmed that face punch has received a takedown notice from Nintendo quote if you want to help
us by deleting your Nintendo related uploads and never uploading again that would help us a lot tell us how you really feel Gary yeah uh there're almost 20 years worth of uploads for Gary's Mod Workshop including 5500 items if you just searched for the word Mario wow uh there were rumors that the notice was fake potentially caused by false copyright Trolls but according to Gary face punch has confirmed the veracity of the notice with Nintendo and then there's a screenshot of a tweet saying uh I have
been or an X or whatever the heck I don't know uh I have been assured that the takedowns have been verified by Nintendo as legit so this will now continue as planned sorry and then I don't even know the emojis that he included it's like a basketball an arm or like a foot or something there's a garbage can a mushroom so those those ones are like all right sounds good garbage can Mushroom and then I don't know what the Yello thing is anyways um to be clear Nintendo is well within their rights
here this is their intellectual property uh in this case the the likeness you know of Mario is absolutely something that's within their rights it sort of baffling to me that a gaming company managed to go 20 years without noticing Gary's mod um you know maybe that's part of what makes Nintendo different is that they just what they don't look at other games they don't have no one who works there has a gaming computer like I just I don't know it seems to be working for them it's working for them pretty good
um and I can definitely see how this is really frustrating for people that are like yeah we kind of just thought this  our our discussion question is should there be some kind of statute of limitations when it comes to Brands not protecting their IP I believe there actually are but I don't think that that would be covered in this case and it would all come down to the law of the various lands that are involved I think Gary is taking an extremely mature approach and the outraged Gamers who are
frustrated with Nintendo's action by all means be frustrated with Nintendo they are kind of jerk wads sometimes but this is within their rights and uh Gary's  yeah all right speaking of things that uh have to do with right no it doesn't actually but anyways uh net neutrality is back FCC votes to restore Obama era rules repealed under Trump FTC voted three to2 to restore rules that prevent internet providers from favoring some sites and apps over others reserving high speeds for those willing to pay
more for them or otherwise interfering with what consumers do online ahead of the vote FCC chairwoman Jessica Rosen waral hopefully I said that right uh stated in our post pandemic world we know that Broadband is a necessity not a luxury opponents claim it will chill Innovation and investment in the Broadband industry supporters argue that without such regulations Broadband providers are incentivized to charge customers more to use internet Fast Lanes the full 400 page draft order has 
released I I will I will say I don't think I heard of a ton of things happening as a result of the repeal of these rules um but I think I'm pretty happy that they might be coming back so yeah yeah this is great uh there's a few other really important ones that I want to make sure that we hit here like this is actually kind of a big week for news um Tik Tok this was we talked about this at the beginning congresses the US Congress has passed a law giving Tik tok's parent company bite dance until
January of next year to sell the app or it will be blocked from us app stores and internet service providers is this what it would take for iPhone users to finally say hey we need to be able to Sid load is this what it would take to make the iPhone uncool with genz and gen Alphas if you couldn't put Tik Tok on it because there's no way to sideload an app and Tik Tok isn't in the app store anyway this forc investment was passed as part of a large foreign aid package targeted at Ukraine Israel and Taiwan B
dce has promised to fight the legislation in court calling it an unconstitutional infringement on American users Free Speech rights sources inside the company have told Reuters that bite dance leadership would rather Tik Tok shut down than sell it I honestly can kind of see that like this is my ball I'm going to play with it or I'm going home I take it with me a major reason lawmakers gave for the decision to force bite dance to divest from Tik Tok is the lack of a barer between the
Chinese government and Chinese companies national security and privacy experts have expressed concern both that the app could be used to access sensitive user information and that its algorithm could be used to manipulate public opinion about the CCP I guess what I'm asking is why aren't you forcing Facebook to sell to to who even I don't know or Twitter to sell to who even I don't know like if basically your concern in a nutshell is that there's an entity controlling this
app that you can't control and that could tune its algorithm for its own purposes I don't know man like I'm not not exactly Pro China that entity is specifically another country cuz I I see where you're going and I do think you're entirely right but uh I I think they're like ooh this is this is uh what is it foreign foreign National interference or whatever I don't remember the term for it but I think it's something that  um who do you want to see BU it is our discussion
question and I I really can I say the brackets can I say the brackets sure in Brackets it says don't  Elon I mean if you hate Tik Tok maybe you would like to see I was gon to say I  Elon oh man I just I I think the part of me that just like loves to see things burn sometimes just you know why not it is entertaining it's another thing that I don't like or use so like whatever I don't know speaking of government the state of California would like to know your location and also your
velocity California Senator Scott weer I'm sure it's I'm sure it's not pronounced quite like that I love it initially proposed a bill that would Place speed limiters in passenger vehicles to physically oh no this was the thing I was talking about earlier okay yeah that would prevent them from going more than 10 m an hour over the speed limit starting in 2027 actually what however this has recently been revised to just using visual and audio signals to alert drivers of their speed weer also amended
the bill to clarify that drivers would receive one warning each time they go over the speed threshold rather than a constant warning this ver of the bill has passed the Senate Transportation committee along party lines the bill is backed by the national Transportation safety board which has pushed for Speed limiting systems since 2012 and the national highway traffic safety administration has documented a sharp increase in traffic fatalities Nationwide including in major
Californian cities it should be noted that these speed limit warning systems are not new and are actually set to be mandatory in all new vehicles in the EU starting in July man new cars are going to be on The Struggle Bus pretty quick  yeah that because that that's what I was sitting here thinking like it says would Place speed limiters in passenger vehicles they mean just new ones right you don't have to like retrofit your car to have a speed limiter in it yeah so I mean given that
even seat belts you don't have to have them if your vehicle's old enough I doubt that we're going to see speed limiters retroactively fed into cars but I who knows right so in this case then the used car market is just going to be so like you're going to have used cars from other states being shipped to California cuz people are going to want to buy older used cars um or I wonder if it's if you could even get just any new car but from out of state like our our car dealerships along the outside but
along the Californian border are going to be like super popular because you can get non-california uh law compliant cars and then like just you know bring them into California I don't know I don't know how those laws would work I don't know American stuff but yeah EK has given a statement on uh the allegations that they failed to pay suppliers employees and contractors for multiple months uh CEO and founder Edward kig has released a statement apologizing both for the hardship caused by lack of timely
payment and lack of adequate communication he took over as CEO in February and claims to have already addressed several issues but acknowledged there's still a long way to go you know what's funny is this is round two of this did you know that no yeah Edward stepped down as CEO once like 10 or 12 years ago I can't remember exactly when EK basically went to crap and then he stepped back in and restored it to its former glory and better and then I didn't even know that he was out again
but it seems like something about EK water blocks runs best when Edward Koenig Mr EK is at the helm um kig claims that EK is committed to fulfilling its financial obligations and regaining Community Trust I mean our discussion question here is a really big one uh why did it take so long to communicate the new plan like that's something that he doesn't have an excuse for because if he's been CEO for two months um that would have been the time to communicate better um like we said in
the video that featured a bunch of EK Parts though we are we are hopeful that they will get themselves out of this um because you know what I love the product it's a great product and I I want to see them succeed but obviously that success can't come at the cost of their employees and their contractors right it can't come on their backs so good luck good luck EK godspeed yeah what else we got uh uh I don't really care about that one is it the Cyber truck one nope it's the LeBron James tattoo one
yeah okay where is this this is pretty cool they're naming conventions for their new chips are really stupid you've got Snapdragon X Elite Snapdragon X Elite but like with less clocker less clockers s but with what but with what does he the difference for this one what am I even looking at here it just has a different part number for no apparent boost I think I think there's no dual core boost why is oh that's  less qualcom has said that gaming on these chips will just work with the X
series of s so's no porting required and this was apparently achieved through a rosetta 2 Style translation layer it seems they're positioning these chips to be an alternative to AMD mobile radons and in Mobile ryzen and Intel's Ultra lineup they've been showing off their Snapdragon X Elite primarily laptops and claim it can work with discret gpus Okay that's pretty cool so have having the ability to uh like put an Nvidia GPU on this thing and just use it as a CPU is kind of it just kind of blows my mind I
don't know why um semi accurate.com talked with unnamed oems that claim the Qualcomm benchmarks are faked though up to 50% higher than what the oems can reproduce with the same X+ chip Qualcomm has claimed that the weaker X+ can deliver 28 better 28% better performance in cinebench 2024 than Intel's Ultra 71 155h at the same power consumption and it looks like there's a few more notes here but what this is going to boil down to is show me the money let's see let's see what you guys
have actually got going on here enough enough talk I'm pretty excited to check these out though this could be the the Apple silicon moment for Windows PCS I wouldn't mind better battery life that would be okay yeah we could we could use it um who who thought naming four products only two different names was cool I I don't mind the plus that much um I think the problem that makes it weird is the the placing that it has in this chart because Elite sounds better than plus so if plus was just first and
then Elite came after it would be fine yeah exactly I guess what what's just snap plus what yeah yeah but there isn't one of those yeah that's fair three of them just being called Snapdragon X Elite is like definitely the whole problem ah oh well um okay anything else cybertruck thing uh the high school  thing I'm do the high school principal thing for the for the people playing bingo um High School principal almost merch messages okay never mind oh yeah sure let's do it let's do a couple merch messages
I might have to go pretty soon boys you can carry on a little longer without me but I am fading extremely fast here only got one sorry I I didn't sleep last night at all and I got on a plane at 8: a.m. so I had to be I had to leave for the airport at 5 so basically I stayed up working on a paint job uh until about 4:30 I got a little bit of rest not sleep just rest while I packed and then I headed out for the airport at around 5:30 and then I uh and then I ate and then I flew and I got
a little bit of sleep on the plane but I'm I'm dying but you know what I don't know whether it's the lack of sleep or whether it's the paint fumes I'm feeling pretty silly today but it was worth it I just got um I got a message from Alex  says honestly paint job is pretty sick it's terrible so I just want to get that out there right now it's ter terrible but that's the intention um you guys might remember that in that we upgraded pl's car video we alluded to potentially
a part two well what we came up with is that we were going to do a part two adding more Tech to his car so we added Android auto we ended added a backup camera last time and we had teased maybe doing power windows power door locks uh you know putting in some new headlights but like we can't have everyone internally complaining that we're upgrading pl's car and nobody else's so there had to be a catch and the catch is  wanted I'm very excited oh man you guys to see this okay sorry Dan go ahead sure let's
get through some merch messages got four that curated right now hi dll first time watching live at 42 just found out that I'm expecting my first child while you had your family young do you have any advice someone having their first in their 40s oh man well having not tried it um yet knock on wood um I don't know yeah yeah yeah or not ideally I uh heyo um having not tried it I mean I would say the biggest thing that has kept me more aligned with my kids is being into teac actually like I
introduced my kids to Discord which they use to socialize with their friends don't let your kids you know move on to you know Instagram or move on to the move on to the platform and then follow them around because that makes you not cool and everything about it not cool but if you just kind of are staying with it a little bit and you have some idea what's going on don't underestimate the importance of knowing what the heck they're talking about um and yeah some of it's going to be kind of stupid my
kids like stupid movies and stupid videos and stupid games they oh man my kids just got into fortnite anyway the point is you're not always going to you're not always going to enjoy it but think of it as work think of little man had such good taste in games forever I know ah my soul okay that's fine you know what I haven't shown him uh I haven't shown him Warcraft 3 yet and I think that's going to capture his attention so that I'm so I'm going to step up my plan is an RTS
gamer he totally is oh he's for RTS yeah yep he's got the he loves ano um yeah Lov Supreme Commander so yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna have him play the Warcraft 3 campaign that's uh that's some a good one it's a really good what we got Dan get him on factorio maybe not yet but he'll he'll I'm sure he'll like that he won't go to school anymore I'd like to see it once in a while yeah yeah yeah going to have he's probably have a better sleep strategy than you uh sorry hi dlll how have you managed to
keep a good level of structure and tidiness in your test or lab uh places with a growing team working for a company that struggles establishing good practices while  too same yeah yeah hi yeah hi de you're going to continue sorry yeah do we no Hi D I started a job as the okay hold on hold on we deserve a little bit more credit than that um we started by having a pretty big space for them so they were able to spread things out a little bit um they actually do a pretty darn good
job of um assigning a place for everything uh we don't always have everything in its place but overall we have a place for everything so it keeps things from getting too messy um um and we're trying not to rush them and they've had a Forward Thinking plan the whole time there was there was like uh essentially models of where they were going to put things from like the very beginning yeah yeah okay go ahead Dan right one moment Hi D I started a job as the IT guy for a company not much
before was documented I want to document all the processes but would doing that make me replaceable how can I make myself indispensable have good ideas like documenting all your processes and execute it and totally kick butt at it and then have a new good idea and then do that and then all of a sudden not only will you not be replaceable you'll  indispensable cannot be yeah the importance of initiative and uh making the company work better regardless of whether it's directly on your you know
quarterly kpis the importance can't be over overated yeah and like if people are really paying attention and you're just not documenting things as an IT person uh you will be very suddenly extremely replaceable yeah so and as somebody who was Irreplaceable for about seven years you want to be replaceable I took four days off in those seven years yeah that too I need to take a Friday off when I'm hold on we gotta you we got to take the context here the context was they are making themselves
replaceable by making their job function really really really smooth so it was a very different thing that I was talking about constant Innovation is not the same thing as being the only guy who knows how to do it and so you just get called in the middle of the night by the owner or whatever exctly and he did technically end it with or whoever this was um did technically end it with how can I make myself indispensable so I think Linus's answer was like pretty good yeah yeah um you you want to be
indispensable and yeah exactly yeah uh evening L LD caught a merch message in a March W about screen time for kids and thought lonus put out a lot of good info curious lonus what is the standard bedtime in your house for the kids oh man you got to understand I got three kids we were all over that stuff like you know bedtime routine we brushed all the kids teeth by hand ourselves and like always did stories and it was always at kind of the same time these days it's like I don't know are you
tired I'm tired okay kids go to bed um you eventually kind of relax on that stuff um generally speaking one of my kids is a total night out my eldest daughter um so I can put her to bed and you know at 8:30 and she'll still be awake in her bed just lying there staring at the ceiling at 10:30 anyway so what's the point um so I'll send her to bed if she's like cranky and obviously needs to sleep but other than that she's um she kind of sleeps when she's tired and then the youngest one we
try to get her in bed at you know 8:30 and uh screen time does end once bedtime starts um however I mean my problem as a kid was never screens when I was supposed to be sleeping it was always books and we do let our kids read in bed so sometimes they're tired and they're hard to wake up in the morning but honestly if I can raise a house of readers I consider a little bit of lost sleep to be acceptable collateral damage Fair okay last of the curate I've got for you here with how bad the car
industry is getting what do you think of a reality involving an open- Source car I know we both believe the vast majority will not own their own cars in the future don't those exist K cars aren't there kit cars that are effectively open source so much of making a car is not the car so much of it is the infrastructure to produce the car like look how many car companies there are that can make one car or a dozen cars the problem is that the overhead involved in designing and building a car
and setting up for manufacturer means that you have to make thousands and thousands tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of cars or it doesn't make any Financial sense so I don't think that the the traditional model of car manufacture is going anywhere anytime soon but who knows hey framework raised another what like $16 million maybe that's their next big uh expansion probably not I actually oh I had meant to kind of speculate on that but I think I actually just need to go and lie down
for a little bit before this event I'm supposed to attend yeah do it get out here maybe next week why don't next week why don't we uh why don't we play a guessing game and see what Frameworks next um next investment cycle is going to go into number one was framework 13 number two was framework 16 number three is something and they're saying it's going to be quite different yeah not a laptop right um investment disclosure yeah yeah all right I think it's not a um I need to go you guys can hang out a
bit longer if you want but I really need to go okay bye thanks for tuning in see you again next week same bad time same bad Channel um I can't say my thing cuz I'm not leaving but bye lonus um okay yeah High School principal almost framed for fake racist rant using AI a clip was posted to a popular Instagram account with the voice of Baltimore County Pikesville High School's principal making racist remarks targeting teachers students and parents by name these included one threat to
drag the school's athletic directors uh  that uh but it was bad and the clip is still up apparently uh it was convincing enough that it began to spread immediately um Emily y says if you don't want to hear it there are a couple points where it sounds off and it's easy to gloss over them because the rest sounds so natural H yeah that's right this stuff is getting crazy students uh faculty and the community believed the clip and really and this led to the principal being temporarily removed and an
investigation launched the investigation revealed that it was in fact a fake made by the schools made by the school's athletic director what a Twist it's good I love this story it's terrifying that's wild so the athletic director made an AI clip of the principal very negatively calling out the the  um that's rough um the investigation revealed that yeah the Smoking Gun was that he had used the school computers and his school email to sign up for the AI voice imitation service and 
recordings okay forensic analysis points to a service like 11 Labs which can synthesize voices with just a few minutes of audio uh only the principal's Union Leader suggested that the clip may be a deep fake one person how can we be sure of anything we see or hear anymore is there any coming back from this uh in my opinion not really to be completely honest  whatever I'm not getting in the chair  could that was a of I don't want to I don't care that's like a that's like a
is that okay I I feel bad about that why do you feel bad about it I don't know because this your your in Linus's show I'm just here to do merch messages yeah but we used we used to have guests on the show all the time I think Elijah was even like hey can I join and I was like I mean if James says it okay but I also don't know how long we're doing this show for yeah should be a little while longer I guess a little bit yeah uh I think we have some other topics the Cyber trunk may be
bulletproof but it's not waterproof Here Comes Dan here comes Dan we're switching C wait I can't do it what do you mean you can't do it oh I don't know how to do there he is  switching you have to do both jobs so he has to he has like I'll just remote into it it's fine it'll be fine I could do it from home I can do it from over by Linus's place oh that's funny uh there we go the Cyber truck may be bulletproof but it's not waterproof uh Car Wash wo turns out that the bullet
resistant truck is not able to handle a bit of water the terms and conditions of the Cyber truck say that if you fail to put it into car wash mode your new "$80,000 truck can be rendered a paper" weight Tik Tok user uh cap caption caption. add went to uh went to the beach with his dogs and then he didn't even pressure wash it but rinsed it out uh rinsed out the bed with a hose and now his infotainment screen is completely nonfunctional whoa uh this includes the truck's speedometer oh okay uh charging
information and rear camera which is necessary to back up the vehicle because the back window is otherwise too narrow and often obscured by the truck's bed cover several other users have reported problems with corrosion in part because stainless steel is not rust proof merely rust resistant uh all the Cyber trucks were apparently recalled every cyber truck has been recalled due to a fault with the accelerator pedal uh recall here means that Tesla will be replacing the faulty Parts they like slip off
right yeah I think at least part of it will slip off and get stuck under stuck it forces the accelerator down there is the the BR overrides cuz they're all digital the BR overrides the accelerator so if you would press the break it wouldn't matter that the accelerator was down cuz you would just break but I mean how long would it take you to realize that you're not pushing down and how and are you actually going know that that would override it you can't really put it into neutral and you can't like turn
the engine off a lot of the tricks you would do in a gas car are not going to work just right into a wall and a trick that you wouldn't really necessarily do in a gas carard does work so it's like yeah yeah it's terrifying not not good um should use more hot glue maybe uh oh yeah here we go here's the detail specifically it is possible for the accelerator pedal to slide up while flooring it lodging the pedal cover against some trim and causing the pedal to get stuck all the way down rough it
seems like a problem was caused by an unapproved change yeah sure we've experienced one of those we'll we'll backpack okay I take it back yeah this happens all the time it was caused by an unapproved change to the assembly of the pedal and introduced a lubricant some soap to help the cover slide on but I guess that stayed there uh the recall also revealed that Tesla has only delivered 3878 cyber trucks oh my gosh so how much does the Cyber truck cost it's like a hell of a lot of money isn't it people
are saying the braks are physical still um non- flyby wire brakes but the I don't think they figured that out perfectly yet but the accelerator is the accelerator my car has a a flyby wire accelerator cuz you know a lot of automatics will have the automatic cut and blip and things like that right um I mean why would they this is like a "$100,000 truck or something like that" Flagship product I think so why are they just like gluing on or slipping over a cover why isn't it like mil aluminum or
you know there's a screw in it like one screw right at the bottom one single screw like you know this is just just one right there and then it wouldn't fall off like come on I I I was seeing people do like uh I don't want to deal with the Recall yet but I need to drive my truck a little bit what is my fix just take it off some of those were pretty funny you can just take the cover off you can screw it on yourself you can do there's like somebody screw just right through it yeah was it going to
hurt the resale value it's been in the air for like a week it's Prett rusted and you've had to clean it you're not going to get your money back on like the rags and the cleaning fluid for yeah yeah yeah I don't know yeah I can't I can't get uh Tesla's website to play nice right now um it's just forcing me to select a language oh yeah what if I actually just pick one okay now it's working that's weird um a rivet that's a good idea joah one rivet do you know the price of
rivets like practically I think they're like $4 a ton or actually uh what about that uh microwave welding thing where you just like squoosh it and then oh yeah yeah yeah like I think even the stream deck is made with that stream deck can do it why can't Tesla I bet I they make a good car pedal I don't know I wonder I wonder how good it was before they did the soap thing cuz it was an unapproved change that they're blaming it on but there wasn't a fast fit yeah I'm not sure maybe it like
clipped on I mean have you could have a pretty strong interference fit with like rubbers or metals or things like that uh but why would it need soap like are they putting them on by hand yeah I'm not sure what the manufacturing process was but it was a lubricant to put it on yeah you would  glue glue it's slippy little bit of super glue nice uh nice smooth stuff it just yeah there bloody hell whatever obviously they would buy it in higher quantities with bigger discounts but a a
50 pack of rivets from Home Depot is nine bucks Canadian stainless deal I think so goes along with the build goes along with the build have to wash your pedal after every time you exp down there but careful don't wash it with too much water cuz you might short out your whole truck put it put it in car wash mode first I was I was promised Utopia I don't like current year I don't think I have for a while just make good things don't make bad things uh I we had a discussion question
did we even talk about it what kind of process results in a truck that isn't  weatherproof yeah I don't know man the um ego is it ego is it I'm happy with like what Tesla did by existing which was like get more interest in EVS yeah um but like this ain't it I mean to me on paper stainless steel car cool DeLorean yeah you clean it with gasoline that's the best way to clean the DeLorean is gasoline I didn't know that yeah it cleans stainless steel really good which I think is hilarious cuz we
don't do that anymore and it's an electric car and gas is like what $34 a gallon now nearly $3 a liter here it's about 2 lb a liter in the America that is over on the other side of the pond like I don't know it's crazy uh apparently this is I don't know if this doesn't seem like an actual official video oh yeah white diesel that makes sense but uh here's their fix I thought this was a do-it-yourself version of the fix cuz I've seen this video I didn't think this was Tesla's fix yeah I mean just
literally that so they I think this was so when I saw the the one that was claiming this was a DIY fix people were saying n it's official okay I don't know uh but this looks like just like a 3D printed block that ensures that you line it up properly and then uh I think they're drilling a hole and then just riveting the hole I think is the whole thing we'll see here in a moment so he's coming back yeah drilling a hole in it wait for it wait for it there we go there it is looks like a rivet to
me I'm not a fan of rivets they're not serviceable yeah yeah me too I'm going to have to drill that out right to repair I mean you could drill it out though yeah but I agree Robert in there uh an open Future is on the horizon get it cuz that's the name of the operating system uh meta is opening its Quest V headset software now called Horizon OS to third-party devices meta has already uh included three official Partners planning to planning on creating Horizon os-based headsets
including a gaming Focus device from Asus a learning Focus device from Lenovo and a limited edition meta quest in collaboration with Xbox meta apparently wants its OS to become the Android of virtual reality uh A major benefit for users is the ability to bring profile information inform across devices and device manufacturers and cross device compatible programs and games uh Adam thinks a major downside for users is the ability for meta to track even more of you uh which is I'm sure 100% of the
reason why they want to do this yeah that seems like the reason anybody does anything these days oh we released this new pair of software it's open and free we get all the informations uh discussion question would a default platform shared between various headsets via Boon to VR do we trust Zuckerberg to be the man with the plan uh what's in it for Mark after the mediocre launch of the Vision Pro is meta feeling bullish or bearish on the VR Market as a whole what about you a lot of questions
actually that is a lot of questions computer tethered guy yeah my headset's a screen one of the reasons I have switched to the index over the the uh I still call it the cv1 because I was a dk1 boy been there from the start yeah get in there for the dev stuff too yeah uh is because the lighthouse system is a little bit more open to third party trackers and like tracking and things like that than maybe a closed system or even inside out right um but I mean I would like to
see the software at least being a little more open um I don't even see why the headsets couldn't just be like tethered headsets but you would attach a computer module ual to the headset so you kind of have like headset driving companies and then maybe also headset display companies like the index had a plug on the top and I could just pop a Oculus Android phone yeah so it's really turning into like computer and monitor yeah instead of all in one device yeah yeah I like the idea of like uh Someone
putting a sticker on their headset that's like my other my other VR headset is a computer monitor yeah yeah I mean that makes sense a lot of the good stuff uh yeah I think they're shared between I think I think they're bearish right and I think seems like it I think a lot of people maybe have been moving away from games because developing games for VR is really hard it's a very limited platform you don't really have too much that you can do uh in the space and then productivity like is that
better uh you know I've got this here my head is unencumbered apart from some headphones and I do know people all of the people that I know that kept their apple Vision Pros mhm uh and especially the people that I know that are happy with them are people that travel a lot and work while they travel I think that's reasonable and and travel might even be a very expensive productivity tool what are your productivity gains versus um the amount that you've spent on it like are you making x amount of
dollars more than you would or is it for fun or is it for writing like I don't know I think there's got to be a little bit of tech passion involved MH um but I think you've got the if you've got the tech passion and you can excuse it as like a productivity for work SL business expense I think those want to sell it to yourself I guess yeah I can I can certainly see that I think if I had the disposable income and needed that use case then you know maybe I would buy it I still have hav't gotten
to try it um it seems to have disappeared but I don't know just spatial Computing is a a concept I'm not sure it's an interesting one uh Avery Studio says are they using it while in the middle of traveling yeah totally like use it on a plane right on a on a plane passenger seat in a car something like that train yeah in an automobile yeah um people are definitely using them I just I think it's a lot less common than obviously when it first came out um maybe it's kind of settled
into its like 600 more hardcore users who are actually going to get some use out of it then yeah maybe getting it and seeing that it's a toy unless you actually really want to use it like a super powerful "computer is a good toy a $4,000 $5,000" computer to play games on very expensive toy right yes yeah as a productivity tool also pretty expensive you could could be reasonably uh productive on a laptop but it's better to be productive on a desktop so maybe that's the kind of
comparison and there's also some privacy benefits absolutely uh if you're on a plane um and you're not in like first class cuz you didn't feel like uh remortgaging your house to fly somewhere you could have bought two Vision Pros yeah exactly uh then then other people might be able to see your screen and depending on what you're working on that might actually not be okay you might want to protect your slash fiction you know yeah all that sort of stuff totally nobody wants to see your weird Harry
Potter stuff I got to buy a Vision Pro you know that kind of thing hey yeah if it if it helps the productivity of of uh of that then yeah why not um how about a bike I don't know man I don't think you can take those on planes I I think they meant using it while you're on a bike uh I think maybe if it's a tandem bike and you're in the back you could make it work I think what it's 12 milliseconds of delay something like that maybe I'm sure you could find a way to bike around with it maybe once
the fov gets better I'm waiting for glasses for me super high quality AR glasses we're not there yet but yeah that's where I'm okay with like all right now I'm going to consider glasses being a productivity tool right my biggest thing right now is it's it's something that's going to go in your face so if you want wide market adoption it needs to not be really ugly I think for me I like the uh like the solidar the solidity of physical objects right um when I'm being productive or I'm working
on stuff the last thing I want to be uh separating my brain into is the management of my environment right so I'm working on things and then suddenly there's a window here but I need it over here or something like that with a mouse it's really easy to just um but now kind of I'm dealing with floating windows and they have to be in 3D space and I have to manipulate them and now I'm trying to conceptualize where my productivity is going and maybe you would get used to that so this is
kind of it's very new um you know I can do that on a computer maybe less experienced users struggle with that right I have no idea if this is a thing or not so I might be talking about a thing that already exists but something that you might like is if someone made an app where you could set up like a workspace and you could have multiple workspaces and then the things within that workspace are contained to that like plane you know what I haven't seen yet which would be amazing for inside
out and like the Oculus and even the Vision Pro stuff like that is just fiducial markers yeah you know uh this is where my computer marker this is where my computer monitor is you just put a little QR code fiducial marker thing on the desk and now it is there or you know you put it on a coaster you get you get a coaster like this yeah AR things are already a thing we've already got the AR uh amiibo things as well um computer monitor right there and then it's just there you want to move it a
bit you just interact with a physical object right not everything has to be digital that'd be kind of neat yeah and you could still you could represent it in virtual reality with something that looks a little bit better with just like a uh like command orb or something near that area so you know where to reach to grab it even if it's full Dive Right um but if you're doing some AR stuff then yeah then you can just see the coaster I guess I mean that kind of works already with the you know
index and individual trackers and things like that they are represented so I don't know yeah maybe po ball marker yeah I like that use whatever you want yeah Pokeball marker I don't know Miss nickle said that I don't sure sure I mean you could change it to whatever you want yeah should we uh should we do some merch messages oh yeah that's a thing that I was supposed to be doing uh you can do it from here I know but I was supposed to be doing that while I was here oh whatever it's fine
uh I think we have only incoming yeah cuz I didn't do any of them cuz there's nobody over there uh Anonymous said oooo uh you can archive those H the button at the bottom no I will show it the whole stream has to be subjected to an oooo message coming up at the bottom it will happen and Q God this is what I have to De with all day the float plane shot is currently spamming ooo locked blocked I have so much power now this is awful uh disembodied head of lonus uh do you have any recommendations for
podcasts well he's gone um so I guess we can take this one over oh no it was to all of us I just read the disembodied lus because took me by surprise more interesting yes could do you listen to podcast no I don't I know a lot of people that do and I was attempting to work on one for a while with a with a friend um oh it was like a book reading more than anything um little slash fiction novels I think there were like vintage bod rippers from the 1950s that had all been kind of lost
to time um very very interesting kind of uh like fiction SL like the the birth of fanfiction almost uh super underground kind of thing and got a lot of them that are very rare um so that was kind of extreme amounts of work like an unbelievable quantity of work um otherwise no there's some CBC ones that are really good yep I've heard of that uh I don't listen to many um for a while there when I first started trying to do weight loss stuff my like knees and a lot of things were super messed up so
the the best thing for me to do was to just like go walk for like an hour and a half basically every day uh so I was listening to a lot of podcasts at that time but that was um a little bit over a year ago at this point um and the podcast that I mainlined at that time was the yard and hubman Lab podcast hubman lab was like a lot of cool interesting information I was trying to be more healthy there's a lot of information for that in in that podcast so that was cool and the yard it was
just it's just like hanging out with the Bros so it was uh more casual I think you've talked about that before when we were doing some of the set redesign and stuff like that oh their set for the yard is incredible I I would never really watch it because I don't know if I'm this is like I don't really watch TV shows or movies at home either if I'm like sitting at home and I need a recreational activity I'm going to play games uh so I would never really like watch their their
podcast but if I was going out on a walk one thing that was nice is I think their podcast is usually around an hour and a half long so it was a good like okay I'll start it when I start walking and when it ends that's when I'll end therefore I'm not like checking the time all the time and going like okay I only got five minutes left it's like no it's just whenever the podcast ends just keep going keep moving until then um I think for me like I don't like it's taken me a long time to get
used to listening to things again in my free time cuz I was working from home a lot and of course what I used to do for work right I can't really listen to music or listen to podcast while I'm doing video editing yeah totally or like working on podcasts or music so now I just silence like I go to the gym with you I don't have any headphones I don't have any music I don't take an MP3 player with me I'll go on walks and stuff like that and just listen to nothing it's like messes
people up sometimes yeah like I'm not that weird guy at the gym who's just like raw dogging it just just listening to nothing and enjoying it uh I can be totally down with the nothing but um if I want to do something really high effort in in the gym I like having music because it it zones me in I'm I'm that's what I'll do at work right so it helps me get into those extremely deep float flow States yes um I don't think I necessarily have gotten into that point at the gym mhm um maybe eventually maybe
yeah I don't know I just yeah it helps me shut off everything else and just like really pour into the one thing that I'm trying to do um helps me hit failure levels stuff like that but yeah but yeah I I don't uh s similar problem I can't really listen to a podcast and do anything relatively heavy um so unless I'm walking or driving then it's not really super relevant my commute to work isn't super long so it would take me like days to get through a single podcast which I'm not super interested
in so sometimes CBC on the radio has them I like listening to CBC on the way in most L because it doesn't have advertisements but you know sometimes music they have a podcast playlist which is one of their segments where they recommend really good ones one thing I will say is with the death of Google podcasts I recently was doing something that I was was very boring and monotonous and I needed a podcast to listen to so I tried to pull up some podcast that I just spoke about human
lab in the yard CU I was like I don't know I know these um and I tried to do it through YouTube music what a horrible experience I really wish Google podcast was still around YouTube music is not a appropriate replacement for Google podcast in in my opinion there's a lot of difficulty with it my understanding is that you could really use anything you want because it's on the back of RSS yeah so when we upload to um our platform it goes everywhere all at once which whoever like decided it was going
to work that way great job fantastic no notes yeah like genuine yeah and how ownership is handled right cuz we've had to transfer them a few times we used to be on Spotify now we're on a new thing called megaphone which allows us to manage all four or five of them at the same time which still goes to Spotify and apple and everywhere else like that and they're all posted automatically I learned that because when I was experimenting with how podcasts work um I just I uploaded the Joe Rogan podcast to
iTunes and I just had control over it because it's just an RSS thing and you can just go like publish podcast and then the entire catalog gets pulled automatically whoa It's really interesting um very strange now I understand why merch messages uh diverge so much yeah yeah makes sense you're experiencing it uh I don't even know see I what was the root question you know any good podcast or something like that we didn't go that far off I guess just a little bit yeah I guess so
um are there any plans for LT to release a bit set case for storing all the bit sets and perhaps uh spots for screwdriver stubby precision and shaft extension all of that sort of stuff on my understanding is in the works currently um I think there are some ideas to maybe release some 3D prints or something like that so you can do it yourself while we're still working through that I know lonus gave away one of the bit sets during the Wii uh the the stream uh the whatnot stream
and I've seen some other mockups as well a bunch of people have made their own yeah that's cool and I think they have like 3D files out for it yeah and I think that we're also trying to set up like a um I can't remember what the platform is but we're trying to set up a repository where we can dump all the 3D prints right because I make I make a lot um a lot of people here make a lot of internal 3D Oh you mean oh okay sorry I was talking about uh 3D prints made by community members no no I think they
should still control those yeah you know uh but I'm oh sorry we're talking about completely different things yeah yeah yeah so I'm talking about both at the same time so we have ones that we've done and then also people in the community have made them and you can either download theirs or ours or design your own but are ours available at all yet I have no idea I don't believe so I don't think so so still two influx planning on maybe doing that at some point but right now you can find
Community ones and and download them and print them I think ours is just going to be for bits but I don't know I'm sure nickl will message me and I will ignore that but that's fine any updates with Flo plane not working on Amazon Fire stick uh no I didn't know it ever did do something better yeah sorry um oh we were talking about TI in TV the other day and and the Vimeo player not being able to like Google Cast or apple cast or cast or something like that I don't know video sucks
what's wrong with you why would you do this I don't like on [Laughter] purpose yeah yeah Flo plane the refresh this what one of my like main jobs these days is trying to fight any amount of expansion to Flo plane scope because it's like my goodness we do so many things already um I got signed out of all my accounts and I have to log in again I'm actually not yeah Jaden's saying in full PL chap it's a mo it's a mobile app not a TV app it's like yeah  that uh hello when when are the new
backpack Carabiner coming out um I have no idea soon just say soon to everything soon TM there you go yeah I know they're they're working on it I I think they like seated some of them out or something and they waiting for feedback maybe that's not even sort of true I have no idea wrong person to ask unfortunately uh might be able to hit up Creator rise up what up what up it's connected now we're live   uh uh hello no I'm not seeing anything but  back can I get some oooos in the chat 
stop got him hey everyone spamming oooo  minute my gosh it's alive oh my goodness see you later Tick Tock you're no longer the favorite get out of here at least we got RGB now yeah so uh people watching on other platforms thew doow on Tik Tok is apparently where we're streaming W show in the future and  platforms we're back again   what this is why I'm supposed to stay behind the desk your fault okay it's your fault Flo plane are we are we gone again maybe I'm still showing if chat
can hear me when we're live and it's working you got to spam oooos and when it dies you got to spam FS I want all Chats on all the platforms to go as fast as possible when I'm at my computer normally I ping 8888 right ping 8888 T this is this is the keep alive your keep alive is now ooo ooo this is Mechanical Turk for for for DNS uh pings it's it's kind of working it is working we're very effective status checks in all of the chats that I can see real time it's a lot faster than
ping all of the chats I can see are just ooo right now Global which means we're working yeah yeah yeah exactly it's it's a it's a way to communicate with all of the places that we're streaming well my heart rate's up I'm enjoying this there was one of the sponsor spots earlier I started cracking up because um it was like uh aonis I'm going to give you guys another shout out I guess says according to a study by cyber security Ventures a Cyber attack took place every 39 seconds last
year trust me being hacked is not fun  this is not this not a suggestion please don't do it I certainly had fun yeah but we had a wonderful time as long as there's no like permanent damage it can be an exciting experience yeah we were talking about that and like that uh that rise to action that happens almost immediately did I ever tell you the story about the car that was set on fire outside of my house no but everyone's still spamming ooo so I know we're still good so please tell me nice um yeah I
mean well when we got hacked both of us like immed mediately jumped into action and it was kind of like oh okay go um and almost like detrimentally kind of activated I guess um but you know I I'd met a couple friends at University and I was driving them back to my place for the first time kind of like you know new budding friendships and like all right we're going to come hang out and as I'm pulling like up my street and into my driveway there's kind of like a fire down at the end of the
road which is weird like a big fire in the street it's kind of down over a hill and so I didn't even think like I just stopped the car and got out and then just ran down the street I didn't even say anything to like the two people who I'm with and like I had I was like casual friends with these people uh and this was like the first experience oh we going to go hang out with Dan and he's just the fire he just leaves and so I start sprinting down the street and I get over the top of this
hill and like okay so it's a car set on fire and I Sprint up to it and there's this poor woman there who is obviously freaking out um and I just basically cuz I understand in the bystander effect people just freeze and what you're supposed to do is you're supposed to tell people what to do and for me it was like call 911 um but like she was on the phone and I just kept like pointing and yelling at her uh are you talking to 911 or like are you talking to the police or something like that and so this this guy
it was night so this guy comes running down the the hill and starts getting starts are you on the phone are are you calling the police are you calling the police are you calling the police and uh so I'm pretty sure that she might have been freaked out a little bit uh the thing is that this car was not hers uh it had most likely been dumped there and Abandoned and set on fire after like a murder so not only that is someone screams down her street dumps a car sets it on fire and then
like a few minutes later this random stranger comes hurling down the street anyway yeah so uh maybe don't scream at people who are in a crisis who have already done the thing that they need to maybe not the greatest idea uh but I I will bring attention again to that my entire screen is just various chat spamming ooo um why do you do this which I'm enjoying thoroughly uh usually I I don't like it when people just Spam chat super hard but right now while we're still trying to figure out like what even just
happened it is kind of useful to have like very upto-date real- time information based on if people are receiving the stream or not my my favorite is the IM Emoji just the single I Emoji wo I'll post that in chat it'll disappear immediately I really like okay float plane chat is now drawing oooo with asky art so they're they're evolving they have uh they need help uh what do I do lonus laptop is that how that works there you go that one that's my favorite oh that's pretty good horrifying that is yeah
that's like eldrich ooo stares into your soul that would make me feel better uh okay so what were we talking about we were talking about we just got into u u 5.4 5.4 yeah so um one of the things that I learned recently is that doing vectorized text in game engines is extremely difficult which doesn't make a whole lot of sense um and so vectors in general are like really complicated to actually do in a in a game engine and I was kind of racking my bread my brain around how
I'm going to be doing some sorry you two YouTube chat has adopted your ooo and they're doing the eyes that rare win for for YouTube chat i' watching all of the chats is particularly open this is sick I will not give you $250 yeah please yeah no it says the stream's finished like is it no there we go yeah don't scare me like that yeah thanks YouTube chat that's horrible I hate this oh there Target eyes one oh the target eyes one is good yeah oh yeah yeah with the lips oh boy okay sorry continue I don't know
this is also good this is this is literally my screen right now it's just all the chats do you want to show it off uh sure yeah if you don't have anything for uh what is that oh that's a that's the log that go to them no that's what we can see okay okay I was like I was like hide it no that's my command window that's my uh external ping to to make sure that no frames are dropping oh cool okay um oh my God anyway so Unreal Engine 5.4 has officially come out it's been in in
preview for a little while now and they have all of these new systems they've got this like motion combining for animations this state-based thing that's really really robust and simple to use they got a whole bunch of new animation tools but the coolest thing is the like Motion Graphics design stuff I don't know if you've seen any of this no I just saw that like was happening actually Bonkers like I I was like got a little flustered was like incredible so um basically you've got Niagara particle
simulations um you've got you know the new Lumen engine right so you can have unlimited polygons and then real-time particle simulations real-time physical simulations laser scans and now they've introduced vector graphics as well as Boolean operations layers like in Photoshop they have a new texture designer like substance substance 3D substance material editors that sort of thing you can now do that entirely buil onreal engine and it's all real time so if you're doing 3D modeling or like
Motion Graphics or stuff like that normally you do Cinema 4D or or blender or something like that um but now you can do that in real time with real-time lighting and it's also all programmable because it's still a game engine right so you can use blueprint prints and do your vector animations and everything like that so basically this is incredible for so many things it's good for me what I was going to say what are you going to use it for so um I wanted to use it for an intro
video as well as having some scaler scalable UI elements one thing that I was finding that were particularly difficult inside um Unreal Engine was being able to adapt to different screen sizes okay chat relax at this guy at this you guys are taking the the spamming more seriously than the than the oooo you guys got you guys got to chill I think some of you even have like Bots running or Auto clickers or some or Auto input things or something relax relax a little bit damn at this point I
literally can't even read it because it's going going faster YouTube chat significantly yeah um chill dudes chill it's getting faster you're not helping maybe not okay I will stop addressing it maybe it will go away um anyways yeah so you want to use it for an intro video yeah so um uh you ever you ever seen how 9000 2001 Space obiously that sort of thing a lot of those uh computer Graphics that were on the screens themselves physically um are very much like blank color plus lines and they're all
beautiful grids and they look futuristic and it's all blocky text right and that kind of theme was also repeated in alien  itely single lines and if I want to have uh this be adaptable to different screen sizes one thing that I hate is playing on my you know 4K C2 OLED and then the textures are all like squishy yeah because they're small now you can do that with vectors which means ah unlimited scaling scaling yeah and then they've also introduced real-time Boolean operations so you can push
objects into other objects and you can also animate um like Graphics over time and Define your push objects into other objects thing uh Boolean operations would be like here's your cylinder and then I want to make a cut in this cylinder so I have an invisible card and then I push them together so I haven't altered this geometry traditionally Boolean would be done in something like blender um so you would have to cut a hole in the geometry because it's like add and subtract so if I take these two objects
in this one's a subtract it would cut into this or if I were to have this as an additive object it would increase and it would still be one object but it's made up of multiple objects and the geometry becomes one single like entity right and normally you would do that operation in something like blender or traditional um and then you would you would uh like finalize it so that object would become solid and then you'd have to retopo the whole thing right because all of those curves and things are going
to be destroyed now you can do that in real time so I could animate the movement of objects through it and then huge thing most of my game is entirely made of instances right it's got like one Cube and then everything's instance so it's performative yeah yeah um you can instance in the motion thing and then simulate real- time nanite particles on your objects and with Lumen as well say the example I saw the other day was a was a dut they had like a billion are surprisingly common yeah yeah so
obviously a cool example but they had like a billion Donuts being rendered in real time with shadows sheesh uh and also real-time physics so uh every single version is incredible and um this one for for me personally has a lot of features that I'm going to touch a lot of complaints with Unreal Engine for a long time is that you're basically modifying like you're making a mod for a first- person shooter rather than making your own game right it's hard to do a different
genre mhm and it's slowly getting better and I think it's slowly becoming just the most insane engine oh yeah obviously it's it's like character-driven focused yeah with the animation tools but I think we're also going to see a lot more uh anim ators coming out of this too right um the the way that you can do rigging and animation things and they've automated a lot of the process and they've also made it a little bit more intuitive to do and simple um for me learning 3D modeling is like almost
impossible for for characters especially because I just can't get past weight painting I don't know how to make a good rig and then if you want to make changes to that rig you would have to take it out of unreal right and you'd have to re-export it and get your objects back and then like re-trigger everything and maybe your animations in a real world all broken but now now it's a little bit more self-contained I suspect people might especially people that have been in the scene for a while CU When you
when you start looking into game development there's a lot of like use this variety of tools to accomplish your end goal right engine right I think people might underestimate how much needing one thing will lower the barrier of entry for people this is going to lower the barrier of entry for me who was kind of already over the initial hump yeah like I know basically how all these programs work and which ones I'm supposed to be using I'm still just garbage at them all um but now that
that efficacy of getting to a level right the barriers for blender are like okay well welcome to blender learn 400 shortcuts please then of course they released 3.8 and I had to relearn like all of them or whatever the version is that they changed it and I had just I just learned them all and that's me because I'm a beginner right I I think there's also even just like the the question of what game engine should I use is already difficult enough for people what game do you want to make yeah I don't
know well then I don't know what do you play yeah I don't know I like lots of stuff like well maybe I want to why are you making a game what is like after after that kind of R lines of questioning is like okay well why because because you you think it's fun or cool I think a lot of people especially in like high school might be doing it uh just to try something to learn something whatever yeah just pick one yeah learn all three at the same time but then you so you have decision
Paralysis on the game engine but then you also have decision Paralysis on all the things that are associated it gets worse and it does not get better and then what everybody forgets about is uh audio Yeah so do now do you go with f mod or well why is pick one f is so fod is is like a audio plugin for all of these engines and then the direct competitor is wo wise w w wise I don't know actually how it's supposed to be pronounced unfortunately I like wo wise I like wise goes along
withing um but yeah I know that that wise is more industry focused and fod is way more approachable okay uh but they're still like okay well yeah you could do the audio inside your engine but it's better to have another tool that modifies that but now you're learning that like it took me a while to understand that I even had to change my mindset when doing OST work because now like Celeste is probably the best example that uses fod I think I've told you this before I think this is accurate
but Celeste has every single piece of music playing simultaneously through the entire game uh and then it just dynamically picks between them and Fades between them when it's appropriate right like okay and now I have to program that so not only are you working inside Unity or your game engine now you have to have the conceptual kind of understanding of this thing is happening what process and what variable do I write that the game is going to modify that is then referred
back to my audio system that then gets modified there and there's two different layers of there right you have like on or off or you can have um you know floating Point stuff but then the graphs that modify the sound are inside fod are different and then you can also have Global variables inside fod to mod like manage a bunch of stuff and then there's bus tracks and Reverb and now I'm working with steam audio which is like a ray tracing system for like real time projections and then
like I I just wanted to I just wanted to make an RTS and I just I want my 10 years back so which which one do you you said there's one that's more industry focused and one that's more approachable which one are you using for your uh your non hobby project I would use fod for both okay um mostly just because I kind of like fod and that's the more approachable one already I think so I think actually for my personal project I will just try wise you know um I think it's probably a good
opportunity to learn it yeah um and if it doesn't work you know stick back to fod yeah cool um I learned substance painter substance painter is a lot easier to get your head around after you understand how it works uh it's not like Photoshop it's about it does it for you but you have to kind of make it do it for you and your your personal project one you said it's a 3D game it is a 3D game which one of the reasons why I went with um unreal um I did try to remake it in go do gdo uh but yeah do you know
which one it is I believe it's gdo I I hear people that go dot work in it semi-professionally say it both ways I'm not sure I mean it might be might be like a bunch of different pronunciations yeah yeah anyway sorry but yeah 3D 3D engine um but it's quite static the problem is that there's a lot of rotations and there's a lot of vector math and there's a lot of um automatic generations and objects and it can be a little bit complicated especially trying to keep it performative when yeah sorry sorry
everyone just noticed the dead pixel  pixel there oh oh crap uh I think people have been   it   yeah I mean these cameras are getting on a bit luckily at least people only noticed it now so it's not going to drive them  stream that one looks okay yeah I think you're  no I can't even point it that I know it's too far I see it too does my hand get in this screen yeah up there yeah okay well all right oh no so it's not    that someone threw these at   um 3D why did that just happen okay
don't think of it yeah so why why did you decide to go with CU you blueprints I like unreal because of blueprints okay so blueprints are phenomenal for a really approachable way of getting programming done it's maybe it's not quite as performative as programming in C++ obviously there's some overhead uh but they're good and you can also use them to move into C++ because you can write Blueprints and each little node is basically just a C++ object so you can dive into them and write a custom
blueprint note yeah yeah so that's a good answer and a good point and I I do also think blueprints are cool but what I really meant was why did you decide to do 3D for this game because the way that you've described it to me it needs to be so why um because of the way that the space is represented so I wanted it to feel claustrophobic oh okay and the limiting space Factor also had to be in 3D so you've seen uh the Windows like 95 screen saver with the pipes right yes love it so it's that always loved
it but as a game yeah and a resource management it's a resource management game so you're inside a cube yeah right and each of the walls are kind of like your factories or whatever you want to think about it however you want to abstract it away this one makes this number go up this one makes a different number go up and each of them have different requirements and you have to connect them together with wires basically like pipes right and so if you can think about laying pipes in 3D to each of the
walls and I think there's something like 400 individual node points that are uh available uh for me to use at least U maybe not to the player that's a little bit ridiculous so now we've got 400 nodes 400 nodes 400 nodes and now all of the wires have to connect to each other like the difficulty is in managing those connections and figuring out where they go and uh uh like even just how to route them and how to keep them organized like I don't know if you've ever played factor or something like that but
keeping the belts all pretty and like flowing and organized is kind of like a fun way to uh to play Factoria or you can do spaghetti um and the resource in this game is the walls yeah so like the amount of space you have on the walls right that's right yeah and then yeah I guess you'll like Tech up over time and whatnot yes exactly but to replace something you have to destroy it which might at least temporarily ruin economy I'm assuming it's actually like you're yourself so like so you
die cuz you're the computer that the outside walls are powering and so it can cause cascading failures so like you delete one little module and you didn't lay out your wires so all the wires go away right and now you have to trace back and find it and you have like 30 40 seconds or something like that to get the new module and the wires pluged back in um or or like yeah I don't know you run out of power and die critical failure critical failure blue screen and I just added this new system called
abstraction where you can add in another Cube next to it and have resources that pass through the walls right and I spent like 3 hours working on this dolly Zoom thing where the cube uh comes into your view which is normally an isometric right and then it pulls out into um uh orthagonal right and then you can move around and pick your next Cube and then you zoom back in right and so now not only are you managing with the wires that are going in the cube you're now managing uh cubes on top of Cubes right
so think the my my elevator pitch is like factorio inside a 4D hyper Cube yeah right so it's factorio in 3D space  sorry I always forget I don't even think it's playing right now whatever it's fine um yeah okay there's a fun sort of offshoot tangent do you want to explain how the swear button Works cuz you just said I don't think it's playing right now and I think people might not necessarily understand what that means oh yeah so swear button is uh track inside Reaper um and it has a tone that is like the
c400 or whatever it is uh that is the swear noise and then the swear button here uh actually just solos that track which mutes all of us because if if I were to put a swear bleep over just my mic here Luke's mic would pick it up anyway right so I have to kill all of the mics simultaneously right so that's a pretty quick and easy way to do that uh if you if you push it you still have to still have to push the button sorry the uh I'm trying to go through merch messages while we're talking about
this a significant amount of merch messages are just oo you know worth it it's worth worth which is making my job a lot easier right now so I appreciate it yeah um what else can we talk about I don't know what's going on do you mentioned something about trying gdau oh yeah I've been I've been doing can't just talk Game Dev all the time I have a lot of thoughts uh they will get me we're just tangent to go into more Game Dev yeah so I don't know what I'm trying to keep the conversation I'm new at this
okay yeah I mean I I've been doing it just as like a learning thing like I I feel like you're going on a direction of you might actually like do something with this I've made like 15 games sorry I have failed at making 15 games yeah so I'm there there that's a good way of saying it I'm planning on failing on making a you will fail at making a lot of games and the more games you fail at making this goes for you guys out there too the more times you fail the more times you've done a thing at
all yeah fair enough yeah so like but like I'm not even necessarily the plan isn't even necessarily to ever succeed yeah I'm just having fun Pok around see how was having fun initially and then I'm kind of like wow uh like I got past minimum viable product okay and I I got to play it for like the 20 seconds that you could like that was that was fun did you did you die did your robot die I no I mostly just die because I'm testing to make sure it triggers properly right that makes and at what point of the you
delete the wrong wire you die you delete the end point that's feeding another thing you die you delete the Middle Point you die uh right you need to keep that and so like redundant systems and I don't know it's going to be ridiculous I think it'll be fun yeah I'm still I'm still just working on clear codes clear code has this tutorial on YouTube that's 11 and a half hours long and then you realize that there's like a 3-hour extension to it and like good I sent that to a friend recently he wants to
get into Game Dev it's fantastic it's really really good um he wants to make that's nice and he hasn't changed what he wants to make in a couple years now I Chang what I want to make essentially every time I sit down and work on it but that's I'm completely okay with that right now because I'll just like blow up everything I've done and I want to learn how to make this system right yeah yeah it's like what what if I what if I did these things would that work and then I
smash it together I'm like no or yes or whatever else yeah yeah oh here's some advice don't do anything with an inventory system yeah that sounds great ever yeah my current plan is to do so but I mean it'll probably change by next time you might actually know how to handle that probably better than most people do not make an RPG I will shoot you that is 100% the current plan my my current plan so the the the game the game that I currently want to make um the game that I currently want
to make I would not be able to release because there's too much like it entirely leans on another IP oh yeah yeah U so I I want to remake in 2D a like old school RPG version of the starting town for wood elves in uh EverQuest one called Kellan okay because that was like cook that was the first MMO that I played I remember how the city looked I'm not even you can go back and play it there's like 99 uh 1999 scape or something like that 2007 Escape 2007 Escape ha why did I say 99 I
don't know no idea um OG Wait no that's RuneScape no no no project 99 is uh EverQuest okay project I think it's called project 99 I thought it's project okay project 99 yeah project 1999 classic EverQuest 2007 Escape is RuneScape that's what I thought you meant I'm talking about EverQuest okay um um so I I played both of those games when I was a Wii one um but yeah I'm just like my my theory with that is I can just make that like starting area with you know the the crushbone Orcs I
don't know why I remember this I didn't play project 99 I just remember this from when I was like in there right yeah so I I I I can make the Orcs I can make that area I can make the skeletons outside the town I can make the little bee things that you fight I can make the town I can do all this other kind of stuff and by doing that it gives me a fairly defined scope and that's why I wanted to do that I don't plan to make it a whole game just the starting area I know the enemies I know the areas I
don't have to think about a map anymore I don't have to think about the music anymore I don't have to think about the names of things anymore I just build the things and try to make them work and then I'm going to fail in 87 different ways and then I can't release it anyways so it's like a project that is intentionally never going to work cuz I could never release it because it's based on someone else's game I think another thing that that I ran into a lot when I was starting to not even Beyond
scope right it was like what system do I fail at so here's a concept for a game that's nice and simple um how fast can I get to where I can't do it anymore I really like RTS and I really like obviously Resource Management games and I'm I want to go home and I want to relax so I'm not going to be doing anything that's super high energy and I don't necessarily like the external pressure of like hey do this thing or you die um because I'm an antagonist like my game you're your own antagonist
it's your fault yeah you suck you're your worst enemy so you're attempting to be and so I wanted to move into like RTS style that you know Town management just for fun and because I like them and it's it's entertaining to work on uh and then oh was like oh it's Friday all right so now I just got to make the little dudes like walk around each other and uh and like get past objects that I build and then I learned what AAR pathfinding was and I thought I'd have that done in like
an afternoon and then I discovered that people write PhD thesis on uh on pathfinding algorithms every once in a while I I like watching visualizations of algorithms on YouTube because I find it fun and pathfinding ones are like super interesting I did about a week of that before I went nope yeah okay so this entire genre is off the checklist right so you're basically building like a model of like okay well I can't do this for me I can't do art like I can't do 3D art very well okay right I'm not
super great at 2D art besides I don't know marker stippling stuff can't really make a game out of that uh so now I need a concept people have made games out of a a lot of I was going to do a game jam with one I made out of clay which would have been fun yeah stop motion clay yeah um right so you're kind of breaking down this this what things am I good at SL enjoy you don't even know what you can't do totally you have and it's weird and it comes out of nowhere and there are
things that you don't expect like um uh uh text layout and like ux design and I'm like hate that uh I'm not very good at this yeah uh I can't get it from where I see it in my brain to where it looks pretty or right and then you're going to look at your project and it's always going to be this like Mark on it I don't know I've always enjoyed projectiles like I made a in in high school we had a we had a course that my absolutely fantastic teacher who's a principal at a different school now um
but Mr trle he came he made a course for the people in in like effectively my grade cuz he could tell we were all very interested in this and it's called 3D game programming and as far as I can tell he like went to BCIT over the summer and like learned some stuff and turned it into a high school course for us which is just so sick um and the game that I made for that was I I just I just uh I pulled a battle State Games making tarov and just downloaded some assets instead of making them myself because uh
some people more interested in like making the 3D models and I was like I suck at this but you do well on Steam in current year yeah asset flips are a bit of a thing I've noticed that on the same side of the coin nobody cares if you make your own assets either yeah so I was your your main character in my game was a snowman okay and you shot basketballs out of your face at ninjas um let's go I was just like whatever he's like the easiest to find models I could find and my whole point was
effectively I shouldn't have done this I was like trying to make a point like I don't like me 3D models cuz I was a dummy and just I guess wanted a lower grade I don't know stupid kid but um I I like wanted to focus on the mechanics of the game so I I focused on the the like projectile physics of this basketball basically so it could like bounce and then off of the varied terrain and then hit the ninjas in different ways and stuff um I I don't know I think it's I think I
still have the code somewhere but like just gives me nightmares about Collision detection yeah but I like that I know yeah right and so that's kind of like where you're like that's that's now your game I'm literally doing that stuff now inau I'm I'm stuck on collision detection CU I'm enjoying it it's a been a fun process and like what is your happens after what is your Collision update rate yes and is it decoupled from the frame rate yes it is good answer but but that is it is not it's
not U if I remember correctly gdau does um Gau has built in ways doesn't let you do it the wrong way they do let you okay but they throw warnings good good good you can ignore them it'll compile with those warnings and you can play the game but it will be coupled to the frame rate um but it it makes it really easy because when it throws one of those warnings it'll it'll Mo modern like idees are so fascinating to me because back when I was doing programming heavily there was
no like GitHub and all all the IDS like sucked and everything was terrible and now everything's like like so helpful and nice um but it'll tell you yeah exactly where the problem is and Link the documentation that will help you solve it so like I ran into this problem yeah clear code ended up explaining it like seconds after I dove through it which was fine but um I I I dove through the problem because I was like this is this is dumb because I was watching the clear code video and I could see the
thing moving across his screen and I could see it moving across my screen I was like these are not at the same rate something is wrong I think it's TI to rate this is terrifying I have to fix this and then he ends up explaining how to fix it in his video it's actually super super easy there's there's stuff built into gdau to help you fix timing which is great it's really nice um it's it's super easy to to mess up in Unreal Engine because like event tick is right there you can just drag off of it but I
want my game to run at you know 140 200 FPS um I can't be searching through arrays every uh you know what like one millisecond I don't think so it's it's just unperformed right it's also just like if you if you aim to make a game super performant the main benefit in my mind is that it can be not performant and still playable if it if it you can play it on something that's junk and it's still a playable game I to me most games 240 FPS I'm too old to be FPS competitive like it's not going to make a difference
for me yeah but that's that's one of my I have two core tenants for this support any screen resolution in any aspect ratio and have it run at high refresh rate I'm struggling because the game view is one: one okay because it's Cube you're inside a cube okay yeah so that's not super hard to render limited right yeah um where do you put the UI when you're on a super ultra wide like I've got a super ultra wide on my desk there and so I'm playing on this how do I make use of 
bars yeah I feel like so there's like those kinds of problems too right I feel like my Sol because this is stuff I don't like working on so I feel like my solution would just be like stretch graphic of some kind well I was just I just have them here but then they're tabbed and it's no I mean like just yeah have the UI be tucked in and then so you don't have black bars just like make it take some like graphic that's like the inside of a computer system to some degree and then just stretch until the
end like whatever cool that's actually a great idea I I don't know if it's a great idea but that that's the type of thing that I would do because I'm just like I don't want to deal with this problem go away but there's a lot of stuff in the UI that's tied to tick or that's tied to updates that need to happen constantly because you know you delete something um the propagation might take a couple seconds right and and the the bricks themselves are constantly checking to make sure that they're
still alive basically uh they have their requirements met right and so if I was doing that 200 times a second it would be uh insane so you know like one every 10 10th of the second it's totally fine yeah let's uh let's try to pow through some some merch messages and then and then bring this thing to an end um I've got one for you which is about what we're currently talking about so we're really not going that far off but uh Dan isn't your game basically an allegory for self-improvement you have to leave
your comfort zone in order to advance uh yes um it is and um I've built it on the kind of the mindset is like shelves so you know I've climbed up to this level I'm comfortable here everything's fine I mean the game's the game's called a cop pathetic right so it's it's it's cool you know you're you're cool you're fine uh but you can't go anywhere like you can't get to the next level you can't get the next research you can't expand or all um and you have to do something scary I mean you can prepare for it
that's the nice thing about it it's not there's no time pressure you can sit there for year you turn the game off you can walk away forever and you're not going to have a problem uh but you're not going anywhere until you start destroying things so that they can be built back better it's like it's like life it's like poetry you know they rhyme ah very nice I've got another one for probably you um hey Dan and Luke whatever uh I've been using Tinker CAD for all my 3D print modeling really want to start
using a more in-depth CAD software what do you use SL recommend that's entirely on you I use solid works uh which is not necessarily for everyone um there's loads of them I'm not a huge fan of um I can't remember what the other one is now the Autodesk product Fusion 360 thank you um mostly because what they've been doing to like creators and and people that use it they used to have a discounted maker uh tier like if you didn't really make money with it you could learn it and then they did a
tarov where they just got rid of that and now you have to pay a subscription and everything's like cloud-based and it's really expensive um not that solid works any better they're extremely expensive but there's lots of like free parametric stuff I'd say that solid works is attainable to U people if you really want to learn it um I don't know for a lot of people solid work LLY yeah get get on solid works solid works will teach you a lot of transferable skills um but you know
parametric is the skill I'm I'm really good at parametric modeling not like some of the designers we have in CW but I understand parametric model I don't understand blender like I've been modeling since high school right um but I can make cubes nice I can't make uh people right makes sense there's loads of free ones and there's loads of good ones Rhino is probably one to look at but solid works hi DL I recently had to log into a laptop that I hadn't used in 15 years not knowing my password I used
fingerprint login what are your thoughts uh regarding the use of Biometrics with them being hard to change being hard to change lighter like your own Biometrics are hard to change really hot car oh my goodness uh wow um that's an interesting question that is an interesting question what happens if   uh uh we hard our keys when we're on camera do we have to start like doing this sort of thing I think our cameras are maybe not good enough for that but they're they're breaking I got to get
new cameras now yeah yeah where is it there right here here um oh well we don't have any more of these yeah we this is literally all three of them isn't it yeah that's right and someone pointed out apparently the one that we thought was fine actually does have one your one I don't know what one it was cuz I didn't see it uh what is it loot cam oh I still don't see the where we have that thing on the screen oh is that covering it there's a thing on the screen that you guys can't see
that we can see is it behind that let me know when I yeah uh you're over it yeah not over the bar though there you  it oh oh there it is so it was behind the thing oh that sucks well cool okay whatever uh oh Biometrics I think Biometrics are pretty cool actually um are you okay with them not changing I mean mostly that's okay yeah if it was face ID would it no longer recognize you if it's been 15 years absolutely could also if if say heaven forbid there was like an acid
attack or something that happened like yeah bad shaving yeah usually I I and I think this was the case in this situation as well though usually biometric logins are backed up by passwords so it's not your only way to get in um which is why I generally think they're cool um should we move to chips embedded I've always like I I I knew some uh get them for here biohacker dudes when I was in high school that were doing that um like way before it was it's not it's not normal now but
that this was like way back and they sent me a video of them just like hanging out in this like basement Suite that they all rented together like stabbing themselves with giant needles yeah I've always kind of wanted the magnets oh the fingerprint T yeah fingertip mag sense yeah that's pretty interesting uh anyways that's a topic I have no right to talk about um not with that attitude get some experience there Luke Steph D Steph D says I'm almost four months behind it would be awesome if you could
read this message on stream to remind me that I sent a merch message when I finally catch up there you go done um hey L &amp; D I hope you're doing well I recently started my data center career with Amazon and things have been interesting what is the jankiest thing you've seen a big company do not counting LD I have an answer do you I was able to pre-think about this so I could go first if you want I'm not sure I've seen a uh like server room type situation where the power was controlled with a light
switch and the light switch was not not in like a security box or anything there was just like a piece of paper to it that was like don't flip regular UPS testing yeah that's all it was it's it's very astute business decision yeah yeah I've also seen the like hey the server is this laptop Don't Unplug it I think that okay Jank is thing I worked at a job and they needed a microwave link um but they couldn't really get a very expensive powerful one right uh they're kind of difficult to get you
need special regulations not if you set the country to a different country and then just set it to like nuclear power levels of bird melting it can go whatever distance you want that's I think I don't know if that's janky or just extremely Reckless but I think it was Abra to a to a building like oh we just had this pole we bought this giant microwave transmitter off of eBay for like 300 bucks we're just going to zap strap and then set it to melt Birds sheesh but it gets 200 feet
now but it's solved it's solved um don't walk under it what happens what what is this did you create this one uh what happens oh streak my brain I also red strip I read steak oh no steak Yeah steak Okay so hey Dan and Luke and lonus what happens when the streak breaks will you start a new one or open when to other hosts do you plan to uh replace who has been uh in established positions for some time uh I think this is one of those situations where I'm going to give the really annoying answer of the Street's
not going to break I don't think so yeah that's kind of the idea I think at this point we've all described the like relatively Atomic scenarios that we would go through in order to keep the streak going so uh I I don't necessarily really see it happening I don't know I don't think so I would like to uh and like I've done the production remote I would like to try it from far away Vancouver Island in October yeah yeah I think that would be fun yeah yeah how remote have you done
the stream my house yeah okay I think it's I think it's fine there will just be little delays not even cuz I'm coming in like uh I don't know like basically Linus's level right it's 300 milliseconds or less that's what I'm saying like very little yeah shouldn't even really matter much um but yeah I don't know there is no plan in place because I don't think I think we're all rather stubborn people yeah the the the streak is to do it every week forever yeah uh hi DL Luke have you watched AMC AMC's
show Halt and Catch Fire I strongly recommend it no never heard of it uh it's good show is AMC watchable up here without Linux isos I uh I don't know I don't know about any of these Sean Sean I don't I don't watch TV sure Sean says awesome show Halton Catch Fire what is this it's like a birth of computers oh but as a drama and it's fun it's very fun cool uh not that I have seen it or consume any media because no of course not just a server full of Linux isos anyways uh I think that's it I think
we're done I think we just finished the show okay so you want to say the the line uh you don't have to if I can even remember I'm mostly focused on just getting to push this button and IGN you guys I'll do both thanks for tuning in to the W show uh tune in next week uh same bad time same bad Channel except it will actually be a different time oh yeah no it'll it'll be later than this this is when we're supposed to start yeah we were supposed to start 10 minutes ago we're never going to happen anyways bye
by push the button now I have to run
