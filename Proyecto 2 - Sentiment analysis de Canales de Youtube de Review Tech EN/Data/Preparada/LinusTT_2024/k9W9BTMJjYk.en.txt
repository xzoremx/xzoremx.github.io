it's no secret that I struggle with sleep at least at night and ever since the birth of my firstborn back in 2012 I've resorted to using earphones to help me catch some z's but everything that I've ever used has at least one flaw Wireless has been a big Improvement I used to chew through Sennheiser ie80s and cables like Tic Tacs but even with those I've still dealt with Comfort issues retention issues and accidental touch control activations in the middle of the night even my current daily
drivers have a fatal flaw they only last about 5 hours before needing to be Juiced in their charging case Oslo who reached out to sponsor this LTT video claims that their new product addresses all of my issues bold but I've also been using them for a couple of days and while I wouldn't call them perfect I will say that they've the best feature set that I've seen so far these little guys are the appropriately named sleep buds they don't get a feature film about a dog but these tiny buds are packed
with special features that might make them less ideal for daily use earphones but perfect for folks that are trying to get a better night's sleep let's take a look at what's included obviously you won't get quite the level of care package that we did hoodie handwritten note is this pills ah calming pillow Mist but what you will get is this well this the smart case which has some cool features we'll get into later the Sleep buds the El four sets of ear tips including the ones that are
pre-installed a USBC cable and a delicious snack oh never actually put them in my mouth before don't do that it's the tips that address the number one issue for a lot of people comfort and retention other earbuds do include silicone tips but there's often still a part of them that comes in contact with your skin that's made of harder materials especially if you're a s side sleeper like me not the case here and the super low profile of the earbuds themselves helps to reduce the pressure that you
feel on your ear as well movie Magic big reveal time I've already been using these for sleeping but um sure let's put them in and and and try them on camera okay this is really not representative this pillow is so thick do we have anything that's more like a normal pillow anything would be comfortable with this convenient ear donut they isolate shockingly well I don't even have anything playing through them right now and I think you said LT something pillow yeah I was going say
the N oh you got the backpack back there here we go can confirm they are flat also can confirm they are extraordinarily difficult to get out of your ears like you got to you got to really want to get them out of there reach in grab the little silicone anchor piece and pull them out but make no mistake that's not a bad thing the comfort is really solid like something shoved in your ear canal is always going to feel like there's something in your ear canal especially if you're not used to it but
this is about as good as I felt and more importantly they have not fallen out overnight yet my daily driver airpod Pro 2os on the other hand fall out at least three times a week while sleeping Elijah who wrote this video and also has sleeping issues tried using these Buds and his first thought was he forgot they were in when he woke up because they didn't press against his ear and they stayed in all night it's a pretty similar system to what I've seen on some workout buds but way less bulky let's
take the silicone tip off though and look at the device itself there you go that's it I think I've eaten pieces of corn that are bigger than that they are less than 1 cm wide in each Direction and my first thought after seeing these was they're probably going to sound like hot poo poo but they don't they're not streets ahead of audio file headphones or anything but the sound quality is reflective of the team that built them a group of x Bose Engineers who worked on the now discontinued Bose
sleep buds which might explain the uh very similar looks now a small elephant in the room is the lack of active noise cancellation given that Bose is known to be a leader in the space and Oslo worked with Bose on licensing technology for this product we wanted to understand why the decision was made to leave it out when we jumped on a call with the engineers they explained that while canceling as much noise as possible can help with focusing on work sleeping with noise cancellation has been found to
wake people up more in the middle of the night than something like a white noise machine for my part though I suspect it has more to do with maintaining the small form factor and with maximizing battery life and after using them I actually don't mind the trade-off the Sleep Beds create a very good seal in the ear canal which combined with their selection of ambient noises helps to very effectively muffle outside sound it's so effective that I can't put them in until Pillow Talk is 100% over
because I will definitely miss that one last good night I love you which is going to earn me a shove in the backside I love you too hun it was the Sleep buds anyway your selected ambient noise gets loaded onto the Sleep buds themselves as a Vancouver boy I'm partial to Misty Rain but there's also fir crackling and a variety of other Brown noises which yes is what they're called the exact noises are not the important part right now though since they're working on adding more the big deal is the part
about the sound being stored locally after you paired the Sleep buds to your phone this functionality allows the Sleep buds to be used in two ways Standalone with no connection to your phone or the same way that I use my regular Bluetooth earphones which is typically to listen to reruns of Adventure Time until I fall asleep after that things get super cool the Sleep buds will detect if your media playback stops for some reason Plex or it'll use its onboard sensors to Det determine if
you've fallen asleep and it will switch over to your selected ambient audio track and so far it's been working a treat for me the well the first night I actually got woken up by my Ambient sound but I have since determined that that was a skill issue I didn't dial in the volume before going to bed so the sudden loud fir crackling sound which I also didn't configure on the first night a little alarming the other major stumbling block I hit was Bluetooth connectivity issues
but once again it was down to not fully understanding the product in order to achieve their impressive and personally validated 10hour battery life Oslo is using Bluetooth LE or low energy the problem is that while many modern chipsets do support Bluetooth LE some phone makers notably Apple have not yet chosen to enable it in their firmware so Oslo is using kind of a hacky workaround the Sleep buds connect to your case using Bluetooth l and then the case connects to your phone
using whatever your phone supports so I had some range issues when I was close to my phone but not close to the case and also when I put my arm over my face like this but um there's no fix for that issue because water is not good your body's full of water since we're on the subject of the case the Sleep buds magnetically snap in for charging taking about two and a half hours to reach a full charge and the case features light noise and temperature sensors that for now will only detect when you're
sleeping to do that audio switch over thing but for the future Oslo plans to expand the information they look for so it'll be able to tell you if an ambulance drove by your window at 2: in the morning which caused you to wake up and it wasn't your stupid brain's fault that's not here yet but they're hoping to roll it out soon and they have committed that there will be no subscription fee for the functionality absolute bro move now there have been so many products pitched to us in the past
that claim Better Health monitoring or better lifestyle that we've turned down or we've discontinued our partnership with because they have an outrageous or deceptive subscription model so it was pretty refreshing to hear the CEO say that quote they are pretty committed that the hardware the noise masking library and the sleep tracking are all part of the purchase price that doesn't mean there will never be a subscription but it does seem to at least indicate that you get to keep the functionality
you paid for without getting rug pulled I hate that that's a w these days but it kind of is I also appreciate the W of being able to highlight both what's good and what's imperfect about these in spite of the sponsored nature of this video Oslo is not hiding that these are not a replacement for your fruit flavored ear beans the lack of on device volume control in particular is a bit of a downer for me and they don't expect me to say that I magically got an uninterrupted 8 hours with sleep buds
what I will say though is that for the type of sleep aid that I need which which is comfortable all night noise blocking these are solid and I can see why so many people were jazzed to see the Sleep buds return if you guys enjoyed this video maybe check out the time that Alex and I tried to build a temperature controlled mattress topper
