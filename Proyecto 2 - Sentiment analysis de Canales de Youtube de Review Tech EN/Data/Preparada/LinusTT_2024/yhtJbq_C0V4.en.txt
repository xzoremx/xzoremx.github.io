welcome to the W show we've got a great show lined up for you guys this week Nvidia just announced day passes for GeForce now with one day of their game streaming service costing you as as much as $8 for a single day who do they think they are wait no they they know who they are they're the like $2 trillion doll okay whatever the point is uh we're also going to be talking about the big news that took place just after the W show ended last week which is the makers of Yuzu the Nintendo switch
emulator settling with Nintendo shutting down their emulators and sending shock waves through the emulation Community what else we got this week Luke Warner Bros chuts down Rooster Teeth and D lists Adult Swim games off of steam and potentially other places but definitely steam uh and also we have a we we bought a CT scanner oh that's crazy it's pretty cool yeah I mean I'm looking at some of the stuff it's produced we'll talk about  that and that got the most reactions we should just titled the show like we
bought a CD  ah the show is brought to you by ag1 Oracle and Squarespace let's jump right into our headline topic gForce now just got a pretty significant upgrade it now wait is this not in the thing uh no okay well whatever the point is that gForce now supports variable refresh rate which I have to confess having not been briefed on this by anyone at Nvidia or done any Research into it whatsoever I have no idea how that would work knowing that in order for your monitor to know
what refresh rate to run at it talks to your GPU and the fact that your GPU is streaming over that their internet um pretty freaking cool now it sort of seems like it might have something to do with nvidia's own drivers because right now variable refresh rate is limited to people who are running a relatively modern envid a GPU so gtx650 RTX 2000n up which sort of raises the question why you're paying for GeForce now in the first place because you already have a decent GPU but then
hold on that theory gets kind of thrown in the garbage and uh lit on fire the second that you realize that on a Mac you have support for variable refresh rate on Apple gpus or get this AMD gpus on the older Intel based Max so what the heck that would seem to suggest that Nvidia is just kind of arbitrarily locking Windows users who don't have GeForce gpus into fixed refresh rate operation on GeForce now then again you know if the uh market share numbers that I was just looking at
earlier this week or anything to go by that's basically nobody not matter nvidia's market share in the discreet GPU VI space is unbelievable and what's what's really wild about it right now is AMD has a pretty competitive lineup if you're not looking at Ray tracing if you're not looking at um you know which most people aren't AI powered frame generation where they do still have a significant Advantage people do care about that they do yeah they that one the r tracing part uh but if you but if
you mostly care about rasterized gaming performance traditional gaming performance performance AMD actually has a pretty competitive lineup between their older 6000 series and their newer "7,000 series cards I will say though if" you look at like settings guides for games everyone's turning that stuff on these days everybody yep and it kind of makes sense um anywh who p uh it is now $10 a month and that gets you a premium rig with RTX on up to 1080p resolution up to 60 FPS and up to a 6h hour session
length though you can start a new session at any time weird well I I get it I mean just in case you're idling let's say you were a popular you know streamer SL YouTuber and were gaming when your heart unexpectedly stopped beating well then this way uh GeForce now or Invidia would not be on the hook for streaming all that game data over  sure it's not hypothetical oh wow this guy knows I don't it was a whole thing W um oh boy so anywh who the point is that oh ultimate is $20 a month
and gets you an RTX 480 rig I'm up to speed with RTX on up to 4K resolution up to 120 FPS and 8 Hour session links I really don't see the 6-hour session length why is there why is there a differentiator that big of a problem in the first place but hey you can game for eight hours straight with GeForce now ultimate It's the weird part to me is that it's only two more hours of course of course none of this is what I'm upset about all of that is pretty cool there are some limitations around the variable
refresh rate support uh I don't believe it works with multim monitors for example but overall I think that is super cool the thing that I'm kind of butthurt about is their priority day passes now In fairness to Nvidia okay In fairness to Nvidia I am not super supportive of the you know the the the free month concept okay give us your credit card and you get a free month however I don't think that this is the solution a priority question yes would you enable that for Flo plane if there was trials
on Flow plane yeah you said you're not a huge fan I'm not sounds good sorry it's it's well enough established practice at this point that I I'm I'm looking at it going as long as it's very easy to cancel and super transparent that's our bar uh so when we're working with sponsors for example sometimes community members will flag for us that a service is difficult to canc whatever else exactly um and that's where I draw the line whereas a free trial is a free trial especially if it gives you very real
access to the service and in our case this isn't the kind of service that is effectively useless for the trial period like you know you look at some services like here I'll pick on a longtime sponsor I'll pick on Squarespace Squarespace their trial exists oh yeah not so you can actually like have a website kind set it up and see if you're satisfied so you can dink around with it a little bit and right so so something like that you know honestly could if we had a trial period someone could Q
download the entire site if Squarespace had a if Squarespace had a paid trial I believe their trial is free so if Squarespace had a paid trial um you know I'd be a little annoyed by that let me let me just see yeah get your get trial start no credit card required so because there's this kind of useless during the trial period they're doing the right thing and the trial is free so for our part if we're giving if we're taking payment information my expectation is that the service is very unfettered
usable during that time so I don't know that we would offer a one-month trial maybe we'd offer a shorter trial but what I can say is I thinking like a week or less we probably wouldn't be doing this for a one day pass for the regular the regular tier or the priority tier priority day pass you are going to pay $4 which I guess is fine except that a full month is $10 what exactly is NVIDIA trying to achieve here with a $4 day okay so ultimate is going to cost you $8 compared to $20 a
month why would anyone in their right mind pay 40% of the price of an entire month for one day and again In fairness to Nvidia I'm not a huge fan of the whole take your credit card now and then hope you forget about the subscription model it's become the standard you know what would be cool but everyone knows why they do that and this is something but why not I mean it's OB it's just who cares it should be a dollar or $2 this idea is free and I love this idea sure what if it contributed towards your 
month I would be far more okay with that it's like it's it's a pretty brutal percentage but if you do subscribe for the month it's like well I got to try it now I feel I still feel like it should be cheaper but I would like it if it contributed to towards honestly I think it should just be I would be happier with a free month trial it shouldn't be a dollar that's too cheap or just have me subscribe for the full month and prate me a partial refund if I'm not happy with it or something like I just I
just if the idea I just don't really understand what Nvidia is trying to achieve here if the idea was to create a very low barrier of Entry so that I can try it before I buy it then it should actually be the barri they don't want to process a bunch of $2 payments which is fair enough but if processing that $2 payment locks someone into a subscription if it turns them into a subscribing customer Mission freaking accomplished and and I can understand Nvidia not wanting to
just give away GeForce now because it as we know is extremely expensive for them to run both in terms of processing like like actual power and in terms of bandwidth this is this is a very premium service even on Nvidia side their costs are high so I get that they want to cover the costs and they don't want to do free trials but this is such a weird nons solution that I just I'm having a hard time Imagining the sort of the the penny pinching that was going on in the board meeting where they were making
this decision like are they actually worried that on a one-day pass someone is going to do you know four six hour sessions in a row to like to really get the maximum out of it and so they have to charge $4 versus a buck or like come on you guys if the idea is just to get the credit card which realistically from a from a marketing standpoint is 90% of the battle is getting someone to create an account and enter their credit card there's a free tier that's worth the few dollars yeah it's uh it's AB supported
yeah so realistically is it really your concern that you're going to lose money on people who want to try priority and ultimate if you don't charge them  I I I just I can't really I can't really follow I I I just don't I just don't really follow yeah we've got people saying like the four bucks should get you a week yeah if if $10 is a month I could totally see $4 being a week and then and then it's and then at least we're kind of talking about people kind of paying approximately the same amount
per time used and we're talking about a period of time when you could actually potentially you know when you have a Bing a game like it's actually useful where $4 for I don't know I just I have nothing else to say other than that I just don't really get it I think it should be a lower price yeah it should be it should be a lower price the day pass idea I actually love I think that's really cool if we could do a float plane day pass I'd be I'd be super into that we haven't built the
mechanisms for trials and for I don't think it works very well for our service to be completely honest I mean it could I don't think un doesn't include download I think yeah yeah something like that could work that might be all right yeah there's definitely some stuff that uh that we need to explore in terms of driving people to float plane we're going to be trying something new today um we're going to be doing are we hopefully are we not doing what uh float plane exclusive Afterparty oh okay yeah we're
playing Super checks I already forgot about that that was six minutes  I immediately started to think like some feature launch or something I was like oh no what am I not ready for we're back to  yeah oh man the fear in his eyes yeah I I legitimately was like what am I not ready for I don't don't know you actually looked extremely frightened ey LED inside oh man uh all right why don't we jump into our next thing that we're supposed to do Dan help me topic number two Luke you
want to pick it sure yeah uh index finger or pinky I asked if you want to pick it why oh really really Luke it's a little early on the show to go there twitch is still watching they're sensitive Virgin Eyes they're not they're not they haven't been sent to bed yet um let's do Yuzu all right let's do Yuzu yeah yeah makers of Yuzu shut down emulators Telemetry data worries and other shock waves through the emulation Community a week after Nintendo just a week this is like the craziest part to me a week after
Nintendo filed the lawsuit against Tropic hay LLC the makers of Yuzu switch emulation software Tropic Hayes has agreed to settle the case by paying Nintendo $2.4 million and ceasing distribution of the emulator man that happened fast like that was lightning fast there is no way that this wasn't all kind of going on behind the scenes at that point yeah Yuzu uh some observers have speculated that the devs may have settled to avoid discovery which may have verified claims that the
Yuzu team dumped and shared games between themselves or helped get switch games uh up and running on Yuzu before their official launch date Yuzu apparently had Telemetry that logged a lot of information and now that all devices and hard drives owned by the LLC are now in the hands of Nintendo leading to fears that they may take further action against the emulator's user base oh boy why did that Telemetry data need to get logged um as an additional result of the lawsuit Tropic hay has
also discontinued support of the 3DS emulator Citra the discussion has caused a wave of chaos yeah there we go uh the decision has caused a wave of Chaos in the emulation Community the official Discord channel of yuzu's competitor ryujinx um had rujin X okay had to temporarily stop accepting inv invites in response to the influx of users from the Yuzu Discord server a popular Discord server for the steam deck uh for the time being at least shut down its entire emulation channel to prevent potential legal
repercussions the developer of popular Nintendo DS emulator drastic uh stopped charging for the soft Ware on the Google Play Store and intends to pull it down and open its source a decision made more Urgent by the Uzu Yuzu settlement our discussion question is what will the results of this decision be and should emulator users and developers be concerned I mean we are not legal experts no when it comes to emulation or anything yep yep I was going there I was going there so take
all of this as not legal advice these are yeah but it's been pretty clear for a long time that emulation is very very murky legally it's heavily dependent on the region that you're in on the region that you are defending yourself against Everyone likes to thump that emulation is legal but it's like some aspects of that are somewhat proven out some aspects of that are not as proven out and as we've seen recently like looking at uh in particular a high-profile long-standing decision that
was overturned by the US Supreme Court somewhat recently just because something has legal precedent for it doesn't necessarily mean that that can never be overturned if there is sufficient pressure on the legal system uh or if there is a new argument that can be presented in order to get it changed I do think that there are probably regions where it is unlikely that that an emulation develop would be um at as much risk but it is very clear that if especially you pursue any kind of
monetary gain yes through the development and distribution of any kind of copyrighted material you are painting a Target on your back and big one you are going to be in trouble I think that what uh drastic is doing is probably a pretty smart defensive play open sourcing it and of trying to trying to make the target broader and less easy to go after if it's just an a community of open- source developers compared to uh an organization that is clearly making a significant amount of money I
mean if you have $2.4 million to pay as a settlement what I would assume is that that's somewhere near everything they had um and that's probably the negotiation that has taken place over presumably the weeks or months that have led up to this announcement and then the subsequent announcement of the settlement I bet you Nintendo wanted it to be fast because shows that scary how fast it happened is scary oh absolutely and I I I pretty much guarantee you a pretty significant
part portion of this was wanting to instill fear they don't want people to do this so they they they want to make a example the thing that sort of baffles me right now is that Nintendo thinks that that will be successful that people will maybe stop emulating games and emulating their systems totally will from a from a paid perspective I think we're going to see a somewhat Universal death of paid emulation I don't think so I think we might see that in some places I mean you're I think you're you're probably
not considering what's going on in places like China where you can buy easily readily available systems that are completely jammed packed full of emulators and pirated ROMs so more in like somewhat legal Havens yeah and and that's the kind of thing where that I mean we've seen time and time again um just basically since the Inception of the internet you can't stomp out anything yeah yeah yeah yeah you'll never completely get it there Always Somewhere it can hide whether it's whether it's you know uh online
Black Market places or whether it's we saw this with wild private servers back in the day before they made wild classic they they would just bounce around to Data Centers oh that one gets whacked another one comes up it's probably a new group of people whatever they're still going to accept payments they got to pay for servers I mean look we we discussed this a little while ago this actually cropped up on the subreddit people were asking well why why was lionist all talking about the Pirate Bay like don't
use the Pirate Bay um and it's because the ownership has changed multiple times and there's it's not it's legitimately not what it used to be it is actually not what it used to be and not run by the folks that used to run it but what I can say about it is it's still there I mean the number of times that the Pirate Bay and the the power of the entities who have tried to take down the Pirate Bay uh the number of times they've shut it down only for it to crop back up again yeah is mindboggling um especially
when you consider the the The Limited financial resources of a a website um and you know they definitely ran ads that we know from experience have higher cpms on them you know advertisers who won't get you know more legitimate sites to display their stuff um to be clear we haven't actually run them we've just seen offers but uh still still it's it's a it's finite resources you're going up against entities that have effectively infinite resources like the Motion Picture Association of America or the uh
what's the Raa recording industry artists Association or something like that I can't remember what Raa stands for but these like gigantic American um media organizations recording industry Association of America thank you um but yeah big deal really big deal yeah I'm I'm I'm worried because I I'm I'm at the point I'm at a point in my life now where I really do play pay for the games I play I I don't me too legitimately do not remember the last time I pirated a game I would have been
still living at my parents house I think maybe not I I don't know either no probably not Call of Duty 2 okay let's look at Call of Duty 2 no no I didn't I didn't pirate Call of Duty 2 because by then I was working at NC and um I got codes that um even if you did that was 2005 yeah no hold on a second was it COD 2 19 years yeah anyway the point is it's been a very very long time long time basically since steam got good I I could not afford to buy the games at all it didn't there was there was no like it
wasn't going to make a difference and I was pirating games and then I could afford to buy games and I bought games so as someone who has played Nintendo games on an emulator and owns every game that I played I mean look I'm not going to pretend that I went through the rig roll of ripping my games yeah and ripping my BIOS not going to pretend that you have a a I've got the cart got a cart yeah got the cart but I don't want to play on the switch it sucks and so that's honestly that's my
problem with all of this I'm not even looking at it like but my free games like it's not about that it's about I want to I want to play my games at 60 frames per second that's mahar's take as well you guys have the same oh really yeah oh it's hilarious he's just like I want it to be better yeah and if nintend if I even gave them I gave them mying money once for the switch second time for the switch OLED give me the game give me a switch to or switch Pro I saw I saw a rumor I don't know what source
it was from I have no idea The credibility but I I saw a rumor that kind of lines up with other rumors about the upcoming switch replacement that it's based on I want to say touring it's already going to be old um where where they were basically saying yeah the hardware has pretty much been done for like 2 years which kind of makes sense from a from a development standpoint like if Nintendo's like look we don't want to rush this we want to have Dev kits that are basically finished
Hardware so that the games at launch have years to be developed veled and are awesome or what like okay I get it I get  like get but I it's like a seven it's a seven-year-old console at this point mobile and it sucked when it came out yeah just give me something it was weak at launch yeah like Nvidia I remember Nvidia coming to the office at NC and pitching do you remember nidia's super phones yeah um yeah I remember that super phones Nvidia let's see if I can let's see if I can find any materials oh my
God from Super phones to super computers what is this what year is this from uh Nvidia fact sheet uh 191 million tegris shipped what am I even what am I even looking at here this is like obviously ancient collateral 2011 let's go okay so Nvidia had this super phones initiative around their Tegra chips and the idea was that they were going to power you know the computer the PC um or sorry they were going to power the data center uh your pocket and everything in between and um
te Terra kind of sucked like on the GPU side of things it was it was good it was solid uh but the the CPU was not competitive at the time and Nvidia wasn't able to iterate on it fast enough and get enough design wins to put the R&amp;D back into it to to get the cycle going it just never it never snowballed and a few years later out came the Nintendo switch with this like kind of crappy when it was launched which was years prior mobile chiping it and it's like oh please anyway yeah this sucks this sucks
because uh my issue is not paying for games my issue is wanting the games that I play to be the best possible experience and Nintendo having no interest in that whatsoever yeah I mean even just the fact that you're that you're save games are locked to the switch with no way to export them and the only way to back them up being a month subscription I've said it once I'll say it again off Nintendo with that I'm not into  money because Unfortunately they make good games yeah they do though yeah they
really do and you know looking at looking at Sony's move I'm I'm worried about the console future oh yeah Microsoft has already telegraphed that they are just utterly disinterested in the hardware side of the business they want to be a a Netflix for games it's it's all it's all I always forget what it's called now project xcloud whatever it's actually called what what what what is the Xbox streaming service called Xbox gold or something any any anyway uh  um XBox cloud gaming really yeah it's
all it's all about Xbox game streaming is that what it's called now it's called something it's all about it's all about this their streaming service and it's all about uh game pass the say cloud gaming sure Xbox cloud gaming uh so it's all about streaming it's all about Game Pass it's all about leveraging their data center expertise to become like a game gaming company but not necessarily just sell consoles at you at you know at cost or or at a loss um and seeing how heavily they've promoted the Xbox I mean
in terms of price like there were there were holiday deals last year that were very very aggressive on the series X and the series s um and seeing how they've just kind of evidently thrown in the towel on sort of making money on the hardware and they've invested everything into buying up developers it seems pretty clear to me that Microsoft's interest in the hardware side of things is fading which I think puts some weight behind what Microsoft said in their defense of
Sony's accusations that they were buying up these IPS to make them XBox exclusive I think I'm at the point now where I kind of believe them that those games will come to PlayStation because they're looking at the cost of developing these Mega AAA or uh quadruple a games games the future of gaming and going look if we don't Target the largest possible install base we're taking our own foot and basically turning it into swiss cheese with a gun right so I I think I kind of buy it now but here's the thing
Sony seems to be way faster way more suddenly I guess than I anticipated coming around to the same thing what even uh I was talking last week I think about the the console tier list video that we have coming where we were looking at the PS5 going you know what are the exclusives that you know cement this console as a as as you know iconic you know a console for the ages cuz that was one of our definitions is like what were the games that defined or the experiences that defined this
console and if all of its best games are going to make their way to PC or forbid and you know Xbox or Nintendo switch 2 or whatever the case may be it's kind of of hard to defend the PlayStation 5 as a piece of Hardware that need that needed to exist at any point and so looking at both Microsoft and Sony headed the Sega route hopefully not with the same level of disastrous um but heading the Sega route of being more of a more of a software company than an actual hardware company
is it possible or or even probable that Nintendo is the last one standing yeah I I think that'll be how it goes I don't know if it'll be soon necessarily I feel like PlayStation's going to hold out for a long time I don't think we're actually that close to PlayStation being done with consoles although I like almost feel like it might be better for us what if it is if they do if they do stop making consoles why oh well because you would need some type of host device at home yeah
better for us if they stop making consoles I don't know I don't know about that as PC people because it almost feels like some of the most interesting games are the ones where they like it's it's like you've got this positive feedback loop where you you make money selling consoles and you dump that into games then you make money selling the games and then you dump that back into the console and it's like it it's a it's a it's a self-reinforcing it's an ecosystem business model slash like there's
through the through the hardware the game and the subscription Services it throws a lot of money into a pot that at some point if they want that if they want that machine to keep turning has to go into developing great games and it feels like if they just become software companies well they're going to have all the same challenges that the entire rest of the games industry does where they just need to count on absolutely crushing it with software sales every single time and
then funding it unless they want to turn unless we want every game to just be a game as a service and even those even those seem really risky these days I have this is going to sound very off topic at but I uh starting next week we're filming a bunch of things with me for float plane CU apparently we're doing like some content with me I don't know um I'm cooking that chicken finally uh apparently that'll be probably a very boring chicken's not the only animal he's going to be showing you how to cook
wow oh boy uh if people know the context that's rough it's okay your mom's probably not watching yeah I don't know um one of them is going to be Starfield review I'm not going to talk about Starfield at all my plan is to entirely talk about the death of like the gaming industry that we grew up with cuz like Bethesda is a rotting carcass as of right now Blizzard's like dead Activision's like dead Ubisoft is like dead EA is like dead like all the biggest in Fair always kind of hated EA
yeah but they used to release bangers it was annoying cuz we didn't like the company but like they released good stuff old school NE for Speed was sick okay that's fair old old school NE for Speed was like actually an amazing game all right Fair they had other stuff that  it um but yeah I mean and and like the yeah the Atari thing I saw people talking about this online they're like this pattern started with Atari and we're just seeing the second stage of it now the first stage was Atari becoming
you know big and lethargic and failing and the the good people from it quitting and forming Activision and now Activision is big and lethargic and boring and now people are leaving Activision studios are leaving Activision key people are leaving Activision and they're going off and Building Things making their own little companies and we're seeing like the big slam Omega hits over the last little while Elden ring balers Gate 3 hell divers 2 the these none of these are from the studios you're expecting them
to be from you know speaking of which uh did you get a chance to try out stormgate from frost giant Studios no I haven't played it okay all right I'm excited too though I didn't pay enough attention I think they did like a play test weekend and I didn't play that weekend yeah these are some ex ex blizzard devs uh who are making what's supposed to be what they're trying to turn into kind of a spiritual successor to Warcraft 3 Starcraft 2 which are IPS that just uh St Starcraft in particular just feels
like it's rotting oh yeah like just do anything with that no no here's another Diablo gotcha game I I think pretty much everything blizzard has is rotting right now if I'm being completely honest I mean Diablo seems to be printing money is it I think so the mobile game yeah exactly the desktop game oh well sure yeah but I mean mobile I mean when Microsoft completed the acquisition of the F okay here let let me back it up the fact that King is even in the name of Activision Blizzard King it's
just yeah like it's not like those are the only gaming companies that they have either which is interesting to me no but the fact that King is like up there in the name of the company was mind-blowing to me and then and then two the the revenue share that King has of the entire of the entire company crazy it's just yeah and when you look at the utterly mind d when you look at the revenue of all the like game series and titles that we like care about cuz we grew up with them they like all
suck it's like oh okay I guess I understand why they're dying but like I think there's also a reason David David told me the latest Final Fantasy is really good yeah this is so this is in my notes is that Square Enix is like one of the only ones that's held on like almost everyone else has totally failed and square Nick had some dips but they've recovered every time yeah but they've also existed for like ever so they're going to do some dumb stuff and pretty much every time that
they do like with their launch of their MMO the original launch of the Final Fantasy MMO was terrible but then they were like you know what they really turned that around we're going to make it good and they like destroyed the whole first thing that they had if I remember correctly they like canceled the entire thing refunded everybody rebuilt it came back and then had this slow successful burn over time and now it's beloved it's like okay all right diao Immortal has St stabilized at
anywhere from about uh5 to7 million a month that's ridiculous so so Diablo Immortal is generating on a recurring basis somewhere in the neighborhood of60 to$ 70 million a year um and that's and that's like well into its life cycle here this is from statista and you take these numbers with the grain of salt that they need to be taken with um I I don't know exactly where these one came from but I these this seems somewhat believable that it did you know tens of millions of dollars
per month in the first couple of months so this game is is so far beyond its Roi Point um and is now into gravy territory with that said games as a service don't have quite the traditional okay we hit the ROI point now everything is just gravy uh that we that you used to because the development is ongoing but there's no way that the development is costing them five to6 million dollar a month a lot of that is absolutely absolutely gravy um I was I forget who I was talking to about
this but um it is pretty funny to me how clearly Nvidia seems to see the future and how much of their development seems to be going into making your old games fun to play again if you if you look I don't know at the big picture why does RTX remix exist it's not like there's any shortage of new games to play so why would anybody need to go back and play morrowwind but like in 8k with ra traced lighting people love Nostalgia stuff um that's going to be I I don't think it's cuz
games are getting worse I I actually have a different opinion on this no no no no no no I'm not saying it's because games are getting worse necessarily what I'm saying is that they are recognizing that the old model of here comes a blockbuster game that everyone is going to play every gamer is going to need or they're just going to get left behind by their gaming crew is dead so they can't count on that to sell gpus anymore cuz like I I think the two things you can't just point at balers
Gate 3 and say and say that that proves the thing or what the problem now is that I have two sure Dark Souls hell divers hell divers is killing it okay is Hell divers going to sell gpus uh let's have a look at the hell divers 2 system requirements shall we yeah I don't think those are super so you need a core i7 4790k hey man and a GTX 1050 TI I don't think you'll necessarily enjoy your experience with that so my so my but my point though was that Nvidia can't count on these AAA games pushing Nvidia sales
that everyone's going to buy to to make it so that you have to buy an RTX you know 6969 GT TI whatever last Epoch and po world are not going to help me counter Lin they are really not so Nvidia those are not so Nvidia is investing heav these are these are not cheap efforts Nvidia is investing heavily in tools to make your old ugly games kill your current GPU yeah but and not in just like a like a meaningless stupid way in a some those shots of mowind are actually insane in a meaningful I would
enjoy this game more playing it this way kind of way and it's just I don't know it's I don't remember how we made it onto this topic of conversation Nei but it's it's clear that they've identified that the industry that they grew up in no longer exists yeah fair enough I just I think it's I think it's yeah I think it's a life and death cycle I think we're seeing new companies rise up I think we're seeing creative ideas come out uh like a lot of people looking at Hell divers and being like why isn't
this Halo like where is Halo Halo infinite took so long to develop and is trash like what I like it sort of well I like things about it yeah it's the game I play if I'm just like I'm going to play a game for an hour I've given them Z for it though so I'm definitely part of the problem um wait no no I bought the campaign I bought it and then didn't play it yeah it's not good I guess I contributed I actually like didn't like it yeah well you played it without me youle I'll still play it with you if you
want well what it yeah it's like it's like if your it's like if your if your if your girlfriend like goes and watches the movie that you were going to watch together and then you're like yo WTF like well I'll watch it again but it suck you never have any I'll watch it again but it sucks yeah yeah I'm going to I'm going to drag you through this experience you didn't even enjoy happily complain about it yeah cuz that's going to make it more fun for me it might it might be the most 
dick oh man um but like it's I don't know we're looking at this stuff and just trying to like where where are these old companies you're looking at these games that are killing you're looking at the things that the community is asking for they're just not making them um and it's frustrating you you hear stories about like how people at at 343 have effectively pitched almost exactly what hell divers is cuz like if you think about it Halo already has their ODST hell jumpers like they literally
have this thing it exists in their  um uh and they just didn't so I don't know Capcom is another company that's been doing good games I agree isn't Capcom Japanese again yep yep so there's a bit of a theme going on there um but they and they also did this thing though in my opinion capcom's had some dogs oh yeah and they're they're recently on a rise for sure but they they were definitely mostly forgotten about for a  all right Dan what's next what about valve they like don't
make games anymore yeah what what a boat valve hey we made CS2 and pissed everybody off I mean did they I mean what even is CS2 is CS2 a game Define game kind of hard to tell at this point I feel like they just like didn't want to maintain uh go anymore like seriously Define game it's Counterstrike but the smokes are cool okay they're pretty cool you can Splish Splash in the water that's pretty cool yeah see people are no no what games is chores smoke is cool see this is this Guys Smoke is pretty cool yeah
this is this is what I'm talking about I no I'm doing this I'm actually I'm doing this okay here we go dictionary do what is your phone doing what's that charging oh yep why does it have red light uh because it has a cool uh it has a cool multicolored light that you can have it do different lights for different things that is such an ancient feature yeah I know that everyone abandoned yeah well it's cool the note 9 is it's the phone that has the all the things um hold on
actually let me double check I think it has that I've I've never actually tried to configure it um RGB uh notification light I think it has one light colors mean i' be defal yeah it has that okay so the definition of a game uh noun wait what Portal 2 is released in 2011 my dudes um stop reminding me about the passage of time an amusement an amusement or Pastime so what does CS2 what does CS2 anything that any way anything versus CSG go the smokes are pretty cool okay so it's an amusement I can look at
the smokes okay CS2 is a game I can look at the smoke and then I can throw a frag nade and then I can go oh it all went away and then it comes back I guess what I'm trying to say is I don't think they developed a game with CS2 because the game already existed it's basically like it's basically like if you electroni bu menu if you that's a big one no they made a market they made a store it's like if you take chess okay and you create a Marketplace for different pieces that you can put on the board
different different board Styles and you make the board look really pretty nice en you Haven write this down you haven't made chess chess is the game you didn't make it you accessorized it you know it would be sick oh my goodness okay Apple Vision Pro app it's a chess app but you can play it like puts at a table at chess event so you can like you can like Magnus Carlson can be beating somebody up right next to you and you are playing someone at your table and like when
Magnus Carlson does his thing where he's like bored cuz he's destroying and he just looks at other people's games and evaluates them CU he's waiting for the other opponent to finally do something uh he can like look at your game and that could be the built-in game evaluation sick Okay I uh really think that that is a much worse idea than where I thought you were going with this I thought you were just I thought where you were going was just you know developing a an exciting remember oh do
you remember battle chess I actually I I I look this up every once in a while I want a campaign based chess game and it they just don't exist as far as I can tell battle chess is sick what is this this is Battle chess obviously oh my  arms it's it's only a a flesh wound though yeah it's the it's the flesh wound meme yes oh no what happens now oh okay it's battle chess what is that don't worry  rook [Laughter] what wow that's amazing oh my Bishop man they got they got God Powers anyway are those Queens
uh Yes W you can tell from the uh yep queenly um yeah oh the Rooks are epic yeah they're  monsters but yeah I want I would love to have like a wait people FPS chess what is this a thing what's FPS chess anyway what I was going to say was basically you create like a like a chess with you know microtransactions essentially so you can buy like skins skins for your chess FPS chess wait what the heck this is amazing oh my god of course this is a thing here we go what you can fly and
stuff hold on hold on here we go here we go what is this what am I what am I what am I looking at just wait for it just  it head shot head shot and then wait Rocket Jump and then they're flying what what's happening okay so when you fight for a for a space king can not win necessarily maybe I have no idea I don't want this I just want a campaign is that a suppressed sniper wow Rook wins over the top okay well that's something that exists uh cool very positive reviews came out in
July of 2022 I don't want I don't want I I don't want 5D chess with multiverses and time travel that's that's cool that's neat that's interesting I just  MMO I I think that's just chess.com I think this legitimately chest Google on pasant um I know what aant is anyway we're supposed to do some merch messages hey guess what we've been talking about this forever the Hat the Hat okay okay so remember when we did a poll on Wan show and we asked the people hold on let me just uh it's not it's not obvious uh
outwardly which one is which can you tell from the bands uh you know what nope no these might wait did they seriously oh they only okay these are the same hat uh one is large one is medium okay the point is ages ago we asked you guys hey do you just want like a more comfortable uh you know USD designed there's no smarty so it's it's like super comfy it has a nice size adjuster oh no smarty yeah no no no smarty has a has a quite a nice size adjuster and it's you know just the right depth it's
qual quality hat do you just want like a quality you know basic hat we're bringing back you know the basic hat or do you want an expensive hat that's like waterproof and made out out of this super expensive material and you guys basically voted 5050 so we were like all right thanks for nothing that's not very  both the LTT hat and the LTT hat Pro now I saw some really cool when it was in thumbnail mode I was  you wow these guys were having way too much fun Colton rocking the so you can
see the uh the Water beading on there um so we've got two versions of the Hat we've got the regular hat and we've got the LT hat Pro made exclusively for professional grass touchers uh it's water resistant for everyday use okay what's the fabric there it is uh ventile cotton with Incredible water repellency repellency Excuse Me By Design got a whole bunch of information here really nice Comfort no matter how you wear it Forward backward one of my requirements was that it should still be comfortable
even if you wear it sideways like a complete tool okay look you know what it matters to me okay it matters to me that works surprisingly well I just I I didn't want the uh wait I can okay please please stop sick beats there look it totally works please actually stop everything that we're looking at right now is not okay got question asking if it comes in tall tall no medium and large sorry medium and large um but the main feature is just that it's comfortable anyway it's there it's
on the store and you can pick it up this week and while you're at it you can leave a merch message the way to interact with the show is not through super chats or um whatever they're called whatever the things on twitchit Twitch bits or anything like that might it's merch mess messages because instead of just throwing money at your screen you should throw money at your screen and get quality merchandise in return and by the way we will also take your messages they'll go to producer Dan who
will sort through them and either pop them up on the screen like Anonymous is here who just scored a knock to Edition screwdriver or we'll forward them internally to get you guys an answer reply to you or even curate them for me and Luke to address and these days often Dan as well uh all you got to do is put something in your cart and there will be a little box anytime we're live that will allow you to leave a merch message so we're going to show you guys kind of how that works and oh right there's
another promo for the store uh I didn't see it on the homepage but we are yes we have a promo running on the Retro screwdriver all you got to do is add the Retro Edition okay so retro colorway to your order and you will get free shipping for your entire order oh nice yeah nick uh was like hey we should do a promo it's March which is a pretty traditionally slow time for retail ah  like and then uh we did it so there it is order a retro screwdriver get free shipping on your whole order let's go
all right Dan do you want to show us how merch messages work I will say one quick thing before we go on it's actually a lot nicer with headphones cuz of the no Bean thing what called yeah well there's no pressure point like everything else we do this hat took an embarrassing amount of time have you noticed how long we've had no hats on the store oh yeah that's because we were working on development of the hat and we were like well let's not reorder any more these other hats cuz like we're going to make
a better hat dude eventually yeah yeah so we're both wearing the regular cotton one and then the ventile one is like double the price or whatever because that material is like wildly expensive yeah it's 20 bucks and it's uh 40 bucks and it's just a really comfortable hat or it's a really comfortable hat with water resistance it's up to you uh one thing to note is that the little like holes are not on the pro that's the only cosmetic difference that's why I was so confused
when I was looking at them because I thought I had one of each I was gaslighting myself to think that they're they the the the the one with the waterproof fabric had a hole on it sorry I want to be really careful with the word waterproof I don't use the word waterproof from my understanding this is a waterproof material but it's a word I just like to avoid because water will literally cut a path through a mountain so nothing is waterproof but the the water what's the point of having a water
resistant one with a hole in it so I was really confused firefighters don't like fireproof yeah yeah cuz it's like really how much fire how long how hot yeah yeah we can melt basically anything so like come at me bro yeah so that's why that's why we had that whole thing with vessie where uh we changed our talking points to vessie vessie says they're waterproof instead of us saying they're waterproof because I won't say anything as waterproof In fairness to vessie they're good good shoes I like them but
nothing is waterproof all right anyway uh Dan yeah sure sup little large and Dad so you know those white circle easy peel tabs on food and stuff why the actual F do those always rip and make peeling not easy at all you make products how could this happen I don't think I've ever ripped one of those oh yeah some of them some sometimes like apples Apple sticker ones yeah sometimes they're made of paper if you get them wet so I've made the mistake of washing an apple before peeling it and what
happens is the paper layer um delaminates from the adhesive layer and then getting that adhesive layer off completely without pulling out the isopropyl alcohol and like cleaning your Apple really uh whereas the plastic ones come off even if you get them wet first but from my understanding are more environmentally impactful so hopefully that answers the question but um the one that really drives me c is um the the Ocean Spray crains the dried cranberries the pack that they 
Costco maybe I'm about to reveal that I'm a complete idiot but as far as I can tell there's been an error in the packaging such that if you use the like pull thing the resealable mechanism for it doesn't work is it the is it the Craisins I don't I don't know there's there's one very like large brand like large recognizable brand thing that they carry at CCO where if you use the pull tab it uh you the the the reeal thing doesn't work and you have to get out a knife and you have to like cut it
yourself in your own spot instead of where the little indent is and I I think it's the craisin some some people are agreeing with you so yeah I think you're right it might be yeah is is it Crain uh people people are saying yes they had the line cut underneath the resalable zipper yeah thanks okay yeah that has been like that for I kid you not like five years and it's it's such a it's such a simple it's such a the fact that nobody at Ocean Spray ever bought a pack of their Craisins and was like this
is stupid is mindblowing to me it is absolutely mind-blowing to me I mean I've talked about this on the show where I think that the president of every car company should have to drive only cars that they make they should they should rotate through them they should have to drive every single car they make because how else are you going to get anything done like the number of if they think it isn't safe enough they shouldn't make it and I mean not just that like if if they
come across something that is annoying and in so many cases costs nothing to fix literally actually nothing you know to move a button where you can reach it more easily or to whatever it is right the the the fact that they don't act as their own harshest reviewers just grinds my gears so hard um you know you talk of man and anything is like this you know like if you are if you if you run you know public transit for the city of Vancouver if you don't ride it at least once a
month you how could you possibly how could you possibly even hope to make decisions that impact the people who do ride it yeah ideally if it's only going to be once a month you should ride it like a lot that one day shouldn't like get on one bus you should probably vary locations and stuff anyway like I use float plane every day yeah I use it I mean uh I had a I had a meeting with Dennis earlier this week where we were talking about his uh his like creative uh creative sponsor spots and uh he
asked me about the ones that we did for Wicked cushions um at CES and I was like brother do you think I watched sponsor spots I whenever I watched like Adam's video or any of the other host videos i' I've watched them on Flo plane the you think this is I'm going to watch on YouTube like some kind of pleb like no watch without the sponsor SPS on Flow plane uh and he's like oh that makes sense I'm I'm getting called out cuz I mentioned I don't watch all the LT videos and I said I watch every day
there's more stuff on there than LT yeah yeah we're not the only ones just saying yeah just saying also do watch LTD videos I just don't watch all of them you guys release a lot of stuff sorry so much content man we got some good stuff coming hey speaking of Nvidia who we roasted in the first topic of the show guess who's back back again no way Nvidia sponsored a video I know right what it's been hold on I think the last I think the last time they worked with us in a non-editorial capacity and even
that seemed begrudging for quite a while was the launch of the RTX 3090 so that was September of 2020 3 and a half years years ago in that time in that time from my understanding um some people have moved on yeah at Nvidia yeah I well I think that's not even that's just true well it's more than just one person who butt I hurt okay uh so that's not surprised some people have some people have moved on or are in positions of lesser importance um and I wouldn't be surprised if that controversy
contributed anyway the point is there's there's there's a new sheriff in town when it comes to Media engagement and we actually first I first sat down with them in June of last year and they were basically like no no we're different now we're different now and I was like sure and they were like no but like you know we really want to we really want to work with the media we want to work with you guys we W to we want to be good citizens and I was like sure and I basically I always feel bad when
this happens because it's not it's not his fault but I basically tore a strip out of him I was like look this is everything that Nvidia has done  ever how long was this called like I'm not even this in person this is at compx oh so I sat down with um I mean I I don't I don't know I don't know if one of these people is like publicly everyone knows what they do but Jacob was one of them you remember Jacob from EVGA right so Jacob was there uh we had someone I truly believe he would try to
do good things oh Jacob's great he's awesome yeah but anyway so we had so Jacob was there uh the other guy who's handing media relations now and I don't know if his name is public and I don't want to like out somebody but Jacob's a public figure so I don't whatever Jacob's fine so so Jacob was there someone from our business team was there I was there and then the the media relations guy uh from Nvidia was there and like Jacob had just made the transition from EV VGA to Nvidia and so I I I'm not
going to put any words in his mouth cuz he didn't say much um but it was it it definitely was an interesting Dynamic having me from the media side Jacob from very recently the Nvidia partner side and the other guy from I'm sure you brought up things they've done to their Partners not just media so I basically laid out everything from Nvidia that I've seen over the course of my career that has that has Illustrated that there's a significant attitude problem not just these isolated in instances of of
bad behavior um and he was like okay I'm going to take all that and uh you know I'mma work with it and I'm I'm going get back to you and anyway we we connected briefly again at CES so this is 6 months later and 3 months ago and he was like yeah you know we really want to work with you guys and you know What In fairness everything I've heard from Gary from the lab has been that Nvidia has been taking feedback like like actually like really seriously um you know anytime we're we're finding any any odd
behavior with the product or or bugs or whatever else um they they seem to the GeForce team even though I I I I've talked about actually well these these things actually kind of go together but the GeForce team seems to still care a lot about gaming even if Nvidia as a company has largely moved on to AI um um and I I talked about how I I would actually be really interested to see Nvidia just split off GeForce yeah as as a separate entity that can just be Scrappy and not have to have the same
kinds of margins or else their stock tanks or whatever else and just focus on gaming because those guys are passionate oh yeah they're passionate yeah so anyway we are um we are working with Nvidia on a sponsored video that is going to be upgrading our worst setup our worst setup so we had people at the company submit their this personal rig setups or work PC setups there are some you're going to see some stuff personal setups no um not everybody owns a vacuum apparently
no I don't know that for sure but what I will say is I didn't see one and I didn't see evidence of one existing I feel like this should be two videos any one should just be reacting and judging to the systems the point is I was on my way to that shoot I forget how I got onto this topic and I was talking to Dennis about the creative reads and I hadn't seen uh anything that was on YouTube because I watch float plane uh uh one quick thing the uh LT Pro hat in the pictures has
holes oh okay or it has the circles I don't know if it actually passes through but I'm seeing on on multiple people maybe it does maybe it just does have holes thin maybe that's the thing either way it is might a layer of something under it because those might be structural it is definitely made of the water resistant material so make of that what you will yeah here I'm just going to look at oh yeah yeah yeah yeah it has the Hol still okay there you go I can actually even see through it I wonder why it has
holes yeah I I can definitely see through this one yep all right it definitely has holes but it is made of the water resistant material all right uh where was yeah where was I going with the story about uh oh yeah anyway well Nvidia nvidia's back so we are they they are sponsoring a video upgrading our worst setup and yeah you guys are going to see some stuff uh I I you know I the person who I'm talking about will know who they are oh no and um are is going to to watch this I know that for a fact 
know I uh I didn't want to touch anything when I was there he going to watch this yeah they're definitely going to watch this I think I know who it is don't don't don't don't don't don't say anything cuz the video is going to start with us meeting all of the finalists and then it'll it'll go from there wow and uh and and all I know so far is that I have been to all the finalists setups I have seen all the setups um but we're going to do we're going to film um probably on
Tuesday we're going to film announcing to them who is going to be getting uh the setup upgrade and then we're going to do some stuff any Elijah ELO everyone's saying it's me it's not I promise uh I will say this much it is not Elijah there it's not Elijah another merch message yeah hit me I don't even remember what that question was stickers bed basically okay oh yeah right wow whoa I either have a gift or a problem I just I'm enabling you to be perfectly honest it can be both it's okay to be
both can have both many businesses in the tech sector seem to be aiming to sell themselves off to a major player is there any subsection of the market maybe such as high-end Leisure products that could avoid that future I mean as far as I can tell the point of starting a business is um to make money what and the best way to make money is to find some sucker with a lot of money and take it off their hands for them that's like how yeah that is the goal in software is to sell generally I
mean that's the goal in basically anything that's not mom and pop and I feel like I mean I wasn't around when it was any different but I feel like it wasn't always like that like the point of running a business was to serve your customers and and and make money but but not make more than you make necessarily by by just selling to someone else um but part of it is like it seems to be driven both ways I've talked about this before but I have that friend who's a vet who bought the practice that she
worked at and ended up bidding against a large Veterinary acquisition company um and so it seems to be a push poll right because on the one hand you've got people whose goal whose sole goal uh when they created their business was to sell it for as much as possible but then you've also got these acquisition companies who exist only to acquire other businesses not to create not to create anything and you know that can sometimes lead to really tragic results because someone who wasn't there and didn't build it
with their sweat Blood and Tears is not necessarily going I shouldn't say not is never going to treat something with the same respect as someone who did and you see this time in time again uh Warner Brothers getting into our next topic here shut down Rooster Teeth Now I want to kind of preface this with saying I didn't really consume Rooster Teeth content I didn't follow any of the controversies that have taken place I don't know if they were resolved and everything was cool or if they were not resolved so
there could be a myriad of reasons why Rooster Teeth shut down but what we know for sure is Warner Brothers has shut him down at least 150 full-time employees will lose their jobs um whoa and many of rooster teeth's existing properties will either be sold or transferred elsewhere within its parent company um Warner Brothers hasn't uh that hasn't been the only controversial move that Warner Brothers has made recently uh Warner Brothers is also delisting an unknown number of game titles originally
published by another subsidiary Adult Swim according to several of the games developers uh Michael M I think this might be a typo in my doc but anyway the creator of sound Dodger plus says he begged his Warner Bros rep to transfer ownership of the game to him on Steam rather than remove it since seeing as he still owned the IP and the game rights and this is a quote I sent him a link to steam's transfer page and explained clearly that it takes literally three clicks to transfer the ownership to me
he rejected my request so the problem with this is not that it necessarily affects the ability of the game to still be available he can relist it himself because he owns the rights which is really great but he loses anyone who ever wishlisted the game he loses all of the reviews of the game the historical reviews of the game um another Dev ow and Deary uh responded by offering a free download of his game small radios big televisions on his website rather than have it completely disappear
um so our discussion question is why would Warner Bros deist these games rather than just leaving them alone the only thing that I can possibly guess tax thing yeah that's one possible option speaking speaking of uh seamless transitions into other topics I definitely have some more to say about uh tax write-offs and tax deductions later on the show because anyway a whole thing this week from the uh from the we read mean comments video um but that that's one that's one potential option
another one is they just uh don't want to fund development of these and make sure that they don't have any security potential liability I yeah I don't know I don't know I I it's hard for me to imagine a mindset where you have something that is as far as I can tell completely passive um requires no input from you whatsoever and generates any amount of Revenue however small and just go you know what I'll just turn that off I just I I can't I don't get it it doesn't make any sense
to me um does anyone have any additional context for this float plane chat anyone I don't think so I also don't think like I think it's fairly accepted that games especially single player games like they're not going to get security updates past a certain point and kind of who cares one Dev according to an um was told that he could relist the game if he removed everyone in Adult Swim games from the credits like what I uh weird I don't get it very weird yeah I don't really get it um I I saw you kind
of I saw you kind of Googling uh Rooster Teeth did were you were you checking if their controversies were resolved or what were you up I looked that up um they like fired somebody for something and there's other stuff but there's been they've they've existed for so long that there's like been stuff over the years it seems like they've mostly resolved it though uh this is what I was more recently looking at was oh Adult Swim games okay what are we looking at here we about Unicorn Attack one of my
favorites oh okay the the the Rick and Morty games there's a few of them in here uh Ricky Morty the virtual game thingy yeah and pocket Morty what else are we looking at I don't recognize I don't recognize most of these most of these that doesn't mean that it's okay and we have no idea exactly had no idea there was a robot unicorn attack too being  know I don't know if I'll be able to know now H I don't see number two on Steam right now in fact I don't see any Robot Unicorn Attack on Steam right
now is it already is it already pulled I don't think I don't know I don't think the first one was ever on Steam oh okay this isn't a list of their games that  games well where where do you buy it uh the first one you didn't buy it was just a free web game oh okay Robot Unicorn Attack 2 is on mobile ah so maybe maybe it's just like a mobile Port that's not really a two or I I'm not  sure but yeah that sucks any times anytime this kind of stuff happens it sucks um I like physical media physical
media is good now if it's physical media that just like links you to a thing that you have to download from then it is irrelevant it doesn't matter but real physical media is good 150 people working for Rooster Teeth that's a lot it does seem like kind of a lot how many shows and stuff did they have I know they have their own dedicated website so that'll be a chunk of it I'm really not sure I I I don't know what the uh I don't know what the revenue model was bought by full screen which in turn
was bought by Otter Media before rooster te became part of Warner media under AT&amp;T's ownership in 2022 Discovery closed the acquisition of Warner media to form Warner Bros Discovery okay so it's changed hands a lot up whoa I don't really know how this works but I went to uh Rooster Teeth website and clicked on shows and uh this this is a lot of stuff oh wow okay so is this stuff that people are watching loading wow I don't know how to tell that apparently in addition to the 150 employees there's
also like tons of contractors and stuff too that are that are getting the boot  things I know at one point they were like killing it with their own streaming service like they were they had like tens of thousands of subscribers like monthly subscribers and stuff like that this is actually just getting to be ridiculous I'm wondering like how many  have and is this actually all made by them like wow well how old is some of this stuff click something like yeah what's that
foures when's the last time this got an update Four Seasons sorry for okay play latest episode  okay nice yeah okay oh not a single comment  indicator well okay uh yeah people are saying it seems like at some point Rooster Teeth had the mindset of greenlighting just about anything and seeing what sticks uh Arbiter K says if lmg sells please sell to good people and not to a Warner Bros type and that I think brings us full circle back around to the point that I was trying to make
as I transitioned into this topic that there is nobody who would buy lmg who would treat it the way that we did and it's possible that we could find someone pretty good I think that the the party that that made an acquisition offer was it last year or the year before they seemed pretty good they were pretty darn close to what we would be looking for if if we were to do something like that but I think as you guys have seen uh we didn't do that and instead we've made uh
significant reinvestments for the future and we're we're sticking around whether you like it or not so get over it um something something taxes or we are we done this topic or no oh we can talk about taxes sure do you want to talk about taxes oh there's more stuff in there isn't never mind yeah we can talk about taxes all right what's up so in our line mic are tax right off basically free actually I think uh I think they provided these mics I don't think they're right off at all you have
to break them for them to become a tax wrof these mic stands are tax wrof um basically free so just a second can you can you just relax for a minute here in the lonus reads mean comments video it's vibrating I ended up going off a little bit at the end of the video because Elijah put up not one but many comments from people talking about how you know whatever lonus just does whatever he does because it's a tax write off it's it's a tax write off y um true and so I I basically was like okay okay I need a
money I I I need a money and I got I got a fake $100 bill I I even said it was fake in the video the number of people that didn't realize it was fake how could you  money you are not helping so I was like okay let's say I made $100 and I ripped it in half to demonstrate that by the time you pay corporate income tax personal income tax um and it doesn't quite work like that because I don't have to pay both personal income tax and corporate income tax I either pay personal income tax and the company
doesn't pay tax on the revenue or I pay corporate income tax and then pay out a shareholder dividend that works out about the same so whatever so by the time you pay income tax to get it into my own hands and the various you know other taxes that we deal with around here sales tax and whatever uh we're down to about half by the time I actually get the money and use it for anything um and then I explained that if I use it to buy something say for example a slate like a video slate then
I spend $50 on that okay now I have a slate and then I still have to rip the remainder in half and I get only $25 of my $100 to actually use and do anything  personally most people it seems like followed along pretty well but one of the comments was accusing me of using my pool as a tax write off you did really okay explain to me yeah this is not Financial advice mhm how I can use my pool as a tax wrate off you use  videos do you have any idea how far the CRA would kick my rectum up into my
body if I tried to write off my pool on my taxes used for work events used very specifically for video multiple videos really I mean your house could be just an entire tax right if we've shot videos in it before yeah we could be making money you guys are actually behaving like ignorant viewers right now that's what you guys are doing right now that's the goal I hate you so much both of you I this will maybe make you feel better uh some people said that you you didn't say that it was fake and I had people go
look at it you you did say it was fake yeah confirmed I I know I said it was fake of course I said it was fake conf I'm not going to I'm not going to admit to a felony offense on camera not that stupid like writing off your pool like writing off my pool um so I just want to I just want to I just want to back up a little bit here the number of people that think cuz people did point out that what I said was an oversimplification lonus you don't have $50 and taxes or $25 and taxes you have $25 and a slate
and you paid some taxes and you paid you paid half as much tax said that I did I did but what they seem to have a hard time with is that I do not have a slate the company does lonus Media Group Incorporated has a slate which he owns I don't need a slate though I can't eat a slate I can't drive a slate I can't swim in a slate you could definitely drive a slate so lonus Media Group in corporated should own the pool in your car no because and so I will you can rent it from the company no you set up a
subsidiary Corporation which you own that rents it from lus Media Group that then is paid for by lus Media Group so it's like infinite money if there was not Financial advice if there was actually an infinite money glitch everyone would use it and all of this is going to vary depending on your tax jurisdiction but what I can tell you guys about ours is that no not every meal I eat is a tax write off no not everything that I own is a tax write off that's actually not how it works now I I
will say this for the pool if we were to use the pool for a shoot okay what I could do oh yeah like a portion whatever what I could do is if I were to set up uh like a like a bus a separate business entity or or I the person were to were to H what what's what's it called um if I were just to operate as like an independent contractor and I to reconcile all of this on my my annual like personal taxes and everything what I could do is I the owner of the pool who paid for it with after tax money
could make an invoice for the company billing the company to rent our pool as a location for a shoot and then the company could pay me and then I could report that income and then I could pay my income tax on that that is a way that I could could subsidize the construction of the pool but I could no no I could I could it's possible kind of like how if you uh if you have a house if you have a house you can write off part of your your um either your mortgage or the interest on
your mortgage or like you can write off part of your house expense office if you have a certain square footage that you use as as an office space that's what I do yeah yes that that's totally legit as long as you're actually using it for for work for like a revenue generating Enterprise you put down a percentage of how much you used it in a year right but but folks no like really like oh there's some good ideas in twitch chat though what now what if we  pool twitch do we really need more hot
tub streams okay is that really what you  oh hot tub super checks how do I get it hot tub super checks yeah now we're talking oh my God hot tub Super Chat the splash goals like after someone scores the like big splash yeah be hyp dude so yeah is ignoring us some people seem to understand that while that was an oversimplification that is basically how it works and there's a lot there's a lot of Regulation that dictate what I'm allowed to write off and what I'm not allowed to write
off for example the EV Chargers that we have here at the office if I install them in a parking stall that is designated for my use I cannot expense those and I cannot participate in any subsidies what if you did for Taran no however if they are for General reuse of the employees then oh wait no no hold on hold on hold on hold on no this one was separate uh if if if it is for my personal use then it counts as a taxable benefit that's right yeah so a taxable benefit is something that the comp is
something that the company pays for but that you the employee still have to pay personal tax on so if I were to as the business owner install an EV charger in a stall that only I can use then any money of the use of that charger and the electricity use counts as a taxable benefit for me that I have to declare on my personal taxes and pay tax on even though the company never actually gave me any cash so that's that's the kind of loophole closing that they do to make it so that I can't have Luke who makes
"$10,000 a year so he only has to pay" like so back to ncx zero income tax which would be nice and then I just give "him 40 $3,000 a year in Costco gift" "cards and $10,000 a year in clex gift" "cards wow and $10,000 a year in steam" gift cards wow right I've got weird priorities anything that has a cash equivalency he would have to pay income tax on you can't just you can't just pay people in gift cards and vacations and like we figured out the system we we beat the system whereas
there is a carote here in BC anyway if we install an EV charger that is for anyone to use and does not belong to to any that is not in like a designated parking stall then nobody has to pay has to count it as a taxable benefit anyone can use it and and you just essentially get to charge for free on the well the company pays for it but um the company gets to write off our energy usage because that's not money we made you don't pay income tax on money you didn't make right right so we write off the
taxes and then they don't have to pay income tax so it's it's optimization but no one is actually no one is able to avoid paying taxes outright unless they are unless you expensive unless you are doing something very either very clever or very illegal and so if you were to say well yeah but lonus could just expense his car because he he could write off his car because he shoots videos with it in it once in a while and he could write off his pool because they shoot videos once in a while yeah you
could also walk into a grocery store and take everything in it you could but if anyone catches you then it's going to be a problem unless you live in California you could not return the shopping you if you took everything in it you would exceed the the limit and I mean that's true yeah yeah groceries are really expensive that's the whole thing yeah you probably couldn't even get like two grocery carts thanks Luke that's uh life sucks you know why life sucks cuz we can't expense our
pools that's why God it's so difficult being wealthy and Rich um doc 3269 says at Linus during the W show you talked about potentially buying a Samsung the wall Luke said it's stupid for anyone to pay that much for a TV and you said it's not going to be that much because you will make some videos to subsidize the cost statements like this make it seem like you're buying expensive things and using making videos as a way of subsidizing the cost I am yeah that's even if I have
to yeah even if I have to pay tax on the income if I get content out of it I'm going to make money on the content that's that's super above board yeah that's fine the government actually really wants you to do that yeah if they're they want more money to move around cuz when more money moves around more taxes move around that's like the whole point of the economy is to buy things yeah Elijah bro he wouldn't have bought the 115in TV if he couldn't make a video guys 99% of the
tech that I acquire is to make a video the camera that you are watching this through the laptop in front of me this stream deck weird fun fact but his house was less of a tech disaster back when we didn't make videos about it yeah cuz I just it was like actually fine and everything worked uh and he even had like you'd have like a controller die and he'd be like I have a solution for this I have the the world's biggest battery charger in 17 anal loops and we can just immediately solve the
problem and there was like everything worked all the time and there was batteries for everything and everything was fine and then now he makes videos about it and everything well the problem is that other people who don't have to live there work on the videos ah okay I mean that makes sense and so but so you wouldn't have to do that if you didn't do this whole thing but the content's good so you do it anyways I do it on purpose I I suffer for you I uh I I I legitimately love new tech and
I love tinkering around with things and and it's not like we're not doing things that I'm approving or or are my idea in the first place but I would a lot of what we do is done the way that we do it because who else would do it that way I did not need to use solar panels and server Heat to augment my pool heating I didn't that's stupid you didn't need to use your pool to cool your server room no not even a little there's a lot of other ways to do it I if iier cheaper way cheaper way easier I could have just
put air conditioning in there in fact I have air conditioning capacity for that room I choose not to use it a because I feel like it's pretty pretty stupid to air condition in the winter when you could just move the heat through much more energy efficient means okay like you know cool yeah I like it and and B  lame when you could put a water cooling Loop in your server room um so yes if you if you have a conspiracy theory that I do things on hard mode just because it's hard mode
and because it's more fun that way you're right I was just going to say [Laughter] yeah the amount of times we've been like here's a video idea it will be a banger and he's like ah too easy like oh okay all right oh  um oh sponsor oh yeah speaking of uh speaking of tax right offs let's write off this message from our sponsor ag1 no one likes I'm just going to say everything is right what the what the am I even watching right now no one likes swallowing things that they don't find

what they are more merch messages all right hit me Dan wow professionals hello employees of Ivon Umbrella Corporation with more and more places asking for Biometrics to log in what happens when a database of fingerprints gets hacked do I need new fingers theoretically the biometric services that you're using assuming you're talking about your iPhone for example theoretically the way that it works is that the actual fingerprint itself is not stored on that third party server
it's just um just a value is Created from that fingerprint and then it ensures locally on your device that you are close enough and then it sends an authentication token that's like yes you biometrically authenticated and we made sure that you did that but you're not actually just shipping your fingerprint to anyone however there are exceptions to that for example I applied to renew my uh my Nexus card uh yesterday and you very much in a government database are storing your
actual biometric information so I I didn't scan my fingerprint into my computer when I when I signed up for it but that just reminded me that there are definitely places where there are gigantic Treasure troes of real biometric data yeah government acts are that brutal and they happen did you do the retina they have my retinas nice uh you get new eyes yeah that's easy I don't think I've done the retina scan that's for air travel with us uh Border Services I they definitely have facial ID for me and they
definitely have fingerprint for me but I don't think they have anything else man the number of countries that have my fingerprints is very unsettling if I ever decided to be a criminal I would have to be the kind that takes a takes a belt sander to the old meat Paws ouch yeah a thing though yeah a thing  already now Luke's mind contains my fingerprints too y or wear gloves look we don't have a policy on that says gold can we toofa your fingerprints please lus isn't allowed to show his you
got unlock your phone pads of his fingers to the camera anymore oh yeah there you go uh any updates on the UV reflective or blocking shirt you mentioned in the past it might be dead oh I'm very sorry so what happened was there was a bit of a miscommunication um we were not moving forward with the original supplier for it due to um things that were not our fault and while I love the sample shirt that I have we were we were not able to reach an agreement on moving forward
with the mass production run so we went in search of a new supplier for it and somewhere in there uh my requirements for the Garment were not fully communicated and we've got a new supplier and we've got a new fabric but while it has the UV blocking properties of the original Fabric and a very similar hand feel good stretch characteristics everything's fine what it doesn't have is the antimicrobial properties of the original garment which was part of what I loved so much about
it so I could just wear this thing to the beach go out swimming in the ocean not do anything just dry off and not stink and not be sunburned it is a flipping awesome garment however there are problems with antimicrobial clothing um construction techniques you can put an antimicrobial uh treatment on it but realistically that's going to wash off in 20 washes 30 at most if you're if you're lucky anything you see advertised as antimicrobial or in most cases waterproof it's just it's just a coating
and given that um man what was that like really good there's a lot of really like high Scotch Guard doesn't exist anymore not the way that it used to which is a good thing because of how many people like died um it's a whole thing it's a whole Rabbit Hole Scotch Guard as you know it on the Shelf today is not Scotch Guard yeah it was like birth defects and like a whole thing yeah the point is that these Coatings are they're they're they're nonsense they're not they're not
intrinsic to the materials so I don't feel comfortable advertising them so we could have done that but we're not going to do that now there are alternatives the thing that made the original garment antimicrobial was that it had uh bamboo component to the to the fabric itself uh but what our compliance um what our compliance person who I don't know if they're off probation or not and Tatiana our our materials Specialists have informed me of is that bamboo even though theoretically it's a super
renewable resource um H in most cases the production of fabrics using bamboo is extremely environmentally harmful unless they're in like a closed system that involves recapture of some kind of something or other and yes you know cotton is too but bamboo is apparently horrible bamboo Fabrics so um they basically presented that to me and we like so um you know it's your call and I was like no bamboo silver is an option but silver has recently been found because of the size of the particles to
have potential um detrimental health effects on the people who wear it so any silver in the fabric not an option now that we know what we know about it yeah I I um gilor in Philipine chat said my wife is a biochemist PhD and teaches researches the microbiome don't get antimicrobial stuff and as far as minor sing goes yeah that's like a thing cuz you're you have as like icky it as as it is you're covered in it all the time well I me and there's good stuff you want to kill the good stuff I
doubt that just from wearing a loose fitting garment it's not a shirt right it goes on top well is that right it's it's it was like a super light hoodie mhm so it was very loose fitting and with the amount of body hair that I and probably a lot of you have realistically it's not like it's killing everything on your skin it's more that it's more that whatever gets off of your skin onto it is not going to just Fester there right um so I'm not I'm not I'm not actually worried about that aspect of it but and
like I don't know I don't know yeah and people are saying it's almost like things harmful to microbes are also harmful to humans I'm not convinced that bamboo containing fabric is particularly harmful to humans I seriously doubt it but I um but yeah basically we're not we're not doing it uh Marino wool has strong anti microbial properties as well but is very expensive to the point where that garment would be like a $150 Sun hoodie and like come on what are we even people already hate we we make cool
Marino W things people like it's really expensive it's like yeah Marino is really expensive really expensive I don't especially when you like I don't make the rules do cool things with it because as far as m sing goes it's difficult to work with so like yeah if you try to make more complex better designs it gets more difficult and more expensive a pretty scary rate I've asked them if we can do it um yeah if if if we can if we can do it if we can find a source for a bamboo
based fabric that does the recapture thing or whatever I still I still want to do it but I um I think it's dead for now but hey positive side I've got mine already I mean it's a write off darn it that that is why we that is why we develop things sometimes because it's just a thing that I want epic next up next up I think we last one last one yeah uh Hey guys I've been loving my screwdriver have you guys noticed issues with ddr5 on and platforms compared to Intel I feel like
it's worse boot times on AMD oh I think you're talking about the memory training issues on am5 um I don't consider it to be a huge problem but the first time that you boot up an am5 system there can be a long and I mean long like sometimes minutes long memory training period where the system does not indicate in any meaningful way that it is doing anything and just sits there seeming like it's just on but not outputting anything and doing nothing and then suddenly Boop it works and then
every time you reboot after that it's quite a bit faster I'd love for them to make that better and smoother it would seem like a more you know mature refined experience if they did but I don't think it's the end of the world because I haven't found overall on a well optimized bios that subsequent boot times are really any are really any worse  opinion Dan oh you want you want a fourth merch message oh yeah sure hit us with one more okay um what does Luke think were the best and worst lonus lead
development ideas lonus led development ideas and can lonus guess what they are it's been a while I don't even remember we haven't done like first no matter what indisputable and if you disagree with me you're actually wrong one I know that one for sure what like doing float plane at all uh okay I didn't go that far but okay yeah I mean I'm I'm sure there were some terrible ideas on the Forum uh remember when we remember when we launched like a Half Baked um way of way of getting rid of old like
uh equipment like we we did like auctions on like live auctions on the Forum that was something live auctions yeah remember it was they were live they were after the L show I thought it was I thought we just announced it for sale though I didn't realize it was an auction remember we would sit there and we would like adjust the pricing we've done some stuff dude I know we've done some really weird stuff no live streaming the thing we're doing right now I really wish we didn't
go down this route um but look at the float plane people look how happy they are yeah okay but but we could them how happy you we could have had a chat some some love some love in the chat we could have had a chat that enables when the live stream is live on other platforms they would like it better like this I mean Luke it's just it's a tax right off so I think it is my husband is ignoring my phone call for your show please let Martin Wen know that his dinner's in the fridge Randy your
sticks oh man that's an old reference that is an old reference um yeah I don't know there's other stuff like that Mo most of it's like uh the the problem was that we were trying to make a verified actual gamer program that was lus LE development that was pretty cool pretty cool I think that's probably the best one in my opinion that one was pretty good I'm not against that I wish we could have gotten more for wasn't actually for Flo plane no that was entir FL plane actually had but they
didn't say float plane they just said best lus development ideas Fair yeah yeah yeah I really liked that that was a cool project and I I wish we got more use out of it but it wasn't a one-off it was four times I think more even no there was the text one there was the picture one yep the game the game was used multiple times and there was there was one where it was mixed of tech text and pictures so we did three before the game and then the game got at least the game got two or three plays I
don't remember how many I think two okay yeah it wasn't that many I do wish the game got more use I do wish that more GPU makers had actually yeah cared yeah about their gpus ending up in the hands of Gamers at a reasonable price I think it was pretty clear by the end of it that the whole thing was kind of lip service cuz it's not like we did that to make money we made very little money in fact by the time you factor in the development cost we probably lost money I I'm not going to say we lost money but
we we we also got some rmas there was a there was a bunch of development time okay we probably let's say if you also account for opportunity costs of that development time not just sure yeah then we definitely lost money but that's not losing money that's losing opportunity not making other money so you know I I try to be words mean what they mean I try to be careful  yeah what nothing go ahead say it nothing why don't we talk about our new CT scanner yeah what is this cool or what it's I
mean the images from it are sick oh this thing is so cool did anyone put any information about it did we even name them aren it you guys uh hold on a second  um Elijah's asking can I scan my head no it's x-rays you definitely I I think we should try that no I mean with the amount of times he's hit it it's probably just empty fascinating oh okay so hold on skull just this endless  brain okay so these are the guys that we're working with uh Luma field so we got the Neptune well it looks cool too
CT scanner yeah looks super cool basically uh what it does is it um at varying exposure times slash I'm not sure if the energy level actually varies but the exposure time definitely varies um it moves around an object blasts it with x-rays and spits out an extremely high fidelity 3D view of whatever object you put inside it so I believe the one we have is the uh Neptune x-ray vision for engineers yeah um from talking to Lucas from the lab who it seems has spent most of the time
with it so far uh the largest object we can do is about the size of a basketball so unfortunately it's not big enough for us to do something like a laptop but we could do something like a smartphone um do you have any issues with like magnetic stuff around it when it's going or is it the box that's not a problem apparently the exposure outside of the box is less than you would experience by quite a lot than just sitting on an airplane okay yeah yeah so it's it's no big deal um oh but that's
not the mag here we go so what you're saying is it's Elijah headside seriously no Dan nobody is saying that Elijah is saying  said okay nobody who is allowed to make those kinds of decisions is saying that there Mike D says I work at a university with a whole department dedicated to studying brain injuries send Elijah my way could we use that as a tax write off no they could what no that's not how any of this works we'll hire a media consultant a video we'll have them make a video it' be
advertising I hate you guys we're going to be in the green for once we can afford new microscopes  we're doing business the funny thing is you guys are meing a lot of other people in the comments are going to be meing because they know how much I get triggered by this kind of tax right off but a significant number after I did the Spiel like a significant amount of the comment section is still people who completely do not they don't it's like they don't want to understand one of the
things is that I think you you are operating above board but a lot of people aren't uh and there's like this whole thing going on right now where like the IRS was partially defunded in the states we don't live in the States but the RS was partially defunded in the states and apparently a bunch of people were getting away with like improperly doing tons of tax writeoffs but maybe they're going after them now or something or whatever I don't know sure um let me put it this way I am not a
small enough fish that I could possibly hope to get away with that our companies have been audited all of them multiple times in the time we've been running them and if we had if we had anything even approaching the egregiousness of trying to write off a home renovation I would get like six ways sideways every bad way the CRA does not around yeah it's a little different so it's a it's a little different cuz like I've I've heard stories from other people in the industry and other people doing business
stuff in general that are like pretty crazy in regards to how they deal with taxes and writeoffs and all this other type of stuff it's all Americans in my experience I think I think their whole tax code being so insanely complicated kind of works both ways there's like no way to do it right so they can screw you over no matter what but also there's no way to do it right so people are just going to do a lot of stuff wrong anyways so like I I don't know I think it's bad on both ends
pretty much but I mean I don't know because I don't have to deal with them oh man I'm so annoyed Dan yeah confirmed we have to use that one app um we cannot use a different one and that's very very annoying yeah look what seriously this is new I think so sorry where did this whole can we deal with this on M conversation even start uh cuz I was logging into my work account before the show and it told me I have one more warning before I must use this and then I used up my one which work account well this
one uh the maker of this  yeah yeah so this so I'm can I type can we yeah I mean we'll talk about we can do with this Monday but okay so is there is there no other option for the app for this uh no well that's stupid yeah and I'm very unhappy about it I have to have an entirely separate app just for this one stupid login okay hate app blo I don't like extra apps I think I kind of like this  I don't know if I can right now but I think I kind of like this I'm interested we'll talk later
well I think you know which side of this battle I want to win right and there's reasons why this one is currently winning but I don't want that one to win I want the other one to win yeah so stuff like this is great for me cuz my team's losing and after all that I don't have access to the SharePoint share that Lucas sent to me why do you why is it on SharePoint I don't know I'm just trying to click a link in the dock Luke it's not supposed to be SharePoint computers it took me
this long to click a link in the dock he's supposed to be using Google Drive okay well is somebody using SharePoint yeah do I have to break fingers yeah oh my God actually like you should make a note for Monday I don't even have a I don't even have it there was a prompt to request access to it and I'm not getting a prompt anymore that's cuz it's SharePoint I'm not even getting a prompt I am so upset right now I'm sending a scheduled message to this person and um it's just all capitals I'm coming for
your fingers no you can't no you can't do that I will ask Ariana to tell me where they live and just go there after wano you guys can't do that I don't even think you can joke about that I think the gas for that trip is a tax right off there you go I'll use the company car and then the overtime well the thing is that you will have one less employee to pay so I'm like I'm like saving your money it'll be two yeah cuz I'll be in jail double tax right up that's not a tax rate off oh yeah that's just being
business savvy and saving your money yeah which might be a tax rate off if you think about it anyway uh I can't show you the scan of the Mouse because it is in SharePoint and I don't have access to it but this is the inside of that promotional dbrand Rubik's Cube how cool is that so you're seeing like the uh uh the magnets for aligning it or something like that and then you're seeing the internal gear mechanism for rotating it around H Luke Rubik's Cube oh yeah that picture is sick really like that one
super cool uh here we go here we go here's a noctua Edition LTD screwdriver on an overnight so this is a 12-hour scan the longer you go uh the more detail you can get so here it is pretty sick and there's there's things that we can refine there's things that we can fine-tune uh one of the things that we agreed to was that for the first 3 months uh anything that we're going to publish in a video we would send it to them to make sure that like everything was set correctly because this is a this is a real tool
it's a professional tool you can there's a lot of parameters that you can adjust but oh my gosh how cool is that that's it that's the ratchet mechanism there's the bit storage that's pretty sweet absolutely love it uh oh my God ah I mean dang it um uh maybe hold on I really want to show you guys uh okay I hate this but I'm downloading a file from teams then I'm going to have to upload it to drive then I'm going to have to open it on there because I'm not logged into teams on this for what are
probably fairly obvious reasons what if you just have them send it to that email at this point I can email it to myself faster than I can have someone else send me the stupid thing so I'm just going to do it myself sounds good um Okay I hold on I now I got to reply love coordinating stuff like this on the yes thanks okay uh anyway that's the internals oh here's a metal 3D printed key cap scanned for 80 minutes pretty cool as well guys how freaking cool is this and it's grain in there it's apparently
super accurate like super accurate like to within 0.1 somethings I can't remember what they are but they're small um really excited about this man the options are endless and what would you guys like to see us use it for oh my God we're not doing tax write off shirts could you tax write off the shirt What If you hired a consultant to  design I mean yeah we can write that off very  business we're going to be a business Factory together will become a real company is this what my mom always says
get a real job can we have is this a real job now can we talk about the cool CT scanner now okay can we talk can we talk about the cool Luma field CT scanner that is really cool what's what's your favorite thing they're letting us use that what what's your favorite thing you scanned um like is Rubik Cube your your favorite one so far well I don't know it might be the mouse but I haven't seen it yet did you write off the Rubik's Cube no that's what are you even talking about
you're not even trying to make it kind of make sense anymore what do you mean it's a it's a prop it's prop it was probably on one of the shelves in one of the backgrounds of one of the videos I'm I'm suspecting someone didn't bring the Rubik's Cube from home look I'm going be honest with you here the Rubik's Cube I I I didn't pay for it at all dbrand sent it and it doesn't even no offense dbrand but it's worthless we I I don't think we declared it I don't even know where it is I I
don't I don't care I don't care about that Rubik's Cube I don't bother to build the company when we use my house as a location it's not it doesn't it doesn't register Luke I don't care about the Rubik's Cube I hate you guys so much the screwdriver though screwdriver looks really cool it does actually the the whatever how 12-hour scan one is pretty wicked yeah uh okay how it picked up the knurling and stuff is pretty cool okay here it is here's Mouse one. MP4 finally flipping so wait what's
happening on the right right now not sure let me move you guys sounds like something a big nerd would know oh it's moving it's moving yeah it's like going through it so the the left is like the final image and the right is I think so how it's like building the the slices yeah freaking cool man that's pretty wild freaking cool where are the okay I see at the bottom there that makes sense so we can like we can see the internal Trace layout of a PCB potentially not on anything super complex in all likelihood
but on something relatively simple like a mouse yeah so the switches are so small small small boys or as I call them L of siiz boys uh okay what are we supposed to be talking about now Samsung Samsung Samsung Samsung okay they doing some of the coolest display development right now Quantum do OLED technology is amazing we did a sponsored video for them around the time of CES for Samsung display which by the way is not the same thing as Samsung Electronics so we worked with Samsung
display we hung out with those guys a little bit at CES I shouldn't say hung out we went to their Booth we went to their booth at CES um I I I genuinely like I would have been happy to make that video without a sponsorship check I don't even care I love this Tech it's so cool cue OLED amazing Samsung Electronics what are you doing bud they announced their upcoming OLED TV lineup but for unknown reasons the company has apparently chosen not to State whether a given television uses a
Quantum do OLED panel the kind that Samsung display makes or a w OLED panel the kind that LG display makes while all of Samsung's high-end s95 C TVs will be QD OLED its mid-range s90d series will apparently be sometimes QD OED and sometimes wed Samsung has previously heavily advocated for Quantum dots both for color period and for avoiding Burnin which appear to be very legitimate advantages of their technology but according to Korean media Outlet the elect Samsung has decided not
to explicitly advertise their TVs as QD OLED due to a request from LG display not to position white OLED as inferior to QD OLED what the actual is going on I put this in as a topic because I get so flipping upset every time a brand obfuscates the underlying technology of what's being used with a deceptive naming scheme and we've seen this time and time again remember when um okay very recently AMD not very recently on an ongoing basis AMD has created a different um numbering scheme for their mobile
processors compared to their desktop processors so that you can't compare across generations and know what exact um so sorry excuse me so you can't look at both of them and know what generation of Zen architecture they're using even though traditionally the model number has gone up to correspond with a move from Zen to Zen plus to Zen 2 to Zen 3 to zen4 and I'm trying to think of some other really good examples of this I mean Nvidia some gpus where you might get uh one architecture you might get
another one and the performance characteristics can be different across them uh we've seen from um man I'm trying to I'm trying to think now I'm pretty sure Intel has pulled this nonsense at some point or another where at the low end they were using uh like a previous architecture even though it had the same like family name uh in The Branding like the same generational branding and I just it drives me absolutely crazy because I I don't have to I like I don't imagine right I don't imagine for a
second that when I buy the low-end product I'm getting exactly the same thing as the high-end one I mean sure if I buy the you know whatever 90 instead of the 95 I might be getting lower-end processing I might not be getting as many uh HDMI inputs uh I it might not be available with the same degree of anti-glare coding technology or whatever ever but if I'm buying this generation of product my expectation is that I'm getting the low-end version of that not that I'm getting a completely fuing
different thing and I don't think that that's an unfair expectation I think  expectation yeah that's all I have to say about that yeah discussion question is if customers are getting an equally good product does it matter that they don't know or understand the difference between two products that are being sold is the same thing that's the thing they are getting an also good product wed has advantages when we're talking pure brightness okay W OLED can achieve higher highs especially on white and you
know what a lot of your specular highlights a lot of your pinpoint stars or you know whatever A lot of the things that are really bright in the scene happen to be white and so they can achieve really fire like the really bright points of it might be white they can achieve really amazing performance in HDR which is how we're evaluating the latest generation of displays because they're all going to do a great job of SDR anyway so we want to see how well they do in HDR also LG's own TV so again
LG display LG Electronics not the same thing but LG Electronics displays as we saw when we checked out that Flander scientific display can do a great job even though they have a you know inferior panel technology when it comes to color brightness cuz that's the thing that CUA does so well is when you're talking about the brightest possible representation of a Pure Color QD OLED is superior to W OLED because it's not washed out by that white sub pixel when it's trying to achieve that level of
brightness it red is just the red subpixel going full more baby not red with some some a little bit of white in there just sneak a little bit of white in there trying to mix things and so it's not about Superior or inferior even necessarily it's about understanding what the I'm buying and my understanding when I was buying a Samsung TV was I was getting if it was OLED I was getting cue OLED and Samsung has marketed it really heavily so for for them to do this about face so that
they can you know not make their W Leed panel based TVs look too bad is really frustrating like by all means have wed panels but just tell me that's what it is and Market it as such because they're not the same thing creating confusion so that it B it basically amounts to creating confusion it's intentional it's not like this is accidental oopsy day like at this point why did you even make white OLED well because LG display if they stop running the Fabs is basically like LA hooped and
so if I had to guess I would say it's because LG display needs to sell panels Samsung Electronics moves a lot of TVs and so they've done a deal to move LG panels and as part of that business Arrangement this this kind of makes sense it's a combination of of what's being reported here which is that LG has asked hey respectfully if you're going to buy our product don't take a biging dump on it in your marketing right so part of it is that and another part of it is that from Samsung
electronics's standpoint there sitting here going hm well if we just Market everything OLED as OLED and we're getting a deal from uh life's desperate over there hey LG has spent the last eight years hyping OLED why don't we just stop talking about the differences in the different kinds of OLED and we can take these discount OLED panels position them you know right alongside ours charge a premium price for the display and thing no one's the wiser so there's so Samsung Electronics has their own incentive for
not positioning QD OLED as that much better than wed because you got to understand Samsung display Samsung Electronics yes they are definitely related and they definitely you know co- benefit each other but Samsung Electronics has to buy panels from Samsung display and it's in their best interest to take as much of the margin of that finished prodct away from Samsung display and into Samsung Electronics because that makes them look good M and they don't ultimately care
nearly as much about how Samsung display looks so if they can use LG display to put pressure on Samsung display so that they can get better deals across the board they're going to do that regardless of whether LG Pye asks them not to make wed look bad so it's a whole complicated Dynamic at play here but at the end of the day it's all about making money and none of it is about helping consumers understand what the  like there and none of this is a tax write-off stop although there are plenty
of tax incentives and tax writeoffs in the operation of their businesses I'm sure I'm sure lots yeah I mean especially in South Korea like the whole you know the government and the big companies things well it's something it sure is speaking of something Microsoft suddenly drops Windows 11's Android app support on March 5th Microsoft unexpectedly announced that next year it would be ending support of the uh Windows subsystem for Android which allows Android apps to be used on
Windows 11 the next day the windows subsystem was no longer available for download the feature debuted in 2022 but it always lacked formal access to the Google Play store which was the whole issue to be clear meaning that users typically relied on the Amazon App Store uh while Microsoft has not stated the reason for the decision it's broadly expected to be a result of low usage levels particularly due to Microsoft no longer producing consumer focused tablets discussion question is Microsoft
right to drop this feature or should they simply have invested more into making it popular uh I have an alternative weird Theory uh which is that they might be trying to get their own uh Android App Store going but actually now that I think about it that's a bad Theory so I take it back um I think it's just low usage um supporting features that no one sucks or no one uses sucks uh you have devs working on this thing and and a lot of developers want to work on something that people actually use um so you you
might have like a literal morale issue if you get people to focus on using this or maintaining this thing that people don't utilize anyways um and that sucks and then just like why are you wasting your time supporting this thing that is mostly supporting Amazon anyways um and no one's using I just couldn't find a real reason to use it we wanted to make a video about it I was either earlier this year or sometime last year if it had access to the Google Play Store it would be
sick but it shouldn't matter anyway  anyway not everything has those available um every time I've looked for one I've been able to find one but like I'm not are you sure it's not something I've done often yeah there's just like APK repository sites and some of them seem but not advice uh some of them have seemed reasonably trustworthy and I've downloaded things from them and not had any problems yeah I don't know if most people want to do that though like I think your install base of people doing 
fair yeah I just I just couldn't find I couldn't find any reason to use it compared to apps that are read available on Windows already or phone link yeah that too someone mentioned that in FL play chat I didn't think of that myself but it's a it's a good argument I just I don't know anyone that uses it if if it had access to Google Play Store I would probably use it um but I don't want to use the Amazon store that's a whole different Rabbit Hole though um speaking of things being
disabled Roku disables TVs until users accept new terms involving forced arbitration and worse what the heck this week many users found themselves unable to access the Roku TVs unless they accepted new dispute resolution terms roku's terms have had a forced arbitration clause for some time but the company quietly changed its terms as of February the 20th to require a further step of informal dispute resolution where anyone with a legal complaint must first call and discuss the issue with
roku's lawyers even before seeking formal arbitration users will likely only have a narrow window of time to opt out of the new terms which Roku requires to be  mail huh uh discussion question is how much does intentional inconvenience prevent people from exercising their rights how can you in my the TV in my opinion this is just waiting for a challenge this is just waiting for a class action I hope they get dunked on this is crazy they're basically they're basically going up you know at a at a at a
baseball game you know they're they're in the crowd they're they're they're pulling down their trousers you know they're they're calling they're calling the pitcher's name and they're pulling down their pants they're turning around they're going take a shot come on I think they're going to get 100 mph  butt where is that from is that from something do you just make that up I mean it's from you know baseball you just I'm sure someone's pulled down their pants at a baseball game
once do you just do you just think of these things while you go get snacks look a bird got killed by Randy Johnson there's no way no one's ever pulled down their pants at a baseball game those things being related is amazing I just no I just mean that the odds the odds are love that that you know I you know planes kill birds all the time yeah there's probably someone who has pants themselves in the middle of an aisle on a plane it's probably happened yeah exactly yeah it
to makes sense it totally makes sense you've seen that clip of Randy Johnson hitting the bird right kind of crazy incredible I thought it was fake like for years I'm like oh no that like actually happened that's unbelievable  wild there is baseball in Canada it just sucks it's called basketball up here  basketball man that's the kind of movie that I would not want to go back and rewatch as not uh you know 14-year-old yeah it's probably terrible probably doesn't hold up that well
yeah I remember it fondly but uh me too and everything I remember I will not go back and watch it yeah is probably it would not convince me to rewatch it yeah yeah I mean hey it's one of those ones where there's a big difference between what professional film critics thought and what the audience thought I often like those movies yeah what just happened what even is this website yep that's uh I mean that tells you everything you need to know yeah the fact that he's holding two of those and
where he's holding them yep yep anyway yep nice nice H okay what are we supposed to be talking about Nikon buys Red yeah I know Red digital cinema what see you later acquired by Nikon is this a good thing do we like this I I think we just don't care I think no one really cares about red anymore and so yeah it's one of those things that's sort of noteworthy because it's like oh yeah I remember red you know when they were making waves and big films we're using RED cameras and
then like prominent online creators were like cool you know RED cameras how many a how many KS how many KS can you make and then team crispy red just didn't do anything for a long time and completely faded from relevance remember the red phone I know right completely faded from relevance and I just kind of forgot they existed like Sony is complet eaten the sort of low-end filmmaker space uh Ari never really seems to have regarded red as anything other than a minor inconvenience
um who else exists exactly by the way Mike D pH said July 16th 1990 Steve Lions of the Chicago White Socks pulled down his pants after making it to first base he's lucky he didn't get a a  know oh man oh come on black magic I think black magic is more interested in the ecosystem than cameras these days yeah and like doing like their green screen stuff is so cool yeah that was an acquisition the the one that we have upstairs that's so cool so cool my goodness that's cool yeah Hardware
accelerated baby although I got to imagine the next level of that is going to be AI accelerated and it's going to absolutely blow your brain stem away yeah probably Canon apparently does Cinema cameras too oh all right shows you what I know imagine just being able to the show literally shot on c200s I totally forgot about them they the Sony's killing it man what cameras can we put somewhere not feel sad about um uh I have a c00 yeah that's not great those were we used those for a while
yeah uh um Linux hits an all-time high according to research firm star counter Linux has reached a historic 4.03% of desktop os's worldwide don't crap on that 4% is a freaking lot oh it's it's more than ever a lot of desktops yeah uh not including Chrome OS by the way which I thought that was it when I first read this I was like it's Chrome OS no Chrome OS accounts for another 2.31% Linux also shows strong upward momentum having only passed 3% of global market share in June of
2023 that's actually massive momentum that's crazy much of the recent growth in Linux comes from adoption overseas such as in India where Linux is the second most popular desktop OS after windows with over 15% market share in comparison Linux has a 3.85% desktop share in the US wow pretty cool wow 15% it's huge now what I'd like to know and I I don't know if this is addressed in any of the coverage ARS Technica did a good article about it um I don't know if this is addressed in any of the
coverage but what I would like to know is are they counting something like a steam deck yeah there's a note here asking essentially the same thing I suspect they would be they might be but because apparently the dat collected from web traffic so I think it would be so then it's also possible that steam decks would be massively undercounted because the steam deck is first and foremost a game console it's a it's a console everything about it is designed to be a console to the greatest degree that
valve was able to achieve that from the instant wake to the uh Power optimization it it's it's yeah you can plug it into a doc you put a keyboard mouse a lot of people aren't going to do that they're just going to they're just going to game they're just going to do nothing but run Steam and and game and they're not going to visit they're not going to browse the web with it um so in my mind this number is probably underrepresented now you could make the same Arguments for other operating
systems uh you know oh well on this kind of you on POS terminals that run Windows of which there are millions worldwide you know they don't browse the web on those sure sure sure fine enough that's fair enough but given how small the Linux number is and given how many steam decks I suspect that valve is selling I think I think it would be a significant impact compared to windows at the same time I think it might actually be the other way around because this is arguing desktop os's so if that's the case then
steam deck involvement at all I think is almost cheating no because desktop OS includes laptops they can't tell the difference so if you're going to include one mobile device you got to include a different mobile device I don't know I don't consider the Ste I consider the steam deck a computer I know I just said it's a console but I also argue that the PS5 is a computer so I'm standing behind switch a computer no it's yes but it doesn't have any kind of general purpose utility steam deck
does steam does it's a computer yeah I think that's probably fair enough I'm trying to pick it apart but I think it's fair like I I like I I it's on the edge we made a very similar argument once the once the um switch is basically a cal once you could once you could put the Xbox in Dev mode and install you know emulators on it and a browser and whatever it's okay it's it's just a computer now yeah like if you plug the right things into it you can literally run uh Jaden used a steam
deck as his development computer at work for a while cuz we didn't have a PC for him so it was temporary and he actually kind of liked it and it worked fine so like yeah I think the argument's fine it's exciting yeah it's cool it's good is it time again no not yet I wonder Ste be too early valve where is Steam OS yeah come on man let us run another computer especially with um all these like hyperinvasive anti-cheats which are like the only way forward because there's a unprecedented insane
amount of people cheating in multiplayer games right now um I like would we're talking about how the console's dying I think gaming device is going to be a thing though so I think you like might legitimately not want to do all the things you do on a computer on your gaming computer if you're playing a bunch of games that have these hyper invasive kernel level anti cheats so like there's some idea there P software has opinions on Colonel level anti-che  know man how do we fix cheating in games 
now you can't fix it at an OS level you can't fix it at a game level you can't fix it can't fix it at a driver level you just can't fix it ban video games can you fix it at a hardware level in my opinion you have to fix it and you still won't be able to fix it you have to try to alleviate it this is this is why I push so hard with tarov which they're never going to do it um but this is why I push so hard for them to have the replay system yeah um because like people used to love love
love love the uh whatever it was called system OverWatch watch system for Counterstrike where reported users would go into this OverWatch queue and users in good standing could review the OverWatch queue and then like basically vote on what they thought it was and they would show it to a bunch of different people to get like a vote on if this person was cheating or not um people liked it so much that Counter-Strike creators would just stream themselves going through the OverWatch queue because it was
interesting um and I I actually think it helped very significantly because they're never going to be able to detect everything it's just not going to happen tell me this if a game developer was willing to  it so by support for it I mean locked off servers where only people who have this device can participate would you buy a device that is essentially a camera and a piece of software that monitors the screen that uses Machine Vision to track your actions on your peripherals and track hold on hold on
just I'm wait I'm waiting locally locally tracks what's happening on your peripherals and locally tracks what's happening on your screen and ensures that they correspond it's not enough why not in tarov people cheat this one's very debatable how much it's use but a lot of people think it's a lot and like if you remember goat's video he was only detecting people that were doing this style of cheating where it's a cheat that's on your screen they can see through walls they can see
wireframes through walls all that type of stuff there's another form of cheating and this form of cheating is in multiple games where you have an external computer so you have a yeah what is it dma device direct memory access device you go to an external computer and then you can see people on the other comp computer so you're talking about your own screen some people cheat within a completely external screen no that's true but yeah I guess that wouldn't help because then everything would still
correspond and unless it's watching your eyes Okay so next eye tracking is next level now you're not allowed looking at a spare monitor though um well you're not allowed to basically you would still be able to do some stuff like you'd be able to stop moving look at something else MIM that you're doing something no you wouldn't because you're just looking at something else you you'd be able to take your mouse off your your hand off your mouse and pretend you're looking at
your phone over here for a little bit and then you'd be able to go back to your thing but that would put you at a significant competitive disadvantage in a lot of games if you if you actually so you okay so it theoretically remember guys this is a theoretical product so theoretically it is a device that has a camera that monitors your hand movements an eye tracker that monitors your eye movements and then a piece of software that it's tied into it or better yet not software a third camera that monitors
the screen and ensures that everything is synced and how does this work it like reports an everything okay signal basically it's it's an every everything's fine alarm all the time and it so it'll ping it'll ping the multiplayer server saying everything's okay everything's okay everything's okay and then if any if it ever stops then  if it worked let's say it's I'm going to hold on let's do stage this hold on it's just it's it's what I've described so far would you consider buying it if there
was a big enough ecosystem that you knew that in a game you like to play other people would be using it and you could play on a cheat free server it sounds so susceptible to a massive honey pot ignore that let's say it worked uh and like wasn't the giant honey pot for people to come everything was essentially locally stored other than the everything's okay alarm yeah people get um yeah probably to be honest and I just cover up the cameras when I wasn't playing well let's talk about the
pricing oh I mean that doesn't whoa hello buddy um that doesn't sound cheap no let's say it's $300 does it work in multiple games it works in any game where the developer implements support and has cheat free like like cheat eye or whatever you want to call it so can we assume this is like not 100% but pretty ubiquitous uh it's not ubiquitous no it's supported in a handful of games but one or two of them happen to be ones that you like to play I would consider it depending on
the games 300 bucks I would consider it depending on the games let's say it was supported in tarov yeah you would you play would you play uh whatever not raids not extractions whatever they're called instances raids sure would you play raids with this device and this device alone if it was available and  it I think I think you'd have to be in lobbies only with other people using it well yeah you would so you you'd have exclusive and I think there's like I said the external monitor thing is still 
um I don't know it's not a guarantee because the external monitor thing cuz there's there's we really have no idea what percentage of people are using that yep um that's fair we know it's a lot we know it's like actually a huge amount of people uh because there's a weird thing where that's the easiest way to cheat with your friends as well because it's the least suspicious to the other people that you're playing with right um if if if it could get around that yeah I think I would
because I to me be completely honest to me like firstperson shooter style competitive games right now are actually just ruined I don't think any of them is okay I don't even think that's a controversial take so someone told me like oh but there's no cheating inv valerant they have the colel level antiche and it's like like bro YouTube it they're everywhere like maybe it helps them maybe but ultimately this is a this is a like back in fourth that will go forever okay so here's
one Elijah uh said something else but it made me think of something different yeah good job alijah um you're doing great it's a Val it's a valuable it's a valuable skill knowing that there's going to be knowing that there's going to be a cost in terms of latency right you're going to probably it'll cost you a frame of latency let's say 15 milliseconds would you play a competitive shooter from a cloudstream service if you knew that every other client connected was also using the same
cloudstream service and the whole thing was running locally so they could monitor what absolutely everyone is doing so nothing goes in nothing goes out other than mouse and keyboard inputs  data would that be more fun these days if everyone's doing it I think so if everyone on it the the biggest thing is not it's not getting owned cuz like you know I'm getting older I'm getting a little bit slower I'm not as good at FPS games as I used to be also don't play them as much like it's just not that's
fine I'm going to lose um it's it's having a very legitimized theory that the person that just beat you might be cheating yeah and like in that seat of doubt it just ruins the whole thing and like in tarov they added a thing where you can view people's profiles after they kill you and it's like like oh cool this guy has a 75% extraction rate probably just died to a cheater go into the next game this guy has 17 KD that is definitely possible there are people that are definitely legit that
definitely have KDs better than that that dude's probably not one of them right like I don't know um and it just sucks time to Break Out World of Tanks let's see let's see world of of tanks cheats cheats are World of Tanks World of Tanks banned thousands of cheaters in February how to cheat in World of Tanks the legal aim cheat World of Tanks  about all right multiplayer competitive games are covered in cheaters right now it's actually crazy it's mostly in like games that involve projectiles so I was going
to say firstperson shooter but I don't know if you divers has a problem does it in a PVE like multiplayer game people suck teamwork yeah if you if you're cheating in Hell  citizen wow that is not very Democratic of you not declared not a citizen got him not not patriotic at all service guarantees citizenship you belong to the bugs uh all right are there any other topics that we really need to hit here uh European new car Assessment program has declared that all cars need physical
controls like buttons switches and dials for important features like turn signals windshield wipers horns Hazard warning lights and any built-in SOS features I mean that should have been Common Sense before but hey thanks Tesla personally I support that a lot yep and uh Oregon passed a right to repair law that apple is not a fan of um basically they're going after uh locking components like serializing components and locking them to a particular device uh Google has been
vocally in support of the bill but Apple has expressed concern saying that the Bill's language around Parts pairing could force them to allow thirdparty biometric sensors to work in our devices without any form of authentication which could lead to unauthorized access to an individual's personal data uh to the detriment of customers everywhere because they do not have the ability to restrict such Provisions regionally um yeah yeah you're going to have to just figure it out Apple which know you can
so just do it because you did it before so just do it like that um yeah the bill covers all consumer electronics but excludes Motor Vehicles farming equip really medical devices HVAC systems why HVAC systems game consoles why solar panels and electric toothbrushes so right to repair doesn't is what is this the Oral B Lobby like what's going on yeah why can't why can't you do that like Colgate owns what's what's going to happen if you fix your your own toothbrush what do you what risk is this
your your teeth data is going to be you know it's a medical device I don't know unbelievable all right I think it's time for Wow after dark all right now fine I'll do it yeah now do you guys want to read your own merch messages and then I go upstairs and prepare things so that we can have a faster switch over yeah I can suppos to be 8% 8% I can be Dan uh what am I doing when after  luck he's lias is also leaving uh I'm just gonna I'm just going to take one of these that I can answer
um I clicked the broadcast did that do the thing I think so um hello dll is using macros for gaming cheating such as entering a key combination enabling a strategy in Hell divers uh as much as I just roasted people for Cheating in Hell  um it's a PVE game so like I don't really care I really really don't think that you should do it because that's part of the game and like failing the key input is part of the game so I think you're robbing yourself of the experience but it's a PV e game so like I don't care
personally but that's also not very Democratic and you're not a patriot got him yeah all right should we do some merch messages yeah I just did one oh good job hi dlll is oh that's one I did last year I installed solar on my house says Andrew Q with an EV uh was close to Net Zero electricity Linus do you monitor your solar if so how has your electricity usage been with an e and many electronics I actually do monitor my solar occasionally uh to give you some idea of how often it is I forget
what the app is called but I do have it I just need to find it it's not very good in the winter because we don't get a lot of sun here in Canada which is why the ROI point for solar in or in Canada there are some parts of Canada that gets Sun but in Van couver we definitely don't get enough to make it make a ton of sense uh but in the summer in the summer it's not bad dang it I forget what it's called it's one of those stupid apps where the name it's it's not you know solar or you
know energy app or anything like that it just has some random stupid name and I have to remember exactly what it is like okay okay my pool for example the app for my pool uh instead of being called aqual link is called I Aqua link so when I'm going through all the apps I don't really use all that often I have to remember right right the pool starts with an i for some reason that I can't possibly imagine what it would be other than apparently you can rename apps no way I had no idea okay I had no idea and
that is super cool when Bingo chroni said remind lonus he can rename apps in  drawer I don't know how to do that I don't see an obvious way to do that app details in store how do you do that um select item okay I select it depends on your launcher oh okay well I don't have a custom launcher I cannot find this I'm sorry this is very embarrassing on the app should bring up an edit button yeah so you probably don't yeah it doesn't I don't have that um well I give up fake news
stop if I find it I'll let you guys know in the meantime we might have to move on to the other one but basically on my best days uh I'm about neutral and most days I I'm not I'm still I'm still paying for electricity very much very  so this is driving me absolutely Bonkers right now the fact that I cannot find this oh it's probably not on here I probably had it on my fold I think I probably just haven't bothered to install it on here cuz it doesn't matter that much oh you know what I think home
assistant has the tracking for it as well I will double check okay home assistant let's go energy let's go yes okay so today the total was um wow that's it 6.1 kilowatt hours from my Sol a with meaning I drew over a 100 kilowatt hours from the grid nice however I could pick a summer day uh let's go back to last summer so I don't know uh arbitrarily August 23rd here we go so on that day um oh wow when I said that I was even on Sundays that was a big lie because it was 27.7 from the solar but still over 100
from the grid I have no idea what was going on that day occasionally I I see big spikes where it's obvious that I was like charging my car uh like here's one where I get home after work and the blue is yeah I'm very much charging my car um yeah yep it makes a small difference not much okay here we go what's next oh right Dan's not here uh yeah do you want me to read them out uh it's up to you no right now I'm curating potentials yeah why don't you do that and I'll I'll read them out we
got we got this how did we ever do this by just ourselves I don't I think I read them out I don't remember we didn't have merch messages before we had a producer I just mean how did we do the w show before yeah but I don't think the producer originally did it really yeah oh I don't know uh Anonymous asks how's teren Chrome PC office coming along and sorry for not suggesting it uh we I to my knowledge we haven't really made any progress because I think we were trying to Source a really some really wild
stuff for it and we expect that to take a little while uh Victor asks can we sponsor Luke to gush about games on air I mean given how much he mostly hates games hates games I hate games I mean you seem to hate a lot of them B Skate 3 is pretty good got him let's go so if your name is larryan Studios then z um no I mean I I gush about games all the time I hell divers is fantastic Ballers Gate 3 is really good balatro came out of nowhere uh as a slay the Spire hyper nerd that game is a
awesome very excited about that games have been pretty good for quite a while now I feel like we're out of the slump this is kind of what I was talking about I feel like the old big companies honestly people just kind of ignore them now like Assassin's Creed Mirage came out you didn't hear people hate on it you also didn't hear people like it a lot just nobody cared even CF thieves was in the news for like two days see if these lasted a little bit three days then yeah I saw as Summit like
single-handedly kept that game relevant for a decent amount like one twitch streamer was like able I'm seriously though because twitch streamers can kind of do that they can like drag a game on but other than Summit like people didn't really seem to care um yeah but to talk about another pirate game I don't even remember the name of it right now the one Ubisoft just released the quadruple a game uh it's Colin bones there there we go people were like including myself like
sorry I meant Skull and Bones I totally fled that yeah Skull and Bones so yes I completely agree that not St thieves th stayed relevant for kind of that was for a while yeah I meant Skull and Bones yep skull and B yeah it was it was like three days in my newsfeed and then it was gone completely gone uninteresting and before like you know Halo 5 comes out and people are mad for like months yeah yeah Halo infinite people are still mad mad for a long time but I think people are getting to the point where
they're just like whatever shut up different now all these new companies are stepping up making really good games some Indies are coming out and just killing it battle bit was a huge success batro is a huge success uh Dave the diver massive success there's other ones that I'm forgetting right now but they've been killing it bers Gate 3 killed it hell divers killed it uh Elden ring massive amazing now po World insane games are just like over and over and over again breaking player limits on
Steam breaking sales limits on steam it just things are actually very good right now and I think it's largely Studios that are not in the original big grouping are releasing bangers and players are more willing to buy games that aren't just from like these original big companies the funny thing for me is even that some of the big traditional players are doing great like when Sony announced those layoffs they also announced like record profits in certain areas though if I remember correctly the layoffs that
happened were with a studio that did not have record profits um I think that was the for I think it's fores spoken that's the name of the game did not do very well as far as my understanding goes um and I think they laid off like that studio um or disperse them within the I don't necessarily know what happened um what is your take on City skylines 2 uh it's not really so much my game my type of game but the city skylines fans are really hardcore I I'm assuming they like
it but I don't know they're pretty mad oh okay the game's super demanding and in a lot of ways it doesn't live up to the full experience of the previous game because it had like 10 years of modding this is a rough point of those types of games and if you're a fan of that type of game you sort of just have to get used to it this is a thing with Civ when a brand new Civ game comes out it's probably not as good as the last one but then they'll release a couple expansions and then it's like really sick like the
next ano games in trouble because an 1800 is outstanding and it got like six seasons of DLC or something like that which compellingly added to the game very good DLC not just cosmetic crap or whatever you want cuz it's great that like dramatically improves the game uh like the the first expansion the new world is awesome amazing it's a whole new world the whole new world to the Arctic expansion is sick the uh whatever that jungle kind of one is is great um and so ano whatever is coming next it it's
going to suck by comparison yeah for probably a while I like playing snowrunner with my dad uh they're releasing a game called Expeditions a mudrunner game and like yeah it's probably not going to be very good for like a while and that's okay cuz it'll get there I I believe it'll be all right Civ 5 greater than Civ 6 I also believe this but I think that's a preference thing I think you and I we probably don't like the districts that's the only reason why I don't like C6 is I'm not so
into the districts but I also know people that love civ6 so it is what it is yeah and it's one of those things where everything we're saying is kind of a generalization like there there are going to be preferred entries in a series absolutely but we just mean in general when you follow up something that had many years of bug fixes and optimization and and in some cases mods extra content content you can't like GTA 6 man no matter how good that game is the online experience is going to be it will not
live up to GTA 5 online or GTA online I guess they call it but you you know what I mean the online experience that that GTA 5 ultimately morphed into that is far beyond what I certainly I expected pit boy saying give us a little Feeder on the Starfield review vid this is it actually the Starfield review vid I'm going to talk about field almost not at all the that's a closed book The Game's garbage um got him what I'm going to be talking about is is this stuff um is the industry is moving and as much as I'm
going to sit here and mourn the the loss of some of my like Favorite Things um like I do not expect the next Elder Scrolls game will be like worth playing at all which sucks that's bold but unless they make dramatic changes in that Studio it's not going to happen like I I don't know um but there's sick games coming out that are really fun I'm having a great time playing new stuff my my era of like I played mowind I went back and played the games before mowind I played Oblivion all like this
oh my God all of these things are amazing and I can just like guarantee that the next one coming out is going to be sick that's kind of over but that doesn't mean that good games are over so are you ever going to finish Final Fantasy 6 yes I will I'm trying to right now figure out uh why my computer's blue screening multiple times a day what it's having problems again new completely new problems raid Port zero some something something yeah I don't know very confusing did you get moss in your fan
it doesn't seem to be related to overheating that's weird yeah okay still trying to figure it out all right well bummer AMD drivers no he's on Nvidia now unless they're talking about the CPU oh I mean that's that's possible but unlikely is cursed with personal PCS I wasn't until the AMD challenge started I never had any problems but now I'm I'm I'm not on AMD card anymore so I can't talk about that Chad asks hey DL alien special edition is the best aliens special edition oh
okay yeah yeah cargo pants when um I don't know we are at oh I should say we're at least 2 to 3 months out because we haven't started mass production yet but they're going to be pretty similar to this and they're not going to be cheap all the pockets and everything ended up um significantly contributing to the cost of this particular garment and our order quantity is not super high because we haven't had like a a a Smash Hit in pants yet and so we're taking a fairly conservative approach to ordering so
there'll be a bit of a low volume tax but they're really nice I really like them um Richard says thanks LT and team question for lonus if he gets it what treats do you like to give your cats oh we're really bad we uh we just give them like Friskies like name brand ones that are probably full of garbage and going to kill them or whatever um we don't give them to them often but they they do like them sometimes we'll put them in like 3D printed stimulus toys that are fun to play with and they like can try
to get it out of it uh but I I like giving them catnip even though I know you're not supposed to you're not supposed to yeah it's I don't know it's like bad for them it's like it's drugs right it like messes them up a little but I don't know drug it's funny it's really funny they get all weird and affectionate and they roll around on stuff so it's e yeah for cats yeah I don't know um yeah Temptations that's the one J Jay sit on in float plane chat um are the 3D printed toys safe for
them to be chewing and licking they they don't they're not dogs like they're they're like fidget toys like they have like spinny bits or they have little like uh thing sliders that they can try to get the the the food underneath it's it's fine apparently the nip is perfectly fine uh some people are saying occasionally it's fine natural is fine yeah I don't know I don't know whatever someone told me at some point that it's not the best I'm going to give it to them anyway because I don't give a
so there you go sorry sorry bad pet bad pet dad uh rodri says if you were forced to use a monitor where all of its specs were as low as they can go but you could choose one spec to be top of the line which would it be size refresh rate color accuracy Etc ooh it depends what I'm doing yeah if it's for gaming it's going to have to be a top-of-the-line refresh rate but am I allowed to also have top-of-the-line pixel response times because if I have the fastest refresh rate and trash pixel
response times that'll suck everything's just a blur then if I have to pick one  unless it's for anything other than gaming in which case it's going to be color but size color but size hold on minimum size how small is that size yeah I don't I mean these days I would say these days probably yeah probably something like that yeah it's probably not going to be size then though uh Gad asks have you looked at the plug-in hybrid Chrysler Pacifica yeah I almost got it when we bought our
Odyssey it was coming soon and I didn't want to be the first person to buy a Chrysler allnew model so I was like this looks super cool this is right up my alley plug-in hybrid I could do a lot of my you know just putting about dropping kids off at lessons on electric uh totally my jam right Chevy Volt guy um but it's a Chrysler and this is the very first one I don't even know if they had a plug-in hybrid before that uh no they must have because um they're they're also under
General Motors but I don't know that Chrysler specifically had done anything yeah I I don't I don't believe in I don't believe in first gen even an established product line I don't want a new a an allnew I don't want an allnew I want the facelift or or I want the last one before the facelift or the second one after the fael I forget what like the ones are but don't want it all new I know that for sure apparently no Chrysler is not GM it's Fiat Chrysler that's right sorry
sorry sorry sorry my bad I think there's one dealership locally that does Chrysler and GM and so I I get that confused sometimes yeah so I I would just no nah I was not I was not into that oops what's up I just created something that there's like two of the same thing for so nice Anonymous says being water resistant how does the LTT hat hold up up to head sweat compared to The Standard Version uh well what I would imagine is that it would not pass through it as easily but I would have to
get back to you on that um I have no idea how to do anything with respect to following this up so maybe someone will see it and we will update the product page at some point but I would say that if you sweat a lot and your main concern when it comes to your head getting wet is from the inside then you should just get the regular one and save yourself 20 bucks and it'll be like very breathable and that'll be good Michael says if the government forced you into one of the
currently vacant non-tech focused public service jobs what would you be excited to do for and what side jobs would you do to actually pay the bills so I'd be a teacher he'd be a firefighter saved you the trouble thanks as for side jobs um man I feel like uh you know what I was looking into this recently I feel like I I'd figure out stuff where I can buy a small piece of equipment and then turn that into like a recurring profit at home a rental yeah no actually what I had in mind was more along the lines of
like you can buy there's this really weird Chinese company vivor and they have kind of everything like they have ultrasonic cleaners and they have like super high pressure compressors I don't know how trustworthy they are like the reviews are like oh yeah this compressor like works pretty good as as long as you you know make sure you're like supervising it really carefully cuz otherwise it'll explode if it goes too high and it doesn't have a safety cut off and also like I had to redo the oil
in it when it first arrived cuz it like wasn't sealed right and like uh anyway um but I I was going to before I realized how dangerous that thing was I was thinking oh that would be like a cool side hustle for like my kid it's like hey you know here learn to run a business um I will I will invest you know the cost of this High Press compressor thing you're responsible for having a web presence and for uh handling you know client Communications and and for actually fulfilling people's
tank filling requests and and you could use it to fill probably not scuba tanks but you could use it to fill Airsoft uh or like air gun or paintball gun uh high pressure air tanks and so I could see myself doing stuff like that so making small Investments like into a bad yeah yeah the guys into like a badminton stringing machine um and then streaming streaming uh badminton streaming badminton stringing machine and stringing people's rackets for them and stuff like that man these guys got
everything so uh yeah don't go to cleaning equipment just go to like the main the main site like super weird company man like is that a milking machine or like what the what the am I even looking at here is that a lawnmower I don't even yeah what is this I don't even know it's like a still I don't even know price is as low as 60 8 a curb ramp like would I trust a Jack from these guys wow I would not trust this right like the lowest price ever oh good I don't know if I want that from a 
yeah what the Yeah weird weird company dude multi effect deep detox temperature control and timer foldable and portable sauna blanket for infrared heating okay Jaws 14 said I literally had their Sona heaters open in Chrome already yeah they just have some of everything um random archive Anonymous says hey Dan  talent what is the most comfortable LT merch to wear while traveling my wife and I are flying to the maritimes in April to see the total solar eclipse and want to get us some
merch while flying man I I would take the drop out that hoodie is awesome the dropo is just so comfortable and I mean if you're going maximum comfort and you just don't give a f about what you look like pick up the pajama pants yeah they are so comfortable Al that yeah I second both of those yeah like if I just wanted maximum Comfort I I would probably just go that route I mean there's always the onesie if you're totally Shameless what's the scenario that you're in is this they're flying flying yeah you can
have some printing issues with the with the the yeah but you could wear the Marino underwear and that would keep the print contained  depending good help you really got to brag about that on a live stream what's wrong you're in that's all what's your problem I just don't wear those in public places yeah you wear them the work it's not a not anymore yeah well because I told you not to yeah uh okay Nathaniel says lur Luke tried Quake Champions I stand by being the best shooter around at the moment
similar vibe to Halo but much faster movement and no a assist I haven't tried it I would probably enjoy it I I love  Rives yeah I feel the same way Ryan s says I was able to play Super checks with my fiance for the first time this week she was playing it similar to foosball all power no finesse um any  defense defense defense um it's all about cutting down the angles so you you basically have to look at whatever part of your net is exposed you put your goalie in whatever the most likely spot
they are to hit is and then you get a player in between the puck and the rest of the net and you can our our games tend to be very tight checking games uh with there was I specifically remember one conversation that we had that you after the conversation were semi- regretting having where we were discussing how to block certain shots um and that that conversation I think was quite the inflection point in like the quality of overall gameplay cuz we went back and forth a bit on like I
outed him for quite a long time yeah and then because neither of us is that into that um whenever he outet as me at something he explains what he's doing and whenever I out meta him at something we both just generally want to be better we'll win we'll we'll win some games if we figure something out yeah but then we'll be like hey once you've kind of got it unlock the reason I'm scoring with my left Winger like every game all the time is because you're not you you're moving this guy
this way and you should be moving him this way um nowadays you like you either have to get lucky and you just like start hitting hard and hoping it like bounces off something and goes some of that there's some of that there's some of that in real hockey too or you gota you man you got to make a good play make some Mak make try to try to do a pass um so instead of just like I have the puck I shoot it at the net um try to like you know they're guarding one angle cuz your
player has the puck instead of shooting at the net pass it to your other one and be ready and smack it right when it gets you so they don't have time to react and move their move their players and stuff also you just generally got to work on your muscle memory uh manage your goalie that's a big one is whenever the Puck's on this side get your goalie to that side and then proceed to play and then when it moves to the other side get it over there get back just keep your
goalie so that he's best cutting down on the angles yeah Daniela hey Lane Lindsay and Delila as a float plane subscriber for a long time I feel like I have missed out on all the Dennis ads that appear in videos could we get a float plane compilation of them love the the show that's a really good idea could be really fun too is like Dennis going over like his like favorite top five ones or something yeah um that's a that's a that's a super good idea I will I will send that to 
um Dennis presents his favorite Dennis ads period idea for a float plane exclusive where Dennis acts as the host and shows them some of the best creative sponsor spots that he's done  them all right yeah it's a really good idea Antonio says Hey Linux Luke Skywalker and Dirty Dan with the retirement of Matt Pat what are your thoughts on YouTubers retiring and the impact theorists have had on the gaming community and game development so thoughts on YouTubers retiring man I uh I've been tempted
myself many times I mean I've I've said guys I'm not doing this for the money anymore don't don't need more of it um I do have a tendency to develop greater Ambitions once I've achieved what I have Ivon calls me insatiable um but but I assure I I I I swear the Badminton Center is the last thing no it's the last thing it's the last thing Luke mhm well I mean the lab still like is not done and the badon center is still not I just mean I'm not going to add any more massive
projects I don't believe you what I do what I do somewhat believe is that at the very least a pause on purchasing real estate which will limit the ability to do certain things I no part of me believes that you're just like not going to Aspire to more that is just hilarious to be completely honest um what that more is I think you might be able to especially knowing you you might be able to wordcraft your way out of it being quote unquote more because it's it's an expansion of something we're already
doing in some way whatever sure but you know what I mean um feel like I'm just getting completely roasted right now there's absolutely nothing I can do about it but yeah I don't know we're going to use the the labs team and and this other something thing to to make extremely high-end uh pool toys or something it's like okay sure dude it would be cat toys before pool toys but sure sure yeah yeah but you're like it's not an expansion because we use the labs team to design
it and we use the creat warehouse team to make it yeah it's like what's wrong so you've built all the teams that you need to build to do whatever you want and you're like now I'm not expanding no that doesn't count that counts no that's   off yeah as for Matt Pat's impact I mean yeah create Crea the creative industry just yeah sure gaming but honestly I think he's been in some way is more influential to people who have watched him and not necessarily gone into gaming or game development uh he's just been an
icon one of those guys like the Green Brothers where you're just like an innovator uh is is the word that I would use to describe him I've only I've only  him twice I want to say um but he's one of those people that a is exactly the way that you expect him to be based on seeing him on camera and B somehow still  sense Charles says Hey dlll I've recently became a father and when helps keep my sanity through the sleepless nights the last few Fridays what is a piece of advice you wish someone had
told you when you became a parent um just be firm be firm and never ever break ranks the you and youro say anything that contradicts the other you are done they will find that tiny Gap in the armor and they will wedge their way into it um and I don't mean that they're evil I just mean that they're people little little people annoying people beautiful people but they're people they're smart so watch out and they and doesn't matter how smart you are cuz remember they're your genetic junk they're every bit as 
are uh that one's done uh Anonymous says Hey parasocial figments of my imagination you've said before that you try to only make products if you can add value to the market so why cables it feels like there are several quality cable Brands so my issue with cables is that they're often not available in the lengths that I want and cable management is something that's a bit of a personal you know passion of mine I I like I like tidiness I like order um and ours will be available in in between lengths the
other thing that we're going to do really well is cut out the BS so instead of Super Ultra Mega speed our cables will simply be labeled with the maximum data rate that they can handle and with the maximum power that they can carry that's it no BS just excellent cables I also haven't seen many if any cable manufacturers use super high quality silicone sleeving um Apple used to have some cables like that but they haven't done them in a long time I've seen it in DIY Electronics
cabling and like wiring rather uh but seeing it in actually finished cables is pretty rare so between the quality of the cables the availability of middle lengths for optimal cable management and the just no BS labels I think that there's an opportunity for us to make a  uh Anonymous says heus and his two carers just curious to know which rig you've had the most fun building at LT PS more of the Jank water cooling guy please the most fun G I don't know cuz there's a fine line between fun and
derangement I almost feel like like you know we have we have that video coming very soon of us reflecting on our favorite builds I so I created this as a call out for that video basically so well I'm nothing if not predictable we got there we got there um the mineral oil PC was just sheer Joy it wasn't that hard it was just let's go to the like pet store and buy a castle and put it in  computer right like it what we already knew how to do it we had a kit like it was n just fun yeah that was pretty fun
uh we we've done a lot of fun Stu always come back to that one man like and some of it's just like wow even less purpose like I did that one where we had a heat sink like an air cooler heat sink and we just like ran water over it we like put it in water to can you water cool air cooling right like that's just F it's just fun did we build a computer really I don't know more we ran a you know science fair experiment but it's if we weren't having fun we wouldn't do it hey speaking of fun um we
did how to clean your water cooling recently and it ended up being a really fun video that's cool um the we were we were going to do it and then a toothbrush sponsor wanted to work with us on a sponsored video I went holy the timing of this is unbelievable because we were just going to do a like how to clean your water cooling thing and we weren't really sure if there'd be enough of an audience for that so it wasn't a high priority uh even though we did want to do it and then and then
things got even better because one of my favorite degenerates that works here David who doesn't take care of his stuff which you guys would have seen in his until extreme Tech upgrade hasn't touched those water cooled systems since I built them and they had some scary stuff in them so we combined checking in on a previous upgrade with how to clean your water cooling with we needed to do a sponsor thing for for like a like a like a super high vibration rate electric toothbrush and it end up being
like a really good video it's informative it's fun and funny and it's sponsored so hey keep the lights on I mean not very on it's when show after dark but only a little bit on a little bit yeah yeah yeah we got to pay Dan somehow I mean he oh oh he is off working yeah I know I'm saying that for them uh uh archive Sean says hey D just got my screwdriver have you considered doing similar real world reviews with other work battered items like you did with the miners backpack no that just
kind of happened by chance um it's kind of a cool idea but I don't think it's the sort of thing that we go out of our way for if you want to see people's real world reviews LTT store.com is chalk full of them like if you ever have any doubt in the product feel free to you know per bruise the reviews where you will find lots and lots and lots of real world impressions of our products "there's over 8,000 reviews for the LTD" screwdriver many of which include photos uh or some of which include photos I
shouldn't say many many they can include photos um a lot of people don't use the feature but they definitely can yeah man I every once in a while I'll just sit and like read reviews it's I can't even keep up look at this all of these are from the 6th of March okay so we're on March 5th here here we go all of these are from March the 5th okay now we're on to March the 4th like people are really passionate about this product even the ones that aren't five star are like dang I really appreciate the behind
the scenes decision this is a reflection of the dedication of the quality of LT like I can't read all the amazing wonderful things that people say about our scar one includes aian saying I signed up for the Precision screwdriver exactly exactly oh man I'm I'm glad I can support great content with actual great  exactly okay so I've dealt with all the incoming and potentials nice I can I can read if you would like you want to participate for a change how about I read one for you Ryan G if I buy this
with my company card is it a tax write off yes no I'll use the mouse pad for work oh then yes maybe partially maybe uh also Luke what's the hardest challenge you've had to solve at flow plane other than live streaming oh yeah H payment processors that's been very annoying um I think the biggest one is protection accomplishing what we have with the team size that we have um I I can't really understate how crazy it is that we able to pull that off a very talented team um It's actually kind of nuts
um and anytime that like yeah I don't know I I don't want to get way too into it but like building a new feature when you have like oh um yes this individual person is responsible for um all of the apps and all of the front end yeah we like know of other sort of Creator um you know platform things and they have a team of like a lot of people that do that entire team has less responsibilities in that one person and the thing that that it it just has a lot of things that we kind of like oh okay
yeah so not shouting out anyone in particular just our team is very talented and they're great yeah and you know what their leader is pretty great yeah thanks man Oh you mean you oh I mean you mean you no I mean Taran oh just I was just I was just bugging you was that that would be right though yeah oh I I'm not in their reporting path at all anymore wait is it cuz he's the  CE you're still a CEO oh that's hilarious I probably shouldn't  no I never thought about this at all
yeah that's so funny um you can tell that reporting line was important yeah  noodles oh okay um Ellas says hey lonus have you switched to that Alienware aw 2725 DF monitor that you unbox for circuit Del wanted it back oh so I haven't gotten one yet cuz I'm lazy also it's really small so my incentive to upgrade to it has been pretty low I do want it though man it was freaking like just I couldn't miss I couldn't miss Luke it's like I was cheating I'm tempted but it's so much money it's so good it's so much
money and I'm like trying to get away from Shooters right now because of how many cheaters there are do it you coward how much is it oh it's like $700 or something oh oh when my next monitor dies it'll be cheaper then yeah it's like a th000 Canadian dollarss dude oh yeah dog I was talking to I was doing not salary but contract rate negotiations with someone today um and they told me their Us number I was like nice and then I converted it and I was like oh nice we'll see man look at these reviews though
this monitor is true wow factor best monitor I ever owned as astounding OLED monitor OLED is the Wave It's The Wave this is almost as good as our screwdriver Luke that's genuinely pretty oh well hold on sort by highest to that cannot be the default Dell what the Dell wow okay ours are sorted by most recent okay so let's see what they end up with then is what just happened did that just do anything I don't think so oh my God most relevant hello okay that one changed okay most recent a shining star on my
desk okay is this okay I don't know what just happened here anyway it may be even better than the LTT oh died after a week dude this is uh okay other than DOA it gets five which stars going to happen with monitors disappointing packaging so it's so it's got a problem with it screen Lottery risk packaging again anyone who gets a working one is like OMG the best thing ever and I I I backed that up epic had to get a replacement literally every single one that isn't five stars it's like it's

LT tax write off shirt in Big and Tall sizes lonus please tell me when I'll be able to spend this I'm not guaranteeing that I'm guar I guarantee nothing but thank you for the your tax liability gift card it's not a tax liability it's just a wait hold on is it no I think it might be because it counts as an asset but it's not I I can't remember how it works but gift cards are actually like sort of inconvenient in a sense like they're are they're they're a liability when you count your business assets or
whatever it's fine though please buy gift cards or whatever um Igor says just got a job as a computer teacher for teenagers and young adults aside from PC Building what do you consider important skills for PC enthusiasts I really want a light a fire and students troubleshooting the the rush of solving a problem is one that can't be under can't be over what it shouldn't be under  good yeah I think a security focused lesson where uh you make it like the the students I don't know to trying to teach
kids security stuff and trying to make it fun could be kind of cool like maybe you could have split the team into like split the class into like four teams or something uh and give them like they have to like send emails to each other and they have to be able to detect which email is like sketchy or something I don't know um could be interesting it would need some workshopping but it could be fun if you if you could find some way to teach kids good you know internet usage practices
in regards to security that would be super super valuable for them and if you could find a way to make it fun that would be great hello lonus tax tips I'm Chaz what are some odd things you've seen wired up to a computer I.E I am wiring up an aftermarket car stereo from the 2010s to my PC for audio and CD/DVD playback that's an odd one um Alex wanted to run a subwoofer off of a computer power supply for for some reason he wanted to build the computer into a sub enclosure we didn't actually
do that but he wanted to sounds cool cigarette lighters are one of the funny ones from the like late '90s early 2000s you could get 5 and a/4 inch Bay like cigarette lighters um I have personally just run power out of my computer for fans that are not actually in the computer or lights that are not actually in the computer that're just somewhere else cuz it was just convenient cuz it was a Molex connector  go I mean power's power right yeah give it to the people Christopher hey lld
first time buyer my partner and I can't wait to read this to our baby who's arriving in a few weeks heck yeah ABC's a gaming let's go any tips for managing screen time for young kids as ours grows up um don't use it as a crutch the biggest obstacle to managing kids screen time is parents you have to learn you have to be disciplined enough to force them to be disciplined enough to not just stare at a screen your kids are going to scream and cry in a restaurant so you have two
options you can have a pleasant meal by giving them your phone or you can Soldier it out you can grab your kid take them out of the not not like this I just meant grab your kid no shake take them out of the restaurant I used to do this all the time your food's going to get cold your steak is going to get tough while it sits there and you are not eating it you sit them down outside the restaurant and you go the way you're behaving is not okay do you like being out here no do you think I want to be out
here well what do we need to do you need to stop the noise you're making that's not okay nobody wants to hear that and when you're done we can go back and inside if it takes too long you go back inside you leave them there you stand there you watch them through the window you make sure no one's going to take off with your kid or whatever you wait it out there will be times when it will take an hour but what they learn is when you say you will eat this food you will do it quietly that that's what will happen
they can have a lot of Tears in between or they can yell or they can do whatever but that's what's going to happen I mean I've never had to hit my kids never had to like you know be do we focused on whatever we say will happen and we will wait you out and it has been so effective I've seen some of it time yep and I don't mind putting them in a slightly unpleasant situation I also like as a as a childless person um I kind of appreciate it because if you just sit there if if you
don't do the phone thing but you just sit there and don't do anything then it's just annoying for everybody else so by like removing them from the scenario it's like okay and there will be escalating levels of unpleasantness like the first place I might put them when they're not behaving at the restaurant is inside the restaurant sitting at the front and I just ignore them while they do not get they want attention right so don't give them attention for that and then if they keep doing it well hey next up is
outside yeah he said he said had to he he would never hit his kids yeah it was just a verbage thing to wor I think some people justify it by saying that they had to that there was no other way yeah and I strongly believe that patience is the most powerful tool because they're not disciplined they're kids they they are not patient if you're willing to you can always Outlast them always and like I said I'm not it's not that I'm not willing to put them in an unpleasant situation so at our old house
step one of time out was the laundry room step two was through the door in the garage and step three was out the back door outside and I don't care what the weather is I don't care how late it is I don't care how tired you are if I said brush your teeth you will brush your teeth you will and then when we're done I say okay did I say brush your teeth mhm okay did you brush your teeth yeah could that have gone a lot faster and a lot more pleasantly mhm okay well then next time
why don't we do it that way and you've got to be you've got to be willing to stand your ground man I remember this one time in Ikea man I could hear I could hear everyone around me like talking about me uh because my middle my middle child was crying for over an hour in the food court because I said she had to take one more bite and she didn't want to and I felt awful because she was over tired I I knew I knew I knew as soon as we were getting into it that she was she was
over tired she was overdue for her nap and it had been kind of a long day and realistically it was like it was crank is not cuz she's a bad kid or whatever but I had already said you have to take one more bite so it's it's been stated the word has been uttered and as soon as they as soon as they find the gaps um now if I act over tired I can get away with XY they're smart they're too smart um and so oh that's that's a big one is when they finally take the bite huge positive
reinforcement like that's really good too big snuggles and pick them up and like whatever right oh and never bribe that's another one always reward unexpectedly never okay we can get the toy if you eat your meal you will eat the meal they eat it you go good job why don't we go get a treat never treat up front never never never never yeah I think that's a pretty good point yep has there been any funny parenting Story I mean I thought the one in the Ikea was pretty funny I thought it was
pretty good it's terrible uh there was the one time my eldest um who was very shy um almost made us miss a fery because we were at the park playing and as we were leaving um he had borrowed a toy from another kid like a little truck or something and I said okay go give the toy back and thank him for letting you borrow it and he went and he put the truck down and he left I said hey I said you need to thank that boy for Lending you his toy I remember this I wasn't there but I remember the story and he
and he cried and cried and cried cuz he he just had this sort of this petrification he was he was so shy sometimes but it doesn't matter you will be polite and you will be a decent human being I don't care how shy you are if somebody does something for you you will thank them period and uh that was one of our biggest battles it was also one of our last ones um because he was getting to the age where was kind of getting it it was he where he where he was getting it and uh and we made that fery by like 30
seconds I I it was barely and we were at that Park and my wife's like we are going to miss this fery like and it was important for some reason important for some reason we had to make this FY and I was like well then you better then you better get with me on convincing him to go thank that kid and I think our compromise was that she got to play good cop a little bit which you must always agree on if someone's going to be good cop and someone's going to be bad cop you agree you take turns but she was
going to be good cop and she was going to go with them she didn't hold his hand all the way there she didn't talk for him but she went and she stood behind him which gave the confidence reinfor someone's got your back that makes sense but once we once we say you will do it you will do it so now the kids are just like you say something and they just do it because they know they will so I could do it now or there could be like a big fight and consequences and it could suck I wonder how this is going to
go in teenage years it's going to be different yeah we we already see it right like it's um and and the thing is you've got to be ready for that your Authority is not always going to be absolute we're already having that conversation with the eldest where we're going like look you are going to be making a lot of your own decisions ongoing here a lot more of your own decisions over time and so we start to involve him in them like uh um he had a bit of a a persistent injury and really
wanted to uh keep doing his badminton training but we we have some concerns about developing a chronic injury before you're even an adult and we're basically like okay so here's what we're going to do we're not going to we're not going to tell you what you're going to do we're going to outline all the different possibilities and all the different options we're going to tell you which one we think you should do and then you are going to make a decision so you have to start going through those processes
with them because otherwise you're not really equipping them for the future when they will have to make their own decisions do you talk about like how you came up with those options and how you established the pros and cons and stuff yeah so we kind of go okay look can stay uh doing exactly what you're doing um the the pro is that you know you enjoy it you're going to improve the con is that you might not improve at the rate that you think you're going to because having an injury can affect your form it
can affect your performance in game it can affect you mental mentally it doesn't make people happy to not being to not be improving right you can go cold turkey which um I think will be best for your recovery uh or we also presented the option of training on an adjusted schedule on a like at a lower rate and he ultimately made his own decision and uh you know that's the next part is you have to respect it even if he makes the wrong one because that'll happen you kind of need to go that
through that too so and you know I you know realistically guys I I get the opportunity to talk a lot about you know the things that go right and I get to put you know my own my own spin on it I'm sure there's times that my kids have been unhappy with the approach and I'm sure there's ways that everything that we're doing uh could back fire you know the strategy that works for one kid does not necessarily work for another so don't take all of this as just like oh yeah L is thinks he's a perfect parent I
don't I make all kinds of mistakes  that own it that's a big one apologize seriously when you get something wrong say sorry man I felt I felt bad when uh I I I was tired of reminding the kids on weekends to brush their teeth in the morning cuz they do it automatically on the weekdays but they just get distracted and forget in the mornings on weekends and I came up and the girls hadn't brushed their teeth and I basically went okay no treats this weekend at all nothing nothing with
sugar in it period I didn't realize one of them was going to a birthday party that day oh but I said it now that I've said it it is said so she got no cake she got no treats I felt terrible and I know this happened because um Ivonne went to the party with her oh she got nothing you know what you know how many times she's Miss brushing her teeth goose egg yeah that makes sense but I apologized I said sorry I wouldn't have said that if I had realized that you were going to a birthday party and you
know so you kiss and make up right you like hey I'm sorry but also when I say something it's it might have been Dan not sure all right uh oh this is the same one there's a comment at Philippine chat mind Paradox said my daughter tried scream shaming me into buying her candy in Walmart when I said no she threw herself on the ground and flailed hands and feet screaming about how I never buy her anything I'm chaotic neutral generally so my response was to throw myself on the ground right next to her
and scream I can't afford to buy you everything you want while flailing my hands and feet her 4-year-old self was up in a lash and and from full on tears to screaming to Daddy Daddy please are looking people are looking that's pretty good very funny I pulled that once over a dut what I was probably about eight oh yeah okay that was the one time I was spanked oh yeah he i' I it's it's like a core memory my my dad immediately dropped whatever groceries we had grabbed me by the arm took me to
the the car gave me one good one and went don't ever do that again I didn't I remember but I don't agree that that's the way to do it I'll give reminders like this is one of my favorites you've probably seen me do it I think so yeah that might have looked lighter than that though I've seen you it's pretty light like it's not it's not no actual pain is in so I uh I I was inspired um by watching like uh like some kind of bird remind its young about something and so I was like yeah uh so when they forget
like a please or something like that and I I don't want to have to verbally remind them cuz we I'll just give them a double little double index finger tap on the head they're like thank you or you know or whatever it is I remember these are these are not these are not great but um my my family did spanking it was very common back then I'm not my parents are great just to be very clear um but it was once we hit a certain age it was very ineffective on my brother and I uh
they were into it we we played a lot of Combat Sports Combat Sports contact Sports um so like that type of it's just it it didn't matter um once the like hair brushes and spoons started breaking and we would just laugh um that was like you know that like the mental damage being inflicted was significantly heavier on the other end because they're like trying to inflict punishment and you're just laughing amongst it uh H there was also one point in time where my brother did this and then I copied
him because I thought it was funny we ended up doing the thing to be clear we weren't that bad of people but um my mom was like trying to get my brother to do something and he just laid on the ground and was like make me cuz he's like huge football player dude he's like what are you what are you going to do H yeah just to taunt them for a second and they did it anyways cuz he's a good guy but yeah um oh man it was great um okay Evelyn hey wandel the curling team I coach made it to the League bonspiel
what do you all do to manage performance anxiety after an important win and when the stakes are high I suck at it I I actually I haven't competed much in my life like in competition obviously life is a competition but uh like at at even like stupid recreational badminton tournaments and stuff when it's a big match even not even at a tournament even when I'm playing against like the people who are like realistically too good to play with me and I like want to do my best I I I get all I get I get tense man
I I I really struggle with that I have no advice for you uh my brother and I both get adrenaline shakes pretty bad um I find if I'm doing I never even knew this was a problem until I was a bit older because whenever I was in sports physical Sports it would take care of itself kind of I don't know why I I guess the energy was being physically expunged enough that I didn't really get the shake so much but if I was in like I used to play Counter-Strike at a decent level if I
was in like a Counter-Strike tournament my hand would just and it was very frustrating I don't know how I necessarily figured this out but eventually I was still able to make shots while that was happening just compensate I have no idea sheer force of will let's go brain figured it out somehow um but it was a it was a concern for a while have fun remember why you curl there's a have fun there's a bit of a trick where if you breathe in really deeply through your nose and then
when you've breathed in pretty much as much as you can pause for a second and  like then breathe out through your mouth and it's calming that can that can kind of pull you down a little bit um I've done that before that can genuinely help um so yeah people are giving it a bunch of different names in full point chat I don't know I just know it works at least it works for me you got used to the pattern of the shakes yeah maybe I don't know what it was it was it was annoying recoil
compensation okay so I have to draw a seven but like  uh Chris asks any idea when water bottles will be back in stock uh hopefully soon I um I don't know we we the store has grown a lot the business has grown a lot over the years and we haven't necessarily kept up in our processes and we've got some Consultants that started a little while ago that have a lot of experience in detail and business management are going to be kind of helping the team um Taran brought them in and I'm I'm pretty
excited for some of the differences they'll be making and I think just sort of inventory management is one of the things that we're going to be looking at how to do better and that doesn't mean that we suck or we're stupid or anything like that it just means like you're not born knowing anything I think and it takes time I'm pretty excited about because I think like we have we've promoted within a lot which is cool people like that but it does mean that I mean a lot of people that work here have
uh at a career level of job have only worked here uh like I would consider myself only really having worked here I've had a ton of other jobs but they weren't really career jobs they were just jobs um so that means that we don't have a ton of experience in like how other companies do things which sometimes means that we'll run into a problem and not really necessarily know what to do which we might actually end up on the right answer but it takes some triaging or some trial and error and
hopefully we'll end up there um whereas sometimes people can just come in externally and be like oh yeah I've worked at like five different companies that are all like Omega big this is how they do it and it's like oh okay cool why reinvent a wheel yeah good sometimes it's worth it often it's not yep we've invented a lot of wheels that have been pretty good Wheels but sometimes there's a better wheel already y uh Josiah asks hi Mr Tool tips and the Gang I recently loved the LT video on
the K swap to the Synchro q704 which I had to look up to remember what it is it's that one with the one connect power supply from um cic super super cool wait no this isn't the right one oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah this this one yeah exactly this is the one so it has that like uh power distribution thing uh from Alex's from Alex's upgrade anyway the point is uh they ask uh has he had any issues not that I know of um also can you do an sff PC Plus theater setup video honestly if
you have the space for it I wouldn't recommend doing a small form factor for a theater because you want it to be as quiet as possible and small form factors tend to compromise on cooling so if it was me I would probably go with as big of a of a of a media sort of friendly looking enclosure as I could get away with in order to have big fans in it that move a lot of air without spinning too fast that would be the best advice that I could give with that said I definitely am going to do a video
turning our original steam machine prototype into a home theater PC at some point we still have it kicking around I want to build like a rip and fast compact machine in it so no but yeah and I think that's it thank you so much for tuning in we will see you again next time same bad time same bad Channel wait don't do it yet for float plane subscribers oh yeah assuming Dan has it working I don't know maybe there will be an party today uh you can join us for um our uh not traditional what's the
uh what's the what's the word is it not traditional customary not customary give me some more give me some more words traditional customary ritual yes ritual that works that's the one I want our our weekly super checks ritual best of what five I mean really for the people for the  my throat's in like a lot of pain but maybe I can do seven well you have to decide ahead of time you can't I know I hate this well you can't cuz you can't decide what it's going to be out of Midway
through uh I feel like you can no you can't not unless you're tied but then after one game you might not be tied anymore so people are like best of eight come on you what no okay I'm I'm I'm I'm going to have to let the people decide I guess oh my goodness okay let's not let the people decide let's let Luke decide but he'll decide sometime between now and when we start yeah how about that all right cool okay so I guess at least five at least best of five probably best as seven but
we'll see okay so what do we do now I don't know how to end the show anymore I don't know if he wants it to be he was talking about streaming from the other computer so we might need to end the show and then start another one uhhuh but that's okay cuz we can spam notifications sending notification of flow plane yeah so that's fine yeah um I'm assuming that's what he wants to do but I don't actually know he hasn't come back down but I don't know how to end the show like he doesn't have us end it
anymore there's a thing he does no no you don't just press that I can probably go figure that out uh okay well I mean know you have to be here though oh to say the thing yeah so like what do we do  that speaking of rituals what's I haven't heard from him during the show so I actually have no idea what his status  uh oh already added that fun idea of Dennis presenting his sponsor spots to uh their content calendar okay sounds good yeah we need  stream okay bye we're helpless now Dan we don't know
how to do things for ourselves well apparently it was good timing he was coming down anyways cuz I think he's done oh nice so I think we're good to go okay sick that's awesome I did that on purpose perfect timing on purpose nice he could tell by the the percussion of the footsteps y yeah I could tell hopefully that wasn't too disturbing I could tell by the angry swearing no longer happening there was a lot of that pulling my head out uh head out uh hair think you mean hairir okay anyway 
bye oh man we need a shirt that just   right I love it I love that I hate it
