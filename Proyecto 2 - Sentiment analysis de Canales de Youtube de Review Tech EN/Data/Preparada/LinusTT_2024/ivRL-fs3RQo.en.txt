quick look at this and this and this and this did you notice anything only the last one was made by Razer here let me slow it down this and this that's no snake it's a frog and it also shows up here on the sick custom hang tag and the shade of green that ain't quite right either but don't feel bad when we first spotted these green and blackbox products next to the check out in the auto part store we didn't notice either wait Auto Part store we're only 32 seconds into this
video and I have so many more questions than I did when I started guess I better clear my calendar these uh screwdriver sharp gaming peripherals are branded dart frog but they're actually manufactured by CJ Global Inc who even is that you ask well based on their website they're everything to everyone they're the refreshing Touch of Mexican beer on your lips the Forgotten Vanguard of American Heroes the brave explorers of the final frontier okay they're a Bargain Basement

shipping hopping right in Dart Frog's packaging is clearly designed to piggyback on Razor's hard-earned reputation but being a knockoff isn't necessarily a knock against a product as long as the price is right and for what we paid for the dartfrog m307 laser gaming mouse 11 Freedom dollar we're prepared to overlook a few Wards the packaging feels more premium than some real razor products and the specs honestly kind of appealing adjustable DPI at four levels 500 1200 1600 and
2400 why 500 not the standard 800 I don't know ergonomic design color changing light seven lights or seven colors um we don't know we'll figure that out and a braided 1 and A2 meter cable and in terms of the look and ergonomics it is not that dissimilar to comparables from Brands like Razer and Logitech to be clear there are some eyebrow razors here eight buttons with a fire key what's a fire key left click no oh this if it works anywhere near as well as the RGB who knows maybe I'll be
impressed there it is the first piece of our fart I mean dart frog gaming setup and next we've got the k520 metal gaming keyboard for $22 I don't know about you guys but I love it when the key specs on a product have no formatting and zero punctuation sorry I mean when they're romatic metal design anti- ghosting USB plug and play specifications colon RGB LED backlight 5ft cable usba interface anti- ghosting sounds promising to me looks less promising feels even less promising In
fairness there is metal involved however flimsy it might be there's probably less Flex in this t-shirt LTT store.com but some of these other specs I just have no idea what they're talking about seven keys shortcuts 12 buttons what is that even mean and why is there an Internet Explorer shortcut I guess you need it if you want to be compatible with Windows XP all the way to Windows 10 not 11 curiously I guess you got to draw the line somewhere though this will go perfectly with my mouse and look an
integrated phone holder to round out our amphibious gaming setup we've got the dartfrog S14 two computer gaming speakers with RGB LED lights for $11 they feature 3 wat 2 1/2 in drivers are these even actually 2 and 1/2 in they're under two frequency response down to 25 HZ strong doubt HD quality sound oh boy these guys I think probably their best feature looking at them is going to be that they make my hands look huge what does separation plusus 40 DB  yeah the lack of an indicator for which
is the right and which is the Left Channel not to mention the USB power I think tells me everything I need to know about the performance of these speakers they do look kind of pretty though and look at that built-in volume dial is it just me or does that seem to suggest that these were headphones at some point oh wow I am immediately doubting some of these very real user reviews Linda n I think you can go wrong with this mouse ergonomics are kind of a mess you guys are going to be feeding me some Labs
data for this right yes we' got information on accuracy precision and latency oh good I'm just trying to click play and this is already a disaster took me three attempts I clicked CS2 and apparently we're going to play Tac FPS micro Corrections easy V2 my favorite easy you say [Laughter] it just feels a little bit off though it actually doesn't feel that far off they say that this is set at 500 DPI but what we measured was actually closer to the standard 800 it was around 700 DPI so
you know it's uh explains why it feels a little off yeah just a little off 481 that's fantastic considering that uh this Mouse has a deviation that's about three times worse than the cheapest mouse that logic Tech makes ah I see so that's the consistency with which your motion will be interpreted should I try this with a Logitech mouse and see if I do any better sure or give me give me give me a real razor do we have a real razor we have the Death Adder which is nice very
similar to the essentials which is what will be our recommendation it's slightly better than the essential though I don't know why I'm doing this to myself because realistically oh God this is not going to be any better oh my God it's definitely better what I say I got last time 480 I think yeah just about 480 I believe okay to give you guys some idea I am halfway through and I'm at 305 now 565 those Precision numbers are especially bad when you consider that we're comparing to a bad Logitech mouse
if we compare it to the 305 which is kind of where they start getting pretty  worse but that but that doesn't mean every gaming mouse from the automotive shop is bad while we were in line we also picked up this Tech Theory gaming pack that promises to make you the gamer you always wanted to be and oh my God I think it's actually working any who the reason I bring this up is that the mouse is actually pretty interesting and look it even comes with  strip the kind of left me to my own
devices on this one here's the LED strip it does have an IR receiver can use with remote control but it doesn't include a remote so I guess I hope you like this as for the mouse there's not much in terms of specs we got the cable length which uh seems to be over reported by 10 cm which my wife tells me is a lot and then the outer diameter sure 2.6 it's RGB with a USC interface they mean USBC nope it's type A maybe it was a type O oh hey okay no but what is helpful is they actually indicate the sensor part
number which gives us some unusual insight into the costs of these bargain Isle peripherals a quick Google search later indicates that it is 11 cents I cannot wait to try this one you want to know how much that box costs the Box um sure do how do you know online 100 bucks we got it for 40 so we got for a discount it's one of those products that I think the the price that's reported online isn't the real one but uh even 40 is that not the cheapest feeling Mouse you've ever held in your hand it's
definitely cheaper feeling but the movement doesn't feel much worse than the dart frog maybe it's just the weight it's a lot easier to move cuz it weighs nothing yeah we tested it against the dart frog and it's about seven times less precise that's bad cuz the dart frog is already horrible uh and so uh maybe the lus does counteract the in preciseness of it numbers don't lie dude I am smack in between the dart frog and the razor that might be that in spite of its Precision issues it's actually
closer to the standard 800 DPI right or it's super light which makes it feel cheap but is also an advantage when you're making micro adjustments but hey that's just a theory too soon yeah sorry I miss him too I think it's time to move on to our darkart frog keyboard the very real user reviews for this one include this gem from Margaret it lights up making the gaming more entertaining all right I personally find that this RGB strip contributes more to my typing of the Dead experience than
the lights on my keyboard but you do you Margaret did you guys bring a real keyboard for me to try as well or I was just thinking about that we have the razor membrane one but it might be nice to have like an actual mechanical keyboard look how much Flex there is in this thing it's part of the feature it's ergonomic this is unbelievable surprising to me the latency on both the dart frog and the tech theory was actually lower than similarly priced razor and Logitech accessories but it's all within a factor
of a few milliseconds so it's all kind of bad you're doing good Zombie's dying  I love how uh called out redditors are in this is monkey type their  words like Eat the Rich like no that wasn't in there but that that kind of stuff just like typical redditor you know oh I love it um do you want to try the same thing on a good keyboard yeah let's do that at least a decent one oo hey at least I can feel where the home row is that's a plus yeah Karma bites see that's what I'm talking about orwellian so tired
nothing I not a very focused person I find this actually very difficult to do but I think that was better oh yeah like 20% better so a better keyboard is better riveting next it calls for me to test out the speakers but uh Jordan yeah you were saying they weren't plugged in  wow yeah that's a speaker right that's terrible you know what for 11 bucks fine sure they got RGB let's win this match here we go Team Cobra incom oh my God this mouse is so bad I didn't realize how bad it was it's so bad did
you see it just lose tracking there yeah yeah do a big swing no I can't I can't look at this are you see this wow okay wait was that in the lab's results that it can't no that the max tracking speed is like zero you know what the lonus vibe is still a valid measure dude can I have that lightweight one the other crappy one oh my God this one's almost as bad just completely loses it I can't turn around no okay you want to you want to try the cheap Logitech one just just to see it's
going to be bad too it's just as bad way better oh it's way better it's bad yeah but it's way better like it still it still does lose tracking sometimes but oh no it's really bad you know what the speakers are far from my biggest problem they seem pretty fine other than that I assume the one with the label would be the right channel I think it's actually the left I would do anything to stop using this mouse right now well you're in luck we have the cheapest peripheral
of the entire day ready for you lonus oh good wireless mouse d09 this is really laggy like you said but it just outright loses my tracking far less often still not great but actually usable a little more on that later for now let's go back to the speakers where come on you guys all knew this was coming what is it I can't even do it like the the peanuts thing oh yeah yeah you know given my expectations not bad for $11 like I'm sitting I was going into this thinking I'm I'm going be like King Hamlet
what frogs and poison like poison in the ears from the ah what you want current pop culture references come on something to keep in mind in all of this is at the prices we paid for these peripherals it's not that easy to find better products I mean a Big Mac meal at McDonald's costs more than this mouse in most of America but don't mistake that for a recommendation for the mouse or actually the burger for that matter it's not products like this suck and in my opinion they just shouldn't even be made
to be clear I also have no problem with budget peripherals the speakers totally usable and the Eastern times mouse that I highlighted earlier which was also at the auto store in spite of its supremely generic packaging and underwhelming product specs actually performed decently well for what it is a doublea powered Wireless utility Mouse and it's just $9 which illustrates why I find dart frogs offerings especially this mouse so offensive they don't need to be this bad maybe a 12 cent sensor and
another nickel in Plastics could have been all the UPG upgrade that it needed to be usable of course my real recommendation is to wait for your next payday and pick up something from a brand that is likely to still exist by the time you make it through the checkout you know just in case you need warranty support at the msrps of the products that we looked at today there are some very decent options the Razer Death Adder essential or the Logitech 203 are both available for about $30 and
both of them are much better than any of the mice that we just looked at in terms of keyboards I know we've MD on red dragon in the past but they've uped their game and they now make pretty decent mechanical hot swappable keyboards for less than 40 bucks we're going to have links to our suggestions in the video description because in our opinion the premium is well worth it for something that you might be touching for hours a day and don't forget guys that if that's not an option for you because
you're on a tight budget secondhand is a great way to go just remember to test everything you buy before you walk away just like I'm going to walk away from this segue to our sponsor charge get ready to power up with the shiek 100 power bank the world's first transparent power bank that's as fun as it is "functional with a whopping 25,600 Milah" capacity it'll keep you going continually and with 100 wat in and out fast charging your devices will be revved up in no time fully recharged in
