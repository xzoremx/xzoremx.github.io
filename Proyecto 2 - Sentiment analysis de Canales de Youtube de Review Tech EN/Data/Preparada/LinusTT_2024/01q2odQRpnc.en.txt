Derek asks does thermal throttling really reduce the lifespan of your CPU or GPU and the answer is it's complicated High thermals do impact the lifespan of an integrated circuit however thermal throttling specifically is a feature that's actually designed to extend your CPU or your gpu's lifespan once it reaches a certain maximum Target temperature it will lower its power Target in order to meet a point where it matches whatever thermal solution is in installed on it even going as far as to operate albeit
very slowly with no cooling solution installed whatsoever so in general you do want things to run as cool as possible but we also have to understand realistically that there are safety measures in place and that modern processors are designed to run at these higher temperatures without immediately dying at least not until your warranty expires
