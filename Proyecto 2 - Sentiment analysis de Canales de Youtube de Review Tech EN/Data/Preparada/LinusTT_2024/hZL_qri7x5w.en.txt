what's up everyone and welcome to the W show we got a great show lined up for you guys today AI powered race cars turns out they kind of suck so far big surprise also the supercomputer auction has completed and spoiler no no I didn't buy it and I will explain all of the reasons why as much as I would have loved to that didn't make any sense guys it made absolutely no sense what else we got today uh uh really you had all this time I don't know you had all this time while I made
an emergency bathroom break not going to lie I uh definitely focus on talking the chat instead and all of this is H Google Play celebrates Sonic and got every single fact about Sonic wrong why you got to focus on the negative cuz it's just funny why don't you go something positive do we have anything positive in the dock I mean Walmart is collaborating with Roblox that's not positive there's no way that's positive uh shrimp Jesus but all right the the the title for that topic is meta says no more to spam
unless it's AI spam nice and then there pictures of Jesus made out of shrimp are fair enough  the show is brought to you today by vessie Squarespace and manscaped why don't we jump right into our headline topic which is of course the supercomputer auction good Lord if I had a dollar for every single person who sent this bloody thing to me this week you could I could have bought it the Cheyenne supercomputer has sold app ly for $  "48,8 this is for sale by" yes.gov the US government at one point I
believe it was in the top oo I can't remember exactly but it was in the I think it was in like the top 20 or top 10 supercomputers in the world or something like that it's about 7 years old though now and if you guys read a little bit more into the details about it you'll probably figure out why in spite of the fact that it was looking like it might go for as little as about "$8,000 earlier in the week I had no" interest whatsoever in bidding on this thing see I swear to if if it went at 8
Grand and you didn't buy it that would have been a mistake that would have been that would have been maybe a mistake that would have definitely been a mistake that would have been maybe a mistake okay we need only go as far as here here let's play a game G let's play a game called how far into this page do I need to read to know what a bad idea it is to buy this thing Cheyenne supercomputer looks good so far item name can confirm it's good when these things match that is the sale Lot number
I mean that looks like a pretty lucky number to Cheyenne Wyoming dude it's 28 racks 28 racks all liquid cooling that's the E racks the eells there are 14 units weighing "1,500 pounds each and I have to get this" stuff from but Wyoming up to our warehouse where here let's keep reading I will have to find a place to store yes 28 rack units containing a total of "145,000 CPU cores that draw and and this" is this is a direct quote this is a direct quote here 1.7 million Watts under load sir are you
aware that with all of our buildings combined we do not have enough power to actually run this thing still could have bought it okay if it was 8 Grand you still should have bought it we could have salvaged it but but there are more issues hold on cuz we can keep reading let's keep reading uh moving the system necessitates the engagement of a professional moving company in fact I don't believe that the buyer is even allowed on on the premises so that's something wait yeah because it has to be
a profession it's a data SEC center it's a highly secure area Okay so there's that and then no no it gets even better it gets even better aside from these being outdated AF like we're talking Haswell grade CPUs here with ddr4 2400 this thing is flipping slow uh it took a team of I believe it was a little less than 20 dedicated engineers to run maintenance on this thing and I'm not saying you should have ran it and they've been having issues with that maintenance to the point where they're
saying hm it's kind of costing more to run this thing than it's worth because their liquid cooling has apparently been leaking all over the place this this thing is a cluster and it seemed like there were some people out there who were serious about buying a supercomputer and like running it oh yeah no and I'm I'm looking at this thing going no brother if you know anything about operating a supercomputer you know that nobody is buying this thing to run it "$480,000 is honestly a scrap price yeah"
100% you are you are ripping cabling out of it you are ripping CPUs and memory modules that is going straight to eBay you're not operating this thing because anyone who has the kind of money money to pay the "$60,000 a month that it is estimated" just to put electricity in this thing's digital veins and find a place that you can even get that electricity don't forget the cooling if you have that kind of money you can afford new hardware you are not buying somebody's like ratted out Civic of a
supercomputer and trying to lease out space on it that's just not how this works six years ago you made a video on the SFU supercomputer I did and that got 2.5 million views and it was 6 years ago okay 2.5 million views just just for context ladies and gentlemen in the tech vertical in the tech vertical is worth about five grand so okay but you know that's not how the math Works no the math is the Math's a little more favorable than that but if I spent more than probably 50 to 100 Grand on this thing I
am I better be profiting on the tear down of it because otherwise I'm in I'm underwater which gets under I agree at that even if I make a number of videos guys that's not one video yeah you've got number of videos like three to five videos I'm doing a series it's a it's a pickup Vlog we're D we're driving to Wyoming boys uh it's that Mr Beast intro where the camera whips out and you've got this huge semi behind you I'm in an abandoned supercomputer meanwhile it's like 6 minutes from the nearest Micro 
100% um but yeah the the other problem is if you're parting it out you'd have to part it out like in the States oh yeah and you'd have to film all your content in the states what I'm going to like I'm going to import this mess you got to be kidding me there's no way there's no way it was a fun thing to dream about it's one of those things where it's like oh man wouldn't it be cool to open a gaming hotel or start a you know a a a peripheral gaming peripheral business or you know like oh I had a I had a cool
idea and a fever dream and I woke up in the middle of the night and I went oh wait a half a million dollars for what is essentially a gigantic pile of leaky e-w there's no way at that point no it doesn't make it doesn't make any sense but but you know what I definitely I oh I didn't think of that what Travis social in the float plane chat you could write it off I could free content I could I could have written it off and gotten like five  could I have made a terrible mistake you got to think harder
man um I I there's like almost no chance but if the person who bought it reached out would you like do any content on it I mean yeah I'd be super down yeah yeah of course all right people let's figure out who the heck bought this realistically it probably has some yeah yeah there's there there's no this is this is basically one of those like e computer shop do whatever like eBay stores and they're they're they're ripping it apart there's there's no way that anybody is actually going to try to
operate this thing it is woefully out ofd they're high Ram units have 256 gigs I mean there are gaming PCs out there albeit not many but there are gaming PCs out there that have 256 gigs of ram in them these days like this is not this is not aged well and especially it has not aged well with the way that the workloads for these supercomputers have evolved in the last seven years there is a reason this is being decommissioned this thing is a CPU supercomputer which ladies and gentlemen is not how they
build them right now it as far as I could tell didn't really have any GPU compute units in it um it's also not designed with systems even that SFU supercomputer that I checked out 6 years ago had systems that had a terabyte or two terabytes or something of memory in them they were they were either four-way or eight-way CPU systems so that they could have these gigantic pools of memory so that they could work on extremely large data sets as far as I can tell Cheyenne didn't have any such
nodes and didn't have any such capabilities so as data sets have grown and as the need for GPU compute um for these for these supercomputing systems has grown it has it has become not just out of date in terms of the the how long it's been since the hardware was released but it has become outdated in terms of the overall design philosophy of the system in terms of the architecture of the system it just didn't make any sense but uh that could be kind of a fun video it was a lot of
fun oh it apparently does have 184 gpus shraff says 73 RTX 490s outperform this machine it could be kind of a fun video to like try to build like up a like we we built the like Cheyenne supercomputer that's actually that's a really good idea and if I'd thought of it we probably would have gotten started on that this week I do wonder if we've missed the moment a little bit at this point like if we had thrown now the auction's actually over yeah if we' thrown together a cluster uh just of
like random random motherboards and just loaded up as many gpus as we could have and freaking like like ethernet cabled them together and been like okay I bought a supercomputer but it isn't what you think isn't that one uh that'd be prettyy funny but yeah it's it probably missed the Merc a little bit "Yeah 100 1,680 pedop flops I mean yeah" what's a what's a what's a 7950 x uh peda flops oh my goodness what is my what is my browser doing do I look old enough that I need that um yeah it doesn't say
I guess that would be that would be teraflops here let's try let's try Tera flops I don't know I don't know how many flops it has how many how many flops you got boys turns out nobody cares about the flops of CPUs anymore right well whatever I'm over it okay why don't we move on to our next topic what do you want to talk about uh mostly mostly your topics but sure let's see what let's do the you have you have tarov update in here what's up with that oh I was just wondering what happened I I haven't been
paying attention to it what I realized was that we talk about really bad news in the community sometimes and we don't really come back and revisit it the following week to see if like maybe something went better like back when we were talking about the problems I was having with my uh with my light switches and and we we did ultimately do an update were like oh yeah the company has actually done the right thing and released the firmware Jasco that's that's who they are and I realized we we
don't always come back and say hey they did a really positive thing and everything's going good now which from the look on your face I'm thinking probably isn't what we're about to discuss so what's battle State Games been up to this week yeah no no need this time uh they they there's been multiple attempts at addressing the issue um there there's a bunch of things there's certain things that we didn't get to address last time like them editing their website did we talk about that no so they they edited
their website to take certain wording away from different versions that they had had in the past which would have made what they're currently doing like not okay so what I would like to know is are they aware of archive.org yeah like apparently not because they do they know that that exists that that's definitely a thing that exists they were asked an interview curious after they did it have they heard of that they were asked an interview after they did it if they had done it and they said no so I actually
think maybe no wow they don't realize that people can prove that they did it which is uh that's pretty funny I mean pretty great AR aren't they are are they Russia based oh it's one of those yeah complicated the company is technically incorporated as far as my understanding goes in the UK right um but you know what where Russ company it's a Russian company okay okay well I mean In fairness to them then in Russia you can just disappear things and they stay disappeared uh yeah unfortunately it's
the interwebs um so that didn't work out so great uh there's been multiple updates and I don't know if all of them are super findable anymore but essentially we've progressively gotten to where we are now um and where are we now oh wait is this is this a new update that I haven't even seen have they done a complete 180 and agreed to give everyone who bought the $150 Edition the the $250 unheard Edition like like is are they actually doing what they said they would do in the first place so sort
of except is anyone in the meantime they kind of made it worse oh brilliant so so anyone who whistle whistle blw from inside battle State Games got disappeared like uh like as if they were talking about airplanes or what I love that you use the term whistleblow because they added a weird new device into the game um that they're calling the Legacy device now remember this is supposed to be a tarov legacy device yeah I don't know why it's called that but like it's a like it's an item an
in-game item like you carry it or it's a gun or like what is it some form of in-game they just say unique item with call-in mechanics and I'll explain the call-in mechanics in a second can I just say for a moment that the moment Call of Duty died for me was the second that you could just order air strikes oh yeah and take out your what was that Cod 4 or Modern Warfare the original Modern Warfare original Modern Warfare I I played it for like two weeks and I was like this ising stupid I'm sorry you
don't even have to point your gun at the other guy yet I mean as Gamers as Gamers we've reached the point where we even like being slack on Old Warcraft m in our desk like this moving the mouse to click the head of the other guy is too much work that's unheard Edition tarov players all right fine okay so so so you got this item okay so yeah before before we get to that just in case people don't know about tarov so much it's extremely hardcore game uh it's supposed to have
you know a touch of realism it's still a video game so it's supposed to be fun but there's supposed to be a touch of realism but like you you reload you can't just like shoot two shoot two rounds and then like throw in a new magazine and like magically the the rounds teleported from the new one to the old one you like took out a magazine that now has 28 rounds in it and you put in one with 30 like you and that one still has 28 in it like even if you have loose rounds in your pockets like it's
yeah it's it's a it's a very very hardcore game and if you die in that game you lose nearly everything on you there's a couple small slots that you can retain um but almost everything that was on you is is now permanently gone except as we talked about last week the UN Third Edition this new $250 Edition you can call in like teammate reinforcements with one of their abilities so like you can be in a raid say say I was playing and then you jumped in Discord I could be like oh hey
and then I could call you into the raid that I'm currently playing sh up the biggest problem with that shut up by an enormous amount is that cheaters they'll often sell their services because there's been a decent amount of stuff that's been put in place to stop so you can have cheater Sherpas yeah so the cheaters can clear the whole Lobby and then you just go pick up the pieces and you just yeah and that's definitely how it's going to be used that's and they'll sell a lot of unheard additions to cheaters
that they'll then ban later and then we'll buy more unheard editions that'll totally happen because now there's a commercial incentive to own unheard Edition yeah cuz you can sell people loot more easily and faster and kind of on their demand and if they're looking for a particular item that's really rare you could have like a list of clients that want different things go into raids clear them check the loot and then call in the people that need the particular items like it's it's really bad and a
disgustingly terrible idea now that was already we already knew about that that was already a thing yeah now they're like trying to say sorry so they're like okay Edge of Darkness owner so this is the the people that bought this really expensive copy of the game $150 copy of the game most people bought this because it said you get all future DLC for free yes so it was like I'm buying into this game I have this is my like it's like buying a Plex lifetime pass or like it's more expensive than it like probably
should be but you get all the stuff later sure but it's not priced ridiculously compared to other lifetime licenses for as a service products so I can I can at least kind of see where people are coming from with this one yeah now they release this new version you don't get everything so they're frustrated so they said okay we're going to give you know the co-op PVE mode to of Darkness people that was a big issue they're like we're going to do it in waves whatever but it is coming to you
guys and a lot of the other things that they announced for the unheard Edition not everything but a lot of it they're like okay we're going to give it to Edge of Darkness people and then they have this random line that says unique item with colon mechanics Legacy device ability to call in a friendly BTR once called the item will go on cool down a BTR is um if you don't immediately know what that is yeah I'm sorry I don't know what a BTR is it's one of these are you  me so basically they're turning tarov
into like like what I can't even I can't yeah until like cod like how does that make any sense you want to be imagine you're in a fight with someone yeah and you're like they have some pretty hard cover you have some pretty hard cover but you're you're trying to go at each other and then you just hear this like Legacy device pop off and you're like well I guess a armored vehicle is going to come and wipe me out in this game which and like other people have pointed out not
only is this a ridiculously egregious pay to win mechanic like obviously because the lower more basic tiers of the game don't get this but it's also makes no sense for the lore of the game at all yeah cuz you're supposed to be like completely cut off from command and all this other kind of stuff and now you're calling in like an armored vehicle and and for whatever reason it gets loaded to like a SpaceX rocket and arrives immediately yeah I just the whole thing is like what 
it's it doesn't seem like it would have been that hard to fix this but now they've screwed up fixing it so many times that now I think it's going to be very difficult to try to fix this there's also CU now they've promised this stupid truck and so anyone they promised it to now wants it because let's face it pay to win pay to win game mechanics work because losers no offense losers buy them so that they can not have to get good or whatever and look like look look I'm not
the kind of person that's going to sit and be all sweaty at a game and and be like get good oh pay to win I if a game is just really hard and the community is like super to it and intense I'm also not going to pay to be competitive like Oh My Bullets do two times as much damage or whatever like no I understand that at some point I'm going to kind of age out of being able to play whatever the the hippest Esports game is and I'm I'm just not going to be competitive at it and no you don't have
to give me like a like a oh I heard you spend eight hours out of your day working instead of just playing video games here how about we just take half of what you made today so that you can feel like a big shot against the kid like what what even is this what Twisted mindset is making people buy these mechanics it's it's like it's it's it's demented to me I mean the real solution the proper solution is better matchmaking obviously just have the Casual dads off in their like crappy
server where they can just spray and prey all over the place and then put all the skilled players in the in the same in the same Lobby like it's it's very doable and some games do it very well but I guess it's more work and it's less lucrative and people will give you money for these kinds of silly upgrades so I guess that's why it keeps perpetuating and again it comes back to what we said last week guys don't give the money for it like man grow a backbone good Lord Gamers but but those people who buy into
those mechanics now that battle state has promised it well they're backs to a wall now their game is just ruined yeah um Because unless they give it to everyone then it's not fair and once they do give it to everyone it's Modern Warfare then the game's ridiculous yeah yeah oh well well now now we need an escalation point I paid $250 for my addition to the game and now you gave this stupid track to everybody well now I need a satellite death laser because otherwise how what's the point of me paying
$250 did someone find it what now oh no I think they yeah they rickrolled me oh I got wrecked no uh okay so there there's some interview with him with Nikita the the like I think he's the COO but he's the main person that talks publicly um there's some interview with him from a long time ago I can't find it right now I swear I'm not hallucinating this but um is Luke in AI this topic next he's talking about how uh cheaters he had like a a realization that cheaters are actually a good thing for your game
because when your player base is like stressed out and uncomfortable with the cheater situation it increases what he calls donations and I'm like wow you know what donations this kind of makes a lot of sense what's a donation I think I think that's when he used to make mobile games so I think he was talking about like uh pay to win mechanics they're going to buy them more if there's cheaters in the game oh my God I'm not 100% certain I'm trying to find the interview but I I
can't find it right now I I know on the subreddit before but I'm having a hard time trying to find it that is that actually hurts my brain you have successfully hurt my brain this whole it's Friday and you hurt my brain it's a good time you can recover before the week start why would you do that to me what did I do to you I hate that so much so so so hold on hold on tin foil hat tin foil hat coming on right now cheating exists in video games to sell micro I so I I have to say
one I need to actually find this video and two it's a translation from Russian so the translation could be wrong right so like I I don't know 100% oh did people just find it I think they did am I getting Rick Rolled again this is not what I'm talking about not the text interview okay it's a there's a video anyways we don't have to try to hunt it down but there's uh so there's there's some very active communities forming right now um this is cool though actually I don't know how much we want
to go into it I don't know a lot okay right I mean is there a downside I I'm wondering if they can issue like takedowns for it or anything even talk it's not like these guys what what issue takedown for the W show yeah if battle State wants to take down the W show you know what that's fine I'll go to I'll go toot toe that I got no problem with that all right what are they going to what are they going to do what kind of under what Authority would some stupid Russian entity take down
our podcast like you got to be kidding me in order for play yes this is the interview okay okay okay we found it hold on this interview there we go so the post is in order for players to donate you need to keep them in a state of discomfort um this is a very old you can see Moscow 2015 so 2015 is if I remember correctly Technically when tarov started but this is as they're so they're pivoting off of like the mobile game they used to make some game called contract Wars which is
either like a mobile game or a browser game or something I don't remember what and then they pivoted into a skap from tarov and this is like as that pivot is kind of happening um he talks about yeah cheaters are always such a serious thing  Revelation both ways okay I'll say it good Lord for me it was honestly a revelation how you perceive it is of course your business if there are a lot  cheaters so what people just assume cheaters make other players uncomfortable so they true assume their
advantage is that they had the main rule is to donate you need to keep the player in a state of discomfort the main rule  donate so like his his point is if your players are uncomfortable they're going to try to like get an edge pay to get advantages to get an edge stuff like that oh my God not great again I don't know the full context of that interview the translation might be wrong there's a lot of things that could be po potentially wrong with that I wouldn't take that as
like a 100% thing be careful there yeah yeah don't fall for misinformation so when it full plane chat is saying the translation is accurate but like we I don't I I don't know we generally trust float plane pretty good it's probably float plane chats usually pretty reliable I mean I wouldn't trust twitch chat as far as I could throw them and they're literally digital they have no weight whatsoever I could throw them very far far yeah I could throw them very far that is unless we have to
account for wind resistance but I'm going to assume this is a great 11 physics   spherical um but yeah rigid body cow there are multiplayer host it yourself play with your friends things happening very very actively right now for tarov um I have seldom seen this much dedication and action on a project uh it's it's moving very very fast uh there's some videos on YouTube of people playing it I'll have no fur like Gamers scorned truly and a bunch of extremely hardcore Gamers scorned as well yeah um
because the the dedication to this is mad I mean obviously if they're going to sell $150 okay so the fact that the community is so outraged and so universally outraged over $150 version of the game means that let's do the math a significant number of them bought it because if nobody bought it people have been like yeah whatever that silly $150 version of the game that nobody bought who cares but no this is a game that people are invested in yeah and that's dangerous and I don't even think
honestly for battle State I don't care if if that Edge of Darkness Edition thing was originally 250 bucks I bet you like a ton of people yeah people would have been upset but they would have bought it I do think the truck would have been a line yes I think the truck still would have been a line the truck is a big line the call in people to raid thing is a big line that's ridiculous and and then going back on your word is a big line those those three things is what has crushed this community but the
community defies the community is not crushed the community made their own tarov basically by having a bunch of single so single player tarov spbt has been a thing for a long time yeah um but it was you know single single player there's a bunch of mods for it though that you can make the game so much better than the multiplayer experience but it was just a single player experience now there's f a multiplayer mod uh and I've seen some videos I have genuinely not touched this but I've seen
some videos of people playing and it looks smooth and there isn't a lot of like you know uh desync between the players it it it looks like at least as good as live as far as I can tell watching other people's gameplay of the you know the synchronization of the two players or multiple other players playing in the game and then some of the mods for single player tarov work with the multiplayer mod so you can just make your own tarov that's better in all the ways except for there
isn't PVP but the active PVP in tarov is so over riddled by cheaters that it's like it's kind of a non-factor any you just cut that cut that limb off you know it's probably fine um so that's that's that's pretty cool in other gaming news we do have another actually very big topic yeah I won bro versus bro okay we can go there that's a big top we can I'm down or we can talk about how Hell divers now will not let you they're getting review bomb now right yeah I have not kept up with this at all other
than that chat will not stop talking about hell divers not going to lie that's the main reason why I know about it when did this even happen it must have happened like yeah all the articles are from from today so this is like very very new uh pirate software is apparently popping off about it um yeah not good from from my understanding it has shown as a requirement on their steam page the whole time that you need a PSN but it wasn't enforced the whole time oh so you so to play on PC you need
a Playstation network account now I mean it wasn't required before though I see so people have played this whole time and and here's the spicy part cuz that at first I was like that's really annoying but I didn't fully fully understand it and then pirate software's tweet made me fully understand it uh there are certain countries so where where psn's just straight up not available something like that yeah yeah py software says for all those here I'll go to my uh all of those
saying to just make a PSN account bro if you've been playing hell divers 2 and do not live in one of these listed countries you cannot make a PSN account choosing a country you do not live in is a violation of Sony's TOs and could lead to account termination then again like what what is the drawback of that account being terminated does it matter well you can't play right but then couldn't you just register on a different PSN account you tied your Steam account o so you're effectively banned
from the game yeah that's bad yeah yeah super bad so like there there's going to be a bunch of people that this happens to so this is is just objectively not a good thing at that point cuz there's people that were playing no problem just fine probably loving the game cuz it's a great game they roll a patch they roll a patch and now they can't yeah and you shouldn't just like suddenly require a new account sign up once the game's been out for like months well they didn't suddenly require it they suddenly
enforcedly enforce it yeah yeah yeah fair enough and it is up to you whether to enforce your rules or not however that's a pretty that's a pretty crappy rule it seems unnecessary given that obviously they didn't have it before and it clearly wasn't necessary yeah uh I mean this is this obviously part of their agreement with Sony I guess so that they can Farm your data um I believe it's a Sony published game or something that's tough something I'm not 100% I mean it does seem like like
an easy solution to this would be to oh man what is the easy solution because there's no way Sony's going to just like suddenly allow you to register from a different country how on Earth say they going to fix this I have no idea because there's no way Sony's going to let them out of that requirement I don't think they're going to roll it back they obviously would have known that this was going to generate a bunch of backlash yeah maybe they didn't maybe they underestimated how angry Gamers can be I bet you
honestly even they didn't consider this angle that pirate software pointed out because the the initial one is kind of annoying and I could understand honestly some people boycotting it because like oh you make me get this new account thing how dare you I don't personally care that much but the second you're going to block out there's people that will be like mad that you're doing a giveaway because you have to have a Twitter account and they're like well I don't have one it's like bro Twitter's
free well I want them to have my information bro make a proton mail account who gives a just put in some fake information but but it's like it's on principle for these people right so I could see someone just like on principle refusing to create a Sony  this is much worse this is much much worse yeah the second the second it comes down to our our our you know our fellow democracy spreaders potentially no longer being able to play the game that's that's where a line has been
crossed for me apparently you have to tie your phone number to Twitter now good Lord what a crappy platform you can probably put a fake one in um no cuz you Pro they probably send you a text oh you think so yeah probably stupid I used to put the White House for my address for like almost everything nice just worked all the time I almost always use 90210 as a zip code whenever I register for anything American there you go yeah exactly and it's like you have to put in an address
and I'm like well I'm Canadian there's no drop down for Canada it only allows us well I guess I live at the White House now there's there is probably junk mail addressed to me that has shown up to the White House I thought about that  who the is this Luc lafier that would actually be kind of hilarious prank signing the White House up for like magazine subscriptions and stuff I just thought you guys might want this you know right I don't know just I I'm I'm trying to I'm just trying to imagine like what
would be some what would be some fun subscriptions you know you you got to know this happens so much that it's probably like d apparently it goes to an off-site facility for processing for security reason that that makes a ton of sense yeah I um we were oh apparently I missed lwig in the YouTube chat oh that's a bummer oh wait no one cares lonus stop something all right hey thanks lwig thanks for showing up oh this must have been because I was talking about bro versus bro nice okay well should we just
do that now nice yeah yeah so that was fun I went down to La for a number of events um now that it's now that it's over I don't have any sort of security concerns about it so I I attended the retirement party for Matt Pat Uh he is is no longer working at game theorist that doesn't mean he's no longer going to work at all he seemed to be in very good spirits um I don't know him especially well or anything like that but we've talked a couple of times obviously have a ton of respect for his
work and he seems like one of those people that you meet in person and you're like all right well you know don't take this the wrong way but I think I had the full experience of meeting you and getting your deal from watching your videos uh and to be clear obviously you know is who he is yeah he'll say things off camera that he wouldn't say on camera but if you watch Matt Pat's videos and you're like wow he seems like a likable dude then I think you'll meet him in person and think wow he seems like a
likable dude uh very very genuine guy uh he and Steph absolutely fantastic I've done a ton for the platform I've done a ton for the community um so I was very honored to to be able to be down there for that um and then since I was heading down uh that was actually the thing that um instigated my trip I was like holy schnikes I've been supposed to do a bro versus bro with lwig forever yeah he came up here and did that collab with us and I told him at the time I was like I
owe you one thank you very much that was absolutely fantastic um Anytime by the way and he's like by the way I'm in LA and I was like good for you heck yeah yeah yeah um heck yeah right so I'm okay I'm coming down to La can we make this work can we try and put these two things together and then stars align and I ended up doing one more thing while I was down there so on the Tuesday I uh I shot a video in collaboration with HP Enterprise and kokia do you know about this I know some amount about it on the
spaceborn to computer oh so they rented and I kid you not this is apparently don't quote me on this because who knows sometimes people just like they they talk it and like you know they talk a big game but it's actually whatever but apparently the set that they rented was at least a piece of the same one that they used on Big Bang Theory when walowitz goes to the ISS so I'm in this like ISS looking set and then they have a couple of the actual machines that were just sent up to the
ISS and I think it was uh February of this year and we talk about all the things about them that are custom for space all the things about them that are not space hardened in any way whatsoever some of the experiments that they've done over the years some of the benefits of having this processing on board on the International Space Station versus having the processing done I mean yeah I guess they can have a CL they can have cloud computing from up there they just beam it down instead of up
right versus reverse cloud computing versus having processing done in the cloud um so that's going to be a super cool video so we shot that on the Tuesday and then I I came back up Tuesday night but the highlight of the trip the absolute highlight of the trip for me was uh participating in bro versus bro what's really funny about this is I don't just one before you get into the Bro versus bro I was going to show you but there's there's not really much there but the reason why I knew
that that happened was because my my friend person from NASA oh yeah got me to go down there and then now I just like play games with them for fun he sent me a message and was like uh how' you guys do this it was a screenshot out of the like ask yard he was like what okay I was like hold on what is this we're not going to spoil what we beamed to the ISS okay okay okay but we did we did get we we we got we got certain access and we definitely beamed a message to the International Space
Station also they're still interested in potentially doing a video on Mission Control Center design and stuff like that I think it would be really good but um so anyway what's really funny about bro versus bro with lwig was that having I don't watch a lot of YouTube and I've been I've been very open with this about this in the past I'm not I'm not trying to be like an or anything like that not know what it was it's just the truth well don't you remember on W show when I essentially pitched a gaming
challenge with him after he said I will beat Linus at literally any game and I pitched a gaming challenge that was essentially bro versus bro yeah I think I remember that yeah I had no idea at the time I wasn't doing a bit I know I believe you cuz I know you don't watch YouTube you just read just read the comments exactly so so bro versus bro is his format where each of the two competitors brings some Advantage games into the game pool and then there are also some neutral games in the game pool
so the neutral games are Battleship Tetris um for for this one anyway uh pong and rock paper scissors and then we each brought our own Advantage games he brought buo Kart um oh shoot what were his other Advantage games I remember that one well because geog guesser one of his geog guesser was one of them yep and then he also brought uh Tekken Tekken 8 oh okay I didn't see that and then my advantage games were um TowerFall okay beat saber and drunken fight simulator which if you
remember you didn't pick Halo if you remember is a game that you and I played yeah I remember one time four years ago why would you pick that when we had a gaming night where we decided we were going to play something fresh this was very fun actually and we sorted the entire steam store by Price low to high and just started buying the cheapest games Barrow yeah Barrow Barrow 2020 let's go sick drunken fight we played some uh some disc Jam that was actually pretty fun legitimately fun before the
servers got shut down don't buy it now waste of money now the servers if you want a fun game to buy now that is is kind of in this realm of like silly entertaining games tape to tape yeah we're having a blast genuinely actually very fun um and like pretty well made so check it out um so so anyway I so I brought drunken fight simulator to the to the fight beautiful um so so that's our pool of 10 games and the the way the format works is you kick off with a rock paper scissors which he didn't show
which is a shame actually because it was part of the the reason why I led the way that I did in the rock paper scissors rock paper scissors in the rock paper scissors that we that ended up deciding it uh was because I figured he wouldn't expect me to do the same thing again but he was actually playing a completely different mind game with me now I have to admit something lwig if you're watching this um one of the best Gamers I know even if she's not too good with a controller or
a keyboard and mouse and she hasn't played a lot of video games is my wife and one of the things that she does is she will be constantly even when she is very clearly in a dominant position on the board constantly talking about how she doesn't really know what she's doing and she's just kind of doing stuff have you ever played a strategy game with that woman I don't think so I vowed 15 years ago at some point during a family game night that I would never play Risk with
her again never because because she has like you know me I'm I'm pretty intense yeah and I I'll be like I'll be like I have to warn people before we play video games with you yeah I'll like start I'll I'll start to call shots on the board I'll be like okay so everyone can see right now that player a is is in a position where look I can't do anything to about any of this because I'm stuck in bloody South America where you people exiled me but they are about to take over Asia and their borders are
completely for ready to be fortified and if you or you don't do anything this game is over like like I'm I'm very like that inciting uh inciting action from others well no I'm not because nobody likes that guy oh so so Ivonne will be just like so apologize when she attacks people and stuff so she'll be the nice person GOA that doesn't say yeah sorry I'm not really I'm not really sure how to play I don't really know what I'm doing sorry I took all over all your places so I have to admit lwig
during the rock paper scissors match oh I was I was taking a page out of my wife's book a little bit got it like I and to be clear to be clear so you had you had a strategy what I said what I said was true I don't know rock paper scissors meta like I don't I don't know I was looking it up I was looking it up later and apparently statistics Bally scissors is the least common throw for example uh men have a tendency to throw rock first and there's like of course we do man there's there's all these like
mind games and stuff so when he's when he's telling me things like you sick who froze that there like I legitimately didn't I didn't know why that was a weird thing to do or whatever but what I was definitely trying to do was I a bit of a rockower myself was was trying to get in his head yeah is I was I was I wasn't trying to figure out what he would do that was how I lost the first two you trying to figure out what he thought you would do yes yeah yeah yeah that's what
I was trying to figure out what does he think cuz cuz I I don't I've I've only hung out with him a couple times now and both times professionally like we don't know each other super well or anything so his entire experience with me is both relatively recent and relatively short so all I had to do was think about absolutely everything he knows about me and try and figure out what he thought I would do and then try and get one ahead of it and so ultimate ultimately you know
spoiler alert but it's definitely still worth watching um yeah man I don't know how you were confident he messages me right after and he's like never lost hope never lost hope how could you not have lost hope when we were 44 in our final game and then rock paper scissors was best of five I was down two nothing how could you possibly not have lost rock paper scissors is like that rock paper scissors is a super swingy game yeah I guess cuz people will like if if you like fall on your back foot in
rocket paper scissors you'll just like chain bad ideas but that didn't even happen I counted it took us I think it was either 12 or 13 to have five winners yeah that I don't know if that is normal but it doesn't it didn't feel normal I think it's pretty normal it felt kind of there's a huge amount of rock paper scissors games that I've been involved in I'm making this sound like I do this often which is not true just to be clear but like you people will throw the same
thing all the time super common okay all right yeah and and and that's the other thing that I said that was true by the way lwig I actually don't I don't really play which he's not going to be happier hearing me say right now cuz he got like he he he seemed he seemed a little upset about me beating him at things and being like I don't play this you don't play that many games yeah I mean it is true when I you used to play a lot when I was going through trying to find my advantage games though man why didn't
you pick Halo why didn't you pick uh Supreme Commander I okay okay okay well there were a couple factors remember I'm an Entertainer yeah I'm not going to pick Supreme Commander SubCom would not have been fun yeah that's not that's not engaging for the audience just like watching someone not know how to play an RTS and like most complicated RTS yeah it's it's not it's up there it's I wouldn't say it's the most complicated necessarily but it's definitely kind of Arcane like the way
that it works is fundamentally different from the normal way that an RTS Works where you mine materials and then you use them to make something in Supreme Commander you have a continuous economy of income and uh and use and you have to balance them yeah so it's just it's a little it's weird different to wrap your brain around um so that would not have been entertaining at all he would have had had like two things and I would have stormed in with an army and just blown blown it all up um as for why you tried
to push for Content a little bit as for why not Halo they had only one computer there we weren't in their main Studio we were cuz I was realistically I think what he really wanted was to have me down there for the yard their podcast and then well I mean what we're going to like go do that in that studio and then go do rock like bro versus bro in a different Studio like it doesn't make sense right so we we kind of had to throw together what we had with what we had so if you watch the
archive of the live which I think is unlisted now I don't know if he links it anywhere but if it's like much longer and has a lot of technical difficulties and stuff like that it's funny the number of comments that I see like what's with all the technical difficulties lest even technical like like people like actually mad about I'm like I'm a guest what I'm going to like I'm going to diagnose their capture card no I'm going to sit and patiently interact with chat and come on you guys
what do you think this is there's also like do you go into someone's house for dinner and like start cooking the meal for them like I don't care if you're a chef that's rude like what's your problem jeez it's also I mean we have technical difficulties all the time yeah exactly stuff can happen like if you've ever done anything in your life you know that things don't necessarily always work the way they're supposed to it's like man that some A+ backseat driving right there um how do you miss
abbotford you know what's funny is I even okay you know those doors that all the new houses have been installing with like the Windows like this down the I saw one and I was like I have no idea how common they are for all I know they're super trendy just in general more broadly but I saw it and I was like man that looks exactly like those doors that like my neighbor just installed in every new Housing Development locally has I wanted so badly so this is geoguesser Canada he challenged me to
geoguesser Canada I was on my home turf which is you know I if you're pushing for Content which I think you you both do which is good that's one way to take an advantaged game for him and make it more interesting I've never played geoguesser yeah I've literally never played geoguesser but as someone who has not a lot but a buddy of mine and I will will play every once in a while hi Bobby um but a buddy and I will play and Canada actually very rarely comes up so even if he plays a lot he probably
doesn't see a ton of Canada so it's like yeah this is cool mix anyway uh a location came up that was probably about 30 to 50 mil from home for me like it was embarrassing that I that I guessed across the entire fing country and it cost me the game and and almost cost me the whole challenge because if I'd won that game it would have been over I wouldn't have had to go to being down to nothing in a best of five rock paper scissors like it how close that was to losing me the game with was terrible so
basically what was going on in my head this was the very first round of geoguesser I've never played before I didn't really understand how quickly you should be moving around and stuff I saw that I hadn't really watched him play yeah you want to zoom yeah and so I was just there I was I was like oh can you know can I see anything that's a hint no all the license plates are kind of blurred I guess I won't be able to rely  and um and it felt so close to home that I second guessed myself I went there's
no way they got to be more common than that there's no way the first one is just going to be in my backyard I don't know some suburb in Ontario and I ended up being off by like "2,000 miles because Canada is enormous" or or what whatever it is my big crutch for geoguesser is domains domains because it's it's usually worldwide and I find that the really big countries like the US and Canada really actually don't come up that much it's often Europe EUR various European little European countries so
even if you're off you're going to be clish but if you see uh a store banner and the store Banner has their website on itnl it's like oh yeah then that's a pretty easy one cool so I'll just like Zoom around try to find something that would have a a website on it and then' be like all right cool I know where that is and I figured some of that stuff out later like how like using signs and stuff but I didn't I didn't figure it out early on it just it wasn't a game I'd played before it was brutal too
because the end score if I remember correctly was actually very close between you like really close 100 points "and he 25,000 where like almost" immediately on his screen there was a sign that just said uh what was it of yeah the name of a university or something yeah and then one or two more clicks later and it was two major highways Crossing each other was his last one and it was like oh I guess I can find exactly this spot and just get like maximum yeah so when I saw that
happening I was like oh I guess he lost cuz I thought you had it up till then cuz without basically a perfect guess yeah I know you were going to win anyways yeah yeah man how I mean realistically he had his he had his own Bamboozled moments um I still burst out laughing every time I watch his breakout gameplay I didn't see the whole thing you didn't see breakout no I saw part that's the one thing that we're going to watch together on the I saw I saw you playing I saw you
talking about the laggy input and then I saw them try to show like it's not laggy and I'm watching just being like what do you mean I can I can see it's laggy through the power of the internets but um I didn't get to watch the rest of it I was like busy doing stuff and I was just trying to tune in when I could yeah yeah that's fine the this is man this is absolutely wild though okay so here uh I'm I'm bringing it up on the on the stream version hey Dan am I going to have audio here
uh yes you are not playing anything now I sure am not uh am I now yes all right here let's go so lineus laptop here we go make sure that you guys can hear it too okay so he's just he's playing around with it a little bit to kind of get a feel for the leg Yeah Yeah Yeah that's smart I think it's this one he's got control he's got oh he keeps like dot he's he's got control oh is the audio really bad only for us most likely only for us oh okay cool one yeah I mean oh God okay I hope pressure but it
should be why is it so bad for us sounds like sample rate mismatch okay oh my God what no no he got it he he got it he got it I hate when it's like flat okay so don't don't worry about it so we get five balls we were going to play Pong but we couldn't find a pong that would accelerate the ball in between shots we couldn't find a web pong that would work properly that's weird cuz that's just how pong Works isn't it it gets faster as you play see through the camera it means it's that much okay the audio
doesn't really matter that much doesn't really matter that but a lot of you were able to you should just I'm just going to turn the audio off forget it so  whoa what was that he's cruising along and then just gets absolutely completely just Bamboozled so he's got to get 102 points to beat me oh that was close and he's  what is is the orange and the red just like that no they they speed it up but I don't think they're supposed to actually change the angle the angle yeah but the
but the higher bricks are worth way more points so the lower ones are worth one each and then I think it goes up to three and then like five or seven or something but it just like it just tosses it on a weird look at your face you love this I couldn't I couldn't believe it I couldn't believe it I felt I mean I like winning obviously but I felt terrible for the guy because that was ridiculous ridiculous and with how leggy the controls were you can't be reacting to like catch
it yeah especially the first one would just it looked completely broken I just I don't know yeah oh yeah no it was ridiculous that's that's unfortunate when you when you don't like prep the games ahead of time well honestly we had the same issue in drunken fight simulator like it didn't I I swear to you the controls are worse than they were when we played markedly worse very noticeably worse like we could barely we could barely Orient our guys to face the same way and the animations weren't even smooth
like like sometimes you could get them to turn a little bit I think I think it worked better the time that we played and obviously game hasn't been patched I mean that's probably why yeah come on right so it barely worked at all um epic yeah yeah it was it was a lot of fun though he was an absolutely great host what I said about him on the yard I I stand by 100% I think that he is an S tier host I think he's a a born Entertainer and you could basically drop him into pretty much anything and he
would manag to to to find the entertainment find the humor um and it just it doesn't surprise me what a success the guy's been even if you know like I said I don't I don't watch a ton of content um and honestly the rest of the the rest of the team was great I was razing them a little bit on the podcast I don't know if you've watched it you you listen to the yard right it's up now uh not or you used to anyway yeah uh I will probably listen to it at some point I my thing with the yard is I I had this
great appreciation for the yard because um I I gained a ton of weight over covid and the the best and safest thing for me to do for a while was just go walk so I would walk for like hour and a half to two hours every day right just to get tons of steps in so I would listen to Just the yard constantly because it was really entertaining and it would make me I would want to listen to it so I would want to go outside and walk cuz I wouldn't let myself listen to it without walking having been on it I still don't
understand what it is about what is the podcast about is it just white guys talk about things podcast cuz yeah all right yeah yeah fair enough I guess it's about white women and dogs all right just just that's that's the topic that's what it's about sure yeah cuz they like there wasn't it didn't seem like I don't think there's like a said like this is this is like a tech news show but what do we talk about half the time what's the point of this show I don't know yeah exactly what's
the point of who knows I don't know it's called the yard it's like some dude sitting in chairs in a yard called them out hard on their like tier like little bro controller uh setup for their guests oh is it that they all had like really nice that's another thing I don't watch it cuz I would just listen to it I was walking they have really nice mic arms so they can like shift in their chair yeah and like have their mic like right next to their mouth and stuff and I'm just mine's just on
like a light stand so I had to like sit up like I had a broomstick up my butt the whole time and to be clear it was it was fine they were all very courteous guests I gave I gave the rest of the guys a bit of a of a like I razed them a little bit I was like I don't even know who you guys are um but they were absolutely fantastic and I I was mostly just leaning into it later just to just to Ras them because it's not like they didn't take their opport with me so I'm sure yeah we didn't even make it
through bro versus bro without him bringing up the the hard R incident oh really yeah I didn't realize that I suspected they would have on the yard out of all the meme faces and like everything that's gone on here in the 11 years that I've been doing this at lonus Media Group really the hard r one is the one that has made its way into the general Consciousness I think more than anything else and for those of you who aren't familiar um on an episode of The W show some time ago I don't even
remember but I I I alluded to having used what I thought that meant I thought it meant I thought it meant the the mental disability slur and I was talking about how it was culturally acceptable to use it in the early 2000s like in high school and I referred to it as the hard R thinking that that's what that meant but I found out that means a very different word in fact doesn't begin with R yeah but there why would why would it be why what how does the word hard hard make any sense with the
previous one well I don't know well because it's it's a hard word I don't know I don't know I they're talking about how you pronounce the r at the end of the word I understand now thank you very much Professor Linguistics you the worst part about this for me is people just constantly bring it up around me I'm like I don't want talk about this like what do you mean like I I'll have I'll I'll have never met this person before don't know that they know me or anything and they'll just walk and be
like hard are I'm like why I don't want anyone around me to hear that you're saying this to me like I don't like if we're in private conversation maybe but people are just walking up to me and saying hard R in public and I'm like  you so you've yeah you've cursed me if that if that makes you feel any better that's pretty funny yeah I thought you might like that yeah I mean I mean how many things in your life are cursed because of me probably a lot that can't be the worst one yeah I don't know oh
man yeah that's great um I I had the pleasure of I had the pleasure of bringing up the Ice Climbers video that you L me to YouTube video of all yeah so poor lwig um got to realize that the only video I'd ever watched of him was actually slime's video which I realize as I'm sitting there on their podcast oh man I I found them through uh slime wire as well slime's Channel I didn't I didn't actually cuz I don't watch streams at all ever I had no idea how profitable podcasting was I think
they make more on the yard than we do on any individual property including wo "like they like they have 40,000" subscribers to just the weekly podast I mean why do we do w for fre wait what's the point of the subscribers do they get it early or something or like they get a decent amount of extra content oh do they okay kind the yard's patreon is actually like pretty good yeah maybe we should learn some things I'm going your laptop I mean I've brought them up a few times oh get out of here no one will
respond to that if you email it um I don't know if it's going to show here but yeah see premium episodes I don't know I don't know like do they do a thing at the end of the show or something it didn't seem like it not with me anyway it seemed like everything we shot was the the thing that was uploaded so yeah so they have premium episodes they have this yeah Aiden's advice um I don't know they've got other stuff so there's a bunch of a bunch of extra content I think there's a pretty
big lean on extra content got it and then there's you know Discord access the normal stuff postcards I don't know what's up with that first look at all merch and discounts that's cool yeah so their merch sells out crazy fast as far as I can tell like they they had a like a coffee book or something yeah coffee book like coffee table book or whatever they're called um and apparently it's sold out in like 5 minutes and they have to do a second printing now or something like that that's wild oh they have a
cool tier at the end there that I'm not going to say lonus figures out something he does for four plus hours a week can make money okay I know it can make money it's just it's just that it could make more the point the point is just that I I had I had no idea how how invested people um get in like podcasts like I just yeah I I don't know I don't know I don't I don't consume them this this is one of those things that I don't consume so but they're selling an actual just
lawn chair yeah it's it's pretty comfy I sat on it during bro versus bro it's a rocking lawn chair that's funny would why not right I don't know we made a screwdriver who knows yeah exactly here here's what I was talking about it's it's a little blurred cuz I'm not subscribed to their patreon but you see the chair there but it's a lawn chair yeah they kill it they 42582 members that's that's some monster member count yeah heck yeah no kidding it definitely made me feel like we need a set upgrade
we are probably we are probably we probably have the highest um sort of General reach and influence to set construction quality ratio on the internet at this point like the W show is lowkey a gigantic podcast like we have anywhere from 600 to "700,000 weekly viewers of the video" thing I don't even know how many people watch it or listen to it on podcast platforms but lwig pointed out to me that thousands of people apparently watch on Twitter which I had I didn't even know we just like turn it on I
think never looked at once I have no I have never once looked at how many people are watching we our streaming setup we can just like add streaming destinations no problem yeah so so we should just stream everywhere every once in a while we're just like oh there's another one we didn't think of we're on Tik Tok now yeah do you know about that we're on Tik Tok right now yeah Tik Tok "holy fuing there are 11,000 people" apparently watching on Twitch sup dudes what are you even doing with your
life why are you watching live why are you watching a 4our video on Twitter yes you're being called out get attacked why would you watch this show go outside nerds no it's some grass it's fine to watch the show the internet just what are you doing watching it on Twitter apparently our chat is verified only can we un that it because that's cringe that'll probably get so oh sure oh deal with that dude I'm not no no I'm not I'm not you're right you're right I'm just saying I'm not going to even be
unmoderated I'm not even I don't even free form this is the very last time that I am ever going to look at it so it doesn't matter that's probably true how long have we even been streaming on there I don't know few few weeks now months something like that I no one I mean are these just all Bots anyway like look don't look at the comments buddy here is like didn't even know this was a thing so pretty active chat is that the only verified user I don't know cuz it's verified only chat
and that's the only comment I don't know if you can check the kind of sick I think I like that that's good we should keep it that way sup Mario all right well there you go there's two of them now things are Tak off yeah that's probably we got to get out of here we got to not encourage this that's the end of the attention for the CH yeah that is hilarious I wonder what lwig thinks about us being openly hostile against most of our viewership of the wed show no no we are not openly
hostile to most of the viewership we are openly hostile toward most of the viewing platforms we are openly hostile to Twitch Twitter Facebook actually Facebook we more just ambivalent about we got 18 on Facebook why exactly we love you guys that's those are our real viewers in the words in the words of Nita from Battle State G those are the True Believers Luke's mom is legit way too tech savvy to be watching on Facebook yeah yeah she has a float plane account exactly got him
um yeah and I don't know I don't think we're openly hostile to Tik Tok how many people are watching on Tik Tok well you didn't even know they existed we got 238 241 yeah see okay that kind of makes sense who would be watching this on Tik Tok like that yeah that yeah I mean our we had like 10 oh so we doubled is what you're trying to say 200 is more oh so we 20x yeah don't I think part of the problem is there's like there is a when there is a account on Tik Tok called The W show
but our actual account is called thew doow seriously yeah so I wasn't even on the right page this shows you what I know about Tik Tok like we don't stream W show on the Linus Tech tips Tik Tok I I know why maybe that I'm sure someone there's some reason for that I'm sure hey look at that but here's the like yeah that's the real wait it's not vertical is it I don't know oh no these are no oh this hilarious these are Clips okay so the W show is live okay okay so Dan what's our what's our Spotify
numbers I hope they're good because like I lowkey legitimately thought that the the W show is like kind of a big podcast and if I find out now that it's actually a really small podcast then my people get very small well I mean we're we're fourth in the US for Tech like news that seems kind of uh looks like 500 even on "the podium then 500,000 listeners in the" last month oh that seems like a fair bit I don't know is that I have no idea no context for super related like they're
like uh cryptocurrency trading podcast stuff like it's anything that could fall under Tech okay so what what are the what are the ones ahead of us Dan again uh there's a cyber security one a cryptocurrency one and the Wall Street Journal how do we find Wall Street Journal uh it comes to my email oh uh do you have a way of screen sharing or just forward it to one of these accounts I will try and find it that might take too long so apparently there's a theory on why the W show is so big okay and it's
because people fall asleep and then when they wake up they're watching the WAN show they were talking about this on the waveform podcast a week or two ago wow they're like yeah how often is it how often is it that you go to sleep and when you wake up you're listening to lonus and Luke talk about tech on the L show and they were like very often which I think is pretty funny who's sleeping for like 3 hours FL plane chat is like no this is 100% a thing this happens to be sleeping for fix your sleep no no no
no no no they're not sleeping for 3 hours they go to sleep listening to something and then it autoplays all night and they wake up in the middle of a 6-hour w show ends up landing on exactly got it well okay then everyone else just needs to figure out their game figure out the market man we cornered  okay you can find your own and the show is so long so we can have every single keyword in the video description and in the timestamps yeah yeah right you just got to figure it out
we that's fantastic fantastic uh okay so Dan uh do do you do you have the list no I'm looking for it currently okay fine you can just you can just or like can you just is this something you can just search for like the oh I might be able to find it hold on try different Spotify works oh we're not on Spotify we're using a new thing called megaphone by Spotify on what yeah megaphone what why do you why do why do you need megaphones ah chartable so uh megaphone allows us
to simultaneously post it everywhere and also manage all of the podcast simultaneously previously we would have to do is go to each individual um oh no I don't want to sign up I want to log in uh we'd have to go to each individual platform and then post it there right because we've got Tech linked and game linked as a as a podcast now chable doesn't even show us in the top oh it's United States of America okay I'm looking at our statistics if do you make money on like a Spotify podcast uh yes we we make
money do we really yes so one of the reasons I moved us over to megaphone was part of their um audience uh Spotify Audience Network which allows us to I'm so sorry uh do targeted advertising um we can also insert advertisements as necessary and it's all sort of automated interesting people know that they don't have to listen to those ads and they can just like watch on YouTube where we don't insert ads in the L show right yeah or say you have something like Spotify Premium I don't believe the ads
are served oh got it okay well that's uh that's that's neat I guess should we jump into a topic oh no we're supposed to explain merch messages hey oh yeah that's right so while I was down there for lwig stream someone uh sent him a super chat for $500 which I thought was pretty wild and uh and even he seemed like kind of taken aback by it he was like yeah I have kind of a policy anything above a $100 I don't give any kind of different reaction to because you want to encourage like degenerate Behavior yeah
you don't want to encourage people to just be giving way too much money to people that you know OB because like some of those people maybe that is totally fine for them but you're also they're some people are a little silly with their money sometimes and they'll see something like that happen and do it when that's the last $100 they have left yeah which they really shouldn't do and I would never encourage someone to do and like maybe if it's the oil princes or whatever like who cares yeah sure why
not and then I think he said something along the lines of like anything above $500 he like doesn't acknowledge or something like that like I I can't remember exactly how he explained like his his sort of person person approach to it um based our approach is I'll take your $500 in fact I'll take a I'll take "$5,000,000 in exchange $500,000 I will" send you some fine merchandise from LTT store.com we really do have an extremely broad range of products these days we've got everything from your from hats to uh
oh man we oh we've got some really cool new stuff this week we've got hats we've got tools we've got cable organizers man this product is like my favorite thing ever look at this GIF man you just put that put that little magnet on there it's a gif Luke get over it put that little GIF on there reviews solid absolutely love it uh to remove the triangle piece oh okay product is great oh shipping took long oh that's too bad well everyone says the product is great and I guess we need to get our shipping
sorted out but hey that's our transparency for you so you can check out reviews we've got a lot of great products we've got some really cool stuff this week have you seen this yet Luke uh well I'm wearing one of them oh that is hilarious Luke is wearing a dead pixel it's the dead pixel collection folks and we've got so much cool stuff want to be the Vana today uh sure we've got a dead pixel monitor enamel pin it's on there it's on there it is a little hard to see can that's the point can we
get it the point there's a dead pixel I got it we've got a dead pixel sticker sheet so you could put a dead pixel on your house you could put a dead pixel on the bumper each one of these stickers is a pixel yep you could put a dead pixel on the bumper of your car you could put a dead pixel on your water bottle you could put it anywhere you want we've got the dead pixel desk pad can we take this out uh nope not necessary I think people understand the point it's a black mouse pad there's a
white dead pixel on it somewhere I'm told they're all different as well that is so cool that is really cool wait is that true of all of them that maybe that's only the shirts I don't know don't don't quote me on that cuz I'm pretty sure the enamel pin is always in the same place so I don't know the dead pixels on it somewhere maybe they're the same maybe some of them are different it's all it's all part of the fun considering the enamel pin it's like it's not part of the paint it's actually
part of the like metal I think it's molded yeah uh anyway this I believe was a Sarah brainstorm a while back and I was basically like not only do we need to do this we need to do so much more of this um so it's man yeah we we we ended up with an entire collection so you guys can check it out by clicking it there uh sticker sheet did I miss anything no but you can get a bundle oh that's cool okay so you can get some bundle savings $59.99 for the entire dead pixel collection and this is the same quality
desk pad that you guys have come to know and love from us don't take my word for it take the word of all of the people who have bought our desk pads over the years uh the one that has sold the most is of course the Northern Lights design and this is a festar product quite literally a five-star product with thousands of reviews we've sold tens and tens of thousands of these so it's a really great great quality pad the only problem with it is that hey if there's a dead pixel I'm afraid we will not be
accepting a return on this desk pad if it has more than five dead pixels in a cluster then I would accept I would accept a return for that seems fair yeah that seems fair there you go there's your uh there's your there's your dead pixel right there Doo and full PL chat said so last week was a setup right you are yeah very clever of us anyway the point is I think we've uh so yeah if you want to send a merch message all you got to do is head to LTT store.com add something

number of these discounts available so if you want to get a deal on the backpack grab it now uh Dan uh do you want to throw a couple of merch messages at us and we can show the people how it works sure thing uh let's see Jacob here Dino pins when uh at Luke can you talk about your experience with Shopify and your team's process as a Shopify developer i' love to hear your thoughts on not building a custom theme h on not building a custom theme man I mean sorry to jump in it
would be very unlike me to do that if someone specifically asked Luke a question totally yeah yeah um do it faster I don't even think it's an option what do you mean like not not doing a custom theme like honestly we ran into so many I'm trying to figure out what they mean because like our theme is based on one of the Shopify themes so are they are they saying that that's not doing that I think it is doing that because we've made a lot of modifications yeah but it isn't like
custom from the ground up oh I see what you mean yeah I would say I'm not sure what they're how they're defining this got it well one way or another I'll tell you this you will run into limitations so fast if you go bone let Shopify work for you they're actually great there are limitations to it you're you're you know you're going to get frustrated sometimes cuz there's whatever weird esoteric idea that you have that isn't going to work very well with the Shopify setup but in
general Shopify is this fairly quickly considering the size of the company constantly marching forward machine that will improve and develop your store effectively for you so I would highly recommend to base off one of their themes I think the theme that we based off of is the dawn theme I believe that's it that sounds familiar and then it's heavily modified so pick pick one of the ones that you like that are on like do do a very short amount of research because it doesn't require much
to figure out which one is their most like forward which ones are their most forward facing ones right now pick one of those modify it to your liking and then as they have the I don't remember what they're called but it's the happens like I don't know twice a year or something they have these Shopify events and they announce like 10 trillion features 20% are available now 80% are going to be available over the next series of weeks or months year whatever um and then just integrate those features and
keep moving forward and then check out the App Store they they also do like a Shopify approved apps thing where there's apps that have worked more directly with Shopify those ones are often better like we work with a lot of different companies in this realm Shopify I I would probably say is one of the best ones considering what they do and how easy it is to work with them Y and considering how little you pay especially when your volume is pretty low once they once you get into them
taking a percentage of your Revenue then they end up definit like they make money on us oh yeah but they do a lot of work we don't exist without them and hiring a development team to do all the things that Shopify does for us we don't want to yeah there that's the it's not efficient yes um we we'd be better off we'd be better off making modifications to Shopify than than just trying to build our own thing from scratch and you got to consider like if you if you look at the the the service
in a really really simplified vacuum it doesn't seem that hard and then you start looking through their dashboards yeah and then you start looking deeper in their dashboards look and then it's like as someone who worked for an online retailer who didn't use Shopify I will tell you it's not better yeah yeah t Tortuga said uh have to be careful with apps uh it can get expensive so only use what you need while you grow I agree but some of the apps are also just like straight
up free um or genuinely very low cost and if you if you look at the pricing model that they have you can kind of figure out how how expensive it's going to be I personally find a lot of the apps to be actually quite affordable for what they offer um that's easy for us to say though as a store that is has has got revenue every day no like genuinely I know but but look if you're just starting out then I can definitely see how you could end up in a trap where you go oh well I can't possibly have a site
without this and this and this that's almost certainly not true and you're underwater yeah you can you can start with no apps and you'll be completely fine uh because if if you're if you're a store that's just barely starting out you probably don't need some of the fancier things that you can do with apps just wait until you need it get it later but yeah the it's good it's very good speaking of things that there's no way that you can wait until you need I am about to drive probably somewhere in the
neighborhood of 300 to 500 float plane subscribers oh wa why do you know how I'm going to do it no I'm going to tell everyone that the legendary 100% success rate chicken recipe is up that's right Luke made the 100% success chicken for Arty who uh said it's pretty good my yeah uh he also did a video showing off his BS it was Luke week on float plane so the exclusive were all luk themed actually not all Luke themed we've also got Emily's video taking a deeper dive into the Prototype via Centaur AI
accelerated CPU and I think this is from last week so it's mostly mostly Luke themed but he also did his Starfield SL gaming industry rant SL optimistic chat did you wait have you watched it how did you know that well because I I don't need man I don't need to watch a video you host I know exactly what you're going to say that's pretty funny cuz I was like there's there's I feel like there's no way he watched it but then you accurately described it better than like anyone else has so I was like how does
this make any sense also I read comments one of the one of the funny things on it that makes sense one of the funny things on that is you know haven't rode a video in six or seven years oh yeah I thought it was going to be like 9 minutes long four minutes oh wow fast man that's amazing get Luke to talk about Starfield and the gaming industry and he wraps it up in 4 minutes and 11 seconds have him talk about his birds and it takes him 20 minutes and there's an extra like minute
and a half long clip that I added at the end that's hilarious yeah and uh oh yeah and chicken chicken also takes 20 minutes so I made the Starfield video was longer I made it shorter cuz I thought it was too long I think what got me was I mentally compared it to how long the documents were that I would write for scripts back in the day yeah and I think like I don't know font or format or something must have been different like paragraph spacing or font or something so it ended up being like
half as long it was like a page and a half it's like how the heck did it come out to four minutes and 11 seconds I think it has some good content in it but I don't know nickel plain asking the big questions what do your birds think of you cooking other [Laughter] birds uh they don't seem to mind I eat chicken in front of them yeah okay and that doesn't bother them effectively every day okay all right don't seem to care what if you ate like uh something more closely related what if you ate a
cockal in front of them that might that might be a bit of an issue I might not go over raw wow like would that would they recognize like he is eating a bird I think so you think so they're pretty are they that smart like if you ate a Budgy if you Aussie Osborne a Budgy right in front of them pretty upset yeah I think that would be pretty Dan got the reference I know I know yeah yeah I just mean was that actually real did that like actually happen the bat oh yeah guys's a GU a whack gu's a whack
job that's wild um yeah some some people are asking for a state of gaming part two I don't know I feel like I kind of like owe people another one but I can't do it on the same topic because I made that one really dense I guess but it has basically everything in it like the video is actually fine being as long as it is it just doesn't have any filler oh apparent ly aie thought it was a prop but he was like so ripped out of his skull on drugs that he didn't notice they handed him a live one wow uh that's
kind of brutal actually we've all been there pretty gross so that's where Co came from yeah it's just a little  yeah it was just uh it was just quarantined in his system by like all the other wild things going on in there for 25 years or however long it was there was some jokes that of the luk week exclusive content there was um 4 minutes of video games and 40 minutes of birds yeah because of chicken and and budgies I mean that makes perfect sense uh all right anyway yeah good week on
float plan okay Dan want to hit us with another merch message sure good evening lldd I was interested in the duvet that was briefly talked about a year-ish ago any updates or has it been crushed um dead Yeah we actually still have "literally a $100,000 in alpaca wool I" heard about this yeah so um we do need to find something has any bright ideas yeah if do you want an alpaca something I mean maybe we should just make a life-size alpaca plush and then just stuff it with alpaca wool and call it a
day we did Maro underwear what about alpaca underwear well the problem is that it's loose wool because it was meant to be used as pillow stuffing so we would actually have to get it like like machine it yeah we'd have to get it I don't know yarned turned into what whatever whatever the weaving or process or whatever that is what if you made like whale plushies and then just made them incredibly expensive because they're filled with alpaca wool I mean wh it's it's a possibility yeah we could
do will plushies we could do uh we could do a bread sorus plushy and just it's yeah it's like sorry it's $100 cuz it's full of alpaca wool uh and also it smells for the first three days because it's full of alpaca wool like I don't know I don't know what to do with it um alpaca Edition screwdriver just comes what like with with just like a bushel of alpaca wool in the box like I don't know yeah it's just it's just premium packaging it doesn't make the screwdriver better in any way yeah we've
had it for like 3 years apparently it's been stored in a dry place so it's like fine it should be fine but we do really need to just put on that apparently somehow no yeah which surprised me a lot because I I don't know how much it cost like I don't know how much wool that is but that sounds like a lot of money to me and so like has alpaca wool gone up in value like is this an appreciating asset yeah  Commodities is this one of my largest personal Investments do I need to
disclose this move over gold we yeah we've got animal we're going to put option puts on alpaca pack a fiber Market oh no see hold on I'm just I'm just checking what are the what are the trends uh increasing popularity in the fashion apparel industry we got pork Futures that's a good one for you show me a graph show me a graph I need a graph someone needs to short Linus's alpaca wol not Financial advice gamma squeeze it hat okay you don't have to spam that much relax um I I don't want an alpaca
wool hat I don't I don't think I I don't know if anyone wants it okay here's the here's the market size um I I don't know what we have but I suspect it's somewhere in the the medium range I don't think it's uh particularly fine fibers where show me the price show me the bloody price okay I give up that was as much time as I'm willing to invest  now all right hit me Dan hey W crew I'm in the process of joining the US Navy to be a cyber warfare technician did y'all ever think about doing some kind of
cyber Tech work in the military or government space big fan I think I've thought about doing everything one could imagine um so I don't know how fair it is to say how' you end up here mostly accident I was just like up late and saw this video and was like oh I'll do that  resume you tell me how that worked man um uh yeah I don't know it it like sounds I think I think for a lot of people myself included it sounds really cool and then you start doing stuff in that space and you're like whoa this is
really hard uh right so yeah as for me no no I just really like computers yep and uh my my career path had already diverged they they wouldn't let me be a technician at NC did I ever tell you that no so it wasn't because of lack of certification or anything like that it was I I was wasn't the most experienced that's fine I could see how they could be concerned about the Optics of that but it had nothing to do with skill level um I was just too good at selling oh they wanted me in the front I was
like I I would like to I would like to just work in the back so I would just I would just hang out in the back and talk to the to the tech at the Langley store his name was Andrew he was sick yeah guy was awesome he was like he was one of those guys that just like well computer tech just zero given um I think I remember this dude yeah super nice guy um he kind of Ginger if I recall correctly I I hardly so I didn't require his services but I would like stand there waiting to pick up one of my
orders or whatever and the text would come out and work with people I remember were just like listening in yeah butd he was chill he was awesome uh anyway yeah they wouldn't uh they they they wouldn't let me just so I'd go back there and hang out with them and the only reason that no one would get mad at me for it was cuz like my sales were higher than anyone else in the store anyway in spite of the fact that I was just like shooting the breeze with the technician a lot of the
time cuz realistically everything I was talking about was kind of on task right like honestly how much better would Best Buy be okay let's not use Best Buy as an example how much better would your local computer store be if the sales reps spent a tenth of their time just talking  technicians yeah yeah probably I mean the the I'm going to use Best Buy anyways the Best Buy that I used to work at are computer sales crew and our Geek Squad crew when I worked there were actually pretty well linked and we did
Super well and I think it made sense cuz our team was like all quite competent no it makes it makes a ton of sense because otherwise how you going to know what to sell unless you know what comes back yeah our our store was like one of the worst in Canada or something and by the time we were done we were like number one or number two in Canada and I I we had a just fairly significant roster change and everybody was just real into it and it's it's a lot easier to sell things you like know what you're talking
about and are passionate yeah cuz most people are like okay cool I hear what you're saying everything that you're saying makes sense you have me interested in this thing because listening to passionate people is just interesting for most people exactly um yeah and it works all right what do you want to do for for a topic do we want to pick a oh you want to do sponsors dang it Dan no they deserve a topic they the topic yeah Dan gosh how about medicine says no more spam unless it's AI spam okay yeah I
don't know what the heck's going on with this meta says that they will be changing the recommendation algorithm for Instagram and threads so that they will no longer recommend reposts and ripped off content which the company says will give more visibility to creators of original content and when you listen to people who actually liked Facebook at some point talk about Facebook and its decline what they talk about I've found more than anything else is missing the days when it was actual
updates from people they are first first order connected to single degree of separation connected to um and and and interacting with those people and it's just kind of turned into just an endless Doom scrolling pile of content Farm you know video crap and reposts of stolen memes and all that kind of stuff so uh I don't see anything in here about Facebook uh no okay we'll get to that in a second uh these platforms will also add labels to reposted content with a link back to the original creator that
is super cool and that should just be kind of standard practice I kind of love that this will not apply to content that has been significantly altered however like a work that is edited into a meme or given a new voiceover meanwhile it has become significantly harder to find original artist content on Facebook as the platform has become flooded with unmarked AI content much of which is bizarrely Jesus themed meta platforms are likewise being flooded with tons of ads for NSFW aai girlfriends against
metazone policies according to wired at "least 29,000 of these sexually" suggestive ads have been published on meta platforms uh meta's own AI has been acting oddly on Facebook making weird unsolicited comments on posts including one incident where it commented on a parenting group claiming to have a disabled yet gifted child meta has also added the AI chatbot to Instagram search making it difficult to avoid interacting with these features I did notice that actually anyway I want to I just want to
show you guys a couple of examples of this weird oddly Jesus themed AI artwork uh here's one made it with my own hands thanks to everyone who appreciates this and this is from account love God and God love you what the what what am I looking at here and why does this have "46,000 interactions yeah how much of" "this is bought activity 46,000" interactions but only 500 comments well "no that's an okay ratio 46,5 yeah cuz an" interaction on Facebook is so low friction yeah I guess this this may
legitimately be actual people that are like yes shrimp Jesus well the next one "the next one has 185,000 interactions" love from love father and mother bless you made it with my own hands thanks to everyone who appreciates this they're doing it they made it with my own hands thing and both of these accounts after the Amber sand they don't have a space I think this is the same thing oh yeah wow thank you Professor Luke no problem he you played spot the AI you won no I mean
like I think it's literally the same like person behind it yeah yeah yeah but I why I don't think an AI would just not put a space in the name like I think somebody actually just named this themselves and it's just AI generating photos yeah that could that could very well be cuz I I mean yeah there's no there's probably tools to like Mass create accounts but sure you would have to you would have to approve it's just I I don't think this is one of those mistakes that an AI would even make
though it would put a space after the Amber you know that's something I've started noticing a lot lately is like when something is bad it almost it it almost makes me it almost makes me feel like oh this is real yeah cuz there's just absolutely no reason to make an error like that anymore exactly um I'm like it happened twice yeah the big question here though is who's the sniper what oh oh man what do they have against Jesus I'm sure that's just the AI not really understanding that that's
actually like supposed to be a window or something and it's just like ah sure why not we'll put that there um I don't know our discussion question is how big of a threat is outof control spam for companies like well hold on a second because it's not like the lowest common denominator that are unironically interacting with this stuff can even tell the difference so why does it matter like for for their user base what difference does it make yeah but I think the whole like what
what is it is the the Daniel no is it fake Internet Theory what is it dead internet Theory dead internet dead Mall oh this is hilarious okay no this totally makes sense yeah float plane chat figured it out it's it's he didn't get it's adapted for modern times he didn't get crucified it was firing squad but that that that that's what  representing thanks float plane chat you guys got this sorted out to be clear to be to be clear to be clear okay regardless of regardless of alignment
this kind of thing is obviously ridiculous and that's the reason that I'm making light of it because it's go to luk Camp clearly silly this poor man I know is it hard sometimes is it is it hard it's usually fine but sometimes is  now why did the right now make me understand I don't know oh yeah made you think about it this is bad though like Twitter is is just overran by Bots oh my I it's actually wild okay anyone who claims to not be able to accidentally find pornographic material on Twitter you are
an actual liar or bar for what is considered pornography is extremely high um I was just I was just looking at the there's ads now that are like I was looking at the yard um post that the the episode that I that I was guessed on was up and man I wanted to see what the hidden for offensive content comments were and one of them was just from someone very confused uh which was kind of funny and I I do read those comments sometimes and then one of them was guys don't if you're at work do not do not unhide any
any hidden comments on that cuz it's yeah it's very definitely above your bar whatever your bar is Twitter is Twitter's brutal yeah uh I don't even know I don't even know what to make of it at this point like at what point can we not ask our staff to be on a platform as part of their work interesting like do we have to basically create a policy at this point if this gets any worse do we tell the social team okay look um you guys can post on this you can decide to not if you but
realistically um we advise against consuming any content on this platform at work you can't or even you can't like we can't we can't tell people yeah go ahead find porn like view pornography at work that's not that's not okay I saw one during the show H Dan don't tell me that I mean it's a problem is it not okay if the employee okay with it is it not okay yeah I'm pretty sure it's not okay I I don't think it matters because it it all comes back to that question of like the power Dynamic so even work that
even if they're okay right even if they're okay the fact that I told them to do it might put pressure on them to be okay yeah yeah and then even if they say it's okay they might come back later and and retroactively decide it wasn't okay so we almost have to get out ahead of it right if you don't tell them to do it if you say like we would like posts on Instagram but if if anyone's uncomfortable with that you don't have or uh Twitter but if anyone's uncomfortable that you don't have to do
it and that doesn't and not everyone's in a in a private office too right like that doesn't account for if anyone's walking behind their desk and someone's just banging on their screen yeah right like we can't we can't ask people to be subjected to that so we I mean I I we should raise this next week like an exec meeting like should we have a serious discussion about whether Twitter is a site is allowed to be accessed on our Network even there's probably a there's probably a way to for the like it team
to block all the images that load on Twitter I mean I'd be I'd be interested in that as a solution yeah how to how to how to safer work your Twitter account dude this is ridiculous it is it is actually genuinely getting like the fact that we even have to have this conversation and and you know what we might not we might not do anything with it we might kind of go the team might come back and say like look yeah if you don't dig into the offensive replies and if we don't go onto any trends like if
we just kind of stay on our own replies Trend are the fine yeah the trends man you like I also get it in my in the the whatever the mixed news feed is if I look at just my notifications or whatever that section's called like things that are directed towards me it's generally fine my mentions are generally fine not always but not always yeah um but but usually vast majority of the time it's okay but if I look at the the full mixed feed it's like pretty high percentage yep Walmart comes to oh wait no sponsors

face first second you want to talk about my face your hair's coming back in my your uh beard oh I just uh I didn't shave this morning I shaved last night so this is a fun one that facial treatment that I did apparently it stimulates hair growth oh so my Beard's been like if I don't shave for like 36 hours like I look like a mountain man are you just going to let it go uh oh no I am but I no I got to finish my paint job oh yeah my so my motorbike paint job got kind of interrupted by Po's car
paint job which by the way have you seen now yes he pulled into work what do you think it's not as striking as the you know the hot pink I kind of I kind of got cold feet and I wanted it to look cool it it looks pretty cool instead of just like an acid it's not yeah it's it's not the acid trip of the original no the original L it's pretty cool but it's it's cool I reviewed the video by the way right before W show it's great it's significantly more like you know livable than than the first one man his car
and I L the way that Alex framed the intro so we added headlights AC dampening we added uh power locks power windows and we did all of those upgrades for less than the price of a single monthly payment on a brand new Civic whoa yeah I thought that was such a cool way to frame it wow that is a really cool way to frame it yeah and we and we I'm immediately interested in that yeah that's awesome yeah good job the paint job was several payments but don't worry about that that was that was Grace but
you don't have to pay that was for fun yeah yeah exactly exactly that part was just for lws uh ton of fun and I learned a lot uh we used a highb Build primer by accident I it's one of those things where like I wouldn't have bought that one but I could have saved it by doing some research and using some reducer in it which I had on hand but I was just like I mean probably this will be fine and I started spraying it and that's why it has that like texture to it because my gun is rated for maximum 9 PSI and
that high Build primer wants 20 psi so basically it didn't completely atomize and it just like blew chunks at the car so uh okay so you're still shaving because you need the mask to make a seal yeah so that my like organic filter uh mask is still good while I'm finishing up my bike I'm going to do a bunch of color tests this weekend I'm really excited about that so I've got a bunch of different variations of undercoat midcoat and then top coats and effects and stuff like that and I've
got an order of speed shapes I got from AliExpress for like $2 uh so speed shapes are basically things like this and they just have like kind of Contours like a car so you can paint them and then kind of see what it looks like from different angles got it I'm going to get that done and I'm just going to settle on a bloody color and get this thing done even though we haven't really quite gotten to the level of vibrant pink that I would like I'm just going to have to kind of live with it and get it done I
want to ride it this season darn it other than that I didn't have a particular topic uh we could talk about oh we're supposed to do merch messages oh never mind you don't have to you're so antagonistic I'm going to run to the washer real quick I'll be right back all right we'll get one for Luke yeah uh question for Luke yes if you got offered a job at from NASA or a similar dream J right when lonus leaves would you leave lmg and move to the US for it uh I'd be really tempted but as of right
now I don't think I could um I feel too much direct responsibility to certain teams certain people here stuff like that I don't know if that would ever necessarily change maybe it will maybe it won't um but I would be extremely flattered I'd say that much I'd be a little bit confused as to what NASA would want to do with me um but I'd be interested yeah that's it maybe a boring answer greetings lldd I'm watching float plane from an airplane sick Luke what processes do you have in place oh boy to help your
development teams actually accurately forecast delivery timelines any any implementation tips I'm going to say no oops uh sorry what was the last what was the last line  uh what what oh man good luck uh James have fun so yeah welcome to the world of developer timelines uh they don't work it's it's like the Whose Line Is It Anyways points they don't matter they don't exist um they're made up they they're made up you you start getting used to different people on your team and
like how good like that person is at estimating time some teams can find um systems like they'll they'll start like Point scoring things and a lot of teams will use different uh types of Point scoring that they can have people saying scrum for the wi yeah good luck that doesn't I I don't find personally that that scrum actually helps you there's a lot of issues with scrum in my opinion but I don't I don't actually find that scrum itself helps you estimate actual completion time of large
projects that need multiple scrums to actually like be completed like maybe and and I mean you estimating the amount of time that it's going to take at the beginning of the project because some people will cheat and be like well we know how much we can do roughly every two weeks and then that's slightly inaccurate every time so by the end the Assumption we made at the beginning is really wrong but our assumptions along the way were pretty good so therefore we did a good job and it's like well no
because we're talking about the Assumption you made at the beginning compared to what the reality was at the end of it anyways um but you can you can do like the best one one that I've heard of is when teams start looking at jobs and they do a point scoring thing so they try to assume the amount of like blocks of time that something will take so they don't do it by hour they do it by like half day or full day or something like that um and they use that as project estimating and then they review that
after every project that they do to try to help themselves get more and more accurate over time that is helpful for teams that often do at least somewhat similar things if you're constantly doing very very different things all the time it's still going to be really tough to estimate um I've actually found that I'm more successful when I just get used to roughly how inaccurate individuals are and then don't actually coach them on doing it at all and just have them keep doing their estimates as they have
been and then buffer custom amounts per person and then I found that's actually pretty good I'm I'm pretty accurate that way um as a blanket rule I always add either 2X or 2 weeks which everyone feels more correct for the situation add two weeks to it or double the amount of time that developer says they think it'll take um a lot of developers are a little bit overconfident um or don't necessarily fully consider testing time uh different things like that needing to go back and and refine things
or or whatever else um so just give them a little bit of extra time because you don't want them to you don't want the blow of like it's late we need it now when they actually just want to do a good job um yeah so someone in Philippine chapter said as a Dev I always feel bad when I underestimate time exactly so if you're leading devs try to set them up for success by hopefully putting them in a situation where that's not really going to happen by buffering for them one of
the best ways to do this is not actually share the full communication with either end don't tell the devs that you buffered extra time for them until they run out of time and don't tell the people that you're agreeing to do the project for that you buffered anytime just tell them the buffered amount and then you end up delivering a little bit early and then when the dev ran out of time you can magically give them extra time and then everyone on each end is happy and you just it's all fine so
basically your career advice is lie through your oh so basically your commun your career advice is lie through your te no it's just correctly estimate and know the people that you're working with I see yeah all right hit me uh is there one for me or are you guys done yeah sure I got one for you here thanks Dan let's see uh did you obtain any patents for your cable management designs or did you figure that if they get Rift ripped off it'll likely happen in China where all
bets are off and decide not to bother um It's a combination of things one that second thing you said yeah I mean realistically what are we going to do go after a Chinese company they don't care their government doesn't care um they only care when Chinese companies get ripped off it's actually really interesting the double standards that exist in the eyes of the Chinese government um so realistically we're not really yeah we don't really think there's going to be any defense against
that anyway um number two I don't think there's anything particularly patentable about it it's a it's a magnet attached to a piece of plastic like if we if we had anything particularly novel about it um if anything I think we'd be better off can make it better I know yeah but if there was anything that made it better or was particularly novel about it I think we'd actually be better off just not mentioning it yeah because then their product might not do as well if you patent something you have to like
include drawings and stuff of like how you do it which I'd rather just not do if we had anything about it that made it special uh and number three is a big part of what makes the cost of our product so high is the raw material cost of the neodymium magnets so with that in mind if you were to make a knockoff where are you saving your money exactly you could I mean we already had the molding done in China we already have the Plastics shot in China we're already buying neodymium from A supplier in
China so okay Chinese knockoff company what exactly is your advantage going to be here um you're going to do all the same things as us and so if you build it to the same level of quality with the same amount of raw neodymium in it your price is going to be high so what they're going to do inevitably you can mark my words on this what they're going to do is they're going to cheap out on the neodymium it won't hold as well and they wouldn't even if if we did have something special that we did to make it
better they won't figure that out they won't notice they won't care because all people ordering online are going to see is that it's the same shape and it has a magnet in it they're not going to know how deep the magnet goes and so those magnets are going to break more easily they're not going to hold as well people are going to get it they're going to find out that it and then if anything it's just marketing for our product because ours is the real one ours is the good one so we didn't
really see the point because it's a really great product and it's quality and uh it's selling really great so yeah we'll see how it goes in the longer term but no I'm really not that worried about it the only way to compete with us on Price is to make a crappier product good  you want to do Luke I don't know man let's get these uh main topics out of the way just to make sure AI powered race cars kind of sucks so far the Abu Dhabi autonomous Racing League the world's first Racing League featuring
self-driving formula race cars held two races this weekend the first featured only self-driving race cars while the second had self-driving cars compete against human drivers okay that's interesting the qualifying time trials prior to the race wound up being chaotic with the automatic race car struggling to finish a lap and occasionally randomly jerking as if dodging an invisible obstruction that's actually weird multiple cars spun out and at least one hit a wall did they not test this at
all here's from the article what here's from the article on the verge uh watch this car hey hey hey how you doing um huh this is great hold on you're about to watch a car turn into a  think yeah why is that car is still a car it didn't turn into a wall oh my goodness misleading misleading The Verge misleading bad content but qualifying or sorry during the race the leading car spun out the second car passed but an official threw a yellow flag the other cars got confused and stopped behind the
stalled car as during a caution lap cars are not allowed to pass each other the autonomous cars were slow especially around corners and seemed to get confused by the smoke from other vehicles oh one car misjudged another car's breaking and rear ended it this sounds like a very expensive  yeah yeah jfer over on uh in the Virgin comment says people only watch F1 for when things go wrong so I don't see anything bad about this stalks dude they're they're going to make so much
money so many things wrong with this so  layers that's amazing all of the  companies there's a lot of AI driven cars on the road this could be you what you're watching right now Tesla all the traditional automakers all the traditional automakers who have who have paused their investments in autonomous driving just putting it all into this to make like Tesla look bad make people scared oh that's so funny this is amazing uh I think that's mostly it there's some discussion questions what's
the likely difference between programming a car to navigate a City versus programming it to complete a race honestly I don't know enough about this to really comment on that but for me it's not necessarily the cuz the predictability of the track theoretically is a h should be very high huge Advantage even if you are using Machine Vision which you would have to be doing in order to avoid obstacles or other vehicles um knowing the the basic parameters is an enormous Advantage
however the speed at which things are happening and the relatively speaking lack of clear rules like on a on a public Street this sign means everyone should behave in in this predictable manner whereas on this track oh I see okay it's well get there first yeah right and obviously they're going to program in some rules because they don't want their expensive machines to just get exploded randomly turn and drive into walls but I mean we've absolutely speaking of randomly turning to the left
um and driving into walls uh let's uh yeah this thing like racing all comes down to you know your your risk to reward tolerance right so this is this is one of the most I'm not into racing but this is one of the most amazing moments in history what is this um video game move yeah hold on let me see if I can find the so Buddy's way behind uh hold on where's my oh man where's my retention sick thing well man  trash well anyway yeah I can't find it but uh yeah unbelievable oh apparently
it's now banned yeah makes sense hate for anything interesting to happen in all seriousness though that is crazy dangerous and nobody should be doing that okay here we go here we go here we've got this is a dash cam here's a dash putting yes on that one Dan look at him go see you later buddy wow so even with all the friction yeah passes passes like six cars in the corner wow yeah absolutely wild but like I don't know man like a machine can't run that risk how's it going to make that decision
like that very few people do that I think true he apparently pulled eight [Laughter]   wow I wonder what kind of chances there were for him to just like break his car doing that La Earth says I a fan and watched it live he literally just tried a video game move like he used on  not helping not helping anything um all right what else we got here uh UK bans bad passwords UK has updated its telecommunications security legislation to ban easily guessable default passwords now
manufacturers will need to ensure their devices come up with a randomly generated password or that they can generate a random password upon setup oh default passwords cannot reference e okay they ban bad default passwords that makes a decent amount of sense default passwords cannot reference easily discoverable information like Wi-Fi ssids and they cannot be incremental versions of each other I.E password one password two okay neat so I would just like to say that I kind of hate this why
as a technical user I really like it when my default password for everything that brand is just admin admin because often I am resetting something multiple times and going back and referring to the 14 Char random character uppercase lowercase special character thing and entering that on my stupid phone because my laptop that I'm using on site today is out of batter like I can understand it's annoying situations where this will be extremely annoying for me but it is 100% the right thing to do yeah yeah
it'll be annoying for probably a lot of the people watching right now literally dozens of us will be infuriated by this but it's better for the whole but it's well here's my problem though is a lot of devices are only ever going to be set up by a professional so n like a server or something come on like ubiquity equipment no no no casual is going to set up a ubiquity access point yeah but I think the ubiquity access points are going to be Prett small percentage of these things I think they're talking
about like Wi-Fi routers and stuff but what about me I mean in Access Point's basically a Wi-Fi router you know I would be okay with with the idea that this only applied to consumer electronics actually if it if it didn't apply to like Enterprise grade stuff I'd be fine with that personally yeah screw it you should probably set your stuff up properly whatever y yeah I I they won't do it that way but that would be fine I I would be I would be so much happier with that but no you're right they probably
won't do it that way another thing that I know you're really happy about is that Walmart has come to Roblox Walmart is piloting a store on Roblox where players can buy a physical item alongside its digital in-game twin the Walmart discovered experience is currently only available in the US children over 13 can make purchases so long if they've verified their age by sending Roblox a picture of their government issued ID as well as adding their name address and credit card information to the
roblox-based Walmart store Walmart previously attempted to appeal to Children through Roblox by adding two previous experiences Walmart land and Walmart's Universe of play however this was met with backlash as Walmart failed to properly disclose that these games uh were also advertisements that was really loud through the mic by the way so the reason I oh sorry so the reason I brought my phone up just now was to check if I still had the notification for it cuz I was going to show you my
son requested to install Roblox earlier this week look no look I the two he's done both of them now I approved fortnite two weeks ago which he's been enjoying a lot I I had the I had the I had the microtransaction conversation with him again I was like I was like look okay you're going to see a lot of your friends are going to have a lot of like paid items and skins and stuff in these game in this in this game um okay what are what are they he's like suckers and I'm like good good boy um I don't
know how long that'll last but boy am I ever going to try and keep that mentality because to be clear guys what I'm doing right now I don't I don't actually think that's necessarily true I think there's lots of good reasons that you could uh contribute towards a piece of software that you really enjoy developers need to be paid I'm not going to make that argument a lot of people have bad relationships with this the issue is that fortnite is designed to be a money sucking machine and it is
designed to pray on people who have who are either young and immature or who have um an unhealthy relationship with these kinds of transactions and so what I am doing is I am I am setting the bar here right knowing that probably he will land here instead of and this is this a hope right like I don't know if this parenting strategy works but instead of setting the bar here and then you know oh dear Lord you know he fell down here so I'm basically setting a very very high level of expectations so if we ever
do spend money on a fortnite skin or something like that the understanding will be that this is an exception this is very this is special this is something very special Merry Christmas you got one skin or something along those lines I think the only thing you risk with that is when they when they become free and they seek the thing that was restricted more sometimes it Cano yeah that's true Way Beyond but true I don't think it will in this case um I yeah his his his opinion on what games
he liked used to be so incredibly based and now it is becoming not so and that makes me sad yeah I know but it's okay that's fine we'll draw him back into it I still haven't shown him Warcraft 3 kids are going to kid sometimes oh yeah and and like realistically gaming is so it's true his friends are playing it it is what it is yeah 100% I agree I just it just sucks um one thing that I think is pretty funny about this Walmart thing is I can pretty much guarantee you that
somebody somewhere is going to complain that you have to buy a physical item in order to get a digital one which I think is so funny because we get comments complaining that you have to buy something from LTT store to get a merch message in because they would rather just send in money and receive nothing and I just think that so crazy that I know someone is going to be like I just wanted the digital headphones I didn't want the real headphones I wanted to play full headphone dollars for digital
headphones not real ones that's going to  it I mean In fairness if they don't need another pair of headphones I kind of see where they're coming from just give them to your friend or something or you could just not need the digital headphones too that's also an option that's a that's a better idea I mean this is really smart you got to give credit where it's due this is this is super smart they're definitely going to move some units um I just it's exhausting I think that's the
only real word that I can use for it it's just exhausting like all the new and creative ways that we can be marketed to billions of dollars going into controlling your brain D like dude there is there is so much stuff that's just like like obvious stuff that LTT store could do in order to sell more like immediately sell more like goofy stuff like when we did our when we did that video on Sports Tech so like Tech that's branded with sports team logos and stuff like that man the site that
runs most of that stuff in the US it's just like every stupid mind game is front and center on their site like right now with only four hours left is the ultimate sale big ball sale no it's not you're just going to start a new sale like fake fake low stock information where they'll try to blast like going out of business two two left yeah yeah man oh man what is it with mattress stores and being going out of business for like 10 years there's there's one on King George Boulevard
that the the going out of business signage just faded like are you're not kid you're not fooling anybody what is this Ltd store.com in Roblox I mean you know what I'd be I'd be down I'd be down to do like a Wan hoodie that you can wear in your video game and also you get a you know real life Wan hoodie or something like that I I I don't I don't see that as in apparently bad I'm just I'm just kind of tired of having things shoved down my throat this hard and it feels like uh feels like a lot of people
feel that way uh speaking of having ads shoved down your throat I just thought that I just thought this was kind of interesting uh the judge in the US Department the US Department of Justice's antitrust case against Google is currently hearing closing arguments as to whether Google's market dominance has harmed the quality of search spoiler yes the heart of the doj case is Google's deals with various companies ensuring that Google search would be the default on their platforms in particular
Google's deal with Apple a witness revealed during this trial that Google pays Apple 36% of its search advertising revenue from Safari in order to remain the default Search tool on the browser in just 2022 this deal resulted in Google paying $20 billion to Apple Android manufacturers typically get around 12% of this revenue for their own default agreement with Google so onethird as much um this is not news necessarily so the closing arguments are happening now but a lot of this has come out earlier but
one of the things that struck me about this was that it is always interesting to me to see the the the the shapes that apple apologists apple loyalists whatever you want to call them fans right fans you shouldn't be a fan of anything um but but that Apple Fans will contort themselves into to frame apple as a totally different kind of entity compared to the other big tech companies and this one this one what stood out to me about this was um it reminded me of that conversation that we had a little
while back about the VPN industry and how sort of you know how our comfort level is high enough to have VPN sponsors and talk about the benefits of VPN to our audience but our comfort level is not high enough to run our own VPN and personally say no I understand that that IP is downloading illicit harmful material um you know it's it's affecting real people you know real miners and we are not going to give you we are not going to give you that person's information that's just beyond
B and Luke's comfort zone we're not going to say no to that so we're just not going to run a VPN because you can't have a VPN that just decides sometimes to disclose its users um activities and sometimes doesn't um but what I it reminded me of that conversation because I was looking at this going How can Apple and Apple's users look at each other you know across the table and go I am so protective of your privacy I care so much about it that it is Central to basically all my product
messaging and for you to sit there and believe that while I am collecting $20 billion a year yeah through Google's efforts to harvest your data and sell ads against that personalized collected data I mean Apple's conflict of interest here is so obvious and so clear and so Brazen that I just I don't know I just I find it I find it exhausting that it isn't obvious to everyone else and I think that's become a bit of a problem for me like I end up with people with people looking at my t
and kind of going like yeah lus lius hates apple or he or he hates this or or he whatever whatever he thinks about about something and I think part of it is yeah I'm just I'm exhausted of having the same conversations over and over again and you know the i' I've said this before I guess I'll do it one more time the thing that drives me most crazy about Apple is the utter hypocrisy of it of their behavior that they that they will put a micro site up on their website about how much they're saving
the planet as they actively send tens of thousands of working devices to uh to a a destroyer like geep Jeep however you pronounce it GE P there was a whole lawsuit that Apple I think ultimately dropped because they didn't like the publicity they were getting around pursuing these guys for ultimately not destroying this working Hardware was the whole thing this was a little while back um I'm not just a hater this is this is not hate this is this is looking at the pieces in motion looking at the actions
they're taking and going is this not obvious to everyone like you can still like Apple products you still buy a iPhone I don't care that's your money you do whatever you want just know what's happening but why why do you insist why do you insist on not seeing it for what it is and I just I don't know how to address it like seeing seeing the the antitrust developments between the US government and apple and all the articles that are on sort of the usual uh news sites that
kind of have that traditional article comment format I I read a lot of comments not just on our own videos not just on videos um a lot of the time I'll I'll skim the article and I'll read the comments I read a lot faster than I watch video though so I usually will just read an article because I'm a pretty fast reader um but but going through going through the Articles it's amazing even on communities where generally I have found that the readers are of above average savviness like AR Technica I
would say is an example of a site where generally speaking it's pretty hard to get upvoted if you're a completeing idiot like it it just doesn't really happen compared to a site like uh like The Verge is a more Normy site but still reasonably Savvy compared to um I don't know that that dumb one that we were showing all the AI comments on a little actually no that one wasn't bad um but anyway the point is I I would say RS Technica is one that has a pretty high high standard of viewership or
readership and I was going through one of the articles on this and the number of people that were making the but wall Garden I love it better in here argument just blew me away then have your Walled Garden you can choose those options stay in it yeah it's okay you can close the door competition is good that is a universal truth and you will not be able to argue that point with any degree of success against anyone who isn't a complete NPC competition breeds Innovation it just does and companies that are not
forced to compete will abuse their okay let's not say monopolistic because that's that's a big part of the argument um um Apple isn't a monopoly they're not a monopoly look at that you don't have to be a a monopoly mono you don't have to be just one to engage in anti-competitive Behavior you can be a local you could be a regional ISP that is stomping out even smaller competitors you are still engaging in anti-competitive Behavior even if there's half a dozen other isps in the
country it's that's not the point right that there's just one um and it just it just blows me away how polarizing this is and how emotional people's arguments are about it when I just don't get it don't be a fan don't be a fan of Apple don't be a fan of Intel or Nvidia or Microsoft or any of these companies I mean look at man look at the way the tech industry has handled layoffs lately have you have you seen the supercharger team layoffs like yeah Tesla Supercharger teams see you later nice knowing you
um I always like going to that that uh website layoffs.fyi it's interesting yeah here I'm going to your laptop yeah in 2024 alone 279 tech companies  employees as soon as you're publicly traded by definition you can't have a  yeah yeah it's brutal you can if you through this website for a while um you can uh I don't know I don't remember exactly how to do it it's it's intuitive once you actually start using it but there's a way to uh sort by like type of company uh because it shows like like
fintech companies all this other type of stuff in there but you can you can narrow it down to different specifics  people Avon fox says if we don't want fans stop calling them team red team blue Etc that's a good point um and you know what that's one of the that's one of the sort of Insidious subtle ways that um that that they do turn Gamers against each other like as far as I remember AMD started that whole team red thing I think so I think that was back in the bulldozzer
days when basically they didn't have any product worth buying and all they could count on was selling to fans and you know what this is tough right because if absolutely everybody bought only the objectively best product companies would just cease to exist go to monopolies instantly instantly and so the fact that the fact that you know people that I would no offense but like laugh at behind closed doors who are buying these like objectively worse products for the same price right like I
I sorry I'm sorry but I think you're a clown if you know that one thing is objectively better than the other one and you buy you buy the worst one because it has a brand you like on it I'm sorry you're a clown I do think sometimes but they saved AMD the fact that we have AMD today is because absolute clowns were fans of a company and bought a brand instead of a product it's like you know what thank you thank you I actually enjoy living in clown World cuz if we had just Intel we' I do
think you're oversimplified we'd still have four cores Luke because some people just don't care enough we'd still have four cores so they're not going to do the research something's just going to be on sale they're like whatever I need a functioning computer I don't really care that and you know what that's fine yeah that's fine and then other people might have but I didn't talk about that other people might have subjective reasons why they like or dislike something and other
people might have reasons why they're doing in anything but purchasing I can address all of these okay all right okay so number one I wasn't talking about that out of ignorance I will absolutely buy the wrong brand of drill bit sure it happens I I I I don't have the time to research absolutely everything in my life and I understand that some people in fact I'm one the people who talks about this all the time like we live in our little Tech bubble where everything's obvious to us you know that
this one is so much better than that one how could anybody possibly buy a a 4060 with only 8 gigs of vram or you know whatever the thing we hate dujour is you know I I talk about that all the time how for most people it's as simple as walking into a retail store and buying whatever the rep hands them happens to be within their price range I get that so I'm not talking about people who just just don't know and as for your second one I forget what it was it was good though really good
uh okay so there was ignorance yeah there was oh just not caring preference I think it was no no that was the third one I thought the third one I can't put that finger yeah the third one was anything but the anything but verse yeah okay so so the so the so the second one I'm sorry but I just I just don't accept it with a computer processor I can accept it with a water bottle because this is sub we were talking about like everything though it wasn't just CPUs we were talking about okay well I'm
specifically talking about tech products right now though and when it comes down to CPUs there might still be preference because you might use a certain program or something that performs better than the other thing but that's fine that's still objective I'm just saying that a CPU is not a subjective purchase but that comes down to potentially two products still being relevant in those days it didn't I agree yeah no that no no that was that was clown days of AMD there was you were if you if you paid
full price for bulldozzer you were you were willfully ignorant basically like those were those were bad you couldn't was a rough time you couldn't look even glance at the introduction of a review and not know that it was not dark times it or that it was dark in the tech indry back then it was it was a sad it was a sad time as for the anything but I get it there are definitely companies that I have taken a break from before but I also I also think that that's kind of a um like I know recently that there are
people that have taken risks with purchasing decisions especially in the GPU Department because of some of the things that nvidia's done I don't necessarily think that that's super wrong and that's fair but what I will say is don't get stuck in like a place of sort of blind hatred forever yeah because outside of you know VAR emploees are going to turn over things very senior leadership the company that you are buying from if you're buying an AMD CPU today for example and I'm using AMD
as an example for a reason because they have had a significant amount of turnover in the last decade if you buy an AMD CPU today you are effectively buying it from a completely different company oh yeah from who they were 10 especially like if you go back like 15 years ago 100% functionally the it's like they're the company of thesis right like almost every working part has been replaced in that time a lot of companies are that way though so holding so holding grudges against a
brand is is entirely silliness um you should absolutely consider anything they've done recently and if they have a long history of absolutely evil Behavior then that clearly is a dee rooted cultural issue like I If someone were to say look I'll buy anything as other than something made by Nestle all right fair enough because you know whether you want to make an argument around like you know the privileged position that they're in today at all is because of the awful behavior that they have paid
zero reparations for or whether you want to look at their more recent actions you'll have a strong argument for why you just shouldn't buy anything made by Nestle but I think it'll be hard pressed to find a similar example in the tech space um Nestle was a good call out though I like it yeah well they're just the the most obviously evil company other than what maybe Chita like I who's that that's the banana company oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah okay all right don't forget about the coke
murders never forget the Coca-Cola murders there's some wild stuff in the food industry it's actually nuts yeah they literally don't even their defense was not even that they didn't do it it didn't happen here their defense was that it was not within the prosecution's jurisdiction you know what that did yes unfortunately there's also lays I think don't forget about the palm oil industry in general like literally palm oil actually destroying entire nations sick but hey at least it's uh
what was what was the argument for it was like lower calorie or healthier or something natural something I forget I forget but yeah yeah yeah yeah sorry for bringing up pal oil it feels like it feels like some like portal stuff it's like lower calories for the ones who are still alive yeah exactly like dude it's this is one of those things where it's like I um I I am not about whataboutism like whataboutism is a super weak argument when someone says hey you did a bad thing and they point back and they
go well what about what about what about there are valid cases for it if someone is engaging in hypocrisy there's nothing I think that I dislike more than hypocrisy like if I'm calling out Luke for his um get me I don't know his big nose perfect right actually that's a bad example because it's an inherent trait but my point was just that my nose is bigger than his so if I were if I were calling oh come on I don't I don't look at these things I genuinely don't literally Royal I can't see myself on
the deluxe I like to describe it as Deluxe nose Prime yeah nice um I like it or whatever it is if I am actively engaging in the same behavior or or the same behavior but worse that is absolutely a valid defense that is not what aism that is you being a hypocrite and you actually need to sort out your own before you start talking about anyone else's yeah U so that's a that's a completely different thing but you know in general I am not I'm not about what about ISM but I also
do think that in the gaming and in the tech industry we tend to We tend to end up with kind of tunnel vision on the things that are happening within our space you know I think I think a great example of this was the uh the principled Technologies benchmarking scandal from Intel do you even remember this I do yeah basically someone at Intel up some charts and they got published even though they were obviously not right and they caused a a very unfavorable comparison to AMD that
was just obviously not right I looked at that whole situation I went yeah someone up there was issues everywhere and legal problem and whoever they are are high up enough that they can cover their butts and trying to deal with it they did a pretty bad job and legal probably came in and said look if we say anything we open ourselves up to a bunch of legal liability because we acknowledge the error which would mean that AMD would have grounds that we have effectively admitted that we are guilty
of doing this when in reality it was probably just some dumbass like on the marketing team that didn't realize that this was a problem um cuz I can I promise you none of the technical people I thought there was more stuff like a test bench hidden under a table and all these other things that no I don't remember maybe this was some other thing it was a small enough thing that it could have easily been coordinated by like one or two people who didn't who did who just I remember
that part who were just dumb sure just plain dumb way too long and probably didn't listen to any of the smarter people who absolutely know better I mean that's the thing about organizations is an organization can do something that was actually just a couple of completeing idiots or just like a wicked miscommunication or a wicked misom I don't think that one was a miscommunication I don't think so either I'm just saying there's a lot of ways for this to happen I think it was
someone with too much power and and who was arrogant and who didn't understand I think it was someone who's being paid more than their understanding of the technical details of the product is is what I will say um and you know the but the way that people kind of blew up about this and the kind of conspiracy theories that were spawned from it I was like look man you guys never heard of handlon Razer you know handlon Razer obviously right I didn't know it was handlon yeah never never attribute to
malice what can be adequately explained by stupidity yeah it is handon hand's Razer um and I never got anyone from Intel to confirm my version of the story but what I did get was I got on a call where I said look tell you what how about this tell me that what I'm saying is wrong and I finished telling my story of how I kind of assumed it happened and then just no one really responded and then well this was one person that was talking to me off the Record cuz they were just
like you know look I just I don't want people thinking that our whole department is like evil people and they were basically just like well this has been a nice call and I'll talk to you another time cuz it's it's just obvious if you understand the human elements that go into something like that it's easier to pick it apart because the the idea that anyone is organized enough to have coordinated that as like a as like a campaign I mean it's it's it's silly right like it's I I think just while
we're on it I think hanon's Razer has a dangerous side of it which is where you if you start overly making people innocent you make yourself very vulnerable cuz there is a lot of malice and that is true and you know what I have multiple times in my life ended up in a bad situation because I have a tendency to attribute to um misunderstanding as my default but you know what I just I just don't think I can live my life the other way no I think I think and I'm usually right I agree and that's it's you know
defaulting to malice you're just going to you're not going to have any friends and your life's going to suck but you just do also have to be aware that there are malicious people out there absolutely and you can't just like be blind to it forever I want to show this real quick before we get off the topic by Tangen thing tooo hard somehow U that if if you've heard all this and you know you still might be into the whole teaming thing you can uh you can jump on amdan store.com and get yourself some $8
DD team AMD clown team I don't know like red NOS team nice in in the defense of the cycling Jersey I'm pretty sure uh Intel has some jerseys as well don't they from something oh probably yeah nice they don't have that many products a $50 waste pack $60 waste pack sorry I mean they have quite a few products actually gaming chair at least oh wow I was about to say at least their worthless swag is priced like worthless Swag like their uh their sunglasses were like 10 bucks but like man that uh I mean that's a
tool backpack though that's not just AMD that almost feels like they they produced a bunch of them for staff just like making them available computer  commuter I don't know if you're going to find the exact same one is it that second one oh no the zipper goes across like that oh is it the 12 custom uh okay well 12 of them for 1406 why why is that promotional products nice laptop backpacks all right Luke doing the real research here I want to find it is it an older model got an investigative journalist
here Luke Luke Luke Luke come on let's cheer him on Luke Luke I don't think I'm going to find it's not here shop shop an old model shop model that's fine I'm over it oh well I took away your screen sharing for that's fine yeah I didn't I didn't I didn't find it I failed I'm still looking I don't even remember what our topic was but basically don't be fans of like especially public companies yeah if you're going to if you're going to act like it personally just uh don't act
like it publicly I mean I guess that's an option like there's been a speaking of companies you should not be a fan of what now uh oh 55 bucks hey hm all right well that's a good markup pretty solid solid markup oh $40 $40 for a decorated sample though that's to order a sample they may do discounted samples so I don't I don't don't read too much into this one that's true what does decorated sample mean well this is these guys are these guys are a printing company so you you would
order a custom one and look the minimum order quantity is 12 so they're expect they're expecting a volume order so that may just be the price for a sample with the expectation that you will order a bunch and the prices might the pricing might be higher I if you want backpacks for your like team or something like that exactly that's cool speaking of companies you shouldn't be a fan of uh YouTube has done a lot Google has had over well o overall an overwhelmingly positive impact on my life oh nice nice
sorry sorry you are just deter you know what fine you do the show no you did the show nice no okay I get it nice thank you for that sorry keep going YouTube loves pause ads there I'm not even going to try and segue I give up I don't even care anymore for the past year YouTube has been piloting ads that appear on Smart TVs when playback is paused Google presented the pilot as a success in their first quarter earnings call as a non-interruptive ad format that nonetheless had significant Advertiser
demand pause ads have likewise been rolled out by Roku here's an example of a YouTube pause ad courtesy of text spot so the image of the show gets smaller and an ad pops up on the side ooh snack break right around the corner probably fine to be honest really as a user if you're going to have an ad somewhere this seems the least intrusive I don't like my UI moving around like I really don't like that when I go to pause something and then replay it I I really don't like my button to move um I think
it wouldn't though realistically I'm not going to see it anyway though so I guess this is all sort hypothe if you're pressing do you would you generally press in the middle of the screen yeah I think cu the middle of the screen here is still the player and you don't have to click on the play icon for it to play you just have to click on the player this is true so it would still work I'm  there I mean I don't it's not like I like it to be clear I just think of first Luke likes pause ads oh my
goodness of all the things that they could do going to be a s very soon luk legp ads.com should put him on float plane no no see he's already working on it that's why he says no because now we're onto his devious plan to put pause ads on float plane they're going to Riot Luke they're going to Riot these are our most loyal customers why would you do that to them what we are working on is getting uh official captions so that'll be nice oh that's cool yeah like are they like like machine learning
generated whisper generated and then there will be an option for manual upload as well wow that's pretty cool yeah that's going to save the social team a lot of work yeah yeah are they the main driver of this uh they've definitely asked for it but I think we just we hit a bit of a milestone in regards to like sight stuff so the the whole like angular to react upgrade thing finished and our new transcoding system is rein is instated in is that a correct way of saying that I don't know
whatever um both of those happened at a relatively similar period of time so like future development is bubbling again which is good sick all right yeah I think it's time for show after dark nice have we done all the major topics uh major topics yes there are other ones are wait Google play Celebrate Sonic oh wait we didn't talk about the rabbit R1 ah let's do it in the dark nice nice do you want me to do the Sonic thing while you're doing that Google Play celebrates Sonic but
gets every single fact wrong last Saturday the official Google Play Twitter account posted a strange thread supposedly showing off the changes in Sonic the Hedgehog's design over the last 30 years years however literally every Post in the entire thread is incorrectly labeled and inaccurate H each has been corrected with a community note uh some have suggested that the thread was generated using Ai and posted without human oversight however Google has yet to either remove or address the thread
despite widespread news coverage this is so weird and like the image that they even   generated I don't know where's the shadow over his this is Sonic is he appears in Sonic Boom never mind is possible that Google Play have confused for the game Sonic CD which did rele 993 though the reason why I said that is cuz his hand here which is like placed on his hip is not actually touching his hip so I was like maybe it's AI stuff but Eng a shot from inside the I don't think so I actually don't
think so either it's weird I think it's just shockingly poor again handlon razor I think it's just shockingly poorly researched you don't you don't think it's AI stuff no I don't think so I think this is too wrong to be AI I don't think an AI would get everything wrong like like what some stuff what AI did they use for that fa I don't think I believe that yep all right US Government adds foxes to AI Hen House thing whatever this means us homeland security has created a new artificial intelligence Safety and
Security Board which is intended to meet once every Financial quarter to discuss partial practical recommendations for the US government on how to best manage the threats posed by AI development yeah let's meet let's meet once a quarter nice no no this is great though the board has 23 members including Sam Alman of open AI Sachin Adella of Microsoft SAR Pai of alphabet and Dario amodi amod sorry of anthropic as well as Jensen hang of Nvidia there are also representatives from Adobe Amazon AMD
Cisco IBM Delta Airlines and Northrop Grumman this has led to criticism of the potential of regulatory capture and excessive industry influence seriously your AI Safety and Security Board is basically just made out of companies that from AI so the the US homeland security has created a new artificial intelligence Safety and Security Board also known as a a pre-planned lobbying meeting that happens once a quarter so they can make ridiculous amounts of money also I love that uh they have Sam
Alman and saan Nella in the same meeting as if they're representing like two very distinctly different companies when it's like yeah sure uh there are other members mostly civil rights experts academics and politicians though there's the odd inclusion of Vicki Hub president and CEO of accidental petroleum an energy company that is interested in incorporating AI just interested our discussion question is what is a good amount of Industry involvement to have in these kinds of oversight
recommendation bodies I mean obviously you have to have some because otherwise you watch the average politician try to talk about cuttingedge technology and you just you just about die right like it's what would you think about a rotating seat yeah I could see that being kind of interesting cuz I I could see being frustrated like if you're not one of the companies that gets selected but you're like trying to fight against some of these companies and then hearing different hearing different corporate
voices from time to time means with how little these guys are aligned with each other on there's there's certainly the opportunity to learn about their businesses without being unduly influenced by their businesses but this this seems hilarious like just laughably one-sided um and good luck with that all right time for some merge messages yeah sure we got a few here for you oh this should be a good one to start out after dark hello w. dll last night my fiance almost puked her stomach
out what was the situation where you were most worried about someone I'm waiting for my backpack to be shipped which very un I'll get child birth yeah that makes sense um I was I was deeply worried yvon's first labor was over 24 hours um and it was it was it was a gruelling ordeal neither of us slept um and uh our first child was in the 99th percentile for head  Ivonne I mean I was unfortunate I was on the yard podcast and I described is good breeding stock um but that doesn't necessarily mean
that she has 99th percentile head circumference hips hips yeah yeah um so so that was why that was uh that was why she ended up with the old uh on the first one thankfully she was able to to safely when do you make this maybe too personal I don't know when do you make that call like because he 24 hours uh the baby's heartbeat uh started to uh drop or the blood pressure or maybe it goes up I forget what it is but basically Happ some measurable metric baby was in distress and they hued her on a
gurnie um and this is actually how she lost most of her jewelry uh because we put it all in a bed because you're not supposed to wear jewelry during an operation they couldn't get her engagement ring off her finger because it was so swollen uh so fortunately we didn't lose that but everything else I put into a bag and I left in the room and it was gone by the time we came back from the O which was really unfortunate she had some really nice earrings and a necklace and stuff that's frustrating
yeah I mean it's fine you know what if she needs a new necklace H shout out I'll get you necklace this weekend just let me know like things went okay for us in life so it's fine but um no there was a really nice pair of Tanzanite earrings that she had that were quite sentimental cuz they were like the first earrings I'd ever bought her and stuff like that so that really sucks but you know other than that it was mostly just just the the the Panic of like okay it's go time
go now uh we need to go do this so do you like pre-approve that like if something goes wrong we will do this thing that wasn't an option okay because just letting her die and letting the baby letting the baby die it could have impacted either of them got it having a having a you know risk of this being very graphic having a a deceased infant child inside you is like not good for Mom either bad yeah yeah so like the whole thing the whole thing was was was very stressful and then our son was
actually the Intensive Care Unit for almost the first week um cuz he wasn't eating like the the birthing process had been extremely exhausting for him as well um yeah that that first that that birthing process and that first week was like was this a good  stressful yeah sheesh yeah it was tough um I forget what the rest of the question was but worried about someone you've been he's ordered a backpack what variant is he going to get uh if we're out of stock then you'll get the new
ones coming in stock which are the final uncore final V2 variant um otherwise you're getting what you're getting and then it'll have a virtual warranty for the second layer and we will definitely get you the upgraded carabiners once they are in stock and once they've shipped out to everyone who has already ordered So speaking of dead kids what advice do you have in keeping kids safe online I mean you just you got to talk to them that's the that's the only choice that's what everyone says and
that's the truth if you're looking for another answer I'm afraid you're not going to find it here bucko hey dll picked up a windbreaker which I love and have a couple questions about it what are the small Pockets inside the main pockets for and why are they different sizes the show for all the sex you'll be  merch I don't know I jokingly refer to uh like some of our little pockets as condom Pockets cuz realistically they're not really useful we just really like putting pockets on things we think
they're cool use it for an air tag you use it for like an airpod little holder thing there's definitely stuff you can use it for yep some people put cards in  yep oh Hoy d i noticed one of your recent videos had a generic voiceover correction and I was wondering what are your thoughts on using synthesis AI voiceovers for scenarios like this it's super convenient like when I'm traveling and I'm not around to shoot a pickup if they can just change a word  AI That's sick it's pretty sweet like
realistically no job is getting replaced right like the job of you know holding a holding a laptop running audacity or a little recorder thing in a mic under me is replaced by the job of you know entering the text in order to make that edit like like nothing's being replaced we're just doing it differently in a way that doesn't require me to come to set uh which is great love it you'll see more of it or wait you mean the generic one oh yeah I'm not as big of a fan of like Tik
Tok voice style ones um but I think that the team likes to do it when they think it's funny and that's just like a kind of humor I don't really get but I you know what I I don't like to stand in the way of just like silly little creative decision like that on the weekend we went up to The Stave Lake power plant thing the you can do the tour pretty cool actually but um afterwards I was dragged into an antique shop and the person working at the antique shop was listening
to a fully as far as I can tell fully AI generated biography on someone and I could tell the voice I could hear it so I could tell the the second I heard the voice I was like oh that's like one of those generic AI voice things and I told everyone that was with me um and I kept listening to it kept listening to it determined that it was probably an AI script as well due to the how it was worded and stuff weird and then uh Emma was talking to the the person and partway through the conversation they
mentioned like yeah I'm watching this biography thing I think it might be fake but I'm not sure like man we're so screwed by the way cin in float plane chat says why does everyone keep trying to pretend jobs aren't being replaced seems silly to pretend it's it's not going to happen he's not doing that that never happened context matters for crying out loud why are you trying to pretend that he said that I'm talking about a very specific thing when we are making an edit to our
video with our team doing the work on our product like it's um that is not a case where AI is is is taking our jobs but that doesn't mean that I'm saying that that isn't going to happen absolutely it's going to happen it's happening now it's already happened and  for live laugh and Dove if you could have uh if you could eliminate all of One Cuisine from each other's diet which one would the fight for the most oh I mean Luke would not allow me to cut chicken out of his diet I might as well
tell him to just cut off his own head what would I do I don't know probably die well you'd waste away first and then die if my diet had to stay exactly the same like if I didn't get to change anything and you were B to remove chicken I might actually just eventually yeah budgies and when we talked about that earlier he said chicken not poultry he said Cuisine Den we can we can stop talking about eating budgies now wow um sorry okay so if you if you could if you could had to okay which one would I
fight for the most to eliminate what's your favorite color of weles no you got to you have to you have to eliminate uh a cuisine from my diet what would I fight for the most what you fight for the most Cuisine is an interesting word for the thing that I'm thinking of but here hold on I'm I'm going to write down my answer let's see if you can get it would chicken even be considered a Cuisine oh for Luke it's a Cuisine I mean Frank's redot would be the most of let's see if you can get it
what's the thing I would fight for most man the answer is going to be so obvious once you get it that you're either going to get it and you're going to nail it and you're going to be like yeah I know or or you're going to not get it and you're going to be like I'm a idiot so those are the only two options I'm afraid I wonder if you know this though yeah I don't feel like I'm that confident in this cuz there's quite a few things that he's fairly passionate about in regards to food actually and they're quite
different Cuisine how are we defining Cuisine Loosely okay yeah I'm not worrying about  yeah I don't know I feel like I'm wrong but I just default to cereal the first  cereal yeah okay okay yeah because the other Contender that I had was pickles but I was like I feel like it's not on the same level yeah no it's high I like pickles but I'll I'll go six months without eating a pickle exact and I've seen that happen if I go a week without eating cereal the first thing I do when I walk in the door at home like
sometimes I don't even say hi to all of my family members I will go and eat a bowl of Honey Nut Cheerios or like Honey Nut shcks or whatever whatever I'm into that at that point like um I I like um I was less confident until yous I was less confident until you said that we were Loosely defining it as uh Loosely defining Cuisine cuz I was like is he talking about Burgers maybe like his own Burgers yeah like some of that oatmeal crisp like wild berry but I'll throw in like extra cranberries tell it's not
Burgers cuz he completely ignored that and just kept talking but Ser you know what I was I was going to write down would also accept Burgers cuz like all right so sort of sort of got it but I think the burgers is half of it the act of making them yeah yeah yeah I mean I don't know what I would I don't know what I would like serve guests cuz yeah I don't personally like chicken wings that much or like like drumsticks and stuff but like that's such a barbecue staple so if I couldn't throw burgers on the grill
man what would I even like like hot dogs really like it's fine for some people not Everyone likes Hot dogss whereas like if you have hot dogs and hamburgers and you offer a veggie version of both pretty much everyone is going to eat nobody's going to be like no I'm a leave hungry yeah yeah yeah I have no idea for Dan as far as I can tell that Dan will happily just literally eat nothing so I shut up shut your mouth so it's like what what do you what do you what do you threaten him to take
away it's not food Dan that's not cuisine is my breakfast oh almost got Luke there's no water in here that's why no I forgot to give you water my one chance no got him H Souls hey hey D uh first off great name Dan thanks Dan uh Second Great question for lonus I'm moving apartment soon and will be repainting it that's not really a question what advice do you have for that satin or egg shell how do I prep the walls oh all right well um the product that people use for prepping the
walls I think it's called tsp for a wall prep um yeah there you go to clean walls with TSP blah blah blah bucket of warm water um it's better than using bleach because there are certain kinds of I think it's mildew that will actually eat uh compounds in Bleach so you can actually end up like having more mildew with that said if you have if you have mildew on your interior walls that's probably um probably got other issues and you're talking I think I think you're talking about interior walls so
the first thing you want to do is just W wipe down the Walls um lightly lightly soapy water will work to wipe them down just whatever you do do not leave a soap film on them you got to make sure that you get that off and then um after that I would say you know figure out what kind of paint's on there if it's a really old house it might have oilbased paint which means that you'll have to pick a special product that is designed to go over top of oilbased paint almost nobody paints with oil inside the house
anymore and certain latex products will just peel right off of an oil paint like they won't to hear at all so make sure that you figure out what's on there you can use a little bit of acetone on a rag if it comes off it's latex based if it doesn't come off then it's oil based you got to watch out for that just let the paint store know and then beyond that I mean satin versus eggshell is just a finish right so you got to decide on a product um I would just I would say avoid avoid cheap paint get a good
quality paint one that has good coverage and buy less of it cuz you'll find that a lot of the time the cheaper product is just going to cover worse and you're going to end up doing another coat of it anyway oh um I like eggshell finish for walls I like semi gloss for trim very very traditional very very classic I mean people obviously do other things if I was painting a bathroom or a kitchen I would consider a glossier coating even for the walls just to make it more scrubbable but basically you can either
have uh there's different kinds of um additives you can only suspend so much in the paint suspension um so you can add uh coloring pigments you can add blocking pigments which will which will cover up what's underneath which will help them to to cover better uh you can add um resin there's only so much you can suspend in it and so when you have these different finishes uh the more uh the more resin you have in it uh one of the nice things about it is is the the more durable it is resin's really good
for hardening it but it makes it more glossy and the glossier it is the more it shows imperfection so that's why eggshell which is not a color it is the texture of an egg shell um and it has like a little bit of Sheen to it but it's mostly flat that's why it's a really nice Middle Ground between being durable enough to scrub with a with a washcloth but also um matte enough that it hides imperfections well you would believe how not flat your drywall is it's not flat I promise you it looks
like no matter who your contractors are and no matter how fresh the job was it looks like it's terrible and and that's that's not their fault she rocks really hard to deal with and getting it extremely flat is I I forget what CU I I had um talked to our contractors about how we have these scones in our theater room and they shine down and you can really see the like bulges in the walls you can see where the mud is um between the drywall sheets because because of just the angle of the light I'm like hey
so this wall isn't very flat and they're like yeah I'm like right but it's not very flat and they're like yeah but if you want it flat that's called I think it's called like a level four finish or something like that and they're basically like yeah it takes like 10 times as long or something like that you want to pay for it I'm like Noah like okay then uh then I think we've uh then I think we've reached a conclusion here yeah um so so that's that's what eggshell is for is it'll help hide those
imperfections um I use high gloss for anything you're going to touch so like a banister or railing anything like that you should be using a high gloss paint he didn't say it was particularly durable he said it was a happy medium yeah guys it's durable enough why what is the point of saying I said a thing I didn't say man stop it the number of times man I read on the internet a thing that I said that I completely fing never said at all it it's actually kind of incredible I say so much stuff it's so
easy to nail me on stuff I've said why go for the stuff I didn't say what's the point oh man it's pretty funny anyway um have fun you know it's fun project put down drop sheets there is no such thing as a job that's so small you shouldn't  sheet hi Dan's hands and lonus and Luke's voice if you were given the ability to advance one piece of technology or breakthrough what would you progress for example Battery  the two examples that they gave were fantastic yeah that's like honestly I
would have taken batteries um yeah fine I'm going to go with screens then I would make them so much more power efficient that I don't need as much battery hey I turned it around it's basically batteries now got him I was going to go with a more kind of broader Tech and just uh mixed reality glass that look like normal glasses that actually look like normal glasses you know it's funny that's the product that I had in mind when I said screens there you go nice on the same wavelength heck yeah computer
brain interfaces hey lldd XE OTR trucker here uh just got my tax write off t-shirt it's officially a work shirt for a write-off if you had to live out of a semi-truck what tech would you take with you loving the Ally dang it but they took my answer again I would gosh darn it I mean I would definitely take like whatever the ball or starlink is if I can get away with it like having actually good internet on the road would be pretty big deal a huge deal for me  um how much how much P
like I guess you're usually when you're stopped you're going to be stopped at a stop like a truck stop or a destination of some kind yes and no like sometimes you're just on the side of the road in the pull over how much power do you have when you're stopped there I mean that's a good question I've never driven a big rig professionally believe it or not yeah I don't know paint housee yes Big R Drive no yeah not so much I'm most of the people that I've talked to that do this type of stuff have battery
powered things which makes me think that you're charging them at a truck stop or something and then potentially using them when you're not there so you probably don't have a ton of power available um unless you're running your truck which you probably don't want to just waste all that fuel um probably not yeah probably not um I could see electric trucks being kind of cool for that actually the Allies is probably kind of  there wow Cop Out answer well I'm I'm thinking cuz like you i' I've seen
people have like PlayStations and TVs in their rigs when they when they have like the bed set up you know they have those ones not all of them have those but when when you have like the bed set up you've seen like at the foot of the bed there's a TV and they have a PlayStation there and that's pretty cool I've seen that a few different times one thing that I've always kind of wondered about is why you don't see like some crazy maybe I just haven't seen it but like a PC Gamer guy
who has his truck set up but there's a computer the power draw is pretty high I think you just wouldn't see it cuz I know I definitely know of some that have nazes in their trucks for example to carry media around okay that's kind of sick like I would definitely have a in my truck that's pretty cool especially if I didn't have my starlink if I have starlink I don't need it as much but if I didn't that's my backup is I would have like a sick NZ with a whole bunch of media okay the sleeper trucks have a
small diesel generator on them providing 1500 watts usually interesting interesting I feel like yeah I am still coping out but I feel like the Ally is just kind of a sick option cop it is sorry Itor hey we've got updates for smash Champs what's that what's that look at that a sneak peek at our concession and seating area wow so this will be the concession and then it looks like a normal kitchen look all right we didn't reinvent kitchens I'm sorry didn't even innovate this will be a small seating
area what else we got oh we got more stuff what's this is this the viewing area this is the retail store oh no downstairs yeah so there's our slat walls so we're going to put what's the yellow thing products on there that is a light for the construction oh okay yep nice nice all the audio stuff came in this week Stringer our stringing  nice are you still going to string your own rackets no man I'm I'm going to use my owner privilege so hard can be like hey guys do you mind
taking care of one of these rackets for me and then I'll pay is that going to affect the the manager numbers shouldn't I'll pay it's fine nice but I like might expect it to be done pretty quickly what should you probably shouldn't pay they should just track how many times you do it because then you're just giving you're just it's just more taxes for no reason that's true actually but technically I'm supposed to pay those taxes that is definitely a personal badminton racket never
mind of course you should pay very  guy yes more yes luck I see you're going to be attending op sauce this year are there any specific open source programs or platforms that you're hyped to see being developed uh so many of them FFM Peg it's it's like so underrated it it it runs like so many things and you don't hear people really talk about it very often you just hear people talk about like I mean we talk about float plane and maybe I don't mention it enough so I'm trying
to give it credit right now uh but FFM Peg is like incredibly amazing um and our our internet offerings would be a lot worse without it I'll say that much um so there I'll say that one I'm always excited when they keep pushing  forward so I'm guessing I fell for your cunning plan when I submitted that dead pixel bug report what are your favorite  websites I always loved the little dinosaur Jump game that you could play when uh a page didn't load in Chrome I that was probably my personal favorite
pass isn't it still a thing maybe I think somebody made a multiplayer version of it I can't remember if that was a thing maybe I'm crazy play Chrome dino game press space to  go Chrome dyo multiplayer look at that no way this feels too easy I guess harder right didn't somebody make a hot dog to play it yeah yeah somebody like mechanically automated a basically a cheat for the game game and then I think he got a job seriously yeah I think they hired him that's amazing man I think it was just a sensor
on the screen that when it detected the like darker color yeah but you got to you got to jump you got to crouch you got to uh gets faster can you crouch is yeah you got to duck under things uh I can't look at my arrow keys right now this just say down arrow uh I can't see them I didn't know you had to are you sure you have to crouch I don't think you can Crouch Dan mhm are you messing with me what is happening right now okay  dark dude he's gaming right now so sweaty did you guys know this is the guy
that beat lwig shut up a dick someone should challenge them to this Dino Jump game I wonder what the high score is for this whatever it is it's embarrassing well I think they've made the the the bot that just does it right so like are you going to beat the bot I I don't think there's crouching Dan I think you're wrong I'm not well how do you crouch why would you crouch maybe they changed it there hasn't been a single cuz it has dark mode now gas all  real if it was it wasn't my fault there
was there was crunching I'm not cing I swear it's down arrow did they remove that because it's it switches between light and dark and there was definitely crouching I don't remember it switching between light and dark mode and I'm pretty sure I played it for longer than that before and it seems to do it on a pretty regular basis okay this needs to actually just kill me at  good I know there was crouching okay uh where are we what are we doing well if you beat that score
then you're a better gamer than lwig I guess yep 100% that's how it works I think y if I beat lwig and you beat me then you beat lwig by definition bigger fish right that's how it works hey hey Luke I'm a self-taught software engineer who started my professional career about a year ago what are your thoughts on companies that crunch to meet deadlines and how does float plane compare I mean we've done it um it's extremely uncommon like extremely I don't remember the last time we've done it and when we do it 
generally not me driven if that makes sense um I I recognized a long time ago that that I actually enjoy those activities cuz I don't know my brain's broken or something um but that generally that is significantly frowned upon so I have taken on a a stance of like if other people are just doing it by default I will generally you know join in and not stop them but I try not to impose it because I think that's bad I think we're also fairly blessed to be in an industry where we mostly set our own deadlines
for things um I think you run into some problems in things like the gaming industry when you're announcing the launch of a game and then say you discover issues with the game ahead of the launch and you're like oh my goodness we need to fix all this stuff or whatever uh so you announce the launch of a game and then you do a play test and it's horrible so you're trying to improve it for whatever reason then you're crunching because of that like there's there's a lot of Industries where crunch is more real
for for more real reasons if that makes sense maybe your piece of software has to match up with a piece of hardware and uh your driver team GPU compan you need to be ready on time for the launch or whatever like there's there's there's situations where it can maybe make sense as as annoying and frustrating as it is it can maybe make sense I don't think it often makes sense with float plane um I can appeal to you guys and I've done it where we I'm I'm saying we're going to
work on something and then we end up working on something else or or we we make some change uh and then I just like you know apologize to you guys on wano explain why we made the change what we're pivoting to what you guys can get instead Etc and then people are usually actually pretty cool with it and I appreciate that and that saves our developers from crunch um not entirely yeah it helps though sometimes they crunch even when you tell them not to explicitly which that can actually
frustrating be a genuine very large problem cuz people will burn out from that and I'm like well hold on I'm telling you not to keep working it's not this is not reverse psychology actually don't do that yeah like don't work on the weekend take your weekend off it's actually better for all of us like just just don't my favorite line we we had an employee at one point that was very problematic that way and my favorite line with them was always just like you're no good to me dead yeah
um like I don't know how to be more explicit than just don't yeah yeah it's um and it's frustrating cuz I think there's some like human spirit in the the desire to like push really hard to help the team and stuff like that like I get it I understand it's it's driven by positive things yeah but it can but I need you to be here on Monday and functional and happy yeah I don't want to it's it's like I don't want to I don't it's not constructive for anyone if you're like like cranky and burnt out yeah or if you
like Miss things in your personal life because you're pushing for it and then those people are complaining at you and then therefore you're upset and all this kind of stuff in that resentment makes it back to work it's like but I didn't ask you to do that yeah so so we're a little bit privileged to be in a situation where we're not running into situations too often where it's like super super required y uh other other Industries are not as privileged and I think sometimes s those
Industries will recognize that they're in that state and then abuse it yeah because people getting into that industry will understand that that will happen but they don't necessarily understand how much will happen because the company leans on it intentionally and that's really bad but it's also not always true I don't know it's just okay what's next hey dlll with MSI dropping AMD GP sorry yeah with MSI dropping AMG gpus is MSI trying to wound Nvidia the focus on a I will Nvidia need
a brand partner with no ties to AMD gpus to handle products with lesser margins uh if anything uh Nvidia tends to reward their most loyal servants with the products that have the higher margins that higher margin has turned into more and more of a pittance over the years to the point where evj ultimately walked away from the business but um as for why MSI seems to be quietly dropping AMD gpus yeah I'd say it's a strategic move I mean it's not like MSI is giving up their partnership with AMD overall
they're clearly still developing motherboards for AMD ryzen platforms but um it's been very clear for some time that AMD is just not competitive on the GPU side of things and it doesn't look like there's any obvious light at the end of that tunnel so strategically if I was MSI seeing the longtime partnership with Nvidia and kind of going okay if someone's going to Blink and walk away from the Radeon partnership why shouldn't it just be us like why are we why are we sabotaging the 85 90% of the
business that we're doing on our discret cards with Nvidia over this like handful of stupid radon gpus that realistically some of them were probably spending more developing than we actually making back in the margins on these things it's not like there's a ton of money in selling radio on cards either I think if I was XFX I'd be kicking myself pretty hard at this point because they'd be the last game in town they were EX exclusive Nvidia till they  AMD yep you talked about the LTT wallet
about a year ago on W show any updates still in development dead hey dll what is Labs policy on AI scraping if it's not allowed have you heard about tools like Nightshade or have you considered an AI chatbot of your own good old can't beat him join him I'm not familiar with Nightshade specific specifically we T cool um I forget which one that is we're not doing a lot of that stuff yet we it's very possible we will do like poisoning tools at some point um there's also some
groups that are trying to develop like you know like a robots.txt oh that night shade yeah okay uh there there's groups that are trying to come up with like a effective equivalent for scrapers that tells them that it's not wanted um so if that happens we'll probably do that I I don't know it's it's a that we need to solve eventually but right now we're more focused on getting our processes down uh getting our article uh publication schedule down and the get making sure the quality is really tight
uh we have a our first keyboard article up on the site right now just G to show  including Force graphs for different Keys you can select any key you want how  that it's my screen right now pretty neat oh here dang it oh we both clicked ours at exactly the same time I was doing a whole thing I realized you were you were talking yeah so you can select different keys and you can see the force that we measured on those different Keys cuz remember the key cap itself has a different weight to it so even if you
use exactly the same key switch uh you won't necessarily have exactly exactly the same experience we've got some we've got some cute little video here why is this not on float plane I don't know we'll figure it out later showing latency testing got our average wired latency yeah good stuff right it's going to take time it's going to take be clear to the dev team that is the correct way to do it right now don't worry about it yes do not crunch yourself into a a freely accessible float plane player the the
architecture of float plane is not designed for free video distribution is designed to be authenticated uh so we would have to actually do a significant amount of work is my understanding in order to make a free player that we can use our float plane CMS to upload to be kind of annoying we'll see and if you there's there's just so many other things we can work on and YouTube is just so free it's right there it's right there and it's free yeah I get it I get it yeah hi L LD lonus and Lou what was one
of your most impactful celebrity or person of clout encounters that You' have had who was it and how did meeting this person either changed and then it's cut off guess changed you changed your outlook on life it definitely didn't really change my outlook on life but I like this story um do you remember when you had that talk with markiplier like a billion years ago and you talking about like hosting and stuff this is this would have been like s years ago or something I did not know
that I met Markiplier I don't think I don't know if you met him or not I know you talked to him really yeah cool you talked to him about hosting and you talked to him about my hosting blah blah blah blah blah so I knew he knew who we were anyways that's the only part of the context that wow I totally forgot about that yeah he's kind of a big deal we my my friends and I were going to pax's Prime and we stopped in at Starbucks cuz a bunch of my friends want coffee I don't drink coffee whatever but I
noticed that he's standing there off on the side and no one's noticed him yet the reason why I know no one's noticed yet is cuz the entire restaurant wasn't hoarding him because he's kind of a big deal little bit and I saw him standing over there and he was like mostly kind of keeping his head down and I think with intention cuz it's pretty early in the morning he just wants some freaking coffee yeah I don't blame him um and I saw him and we kind of locked eyes and I just head nodded and he head nodded and
we went back to ignoring each other and I was like cool that's pretty awesome yeah I was like that's I'm happy that this didn't turn into like a thing I'm happy I was able to not bother him in that moment and it was just like I don't know it was pretty cool yeah that's about it I don't think like I don't think I've been hugely  kind um trying to remember I'm trying to remember what his name is um man the the star bomb guy someone help me out here Star Bomb guy yeah ego Raptor that's right oh yeah yeah I've
told the story before but I I met him at an event and I didn't realize who he was he like was talking to me about maybe we could like use his like live production company services at some point if we ever wanted to do like a tour or something I I I was like networking and stuff and he seemed cool and everything but I didn't realize who he was until I like looked up his name in the elevator and uh I had to like go find him later in the event I was like yo I had no idea who you were I like
grew up watching your cartoons and stuff add respect see you later that's pretty cool that's actually pretty cool yeah I mean that's the thing right about an animators right like it's and he does so many different voices it's not like you would just know from his voice unless you unless you know is he like or a game grumps Watcher or something yeah which I wasn't yeah cuz I I believe he did the animated stuff for a long time before he started showing up on yeah like I watch this stuff on like 
exactly First Merch message glad to be here simple question when car focused Channel I love Tech and I love cars and I want to make me a tech and car YouTube channel sandwich then watch every car video that we upload to the other channels and the more we can make the pitch for financial viability the more we will be able to make that dedicated Channel or channels in the future it's a super crowded space though guys it's not like we can just walk in and immediately have a reason
for being um I definitely have a lot of thoughts but you know reviewing products is uh ton of work and I think right now our main focus is on just making sure that our that our Tech videos are solid um cars will come when they come hi Luke I am studying data analytics and in the process of building a website that utilized a database to budget my money and save receipts how did you decide what to use for float plane and then designing it Linus Le development let's go I want an Excel
database Luke how do you decide what to use for Flo plane no no no none of that was lineus slide development he had no  all hey hey hey hey hey hey we wouldn't use cloud flare today if it wasn't for me I forced him to call them I think we would be using them today okay today we probably would but it would have taken a lot longer it would have taken a while longer he was so stubbornly like determined he was determined that they were not going to work for dos protection for our site I mean stuff
still got through I was still a little bit right but I wasn't right enough you were not nearly right enough um why are you making a website for this um in the process of building website that utilized nothing is allowed to be for fun um I'm in the process thatti I hope you don't actually hold that conviction are we we're not allowed to talk anymore no no no no if if it's just for fun that's cool if if you want something I I would honestly really suggest that's why we monetize our hanging
out all my all my hobbies are monetized as well I'm no I'm no better yeah so what are you what are you talking about um I I think you'd be better off just doing fancy Google Sheets um and like learning how to do fancy things with Google Sheets because I think a lot of people don't realize at all how powerful it is with its ability to link to other sheets and things um there's also looker studio now which they renamed Big Data studio and you can use Big Data Studio no it used to be now it's looker Studio
which is Google is a different thing than they killed the other one no it's just a dumb name it is a dumb name tell us how you feel so stupid and that can have uh Google sheet data bases yeah Excel is better except Excel isn't remotely accessible okay guy what about Office 365 got him it's bad the web version is bad all right uh okay so the decisions let me let me get to the root of this how do you decide what to use for flow plane uh and then designing it we I mean I tried
to make some decisions with Jake uh and we wrote down our pretty bad decisions and then AJ then AJ was was like hold on yeah and then we went with what AJ said for the most part and then I fun fact he still works for float plane yeah it's great that AJ um I had the team at the time religiously read the Netflix blog M I would I would post it in our slack every time they posted a new article I like how you refer to it as the team yeah it's like you and AJ and some volunteers yeah heck yeah there was
volunteers back then that's true more people um but yeah we we would read the Netflix blog and we we got a lot of our CU my info on it was like a lot of these websites are not sharing information on how they're making their video websites it was very closed back then very very closed and then there's Netflix just being like hey here's how we do basically everything and I was like okay well this isn't exactly what we're trying to build but it's pretty close so let's take some ideas from these you
know people that are clearly doing a great job of this and try to mirror a lot of what they're doing and it worked quite well for us for a while and now we've of pivoted onto our own things now that we have a lot of experience in the space um but yeah we we learned from another player in the space that has been doing really well if you're doing it for fun do that if you're not doing it for fun seriously consider something like Google Sheets instead of making a  this yeah okay here's a here's a good
one Hey dlll nearly a year has passed since Taran took over as CEO what are some challenges and positive developments observed since lonus step down basically a year review I mean it's easier for you guys to answer this one have you noticed anything positive or things just generally worse uh we feel more like a real company you can take that however you want um oh I'll take it oh my oh my um I think what are some of the challenges I don't think there's been a ton of challenges particularly
pertaining to that to be  a I don't know what it's like a completely different  same so it's cereal but it isn't but it like you eat like a cereal flavored candy bar and you're like wait so it's a cereal bar yeah [Laughter] um I don't know it's like it's it's very similar but it's not the same like Daran has a different approach to things and a different style but they're clearly highly related overall The Guiding star is the same I mean it's not like I would have brought in someone
who's just going to completely mess up myy I don't I don't think there's a lot of like new challenges because of that if that makes sense I mean we're definitely we're definitely doing some stuff differently like our entire leadership team which is about a almost A fifth or a quarter of the company some somewhere in there uh is doing like executive leadership training right now I think that's a positive development not a challenge oh you trying to think  yeah I mean he's remote still like half
the time I consider that a challenge but I guess for most people it probably doesn't make much of a difference no because you you were too spread thin anyway so you weren't there anyways yeah that's fair so like yeah what difference does it make all right fair enough if anything there's probably more time being spent because when he is here half the time that he's here that's more time so I don't know someone asked for more French terry hoodies and someone else sniped me on the reply I said
k sorry I think I just showed that one um okay last one I've got for you here lonus I just purchased an S2 delmare for my daily commute I have no idea what that is I will go look it up while you continue to read what is your favorite bike gear accessories safety equipment or Tech likely will order a Break Free it looks cool I mean yeah it looks sick the S2 gilar uh I don't know it doesn't really oh yeah it kind of looks like it yeah I think it's electric far ranging fast
charging absolutely that makes me think Electric City range 181 kilometers LEL two charge in 78 minutes that's pretty she goes Dang Dang Dang yeah she goes um Zoom stunts performed by professionals good Lord voh okay I'm doing the  hi any who yeah that looks super cool I got to confess I um I test drove an electric bike a while back and it just didn't sing to me so I ended up dumping a bunch of money into my sv650s it's an old 2003 but um I I'm really looking forward to having it back
on the road as for my favorite gear honestly I just have like kind of  uh I just I just like riding my bike you have a lot of the same stuff to yeah I haven't I haven't I don't replace things unless I absolutely have to like I buy a new helmet every you know five or six years like you're supposed to yeah I'm going to I'm going to paint my new one to match my bike yeah I don't probably all the same stuff right I'm assuming it's something from someone has some armor in it it I got the one that 
know nice I don't know man I'm just I'm not much of a it's funny cuz I'll say stuff like I'm you know I'm not that much into the Aesthetics of things I just I'm I don't care about the brand I'm just buying functionality like I say stuff like that and then I am spending I kid you not like thousands of dollars painting my bike but that's not a it's not a about the end result like if I was buying a bike on Craigslist I would just get whatever one I don't care what color it is it's more about the project of
doing it um so I don't I don't know how to address this I I have some wired headphones that I that I installed into my helmet nice and then I run them like down to a to a thing so so they don't go in my ear so I can hear everything around me but I got like speakers like they're they're like the the the the drivers out of a pair of headphones and they just kind of like sit in the little ear things inside my helmet like you're probably expecting me to talk about like my sick you know
heads up display Helmet or whatever no man I just wear whatever fits sorry I'm I'm so oh man yeah I'm I'm basic can you get like a gole Maps HUD on probably yeah I think there's some pretty cool helmets but like man you could have replaced that every years buy a visor that has you have to buy the whole helmet I don't know maybe but like helmets are already expensive for like yeah mine's good it's good like and to be clear I'm not buying low quality stuff like I have a showy helmet which is not a word to
describe it it's a brand yeah um man I don't know apparently none of the HUD helmets are good yet like that's the thing right is I I tend to I tend to wait for other people to buy garbage and then I'll buy like a good one when it doesn't suck yeah fair enough all right I think that's it do we have any machinists on staff we definitely have some part-time uh machinists I think ours is total four axis Dan would you know uh machinist or our machine what do you mean yeah our our torok how many axes
does it uh yeah we have an A axis so it's four axis sorry did you said eight and then you said four a AIS yeah that's the r one right yes that would be the fourth axis yeah okay okay okay uh so that's what we have and we definitely have some folks that are more than capable of using it like andan I got to learn how to do conversational on it it was terrifying but they are not full-time machinists you will see some really cool um you you will see some really cool discussion from them about
how it works though in an upcoming video where we made a giant version of the  house that's kind of cool actually yeah it feels like something you'd see at like Science World it'll be for a stream so I have to build a computer with it apparently I I have only gotten to see a picture of it so far I'm pretty excited it looks hilarious like it's thicker around than this nice for the handle I'll get it done yeah yeah like it's like the guy that she tells you not to worry about version of the screwdriver
not a bad screwdriver yeah all right uh someone asks if there will be super checks after party honestly I played Super checks at Lounge night with someone the other night I can't I got to go do medicine for the birds oh I mean that's fine I was going to say um losing it a little bit no dang no it was boring oh it's not actually like fun to play against people right now um and you're still fun good but hey last time was pretty close you definitely beat me but it was pretty close yeah but like I'm I'm kind of
tired of winning every time you should have not done the tape review yeah maybe not but I want I wanted to be good you were good I wanted to get good though hey we never talked about the rabbit r won we kind of missed we kind of missed a it kind of sucks and we should have had a launch video on it uh I don't think we had it yet oh yeah we got it though I did a short circuit well it kind of sucks no we don't have to do the whole topic but I will say watch the short circuit video because no matter how bad
you think the R1 is um it managed to be worse in the short circuit video oh boy I I I love teenage engineering stuff I don't think I'll ever buy anything they ever make because it's all way too expensive but I really like their design work and it seems to be of dubious utility yeah generally speaking I don't really understand what that company does or why it exists some of their stuff just looks really cool though I wish more things looked like that yeah but I don't buy stuff for looking cool exact I
don't never buy any of it but it looks sweet um yeah people have this like weird relationship with teenage engineering that I that is true I don't have that I don't understand like they just they're like fans of them they'll just buy stuff just because they yeah I'm not going to do that worked on the design but like I kid you not it has a giant touchcreen covering half of the front of the unit and you can't interact with it you have to use the wheel this just looks so cool sure but so what I'm
never going to buy it yeah Not only would I never use it but I would have no like I can't I literally even if I was in this interest industry I don't think I would buy this yeah but it's a it's a it's like an instrument how else will you dial the telephone awesome it looks so cool they make some neat instruments but I'll never buy it anyways um so yeah I think I think the design looks cool and stuff and I I don't hate the idea of making dedicated devices for things that you
would normally use your phone for yeah because I don't hate the idea of getting off your phone more you should watch the video anyway cuz it's going to be really funny I probably will thanks for tuning in we'll see you again next week same    leg um
