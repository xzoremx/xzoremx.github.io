Hollywood has been using Teek in movies since the computer was first invented and they've been getting it wrong for just as long and just like the corridor crew when we see it mistakes in movies it's pretty hard to overlook and focus on the rest of the story which is why we were here at computex and we invited Wendell from level one Tex to help take a look and break down some scenes from TV shows and movies to see what they got wrong but maybe also some stuff they got right I was wandering outside and they
brought me in that is actually true and we also brought in this message from our sponsor ug green their NEX ode x 160 W charger is smaller than the original nexe and comes equipped with four charging ports bring your 16-in MacBook Pro from 0 to 50% in just 27 minutes with its 140 watt USBC port  starting with the TV show Bones in season 7 episode 6 their computer gets hacked because someone accidentally uploaded a virus by scanning a skeleton let's watch Once We scan the bones the
computer can predict scenarios consistent with the damage yeah now now that's realistic especially these days okay now the computer should tell us what caused the internal injuries a gunshot there whoa whoa whoa whoa I'm not even into the computer stuff yet and that is straight up not how that would work it's not even pointing at a bone okay they fire under the rib cage I'm sorry was it a shotgun whoa whoa whoa what what just happened you think I smell something  no yeah the computer wouldn't catch on
fire even if the cooling failed catastrophically it wouldn't catch on sometimes the wires will catch on fire but that would be at the back yeah you can get little like spot Burns now there is a product that is specifically designed with a kill switch that is supposed to heat up the circuits and Destroy them a lot of the flight data stuff in in classified airplanes also have explosives so you just pull the thing and it's like thermite and it just and then it's gone but it would have to
be designed for that also that first flame was about as convincing as when we did our April Fool's video where I said our server room was on fire so it turned out the malware killed our fans they're supposed to turn on when the CPU reaches 75Â° but the malware added a zero and made it 750 how did this malware get past our fire it doesn't go past 255 sorry okay for everyone who gets that that's hilarious it doesn't catch fire immediately what it would slow down or turn off it's also weird cuz like you
wouldn't unless the program is badly written and your adversary knows exactly the software that you're using and the version you could do this with like a buffer overflow so like the data is parsed as commands instead of data but most of the time when you're scanning something it's just going to be data I feel like by giving it that thorough of a debunking you're almost respecting it too much even if what he said wasn't true there isn't a processor on Earth that would manage to heat up that fast
even if you turn the fans off it originated in my computer wait but it wouldn't have gotten in there unless you had downloaded something yeah or uploaded all you uploaded were the scans of those bones are you telling me that there's a computer virus in the bones the computer virus is in the bones imagine you had like a CT scan and you have a malformed CT scan file and you give it to your hospital and they parse that and then it turns into a virus that's kind of what happens with PDFs or anything in your
emails like you get a malform PDF you're not running a PDF thing and it takes over your computer looking at a PDF should be a perfectly safe operation but it takes over and does stuff so that part is the least unrealistic part and it's really a stretch and no two scans are likely to be exactly identical because that's largely an analog process again I think you're respecting it far too much also what was the point of that just to light their computer on fire a motov cocktail would get you there a lot
faster and a lot cheaper anything promising it's hard to say all the documents were photographed are in Chinese he got his hard drives scans of everything in now hold on just a moment here this is disappointing because like some of the stuff is like there there's there's artistic creative license you know maybe they scan the bones that could have been a bomb this is just they didn't Google it does that even have  custody again respecting it far too much now just a minute we've got as hard
drives for one thing that is one hard drive for another thing really you couldn't afford any more than a do stop power supply from the P3 era is that a 20 pin connector yep yeah that's like 300 W power supply you will have plenty of stuff to go through in the morning he has so many questions he's like that's not a hard drive I haven't talked about this much but Luke and I actually did a little bit of unpaid Consulting on a Hightech script for some medium don't worry about
the details because I'm pretty sure I'm under NDA but speaking from that experience if I had to guess how these things happen I would say it's not because nobody knew better it's not because a tech EXP expert wasn't hired to come in and tell them something different but because they actually made a conscious decision to not care or they or they did it too late like there was some changes that we had suggested that were like well we can't do it now I think they could have sourced an e-w
hard drive instead of an e-w power supply system breach go firewall one we got a problem this is from Castle someone sned a rat to one of my servers a remote access tool we're being hacked first of all it's remote access Trojan like is it the more firewalls I have the more safe I am no no it's like swiss cheese defense right all the firewalls have minor vulnerabilities and you just have a variety of them the whole way through yeah that's the Battle Star Galactica model I love the percentage to breach
thing I love that they have this tool where they're like we know we suck let's make sure that we can measure exactly how screwed we are yeah what's the morale of the team that develops that breached in red I mean if you could figure this out it would be great cuz as firewall one hits breached you just message the backup battery and be like hey you need to turn off right now and it turns off yeah no that would be too sensible and look I know that this is probably going to be the most pedantic
nitpick of all but that's not how you spell synced I'll start an intrusion  is who hieroglyphs uhoh oh they're hold on you don't decrypt a firewall no firewall number four he stopped respecting them too much his brain's broken yeah it's not this is  no it's coming from inside the city trying to narrow it down okay what even is this it's supposed to be narrowing down which is funny because how this circle Works they already know theoretically that it's in the middle I can ping it a friend that's three states
away has a lower ping than my neighbor across the street so I don't this is like oh let's figure out how far away it is it doesn't always work like this yeah tight faster oh my God this scene is like 3 minutes long that barely slowed him down I'm sorry but he's going to find us in less than a minute should we abort no we we've only got two of the Blinky boxes left to go I like that that's good come on got  exact address that's Castle's office he must be working with Haley she's got the
skill set for this and she is about to breach our firewall if she does they'll have instant access to our entire investigation no they won't okay tell me this you have breached the URL of apple.com do you have instant access to all of the data that's on it no although Dell if all of it's public Dell's public suffering lately with that though they did exfiltrate a lot of data to do with the customer orders and names and but it would take time yes and if they were if Dell was literally sitting there
preventatively anti-hacking yeah no in fact they would not have access to everything I can launch a cybernuke but it'll completely fry a cybernuke cyber what is this interface why do they have this interface but they don't have the ability to sh off the power oh what just happened we got Cyber News Armageddon I'm afraid it doesn't work that way you don't just have like digital icbms I mean I assume that what's supposed to happen there is like you can trick the person attacking you into
running some executable code and it wipes something but it doesn't work that way someone hacked a curtain ad on the scroll MD site looks like a normal ad right and this is the code for the ad but peekaboo there's actually two two codes written right on top of each other okay we were doing really good surprisingly good for AIT I was convinced this was quite solid that was actually really cool like and pretty realistic uh injecting a malicious redirect into some kind of seemingly
real advertisement especially a pharmacy where you'd collect a lot of personal information and valuable personal information about people maybe that guy was just thinking his coor workers or morons and is using that to explain it and it's like okay this code actually injects this other code it's not like code on top of another code I'm convinced that dude wants to claim that he has like two weeks to a month of work to do and he's going to do it in like four hours now that sounds
realistic the target had to breach the scroll MD service to inject this Cod not true actually you could just exploit uh kind of delivery Network this happens all the time he's operating almost entirely on the surface web where he can reach millions of everyday sys on the surface web what is the surface web uh well as opposed to like the dark web or better script dialogue for that would have been it's like they're you're utilizing like public ad networks and they're flying under the radar of public
ad networks yeah are you you should do this are you audition for your next career move Consulting for Hollywood they won't listen to you no 218 gone okay no what I mean if it's a pharmacy website there's probably tens of I mean just bot traffic is going to be tens of thousands of ips but look at the IPS 164 387 that it'll never be more than 255 on any number whoopsy Doodles no that might be on purpose just cuz like you could accidentally have an IP address in there and it's like oh look it's bang are all
of these breaking that rule think you might be right whole like there's reserved IP ranges for kind of like 5555555 there's fake IPS so they could just use those if they actually knew they need like a whole ocean of them and these all look like they broke that rule yeah none of these are are can be real IP I don't think any of them are maybe it was on purpose then let's give them that one and their whole narrowing exercise doesn't work at all because the guy working in the mail room and the
executive would actually have the same public facing IP likely yeah God kidding me Target's using an IR LED array makes his license plate on B the cameras all four tires up okay yes that's actually kind of cool and like that and the the whole none of those IPS would be working stuff like there's there's you know there traces in here all four tires give up Bluetooth signals report when they're low on pressure what do you think I don't know if they're Bluetooth Bluetooth no they
really don't yeah that would be done over low frequency signal yeah that's not even a little bit Bluetooth uh the there is something really wild that's happening with self-driving cars and that is the standard for aircraft like the aircraft to aircraft communication uh has been co-opted and modified slightly for carto car communication so a lot of smart cars are emitting tons of radio and can be uniquely identified if you drive a Tesla your Tesla can be fingerprinted and and tracked without a
license plate now Wendell this is something I legitimately don't know would a Bluetooth device have a MAC address okay okay okay I've never looked up the MAC address of my Bluetooth device well Apple actually has been worried about this for a long time and so they've been doing Mac randomization and Android got that feature later so when you connect to a public Wi-Fi uh actually I used to work on a project for a very large commercial entity where we were doing Bluetooth uh Beacon tracking
and you could track somebody moving through a commercial store like a Marshalls or something like that it's like oh the same people are coming back we don't know who they are but they're they're probably somebody that bought something oh yeah that's kind of like what they do on the cruises where they can bring your drink right to you see that little white box right there the Department of Transportation traffic monitoring system picks up Bluetooth signals to report traffic patterns sadly this has become
reality it's not Bluetooth no but if you're trying to communicate this to people that are going to watch this show it's not that bad why don't you just say Wireless yeah yeah no way I'm getting HED this is classic no no this is okay like there's just so much they already burned to the NC my goodness my frontal lo I have never actually seen this this this is a super legendary scene if someone is stealing your documents the documents that are being stolen are not opening on your
screen like it doesn't you're not going to get a million it would be impossible to do any work on this computer because of all the popups remember the '90s like you get all the popups and bad things happening on your computer because of the malware it's like oh what is this take the node and dump them on the other side of the router I'm trying it's moving too fast have you seen this before Oh my God this is so like okay two people one keyboard does not work in any there's just no Universe where two
people one keyboard works ah where'd it go Abby I didn't do anything I thought you did no hence why you don't have two people on One keyboard he unplugged it well that's the first person with a brain we did it literally the most reasonable thing in that entire scene with all the submissions you guys gave us from crime show like CSI and NCIS we could probably make an entire second episode just from that so hit the like button if you guys want to see a second one of these I mean according to IMDb
NCIS has a budget of only $25 million per episode so that would explain why they just didn't have the budget to accurately represent hacking and Technology on the show um let's pivot though and take a look at a movie that had a budget of a mere $200 million surely they did a much better job a oh good it's f Ramsey has created something interesting bring it up yes sir say hello to God's eye now this little bastard hacks into anything that's on the digital Network that means
every this is certainly the intelligent Services want this if we look at it it's like we we and they try to make components of this the headlines for the Pegasus malware and the Dual elliptic curve incursions by the intelligence services and this is scary close to re reality possibly maybe I say thank God it can only access anything on the digital Network as opposed to the analog networks that we're still rolling one thing that I may argue is that I don't know that the Fast and Furious universe
is actually the same as our own really I think at this point I think it's arguable that it is not actually the same universe Dr Chan recalculate the new Thruster data and relay it to Blue Oyster called immediately insens he Roger that do to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what's wrong seriously you auto updating now General I won't be able to calculate the right data for the satellite for 49 minutes how long you impact 11 minutes and 44 seconds  Microsoft it do be like that sometimes okay this is actually pretty funny but
you could probably use a different machine on the network I'm enjoying this one enough though that I don't feel like I need to pick it apart it didn't pull me complet completely out of the scene Elijah actually has some inaccuracies in there that we were supposed to notice their group policy almost certainly would have prevented an update for happening at such an inopportune time although Microsoft has started ignoring group policy and they can for certain things yeah Group Policy is not as
Ironclad as it used to be if they're like Microsoft if they're like this is important enough of an update they'll just our last clip also from The Fast and Furious universe as Luke calls it  wait he's in a giant motorcade in a city  sure okay they found him those coordinates to's copy that so like if that was a dude that was under surveillance already and they had malware on his phone like the Pegasus malware they absolutely could do that yeah turned the microphone on
surreptitiously like the whole nine also am I going to be the one to point out that they have planes yeah that are just in the air all the time and yet they choose to pursue on the ground in the Fast and the Furious Universe cars are the best thing that exist at all other than family well wait if they've got a New York police escort just radio the New York police would be like stop this is what I've been saying they had to try to track this person down but they have a giant motorcade in
the middle of a huge City wait why do we need to read his license plate this is what I'm this is what I'm saying they definitely know this is happening do these guys work for the Department of redundancy Department if you have this level of control can't you just turn a stop light red yeah want every chip with a zero die exploit in any idiot with a flipper zero who whoa who every chip with a zero day exploit in a certain mile radius I thought why do they need a chip with a zero day exploit they've got
God's eye they should have everything got to use the orange text on the video them all that's like in the Batman movie that made Alfred upset yeah what this hacking they're going to start driving the cars to crash the motorcade oh my God  thing why would they want it to do that how did they want the windshield wipers to go now there's a lot of intelligence services that would be really happy for this level of functionality cuz it's like oh look this problematic person died in a horrible car accident
whoops okay where did those coins come from whoa wo wo W did the coins just come out of the ground what the happened to that parking meter I think those were added in post really also notice how much rust there is on the ones that are real shoot their engines there's people in those C wo wo W did you see the spread what are these bullets hitting that's epic dude oh interesting when you shoot the engine it naturally diverts away massive thanks to Wendell for joining us to critique some scenes from
