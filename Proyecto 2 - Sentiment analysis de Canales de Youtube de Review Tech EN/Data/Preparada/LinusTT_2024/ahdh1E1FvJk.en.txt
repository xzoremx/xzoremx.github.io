welcome to the W show we've got a great show lined up for you guys today Nvidia hit a valuation of $2 trillion yes yes with a pinky trillion also reddit's licensing deal with Google has been this was this was leaked right no they confirmed the leak uh also Reddit is going public what else we got today PlayStation 2 VR is coming to PC five well okay uh Playstation VR2 he's not feeling well today this going to be a rough show and I have no excuse what else we got oh boy um and the CEO says don't buy
hell divers too really yeah you picked that I don't know the CEO of what uh it's not it doesn't say I'm pretty sure the CEO of uh the arrowhead which is the company that made cool that's the context they needed let's roll that intro  oh boy Whoa get out of  here this disaster is brought to you by ag1 vessie and the ridge why don't we jump right into our headline topic and that is nvidia's market cap go stons what the actual am I looking at here this is parabolic surely there must be a limit
to this somewhere but we've yet to see it absolutely incredible so what we're looking at here is Crypt Boom the first Crypt boom thei and AI okay what's a word that's bigger than boom hyper boom I like hyper boom yeah I I don't know turbo boom turbo boom Mondo boom Omega boom it's yeah you I don't mind Omega boom but that it would have to be the last one and I really don't think this is the last we're seeing of interesting uses for nvidia's gpus that are spoiler not gaming Nvidia briefly
hit A2 trillion market cap this morning becoming the third company to do so after apple and Microsoft however axios has argued that nvidia's current Arc is likely to plateau given that most of its biggest customers like Microsoft and Google have reported weak earnings numbers recently in part because their expensive AI features largely aren't making money yet Nvidia might also face increased competition within the AI chip Market as companies like Microsoft continue developing their own chips in
an effort to move away from their dependence on Nvidia who charges as we Gamers already knew and could have warned them about a lot for their technology oh yeah in its most recent annual report Nvidia listed its top competitors as Huawei AMD Amazon Microsoft and broadcom Nvidia has also launched a beta for the Nvidia app okay well this is a completely separate topic we very very different anyway the point is um we're being asked in our discussion question how overhyped is it really and
I would like to preface our response with we are not analysts no Yep this is not Financial we're not we there's no there's no anal in either of us nope not right now oh anyway the point is that we're not analysts and we and this is not Financial advice that should set the tone for how seriously you should be taking any of what I'm about to say um but to be to be truthful with you I think think that Nvidia does have competition coming uh Jim Keller actually just weighed in on Sam alman's
whole thing where he needs like7 trillion dollar to build AI chips or something like that and he's basically like I'll do it in less oh yeah like that Jim Keller like like like K8 AMD Jim Keller and um shoot what was the uh uh what man trying to think oh yeah also Zen Jim Keller like like that Jim Keller like chip architect Jim Keller um so with that said I mean it's clear that competition is coming for them it's clear that additional Fab capacity is coming in the future uh Intel has been talking a lot
about their intention to I mean this is this is great this actually isn't in the dock this week but Pat Ginger said we'd love to build chips for AMD he actually like finally said the thing that I was talking about over the last little bit where I've been like hey this Intel we're going to be a Fab thing is something that I think has been overlooked not Financial advice um also Intel insiders are apparently buying up a bunch of stock right now not Financial advice neither of us are analysts but
what appears is going to be happening tsmc is adding fabrication capacity in Japan in anticipation of China's eventual encroachment on Taiwan um Intel is building up Fab capacity at a pace that to my knowledge is has not been seen before from themed um including in the continental US um we've got intense competition for this enormous Market that is the AI chip Market both from a dedicated chip designers and from the companies that are the ones who are procuring these chips like the Microsoft
of the world um so I do I do think that competition is coming however and this is from someone who would not describe themselves as a  business it's funny because Jensen has actually said very similar things about Intel but I will say this about Nvidia and that is if Nvidia were to for some reason enter Myspace  Facebook that's pretty good you're applauding that that's pretty good I assumed you were going for the Bell anyway uh the point is they are not accompanying was it worthy of the Bell
that I would bet against MH um and so you know if there's a big paradigm shift and traditional gpus you don't make as much sense as some kind of new AI chip architecture um I wouldn't imagine myself um you know savier and cleverer than Nvidia in terms of figuring that out and being somewhat on top of it with that said it's not like there aren't other smart people out there um and what I'm trying to say is the future is extremely murky I do see how there could be some hesitation around uh just
projecting you know infinite growth because that's not how that works and that is a good point that these AI features aren't making money but just because a space isn't making money doesn't mean that there isn't going to be a ton of capital rushing into it and as long as these companies keep buying it doesn't matter now now if they're not making money that could be a sign that they're not going to keep buying but Silicon Valley has often not really cared that much and the
intense competition that you guys are noting for the on the chip side side also exists on the software side yeah and that competition as far as I can tell has not slowed down at all I mean at Google people are sharing internal memes kind of poking fun at how many AI products and how many AI code names Google has for all of the various initiatives that they're running right now something has to power that and that something is NVIDIA for the time being I would love to see man can I just dream for a
second here okay we had that whole thing we talked about this a few weeks ago where uh AMD was like clo and Dagger like like funding um uh like a Cuda translator that could run on AMD gpus and and so you know if I could imagine like an amazing world it would be one where AMD you know instead of Nvidia using gaming to get profitable and build AI stuff you know AMD sells some Ai gpus and then uses that sick AI money to build better gpus that they also sell to Gamers like like they flip
the whole they flip the whole thing upside down and then we get like real competition in the gaming space but I don't think that's going to happen I mean AMD has shown time and time again that they're every bit as much a company as Nvidia is yeah uh well I shouldn't say every bit as much a company as Nvidia is they are a similar similar level of just company to Nvidia um and so they're going to operate in their best corporate interest but hopefully that remains um you know building gpus
for gamers please but realistically I think we could end up waiting for battl mage um to to be a a real threat that's I've been leaning for a while now I I feel like it's going to be Intel eventually I don't necessarily know that it'll be battle mage maybe it'll be I don't think it's going to be battle mage I was dreaming whatever the c one I was dreaming Celestial yeah I I was dreaming I think after that is I want to say Druid Arc Druid is that a thing have they have they announced them that far
ahead uh yeah yeah Druid is still just a rumor but that is uh that is that is understood to be the code name so Alchemist battle mage Celestial Druid and then I don't think we have anything for E evoker yet bet you it'll be evoker evoker really yeah not elf no not battle mage and Drew at are classes Al is sure but is Celestial I guess kind of I mean you could say you could say you could say oh oh enchanter oh that's pretty good or or they could mix it up enchantress yeah is that PC anymore
literally no idea yeah I have no idea you know what let's play this game I know I promised it would be a short show today cuz Luke's not feeling well but let's let's play this game with the uh okay they could cheat for something like f they could go fire Mage or something like that you kind of you could kind of cheat it yeah yeah yeah uh you could go flare um you could go with fighter let's see oh fighter oh man Fighters actually I kind of like fighter 700 would be like a sick name for card
the mo it's the most basic but it's almost just it's almost the strongest sounding okay I'm going with I'm going with we're going to map it out for Intel and if anyone from Intel is watching we and and the community are going to do the rest of the work for you guys and then you just have to stick with our road map Grenadier yeah think like Gunner or Grenadier or something oh gunar why do you keep immediately having something that's way more obvious and way better than mine I don't know if
they would go with Gunner though okay Hellcat o give me something here um Howitzer no that's not really yeah I think sticking away from the guns is likely for Intel yeah that Mak there's a lot of weight on that y and like you know Mage and Celestial hunter hunter that wasn't me that that was that was Philip chat I took that from pH dang it okay okay hold on hold on okay eyes got to be ice something um uh no no it could be I'm see I'm trying to do this on my own you're just reading float plane Chad
that is such a hack all I didn't get the only one I got from there I I said what it was um I I want to kind of cheat and just go with inv ER instead of evoker oh come on uh Illusionist illusion ooh Illusionist is good I'm picturing uh man what what's I'm picturing job from  though uh it makes me think of like very old school RPG Joker jester Joker Javelin like jouster Jou dang it stop   jackass jerk face jack off no almost got him oh my goodness okay  one you know they even used it as a code
name before night's Corner night's Landing that was even freaking a GPU how did I not think of it sort of this one's going to be really  Lancer oh oh oh oh oh lightbringer no okay uh light why not lightbringer well no it's more of a name it's it's less of a lancer's a class if we're sticking with classes I feel like lightbringer could be like a paladin specialization I think lightbringer is fine well yeah it could be but it isn't it could be okay so but there's got to be there's got to
be light something there's got to be like uh um I mean yeah I guess we missed kind of some obvious ones like H could be like holy night or something like that but then we're going to end up with two knights probably okay L uh L uh you could have like lunar something you know lunar Elf or something like that um again that's that's again that's a race not a class um all right I'm I'm just looking I'm just looking at the Luke no they're not it's not going to be luke that'd be so sick light llama why am I
even looking at this you guys aren't even helpful okay I would ask for no royalties at all just name it name it Luke they've already done battle mage so we can't just go straight for mage yeah um murderer no probably not Intel Arc seems extremely un Intel Arc murderer that's more like what would be nvidia's code name for whatever they're going to put up against it mercenary um it might be too like madman something like that oh mercenary it's got to be dang it um oh Marauder Marauder is gooder marer
it's going to be Marauder yeah and uh oh night elf night blade night BL crap  did okay  oppressor I don't know that sounds like it it's kind of sick I just don't think Intel would do it pressor Onslaught uh like over overpower like o man oh man he could have been like Devourer that would have been kind of cool it's a little graphic though it's a little graphic I feel like Intel is going to want to be a little bit more and looking at the artwork that they've had so far it's more like like like
Arcane and like uh like high fantasy it's not like like horror so I think like like devour it's more dumat it's like demonic you know um yeah something like a cult not only is that not a class but yeah I think they wouldn't go that direction any the occultist occultist that's actually not terrible we don't have a ton of option what oh like Omen something Omen Omen Brer like I don't okay I don't know what is what ises chat saying Oracle obiously yeah it's has to be Oracle you guys you guys clear W on
that one yeah Paladin okay yes what for me there you go uh Q it's like queen or like uh uh uh H is this even fun for people I have no idea not a clue uh yeah people seem engaged Quarter Master that's not bad Quarter Master is pretty good that's actually that's solid I kind of like Quarter Master I actually like that a lot there's a lot of like Queen and quilt and you just kind of quiz quilt yeah I think Quarter Master is really solid I would laugh so hard if they made it quilt no
like the quilt fighter just what he's like just puts a blanket over his head he lays down in the corner and just  blanket uh q r r uh ra ravage no that it's pretty swordsman probably not no it's too it's too simple Spell blade Oh okay that's cool uh sorcer you could yeah there's actually so many they're like spell bind come up with almost anything for that there's tons of s um Samurai yes nice that would be pretty sick actually I I think it's got to have to be samurai samurai pretty just with how much kind
of you know magy stuff we've already got I don't want to see like spell spell smoth yeah I like Samurai too t good Taylor it's a popular name really fast oh AR The Arc Taylor it's it's it's your Bard it's just like a it's an get it as fast yeah yeah yeah he he got there it's a little slow today there's like Thief um okay yeah I don't think they'd want that though I don't think they would want Thief no no Thief  uh so they wait yeah Ark was the first one so it could be ar Alchemist Ark
battle mage Arc Celestial oh yeah yeah yeah yeah no no Arc is always part of it okay okay um ooh Tempest I like that I like that Tempest Tempest is pretty good I think that's got to be the one tinkerer is not bad though tinkerer is very good and very different from everything so far y I mean at this point we're talking like the road map is out into about 2040 or so 2045 so we might not even live long enough to see these code names and they've probably like picked a new naming scheme at this point
anyways but who knows maybe this will be the one time that a company actually sees it through Google bailed why did they bail on Android names yeah I liked them it was it was so much more memorable I can't even keep track of the numbers anymore yeah whereas like if you ask me okay what did KitKat look like I'd be like oh yeah like kind of like that yeah yeah honeycomb like oh yeah yeah honeycomb was when we like you know got landscape on tablets and stuff right like it just and it worked better and
stuff like it was more optimized like I remember those things um okay okay what did we leave off what did we leave off I'm not with it enough to even know but okay we're under we're on youu you yeah  Ultra altruist that's not how that spells that's an a thanks I mean I thought it was more B tier but appreciate you wow hey there we go uh my brain went to Undertaker but they would never do that no no no no no Umbra is that like Umbra what is um isn't that just like a soccer brand oh no that's Umbro trust them
unicorn uh yeah I don't think so I mean that'd be cool branding like unicorn Rider or something like that but I just I don't see it it's not really aligned with what we have so far which is your Alchemist battle mage Celestial Druid I just don't I don't see like a prancing unicorn Ser I like that one oh that's not bad it might feel a little late like I I would assume that we're not going to get to usurper if they haven't usurped anything by yeah that's pretty fair I do
like it though Ultima that's pretty sick yeah it's that's a spell though right like that's not it's going to be ultra something Ultra blade or Ultra Ultra something but I don't know exactly what Conrad says Gemini says umist UNT Tamer and urchin yeah it's definitely Umbra is the fully shaded inner region of a shadow cast by an opaque object especially the area on the Earth or Moon experiencing a total phase of an eclipse it is often used in video games to describe like something shadowy
something you should be concerned about there's a sword in morwin called Umbra the umbr list that like uh yeah I don't think that's compels the the wheel there to okay pone Ultra something yeah V that one's kind of unfortunate VI the violence Giver the the the V venge venge something I need to close this the venger uh I first went to vist which is not good ventriloquist the violinist everyone's fighting you're just like I mean they don't have a Bard yet so yeah yeah yeah 
tayor V for the violence rer I am I am stealing this from chat I saw this before I closed the screen but Viper um it's okay it could be like a Rog specialization maybe but it's a little like poison based Rogue or something yeah the the vasectomy Giver just I could see a d andd campaign based around that I will I will  Offspring we we won't win this war this year or next year but give us a generation in Generations from now if only it wasn't a real thing yeah yeah uh okay so V then
um I mean it's for Vendetta obviously right but the the Vendetta okay do you guys have anything Vanguard dang it how did we not think of that y y all right vulture that's not bad either Vanguard I think is it though no it's got to be vulture really yeah it's Vanguard what it's Vanguard for sure Dan settle this uh Vanguard yeah yeah all right TV W okay W uh War warhorse warlord warlord's pretty good I think warlord's cooler than wizard Dan warlock warlock warlock all right we'll just go
with that I think warlock might win yay  X-Man just collab with them like whatever we couldn't think of a name yeah well that was like uh Google did with um nestl or whatever for Kit Kat oh yeah they're like okay we have nothing for K so we're going to we're going to like license the thing we could call it like we'll work with them on it um so it's actually just X-Men I feel like there's got to xenomorph that's something that's that's chat chat gets credit for that one is that a class they
could just call it they could just call it the Warrior Princess Zena um Zena actually sounds pretty cool yeah but I'm pretty sure it would have a similar issue to X-Men yeah yeah you know what let's just go with um yeah xenomorph would have the same problem too that's that's certainly copyrighted or whatever the yeah copyrighted or protected in some way um Zeno Xeno Blade oh no that's a thing crap uh Z Zeno something probably yeah um okay why Yak Rider I kind of like that I can't think
of much um um the yaker right right because we don't have a we don't have like a like a charismatic the yaker the yaker yeah that's a horrible name oh my god um did you just did you just do a takedown of my entire class literally my job it's funny because what I first jumped to was [Laughter] yappy um all right I'm going to chat yeah what do they got YOLO YF dog what wow you guys aren't even trying anymore igdrasil is not like a the Yankee yeah what is a cool word it is a cool word
what what's it what's a Yankee you it like rides into battle there you go the  um yman that's something which is more than what we had you missed Ark what no what uh yeah Yaman is Yaman is decent I say we go with that Yaman it's like a shaman but cooler I guess so I don't think so I forget what they do Yan uh a man holding and cultivating a small landed estate a Freeholder oh yeah I know I I thought you were seeing like  mancer I mean fun attack yeah um okay sure we can't do Yak they can't
do Yakuza that's not yeah that's definitely not going to be a thing no Yeezy collab  Z zapper oh Conrad's got it he might have got it from Gemini I'm not sure but Zealot oh Zealot okay yeah that's going to have to be it okay man what did we do for S sapper wouldn't have been bad there was there was like too many for S oh there was too many for S yeah that's right oh there's so many good ones a million can I can I have sapper sapper is pretty good is Intel going to want to call their thing sapper
I think you I think you could I think you could I think with cool enough branding sapper fits into what we have established so far swash buckler dang there's so many s's fine zookeeper all right let's go into topic number two I don't even remember what topic number one was anymore uh there was a bit of an ending on topic number one which is NVIDIA has also launched a beta for the Nvidia app which finally merges features of GeForce experience and the Nvidia control panel on Windows it offers account-based
Awards but thank goodness finally doesn't require login to use it actually looks super cool they also launched I believe it's in beta right now but they also launched a new feature so the the AI powered SDR to HDR video conversion that they've had available for some time now is now available as a toggle in the new driver um and this is a really well-timed launch from them going hey try our new driver not only is it a new driver and like you know the first time we've updated our look in you know 20 years or
however long it's been since they first launched the Nvidia control panel uh but we've got this very compelling new feature that people might want to try so it's an automatic SDR to HDR converter for games which already exists at least in Windows but is now powered by AI or something I haven't tried it yet uh we are we were working on a video on the video version and then we were going to kind of touch on the hacky way that um some folks found to enable it in games uh but now we're just going to bundle
those two together and we're going to do a video on HDR or SDR to HDR conversion because there's a lot of HDR monitors out there now at this point as if you consider TVs monitors there's a ton of them basically every TV in the last few years over the very very entry level has been HDR capable and in many cases more capable than the entry level HDR monitors so anyone who's gaming on a TV a relatively recent TV is going to be able to take advantage of this in a big way because there's still a significant
shortage of HDR content particularly on the video side like if you go like if you just you know look at look for any movie you enjoy here uh pick a movie you enjoyed as a kid that you think is you know probably not a huge deal you know it's not Lord of the Rings but just some movie you liked he's going to out himself here I just I just it's it's it's white chicks isn't it all right I'll look it up White Chicks you just you cut me off at the pass I was going to say Lord of the Rings Fellowship of
the Ring and then you were like can't be that I was like all right fair enough I've never watched like a ton of movies um original Top Gun okay yeah Top Gun man okay Top Gun probably does have an HDR release uh what was it 1988 uh shut up it's not from 1980 is it 1986 all right uh man I can't believe Tom Cruz has been cool as long as I've been alive mind-blowing yeah uh no top gun did get a 4K Ultra HD Blu-Ray so it it is available uh with in Dolby Vision but my point is that there are a lot of
older movies that are not available in HDR in any release format that's at decent quality there's a lot that do have HDR releases through streaming platforms but if I could watch the Blu-ray with a light Ai upscaling and with a good SDR to HDR conversion I think I'm at the point now where I understand and I accept that that's the best I'm ever going to get and I think I could settle for that cuz HDR 4K Blu-ray is dying o original Tron yeah that probably got the HDR you've
seen that right um oh I haven't wow hey speaking of which have you played any Final Fantasy 6 no oh I wanted to this week but if I wasn't working I was generally sleeping whole week so who would like to see a 4K remaster of original Tron no it appears it has not gotten the treatment apparently neither has RoboCop uh Shawn of the Dead I I doubt Sha of the Dead is getting a whatever I like that movie um what was Sha of the dead shot on would it even shut up it was shot on film with ar
cameras there would be enough dynamic range there and enough resolution for them to do it if anyone was motivated enough to do it and it really is it's a great movie it's so good I I'm not even a huge fan of the zombie movie genre so I'm sure there were references that I didn't get and stuff like that but it was it was absolutely a a blast and I love Simon Peg uh I just think he is one of those people who's naturally hilarious no matter what he's doing it's incredible a Galaxy Quest oh oh so good
speaking actors that I love no matter what they're doing um oh my God why can't I remember his name right now this is so embarrassing uh Alan Rickman jeez oh wow yeah alen Rickman man he's awesome he's fantastic in everything he's awesome have you seen Galaxy Quest yeah oh okay parts of it by grap th oh man he's so good I haven't seen the whole thing but I've seen parts of it you what yeah how can you watch part of a movie like that and not watch the whole thing I just don't really watch 
I guarantee you've seen parts of original Tron you ever watched the whole thing no I've never seen any of it wow really yeah I mean I when would okay we either had it on VHS when I was a kid or I seen we never owned it where would I seen it like Galaxy Quest I never had like access to it then where did you see it how do you see parts of movies SE uh people reference it all the time there's like YouTube things on it stuff like that oh okay yeah all right fair enough look might be a psycho maybe I don't
know I get I like I get too distracted um watching like TVs and shows like if if I TVs and shows oh man um if I'm watching something with that's why you're distracted you got all these TVs how you supposed to pay attention to any of the movies you're watching my my living room just types of loose movie reviews really disjointed story it felt like if they'd had five six more of a movie there there really would have been something maybe it had something to do with the fact that I had half a dozen
movies going at the same time maybe not sure that seems like a movie problem not a me problem uh yeah uh yeah I was I was saying like my my living room is like those old like 90s sets with like just the Tower of CRTs it's like yeah that's how I watch TV uh that's how I watch TVs I guess it's time for us to talk about the big Reddit licensing deal with Google slash Reddit goes public Reddit filed its initial public offering yesterday to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange as
rddt according to the company in addition to offering stock to institutional investors they will also be offering it to its top users including moderators based on Reddit Karma I knew that Karma was going to be worth something someday too bad it's Reddit stock yeah with that said Reddit has some news obviously timed to help boost it during the IPO to share that makes it seem like maybe not just an endless Money Pit forever Reddit confirmed a leak claiming it had struck a Content
licensing deal with a major AI company Google will apparently have direct access to reddit's API for the purpose of training data the deal is rumored to be worth 60 million us annually to Reddit the filing likewise revealed that open aai CEO Sam ultman is the third largest shareholder in Reddit with 8.7% of the shares compared to Reddit CEO Steve Huffman's 3.3% of course he's in there somewhere  um the whole thing where you know you create the value for the site where where the site is free to use because
you're the product yeah there there's your there's your evidence there it is there it is right there everybody knows I don't know do they though I I actually am not no I not convinced of that I I had a family dinner not that long ago and I had a Rel relative ask me well how do you make money on YouTube I was like how do they make money with TV like ads and and and like product placements like what what what are you asking how does anybody make money on anything like I think I think
people just especially older gener people no no fundamentally do not understand that the internet costs money even necessarily yeah like like the the idea that Reddit might need tens of millions of dollars in order to operate is just why it's just page of text right like that can't be that hard right like it might be a lot cheaper if it was just a page of text I suspect it has to do a lot with Reddit video and uh lots of other things they have going on their picture and video hosting I there
was there was sites that cropped up in the early Reddit days I think imager is one of them uh but I I'm pretty sure there was other ones as well where their whole thing was that they were a host for video and pictures that went on Reddit uh and then I think Reddit saw that and was like oh we want to move this in-house but that just costs insane amounts of money so there's a couple of discussion questions here one is how will going public change Reddit I mean I don't think at all compared to how
they've been behaving recently since everything they've done over the last couple of years has been in the leadup to going public and trying to juice the value as much as humanly possible um I guess what what I want to know is how how do yeah no I guess I don't really want to know anything oh right yes I remember what I want to know I want to know if you would invest in Reddit no well hold on a second though would you have said the same thing when  IPO when did they go IPO oh man it was
like 10 12 years ago then probably hold on hold on hold on hold on Facebook IPO versus today hold on so Facebook has been uh I think a five a five Banger for people who invested hold on IPO price of $38 at today's price oh whoa whoa whoa whoa today's price of around 191 per share this article is from 2019 okay where is the stupid how much are the worth today uh so they went IPO at apparently $38 on the first trading day and then uh Facebook stock price so what are we at now 484 okay so it's more than a 10
Banger begger bger that's the word so it's like a 13 beggar or something like that you 13 extra money over uh what was it let's see when did they go IP that was 2012 so about 12 years ago man I'm good okay Facebook was the king of the internet back then they were but it wasn't clear what their model for actually monetizing any of it was going to be yeah but that never mattered okay all right but you don't see a path to Reddit becoming a bigger player in the advertising space or the AI space the
advertising space no as far as my understanding goes advertising on Reddit uh is horrible and has always been horrible what about the microtransaction space I don't think so I don't think anyone really cares um they even like killed Awards didn't they I'm not sure I don't know I think so some other new way to do it yeah I don't know maybe there's some other new way to do it but I think they removed the original way that you could like Guild post and stuff like that um they might have replaced it I
might be wrong I don't know don't take that as anything um their only real value I can think of is selling their data um which they're getting 60 million for it um from one company I don't know if that's exclusive I to assume Really I sincerely doubt that that's exclusive I mean why would Sam Alman who owns what was it like 6 point something per of the company 8.7 um yeah why why would he be like you know what would be cool not having this data not having this data I'm not going to Advocate against this
like and if they took even if they took half as much for access from Google well then they could sell it Google Microsoft would open AI just have not necessarily they could say no you have to buy two licenses one for Microsoft one for open Ai and then I mean who the knows like maybe yahoo still wants it cuz they want to be relevant again or something moft again you could oh that's right you could definitely the point is you could definitely turn around and sell it multiple times selling it to
Microsoft like six times yeah and you know you're a public company so you're just going to do whatever is best for you ethics be damned so you're probably going to sell it to you know like a um  crap it's escaping me the one that like Alibaba you're probably going to sell it to um you know by do uh no no I I absolutely I absolutely think that they can scale up selling their data um maybe they'll have some pretty good use but there's a lot of the laws around that right now are kind of weird and the
concern for me is that that might already be priced in yeah but I don't know that for sure how much how much are they losing per year right now uh that I don't know I can tell you that they've been really pushy lately about us advertising on them I don't think they really know who we are like oh hold on one sec um like I I we don't advertise yeah lus Tech tips on Reddit well we we I guess that might go to the wrong inbox but we do advertise like certain CTO Warehouse things no went to my inbox and they're
like yeah lineus Tech tips is really cool uh brands have seen success in our program we thought lineus Tech tips could be a good fit heck yeah dude uh you're missing out on an incremental engaged audience um yeah I um I guess that's neat but like we don't I mean do you want do you want to advertise with us really who know reverse yeah yeah we can we can sell your data um I don't know how to read this I'm I'm I'm getting like headlines but I'm not getting a lot of uh apparently they saw 21% Revenue
growth uh but $90 million in losses nice sick nice I mean you know for for Silicon Valley that's pretty good right that's pretty good yeah yeah yeah um I don't know I would be I I would have been pretty what is is bullish the right term on Facebook yeah when it went IPO I remember when that happened and I remember being like don't have any money don't have any money would have been sick though um I don't feel the same way this time around um I remember before Halo 1 came
out I I like begged my grandpa to invest in Bungie without knowing that that wasn't like a thing you could do um but I was like this game's going to go bangers I like I know it um I remember years later being like oh man I wish he like did that he'd be like so wealthy now and then I looked into it and I was like yeah it's not a thing you can do like okay cool oh man oh Luke anyways uh all right I think it's time for us to do a couple merch messages and explain what they are
they're the best way to interact with the show because instead of just throwing money at the screen like you might do with other streamers you get to throw money at the screen and also get great merchandise in your mailbox we've got a couple of big announcements for the store this week first we have a backpack discount update we have extended the expiry on our dual layer uh discount for backpack buyers prior to December 9th to make sure that they can use it towards magnetic Cable Management
if they choose to I had someone ask me about this they were like hey am I going to be able to use my credit for magnetic cable management and I was like yeah and then the launch was delayed and now we're like yeah still yeah still yeah but it's going to be a little bit so uh the expiry date has been moved to March 15th which should give you some idea of when magnetic cable management is hopefully coming uh we also have a backpack Carabiner update Source Reddit this is hilarious they are in people's hands
check it out this is it this is the real deal this is the kit that you will get with all your replacement bits and Bobs you get the tool for prying open the original uh pull holders you get a set of regular pulls from YKK so this is just in case you've had enough Carabiner in your life and you just don't want any more of it you get a full set of replacement Carabiner pulls these are in titanium alloy of some sort they're super awesome uh they don't have any hinges on them
they just uh We've shown them on the show before but they basically just have these like Cuts in either side so they're really bendy at the right spot and they work like a carabiner would and you get the custom designed uh from the Creator Warehouse team a zipper closer uh tool that is I think did we end up injection molding this I don't remember it's either 3D printed or injection molded but it's plastic and you basically turn the thing in order to close it shut I believe tinan hosted the
video that you will scan this QR code to view and it shows you exactly how to replace them all the whole process should take less than like 10 minutes to get all the old ones off and all the new ones on now this is really important I cannot stress this enough you are to use either these or these one time just one time don't swap back and forth these are not for you know oh you know I'm really in a carabiner mood today and or no you know what I'm really feeling the more basic pull
look one time if you open them and close them and open them and close them and replace the poles more than you have to it will cause the metal to fatigue and it will cause it to break so one time um don't tell me what to do I'm telling you what we cover so that's what I'm telling you trust me bro do it one time uh the last thing for us to shout out this week for the store is that we have stock of the legendary Honeywell PTM 7950 thermal pads these are sweet uh they really are this has been a long
time coming as it turns out um Honeywell not a super easy company for randoms like me to get in touch with with and we were but we were able to get in touch with someone who was a viewer slan and had a contact at a distributor for Honeywell and was able to get us access to their PTM 7950 which we actually reviewed here we go Reddit told me to buy this man the whole show is like Reddit themed today it it it about a year and a half ago long story short it's really cool you put it in the
fridge which solidifies it you cut it in the shape that you want you peel the the the backings off of it you put it well you peel one side you put it onto whatever it is you're trying to cool CPU GPU or whatever the case may be you peel the other plastic off of it and then what happens is once you mount your heat sink or your well yeah heat sink or water block or whatever it is and it warms up it changes phases allowing you to have a perfect Mount every time there's no inconsistency like you might
encounter sometimes with thermal paste so yeah super cool and you can buy this stuff in other places it's absolutely a thing but in most cases that we've seen it is either extremely expensive or it comes from sources where you have no guarantee whatsoever that the sheet of gray shmoo that you're buying is actually PTM 7950 because Honeywell doesn't engage with little ply you know computer sellers they're they're not interested if you're not if you're not a government entity they're
basically not picking up the phone and that's that's not a fair characterization entirely but the point is that they're only really interested in very big fish now it is still not cheap you can see here a 6 cm or yeah 6 cm x 6 cm pad is $4.99 but we also offer a 200 mil by 160 mil for wait where' the price go ah yes for $69.99 so that would give you a lot of uses uh let's see if we can oh no do we not oh please tell me we have pictures for scale okay here's the two for scale
oh no do we do we have do we have any of them next to CPU okay well whatever 6 cm is pretty big and 20 okay so that's 27 so okay so here for my American friends that's about uh 2/3 you like fractions right 2/3 of a 12in ruler is is by about half of a 12in ruler there you go so that's that's pretty big that's quite a few applications uh is it reusable no it changes phases so it it is definitely something you would want to clean off after you're done anyway really cool product really
good performance not like your grandma's  pad what nothing anyway merch messages all you got to do is go to LTD store.com and in the cart there will be a little box whenever we're live you can fill out a merch message and it'll go to producer Dan who will reply to your message forward it to the appropriate person or curate it for me and Luke to address on the show so Dan why don't you go ahead and hit us with a couple of merch messages sure can do hi lld Luke how does having Birds limit your life what
do you do when you go on holiday is it more difficult than having a cat love of all animals yeah it can be kind of annoying um birds are super fragile so there's a lot of things like in the air um like if someone cooks with um like non-stick pans and stuff it can it can put things in the air that can kill the the birds there's other different cleaners and things they might use around their house and whatnot that can be really bad for the birds it's a lot of stuff that would be in the air um
there's even like air fresheners in your car so having someone else drive them around can even be a problem um so when a full play chat I said how to friend's bird die from resin 3D printer fumes yeah not surprised not surprised at all  uh Aven vet Aven vet Aven vet is that what it's called I think so sure um and they do boarding so when we go away we can leave them at hopefully not with  that's for fish yeah there you go yeah come on down to Luke's waterboarding leave your fish with us
we'll make sure they get the finest care was so concerning so many red flag um yeah you can leave them at the vet which uh is also nice because then you can get checkups and other stuff done while you're gone so yeah yeah other one I got here hi W.D with new AI processing and editing features in smartphone cameras what is a picture anymore how much processing is too much where's the line I mean this is kind of an older controversy now but uh check out I was about to clear it yeah
uh it's a space station it's not a moon the point is look sorry I'm layering up the Star Wars references here PR that's  yeah man I was trying really hard for this one I'm a little Ray of of Star Wars Sunshine yeah I wow yeah I don't think that one landed very well no it really didn't just like the movies yeah  um oh my goodness anyway yes the Samsung moon photos where people were taking pictures of the Moon through their Samsung telephoto you know magnified AI Zoom nonsense and didn't realize how
how trained the model was to basically take their picture and use it as kind of a hint for a much more detailed scan of or or picture of the Moon that it was just kind of plunking into people's pictures wow gee look how perfect the Moon looks in everyone's pictures on  phones what even is a picture anymore what even his truth anymore how about this what was a picture ever what if your picture from you know 1951 was edited anyway that wasn't in color and was grainy as heck and had you
know contrast and Clarity issues like okay uh one of the one of the big problems with earlier cameras was the way that they handled darker skin tones because they were designed by whites for whites um I didn't know about this makes sense yeah no it's like it's like a whole thing it's like it's anyway modern camera technology and lighting technology has caught up a lot to the point where you can what oh you are bleeding when did that even happen um please don't get blood on the table really Dan I'll get some
towels to clean it off um okay is it new does it look new yeah it looks new what it's new blood um well I'm fine I'll just try to not bleed on things that's the Twilight reboot nice yeah very good any very good the point is sure a really paper towel I mean you're getting him the form right we should make him fill out the form on show you Ser yes if you cut yourself at work you have to fill out the form maybe it wasn't at work I just told you it looks fresh they witnessed it how did that
even happen do you know how much they witnessed you enough that you have to spray your mouth full of silver spray pain all these all these references look it's been a long week okay what's happening it's not it's not even I don't think it's fresh oh man oh man this is great never injure yourself live on the internet because you are going to have you're going to immediately turn into a hypochondriac because you're going to "have literally 10,000 people looking up" all the horrible awful things that could
cause a spontaneous skin lesion or that could infect your blood they're going to have to they're going to have to cut it off above the elbow Loop yeah it's over my whole career oh my goodness you guys could be a tick could be could be lupus could be a oh man might as well just amputate it now we don't even have time to get speed workplace safety form any% let's go oh my goodness it was a pre-existing condition he scratched a scab ELO did you have a scab there I don't think so
all right well I mean how big like I can't even really see it it's either that or uh hold on what's it's not very big what's this other good one I can't feel it either I feel like this happened some other time oh no tinan no look away oh no oh yeah tian's not going to let you get away with it safety man is here sudden sudden death syndrome he's not an infant okay it's not like I don't I don't believe you that it's new I can tell from the color look at the color of those pix dry it's I mean yeah is and
there's no blood here here give me that it's not dry there's literally blood spots on here what are you even talking about like little Flex I think that's dried blood that got off it's not you can tell from the color luk I tried to pull it off yeah what you think I'm a idiot like you've known me a long time I'm still going to try it's just about to scratch it's mely a flesh wound I mean it is a flesh wound sure give you that but it's it wasn't a pimple it's like a big spy it's not a
dry one stop showing everyone your blood gross I'm trying to see it myself goodness Luke fills out the form live on the air let's go Dan well you have to give it to yeah Luke has to fill out the for technically that's proprietary information it is not it's protected medical information and you've told everybody on the internet that he's had a medical incident and now he can uh I think technically I told everyone oh yeah oh good okay yes Luke Luke you can only Sue yourself the
company lives another day I'm going to do it I'm not a member of the Safety Committee so I actually can't fill this out but we have an A upstairs if you need it yes that is I was going to bring it for comedy but I figured that was probably actually kind of irresponsible don't do that yeah exactly it's like playing with fire extinguishers at work which we have never done allegedly I actually don't think we have I don't think so I was trying to think back in the old house I was like that seems very
possible back then I don't think we have but I don't think we did y yeah um I brought you a Band-Aid though do you want a Band-Aid sure just so I don't get blood on anything okay so don't I still don't feel it back to our conversation about cameras so my question is yeah is that photo that you took in 1951 real or are there all kinds of approximations and flaws in that representation that we only accept  them I I think by that logic yeah no no Recreation of anything ever could be real um but I do think that
intentionally changing something we intentionally change things all the time what's a color filter I mean yeah I I include that oh okay so then fine go ahead but is that so is that changing something through editing cuz the question is what is a picture anymore I guess my counter question is what was a picture ever if you've been on Instagram what has a picture been this whole time because people are you know you can see people that are trying to yeah shrink their waist or or make
their arms look big or whatever and you'll see y oh I meant peex I meant PEX both to be honest um and you'll see like the background behind them like warp because they've like expanded or or or uh contracted something oh my goodness   wait oh my gosh this was all planned oh no way really is this what I think it is are you allowed to show this off i' have it better yeah are you allowed to show it off I don't know I'll go to CW and help you leak it tinan is he allowed I 
know dang it I don't have it I can go to CW and their lives for it's okay A that sucks wait is is tyan Ashley saying that okay uh no no he's not I I I wanted to wanted to leak the fail pen which I think we've actually talked about before but we've talked about it yeah we do we do have a can't see can you put it on I can't see God this is sad what was that that that was you not letting go when you try to hand me  go it feels better now oh my goodness it's cuz I'm a father 
okay all right I'll do this right oh calm down you guys I kissed the Band-Aid I I don't care either way um and he knew that um this is going to end up on the subreddit before the night is out yeah oh yeah yep yep and it's going to it's going to explode it's going to break the  wait what are we supposed to be talking about right now right are they pictures right are you no you're just filling out forms okay well I am no I I I think yeah I think um some camera nerds going to come back
at me with like certain cameras are going to naturally look different in a certain way compar to other ones I think I think if you go in or even framing even the way you frame a picture can change the context dramatically intensely yeah yeah yeah I think we're getting to a new man there's a movie reference here but I don't remember the exact naming but we're we're getting to like new ground here UNT tread paths where where having things that aren't even like we're not even necessarily tuning these
dials like with the Samsung thing it's just doing that automatically it's changing the picture um that's uncharted waters there we go um strange new worlds yeah there's there's a lot of different references this could be but I I I do think this is new and different and in a way scary because I think it's kind of less obvious um I think there's a lot of ways like what we were talking about with the like bent backgrounds and stuff there's quite a few ways that you could tell if
something was edited in the past this is going to be going to be harder a lot harder y time of injury uh I mean we could check the time stamp I bet someone knows PM I have no idea how specific does it have to be uh just yeah if I mean very accurate yes I filled out a form for my injury the other day uh during the shoot um my my cut was 2 mm long I believe I caught a hang nail on my pants and you really is that what it was I think so yeah cuz you were standing next to a recently metal framed thing I just
assumed you touched a sharp object or something no no it was definitely uh pants ripping my fingers open that was a fun shoot though maybe we should talk about that a little bit uh Let's do let's do our oh oh no yeah we've got topics okay we get to do topics so Luke wasn't there I kind of feel bad for not inviting you to what you probably would have wanted to come the full projector wall thing the the world's largest  song which one Frank's 2000 inch TV I don't think so hold on sounds awesome
does it have a music video I actually I actually don't know if this has a music video uh it would appear that it does not uh but it's it's a weird l song from I want to say the late 90s or something  that um anyway the point is that he sings this song about you know kind of poking fun at keeping up with the Joneses and and flaunting your wealth through fancy electronics and it's sort of this this guy who buys this endgame TV that can only be delivered through ju just utterly decadent means and you know but
you know thank God I can watch The Simpsons from 30 blocks away know anyway so it's it's it's it's really funny because it's weird all and he's always funny um so is what you're trying to say is that those pictures of that were edited no oh what I'm trying to say is that that dis display was "2,70" in we did it we made Frank's 2000 in TV that's pretty fantastic yeah it ended up being I I forget the exact number so don't quote me on this just wait to watch the video if you want to know the
exact numbers but it was something like 170 ft wide yeah yeah that makes sense but like wow by like 30 something feet tall absolutely enormous and oh okay right Dan was there yeah um Dan I'm going to say something that's going to sound controversial and then there's no pressure to agree with me but I would love to hear your take one of the games that we played on it was flight simulator and I felt that it was  VR the depends on the well okay so I was I was playing Microsoft flight simulator
uh so I can't remember if I even watched anybody do it I'm not sure I would uh I would say no in my opinion um certainly not playing it I felt very claustrophobic in the cockpit it seemed uh it wasn't kind of far back enough maybe if we had tweaked the settings and it would be a little bit better um looking around wasn't really possible in the you know maybe if I turned my head something like that that's a really wide flat display I would say it's a different it's a different kind of immersive to VR VR is
like you're sitting there and this was kind of like the next best thing this is everywhere it was kind of more like it it wasn't as as presence and as real as being in VR oops so I played some of the other games but I didn't actually play Flight Sim I watched Dan play Flight Sim so I was um like I was the passenger of the plane and maybe the fact that I didn't have to be focused on the middle you can look around and I could like really look around out over what feel like life-size Vistas but
because the display was so large that it occupied almost my entire field of view even moving my head around a little bit the sense of scale was incredible I got that a lot too and and I wasn't I wasn't looking through a periscope you know and modern VR headsets have reached a point where the where the field of view is pretty good that's right yeah but it wasn't even close but it isn't even close to to that experience of having genuine vastness you actually get the full fov of your
eyes and there's no headset and like you're you're there I think I kind of got that feeling the same sort of feeling of being the passenger and just kind of looking but I'm focused Dead Ahead my entire field of view is just you know langly and that's a thing right is that when I'm playing a game in VR this doesn't bother me because I'm focused on this and if I want to see something else I'll do what I would do in real life because we can only achieve our our maximum resolution over what is
it like a 4% of the area we can see only within like a certain area like it's not it's not actually out here that you would so you would turn your head anyway so that's really natural but if I was if I was an observer through that tunnel I wouldn't like it whereas being an observer on the giant wall oh there's there's like more proper terms for this I don't think this is the right term but suspension of disbelief I think is also hurt by something strapped onto your head like you're always going to be at
least somewhat aware like yeah you might be convinced that the plank you're you're not convinced but your brain might be freaking out because you're walking on a plank above a highrise and your brain's like I don't want to fall even though you know you're in VR but you have this thing strapped to your face there's there's a lot of cues to kind of remind you that it's it's not what's actually happening thinking back there was a number of moments where I don't know everything
just kind of fell away CU you're looking at a monitor but you're you're focused quite close to you and you don't have a headset so you don't have any of the perception of things touching you or that you're wearing a headset that's kind of harder to forget but when you're in front of basically just this window that goes into the sky um I think that that kind of dissociation happens a hell of a lot faster than with anything I've felt before I did not feel like I was looking at a wall it didn't look like a
monitor it it looked like I was flying a a window into um into something else and the sense of of motion that I got was so much more convincing than at least any other flat display that I have ever experienced just because of the sheer vastness of it um it was a really cool setup we we actually ended up shooting two videos that day instead of just one we shot one that's like a land Center SL Badminton Center update um because people had I had to approve Dan's time for this oh okay yeah people had to um
people had more questions uh that they raised than they felt were answered by the first video so we ended up talking actually I don't think I've really addressed anyone's questions from the first video but the point is there's cool stuff uh and and we and we talk about it Dan goes through some of the networking stuff our armored fiber is on site ready for installation so we do a little uh we do a little autopsy on the fiber that we're going to be rolling out and stuff like that it's a really cool
video and then at the end of it uh Chase shows off kind of what we have planned for a big projector gaming console corner and we grab the 120in screen from my that used to be in my basement and we put that up and then we go yeah but it's dark enough in here we could go bigger and we kind of just throw as big of an image as we conceivably can with the projector that I had in my basement at the wall until we realize okay yeah you can only go so big no matter how dark it is before it starts
to look washed out and and Garbo right then we go from 2700 lumens to working with an AV company that specializes in these kinds of deployments to a multi-projector "12,000 Lumen setup" and yeah there's there's there's no way to there's there's nothing I can say other than it's unlike anything I've ever experienced I kind of did want to see it but I'm sorry um can you imagine that at 240 HZ I know it was only at 60 "HDR 4K 240 HZ 2,000 in W I guess what" you're saying is you want to redo it
yeah do it better yeah bigger building no I no that that's that's going to be a no um thank you for the suggestion though Dan appreciate you you could use it for the new town There's not going to be a new town yeah none of these people know what you're talking about it's on the pre-show oh that makes it better no inside jokes are not good all right Dan do you want to hit us with one more uh wrong button yep sure I got one more let's see uh evening dll what happens if the CPUs
bended for the labs test benches fail do you restart the process are there any spares are they expected to be obsolete or replaced before they fail I really hope they don't um but as part of our process we're going to be retesting anyway and with new Aisa updates bios updates uh driver updates the the ones that we're using may change anyway so it's something we're going to have to go through regardless of whether one of them dies or whether one of them doesn't so it's just I think it's just uh oh my
gosh I'm an idiot what remember I was all concerned about showing people the scale of the thermal pads I have them yeah yeah I didn't think of that they're right here oh I didn't realize this was a thing that happened probably cuz I'm pretty out of it but yeah cool yeah any anyway so the big ones I mean you're you're supposed to cut kind of both of them but one of these is like this is you're you're installing a CPU you installing one CPU one one giant CPU or four smaller ones oh yeah you you
could do four smaller ones totally like I could do I could easily do uh four ryzen 7000s with this but unquestionably you'll be able to get one install for a CPU from that pretty much regardless of size yes I can't think of one that wouldn't work uh I think some of the big epics you'd probably cover all the dies but I just wouldn't you just you just spent "$900 you know $22,000 on a CPU just get" a proper thermal pad for it uh so that's what the big mama is for that's a big
thermal pad so that's a lot of CPU installations you cut that to whatever you want yeah yeah and Sarah designed really nice packaging for it and everything yeah so pretty excited about that very professional showed up to work showed up to cool your CPU for you or whatever else thanks Luke you're doing great today yeah I'm going to crush him at Super checks tonight if I even make it he beat me last week I'm so upset got him he's I'm so upset he was sick it that last game I'm still unhappy I think I was
less sick than funny enough but yeah well good you're going down this week I out him two to one I'm also I'm also grievously wounded I outshot him two to one and he outscored me 32 got him so unhappy goalie standing on his head anyway the point is uh let jump into our next topic dude I've had some insane manual blocks insane yes I know I was there you  know you know you didn't get a lot more goals on me um um all right what we we talking about now I also got a lot less shots
though uh Troy Hunt is having an issue with his Sono setup oh I feel like I'm going to regret going down this rabbit hole before even asking but here goes we have eight Sonos devices three wired the rest Wireless we have massive Wi-Fi coverage with ubiquity mesh gear but are now having major problems playing audio to multiple rooms with constant dropouts regular unable to Connected device errors units appearing off line and so on firw up to- date everywhere power cycles and network
reboots but the problems persist I'm guessing it's somehow Network related but I don't even know where to begin on this one ideas I have two ideas idea number one is if you have the 2.4 GHz radios enabled on all of your ubiquity units go through and strategically disable a bunch of them I actually ran into this recently with my setup where I had everything on default I had all the 2.4 GHz radios on and I had them all set to to automatic channel selection and on recent fmer this was very recent they
were all selecting channel one for some reason and with all of them I have something like eight access points in my house or something like that with all of them on channel one even just the regular pinging of hey are you there was annihilating the available um like the available band uh not bandwidth but just the available Spectrum yeah like just utilization was capped and so I was having dropouts not with my Sonos devices necessarily but with some devices kind of everything and I was
getting music cutting out however I went through and um Jake actually recommended this picked one per floor to go to 2.4 GHz and then disabled 2.4 on all the rest of them uh that resolved the dropouts I was getting from other devices but I was still getting cutouts from my Sonos units and Ivon made the suggestion that um you know or not suggestion but she asked a question because she's been married to me for a thousand years and listens and you know she just tries to participate
and it's delightful um she's not into Tech but she knows a lot is what I'm trying to say and she kind of goes oh well you know could it be a wireless issue and I go no it doesn't make any sense they're all wired all of my Sonos units except one are wired and then I went into the app and I found that are they all working wirelessly anyways even though they are all plugged in there's a setting in the app to disable Wireless on them now I don't know for sure that they were
working wirelessly but what I will say is after I painstakingly went through and disabled wireless on all of them which is a horrible experience by the way Sonos if you're watching because everything because you can't do it wholesale because as part of the process you have to navigate through like two or three different submenus to even get to that button for that one and number three it has to go through a process where it determines if it has a wired connection before it will allow you to
disable the wireless connection which I understand but what I don't understand is why it takes like 30 seconds for it to determine that and can I just go on a side rant here why the everloving does it take so long for a device to tell you if it has a internet connection if it has one or not yes it drives me bat crap crazy whether it's a game console or a TV where it does that or man remember the Wii yeah how long it would take to know if it had a internet connection how many
milliseconds does it take to ping something do you have an intercon connection yes or no yeah I wonder if like I wonder what exactly they're doing I'm sure I'm sure they're probably doing more than that obviously yeah what is it I'm not sure and I feel like that there has to be some convoluted phone home thing instead of just like Ping Google or something some of the newer ones do a speed test and they will report the result of that got it and and that makes sense you cannot determine how fast a
connection is without transferring some amount of data over some period of time longer than probably the you know 9 milliseconds it would take to do we want to tell the user that there is an internet connection if we don't know it's stable yet but a lot of them don't appear to be doing that and just yeah I'm not sure just take a long time there's there's a there's a lot of stuff like that that I just I got to tell you guys I just don't really understand um with how many millions of
cycles per second a modern processor runs that why does it still take just about exactly as long to plug in an ethernet  connected well I still I still feel like it's probably because it's doing external things well no because no no I'm not even talking about that right now I'm talking like when you plug in an ethernet cable plug in an ethernet cable yeah okay it it has to negotiate the link speed sure but how long does that take so you're talking even even just your local network yeah so even just
detecting that it's plugged in at all when you just plug in a cable I haven't had this problem until uh actually my my work desktop my work desktop's a huge pain sometimes it just will not accept an ethernet connection I have to restart the whole computer and then it works you know what you might want to do is manually set your uh speed and duplex um I I've found that the 2 and 1 half gig in uh in that office is a little bit sketchy and if I depending on your chipset if you set it to gigabit then it'll
just work every time um so okay I'm answering my own question I do know some of why it takes longer um if for example there's some packet lost then it will it will take a while to figure out okay what is the appropriate link speed for this connection but there are a lot of things in the tech world that are operating at you know millions of cycles per second that seemingly should be instantaneous but take a very very long time sometimes even things are happening locally extreme low
priority yeah I guess even if the CPU is running way faster it might not be allowed to use any more than it used to use in the past but really though like if I could just have it happen instantly I mean that would be that would be great yeah but then if they if they did that every time you plug in a cable in your computer just like then they're going to get a bunch of complaints about it I'm sorry but I'm not convinced it would yeah that's probably fair I'm not convinced like even plugging in like a
plugging in like a USB drive why is that not instantaneous I feel like it is for me it's not instantaneous it's pretty fast it's reasonable it's pretty fast I'm not convinced it's any faster than it was 10 years ago though yeah our computers are a lot faster than they were 10 years ago it's it's kind of like how you you'll play an old game and the loading times still suck you're like what was the bottleneck here cuz my CPU is four times  faster it could be such a huge range of
things it could be it could be timeouts it could be uh the amount of things that old games based off of your system clock um it could be it could be a yeah that one triggers me so hard I again again again I do know some of the reasons for this it just bothers me probably more than it should there could be things where like it needs to do a thing and then make sure that that thing is functioning for a set amount of time that's what I mean by yep timeouts so like the timeouts might even be uh well
intentioned but yeah um anyway in response to Troy I would take the three wired ones so first I would do the 2.4 GHz thing then I would take the three wired ones and I would go into your Sonos app and manually disable Wireless on them so that you know for sure that they are actually using the wire and then that will that will hopefully mean you will have fewer devices fighting for airtime anyway are you just hoping he watches as part of the show I guess I mean I you like tweeting it at him or I'll tweet it
at him there you go are you doing that now well what is that  you sure yeah lus still hasn't realized Troy already solved the problem in the next tweet oh  oh all right well let's see what the solution was um I was unaware of Sonos net so on a hunch I pulled the power on the three Wireless units and power cycled all the others they running perfectly now okay so I don't know exactly oh wait the plan now is to join the three remaining units directly to Wi-Fi and cancel out sonosnet altoe so much for
the wired connections always being the most reliable path interesting all right very  Troy cool anyway I would have been curious to know if the other thing would have worked I actually do not have issues with my wired Sonos devices though other than when it turns out they are oh by the way did I say that it worked perfectly now for me no but I think I assumed it was implied yeah anyway the show is brought to you by ag1 Luke is gone yeah we're back on YouTube now all right wonderful uh just

um 1943 German Soldier the fck am I looking at here uh okay Luke do you want to walk us through this one cuz there's a lot to unpack I think I'll just read the the thing and then I'll start unpacking after that Google has tempor removed the image generation feature from its Gemini chatbot following a widely reported problem where it would refuse to generate images of white people or Latinos and would insert the keyword diverse into unrelated prompts in at least one case this resulted in
generating images of a group of multi-racial 1943 German soldiers as we just showed you according to Google this was caused by a miscalibrated mechanism meant to counteract other another well-known issue with early image generation models namely that they would overweigh the most common stereotypical images in their databases leading to a generator that would only produce men when asked for a scientist or would produce a white doctor uh even when explicitly asked for a black doctor
Google has apologized for the overcorrection Google likewise appears to have a moderation system based on spelling brilliant uh meaning that it is easily bypassed by intentional mistyping of a forbidden word discussion question is there a correct amount of stereotyping that an AI should use shouldn't Google be able to find a less dumb way of fixing these issues I think the issue specifically um if you want to ask me is not that it uh if it was like more likely to do a certain thing
but would do a range of things I think that's fine um um yeah except that a lot of these prompts because generating more than one image is uh very expensive a lot of these prompts that I've used in the past only spit out one at a time anyway I believe Gemini tends to do four sure but okay if we're talking about Gemini specifically then I see I see your solution being okay you could have three that just use the images that it's trained on and then one that's kind of a like shot in the dark uh whereas for of
the ones that only spit out one image if it gave me I mean well really especially top right and bottom left if it gave me either of those I mean this may also well maybe he's the soldier I don't know I mean she's wearing the uniform right yep I mean well this this this is just this is just a lot to unpack in general it's also like an americanish looking Soldier yeah like down she seems to be helping yeah so her her uh storage pack that's on her back hip I think is upside down I like
her hair it's kind of sick it's just not here but it is here and it's here yeah but not here yeah  think I think forcing terms ends up being a problem because it over corrects as we have just seen but on the other hand you can't just generate men when you search for Doctor totally but if you search specifically for um yeah yeah so like the the unaltered one is also too far though because again um internal hair routing ducting in the uniform they would they would they would over she pulled a Mulan
cuz women weren't allowed to serve in Germany then anyway yeah yeah perfect um they would overweigh the most common stereotypical images in the databases leading to a generator that would produce men uh when asked for science or this is the key point in my opinion would produce a white doctor even when explicitly asked for a black doctor so the original way it was going was also wrong yes cuz you're not even getting specifically what you asked for out of it so they needed to correct off of that
because the original version is just bad um but this is just too far um I think think I think uh if you weren't already thinking this I think this is quite a slap in the face for the observation that this this is a very in-your-face obvious version of this but all of these systems are going to be tuned to something whatever company's version of this that you're using is going to be tuning it to serve you certain types of things and you need to understand that your worldview or your exposure whatever
else is going to be and just wait painted until they're tuning it specifically for you yeah so they'll they'll they'll creep your Facebook and be like oh well you are you're super I'm going to pick a no I'm not going to pick anything controversial I will pick uh mops you really into mops you are you are pro mop Enthusiast you are pro the mops that were already there or you are pro the brooms that came later you know whatever whatever it is and so when you search for uh you know a patriotic
Soldier it's going to show you mop soldiers or whatever else whereas if you you know if you are more on the side of the brooms then it's going to show you broom soldiers you know right so if I searched Soldier for example maybe it would give me a Canadian Soldier exactly because it has the context that I'm maybe in Canada or maybe it knows that I'm a Canadian citizen or something like that and remember with how much they know about you it might give you a Canadian Soul it might give you a
Canadian sniper yeah cuz you'd be more into Marksmanship than than necessarily you know uh being a tanks tank tank uh yeah operator Gunner whatever there's a range of roles in there but yeah sure uh but but part of a member of a tank crew like I I would guess it might be and and it it it depends on what the uh what's driving a tanky very nice danan um it depends on on what's driving the value for this thing so a conversation that we were talking about earlier where you're the product it's like okay so
what are you serving me are there product placements is it going to give you a Canadian Soldier using a particular rifle with a particular scope on it yeah is it going to try to push me into you know uh recruitment for the military somehow um is it is it is it only going to show soldiers that like look very you know successful in clean cut is it going to show soldiers that look like you maybe so you can see yourself in that more easily like there's there's lots of ways that these
things can be tuned we are so close to dystopia that like we're basically here yeah yeah so like this is this is something that uh just just because this one was super obvious if this goes away the the root problem is very much here just because it it might not be spitting out images of um and they can hide it they can hide that root problem by doing what we're talking about by tuning it to output something that you expect and these inputs are things that you will give them you are going to give
them willingly helping them build their profile for you because it will make the tools work better and we like these tools and they're convenient so it'll spit out nine images for you and it'll say which one do you think was the best one it remember which one the Aran one and it'll be like all right good to know and you'll get more of that you need to start self analyzing with some of the results you start getting you just type in Soldier and it just gives you a 1943 German Soldier and you're like
oh oh who's wearing a jersey that says laugher on the back oh no what's happening a sounds like Google me yeah uh absolutely exactly but I think don't forget about meta even more like Amazon more easy for them to be nefarious with and the US Army and other armies yeah remember the US Army was on Twitch that was a thing yeah was I mean uh are they not anymore I was just going to check  Esports m four years ago maybe they're not uh schedule here we go oh no last stream two years ago okay so this
particular thing is no longer a thing but don't kid yourself um sure they're around somehow it's definitely a thing I had no idea how into merchandising the US Army was yeah we have a video coming shortly I actually reviewed the edit for it's a great video I I just reviewed the edit before W show today um on these like kind of um wannabe Razer peripherals we actually showed them on the show couple weeks ago I think and one of the other things that this company that makes these uh ripoff razor
peripherals does is they make US Army branded stuff and as part of that rabbit hole we went looking for all the things with US Army co-branding on them what yeah there's anything and everything with United States Army co-branding it's absolutely wild oh there's tons of stuff like they should pay you to wear it you know cuz you served or something not not you pay them to to I mean I don't know I maybe maybe I'm missing something here but good gravy I wonder like are you okay I don't
know like you have acid reflux or I'm trying to hold it together are you do you need do you even cheap look at a yeah oh man $40 t-shirt it's amazing how often we take flak for the pricing on our store oh my goodness sorry guys our shirts are $20 like we we I don't anyway it doesn't matter the point is got more expensive $44 oh hold on I'm back to your laptop is that cuz there's print on the back is there no yeah I don't think print on the back does cost more and that's a pretty
reasonable upch charge for double-sided printing it's it adds a complete extra step with an additional screen okay they've got they've got a $19 well what's a PT shirt personal training oh okay okay they there's some reasonably priced stuff here I have no idea what the quality of any of this is what is army gear us.com though discounts get pretty fat I don't think this is actually I have no idea no this isn't this isn't the Army Luke I don't know dude man you're are you are you like uh no it's
AR Army co-branded I think right I don't I don't know that looks pretty Army co-branded to me I have no idea this Under Armour duty honor country T duty duty honor country did they just take every keyword I think that's one of their like their tagline things like on their on their coins and stuff it so I think there would usually be like a symbol between each word or something people are saying that is the logo so okay yeah that that is definitely the US Army logo that's why I was saying
physical training oh there you go not personal training shirt whatever I knew it meant like going to workout NATO apparently streamed a gaming tournament but the twitch channel is no longer there for some reason wild um any why don't we jump into we've got a few merch messages Dan want to hit us yeah sure thing let's see here maybe we should fetch Luca bucket at some point I think he's I did offer him earlier oh I'll be fine okay uh yeah I got two here for you hi dll the American Red Cross released a
VR training app for lifeguards but it needs the quest two or three lus do you think this would have helped you become a better lifeguard and can it help others I think it could have helped with repetitive training exercises like going through the motions literally of you know working on CPR compressions or um or to to practice like if they have a if they have like a simulated pool that you can stand next to and try to spot distressed swimmers and stuff like that try to try to get your like make it make
make it a game try to get your time down like how fast you you recognize a problem like I could see I could see stuff like that being kind of useful but when it comes to the nuts and bolts of can you actually haul someone's you know soggy butt out of a pool no you need real life you need to you need to actually train so if I was doing a training program and I had homework for the weekend where I had to get my response time down to you know 3 seconds to spot or whatever yeah sure I could
see being kind of useful for that I also think if you're if you're doing stuff like if you're if you're training um once you've gotten them out of the water Aid I don't know what different forms of that that would come up in but if it's like training that you do with a dummy yep if you could still do that training with a dummy but while VR strapped in so it's like more real reality I think it might help desensitize in situations where it might be rough yeah that's kind
of interesting um another thing I could see it be really being really useful for with mixed reality is things like um you know landmarking or um like okay one of the things that you need to do if you're going to do mouth to mouth resuscitation like uh breathing assistance is is you have to tilt the head back and so if it would tell you like hey you didn't tilt back far enough cuz it's actually monitoring it could show you like uh like a you know like a green shade for how far back the head the head needs to
go in order to open up the airway or something like that sure I could see it being very useful I haven't used their software though I have no idea if it does any of what I just said it could just be stupid I'm not sure but yeah absolutely I mean uh commercial applications for VR are heavily heavily uh training focused uh one of the things that um oh bananas who was it uh yeah one of the things Intel showed back when I checked out their Fab a while back was uh maintenance on the
machines is it it's Microsoft Hollow lens driven yeah so it'll just show you like you could be a complete nobody off the street and you could perform maintenance on one of these multi-million dollar machines just by putting on a hollow lens and it'll be like okay go over there and get that toolkit and then open up that tool kit uh grab this and you pick it up it's like nope not that one like like really any monkey with training could like yeah Hollow lens is totally a thing it's just
not a thing in the consumer space um military has applications for it as well well y all right Dan hit us sure thing Hi D I work in Live Theater lighting tungsten bulbs are being banned by the government the alternative is LEDs that cost "$10,000 and up to achieve a similar" quality light will small theater survive  not not with product that are available today necessarily the advancements in LED lighting over the last 10 years have been a thing to behold I had this conversation with someone on set a
little while ago and I kind of went okay let's look at all the major Tech categories CPU GPU networking U and there's some solid arguments to be made for a lot of those a lot of those categories in terms of you know what's Advanced the most over the last 10 years and I was like like and then I'm going to I'm going to tell me what you think is Advanced the most and then I'm going to surprise you with my answer and see if we can kind of we play these kinds of games when we're in
between takes and stuff like that and they they gave their answers and I was like  like huh because there are certainly ways that you know even even a stupid you know Intel 14 nanm Plus+ plus refresh has more advanced technology in in it than than you know one generation of lighting and to to the next three generations of lighting potentially but in terms of what has made an impact on our business um and in terms of the the change in quality and cost in that time I don't know if anything touches LED
lighting and like veritasium had that video that went viral recently on the challenges of developing the blue LED and how just LEDs were up against this wall forever and then development happened like wildly fast and that wild fast development is very much still happening like in the last 10 years we've gone from flu we've gone from fluorescence being dominant to LEDs being not just dominant but now you can change the color temperatures on them on the Fly because these controllers have
come down in cost by so so much um you can have arrays of LEDs at different color temperatures and they can do they can do mixing or they can switch between one or the other or both the brightness of them the efficiency of them everything is getting absolutely incredible and at the same time costs are plummeting the first lights we ever bought were fluorescence because that was the only thing that had a CRI or basically like a like a like um an accurate enough color uh to use for filming and then over the
next few years LED lights showed up but they were prohibitively expensive over the following 3 to 5 years LEDs got cheap like why would we buy anything else cheap nothing else makes any sense cheap and I just don't really see it slowing down um so in a bit and I'm not going to tell you exactly when but in a bit no I absolutely foresee those traditional lights being replaceable with LEDs and I don't know where you are and when exactly these bands are going into effect there have certainly been
some shortsighted bands that have destroyed entire Industries and have made absolutely no sense I mean uh you could make a strong argument against the plastic bag band that went into effect in Vancouver recently where it's like okay but is anybody talking about the energy cost of um paper bags is anybody talking about the reusability of those plastic bags compared to the paper ones like I get it I get a ton of uses out of my plastic bags yeah and not everybody does lots of people just throw them away
but like there's issues like that with the straws as well switch to paper straws but there's a lot of like different chemicals and things in the paper straws it's not just like paper in a roll that isn't even just paper in a roll like that's bleached and everything like and then you're putting that in liquid and it's soaking into the liquid liid and then you're drinking that and it's like oh this is actually glass straws are the way to go what's wrong with pasta just use pasta I like pasta
Twizzlers I'm not going to I'm Arc Twizzler AR there you go call back to earlier in the show um where where was I going with this I forget what the question even was Dan Dan started tungsten B are now banned LEDs help expensive so yeah I'm not saying that there's any guarantee that you guys will will able to get there in time and honestly even if the new lights are cheap I I know that live productions can be very budget constrained you might just not have you might just not have
the budget to replace them at all with anything and you certainly can't sell something that's banned so you can't even recoup any of your old costs is this is this like a you have to replace it now thing or is it when your current existing thing dies you must get a new one it's probably a right now thing and I was I was look look at um I was looking at something recently that was kind of like this that was basically like here's a here's a ban that's happening now and everyone was like yo
this is completely untenable for us like you're you're basically just killing our industry I can't remember which one it is for the life of me but I hope not I personally love live theater it's not for everyone um but you if you ask if you asked me hey me too you can game for 3 hours or you can watch a movie for 3 hours or you can do just about any kind of passive form of entertainment for 3 hours or you can go to a live theater show for 3 hours I will take the live theater show every
single time I justs I I love it it's raw it's real it's fun it's intimate um you know I I'm very human I I have a really hard time enjoying a show that's in a room with tens of thousands of people it's just it's not really my vium uh whereas as a few hundred yeah I can I can get into that um yep like you can you can find that person who's laughing really loud at every at every joke which I don't know it doesn't bother me like it would in a movie theater you know like I don't it's it's it's just it's
it's human yeah it's a really good way of putting it I love there's a lot of stuff like that too like if um you know if like if NASA puts a thing on the moon it's like well is there person in it no most people aren't going to Care does it necessarily make that much of a difference like we might we might even be getting the same amount of accomplishment but if there isn't a human involved a lot of people are just like me it's interesting that that aspect the whole like viewership on space launches and
space activities that involve people versus ones that don't involve people and how uh actually well studied those metrics are has been something that's been very interesting for me when looking at all these new AI tools and stuff oh um people generally care a lot more when other people are involved sure I mean it's the only reason that you know the Olympics gets to be a thing is they they get you they get you focused in on the stories yeah of the people nobody nobody actually cares about Javelin other than
the handful of people who care about Javelin um you know for 3.96 years and then the Olympics rolls around and they and they and they tell all these stories and the stories are interesting because we've been checked out of them for over three years yeah um but yeah no it's it's the human element that matters for any of this and it's just you're closer to it I guess is what I'm trying to say um you know even like even a live sporting event I just I find it's it's huge and I've been told a lot
of times that I should go and watch lower level sporting events and I probably would enjoy them more but I've just been kind of busy ever since following a sports team is actually kind of a lot of work like especially if if if you're like me and you kind of tend to get into things like I'm going to want to know what's going on with you know the other teams that they compete against and all the players and the and the ones who are getting called up and the ones who are getting sent down in the coaches and I
don't the whole thing yeah anyway what are we supposed to be doing Dan ah more topics more topics what do you want to talk about Luke I don't know man oh how about this uh do I do I get do I get an I was right yet um the PlayStation portal has been um  PPSSPP and will allow the console to locally run emulated games for the PlayStation portal which is what many gamers hoped that the portal might be able to do when it was first announced one of the devs behind the hack Google security researcher Andy
Newan known as the flow has stated that the hack is not yet ready for release but he demonstrated shots of GTA 3 running on a PS portal it can also apparently run Tekken 6 and Minecraft um this is one of the things that I feel like maybe we didn't emphasize enough in our video but we definitely mentioned when talking about the value of the PlayStation portal the fact that by the time cuz remember we did our video a bit later and by the time we did it people were already
starting to poke and prod at it with at least a little bit of success and we  like uh this thing might be you know something might happen and obviously you know like we're not going to be the ones to put the work into it but it's the kind of device that is just screaming for someone to figure out how to work around Sony's Walled Garden and I don't think I've seen an Android device that has not ultimately been pwned yeah that one that people care about yes um and speaking of Sony
devices and being poned uh psvr2 is getting self- poned Sony has announced that they will be adding PC support to the psvr2 hopefully sometime this year the headset had weaker than expected initial sales when it came out last year only selling around man this is wild like even you know oh this sucked uh selling around "270,000" 2700 "200 you good 270,000 units of the 2" million that Sony manufactured for its launch window okay so that doesn't sound like a sales shortfall that sounds like
a manufacturing uh overestimation but anyway as of now now only about a million units total have been sold a discussion question would you switch over to the psvr2 if it could play games on Steam it's a pretty good headset and  price I mean I wouldn't but I do think if you were like getting into VR it's a heck of a yeah it's price is like very well positioned how much is it again it's like 200 bucks isn't it yes are PPSSPP is apparently uh is apparently the name of a good PSP emulator not the name of the
hack so correction thank you chat 750 bucks is that Canadian yeah yeah well that's Canadian dollars dude it's OLED oh yeah that's pretty nice yeah all right okay all right I'm only really remembering like I I've never tried this one I've only tried the first one no it's really good it's uh it's yeah it's 550 us okay um and that includes controllers like good controllers oh nice yeah yeah no it's  compelling uh oh wow yeah really high res too wow all right this is interesting the extremely popular new
game hell divers 2 has been plagued with server issues since launch uh which Arrowhead CEO Johan Johan has acknowledged is largely due to insufficiently optimized backend code and the time needed to onboard additional Engineers to their backend team currently consisting of four developers he has recommended that Gamers especially cash strapped Gamers hold off on buying it until the issues are addressed based that is unheard of yeah I I to be fair if they had a a sales goal they're I'm
genuinely estimating probably like 50 to 100 times beyond what that sales goal was at this point right um because they are just smashing it right now um so they definitely don't need it and it might actually be like the the good press from saying this is is likely just worth it exacerbating the problem many players have been squatting AFK on servers in order to avoid wait times which Arrowhead Studios will apparently be addressing in an upcoming pth yeah guys when there's an issue with
something doing things that make the issue worse for everyone is bad my favorite one is like when a login server goes down and then people just sit there yeah login Lin L goes down and people start spamming F in the chat so that when I try to type an update no one sees it yeah yeah people are the problem yeah is that is that patch out already sorry uh yeah the 15minute AFK patches is out and they also pretty much doubled the server capacity yesterday they've been working non-stop it's
amazing I think it's like a team of four people backend team is four people yeah that's right the game is currently PC PS5 only but a popular petition is currently circulating to Port the game to Xbox which I'm sure they will do at some point when they are not busy well I think it's like a PlayStation published game so maybe not oh discussion question does a company have a certain level of responsibility to encourage their customers to make good financial decisions um technically that's the most
optimistic sounding thing I've ever read yeah technically no not even slightly appreciate you uh probably Jessica who wrote that I think Riley's more jaded yeah yeah I think it's really cool when they do but yeah uh but I think expecting it at this point is simply not realistic yeah it saddens me to say that but it's the truth yeah that was like um the the pal World lead developer or something CEO I don't know what it was um but people pointed out like oh there's like a lot less players playing
po world now and he's like that's cool there was content and they probably like played it and then hopefully we'll release more content and they'll come back that's fine it's like sweet yeah that makes sense hey you know who else did the right thing recently the Xbox team yeah Xbox is adding the ability to recalibrate their own thumbsticks on series X and S and Xbox One controllers this will allow players to fix their own calibration issues without having to get a repair or contact support it will also
allow players to independently set up replacement thumbsticks very cool in other news earlier this week Xbox announced that four previously Microsoft exclusive games sea of Thieves Hi-Fi Rush grounded and pentant would all be coming to PS5 and the latter two would be coming to switch is platform exclusivity just like dead I think to a certain degree is it buried maybe like okay we have a video coming that's a um console tier list video so we go through and we rank from
from s to f um all of the major consoles from all the major players and we don't get into handheld it's just like your live your living room consoles so we just like crushes um I believe we ended up being a tier go so because pause wait because one of our criteria was how how how well the game Library holds up today we factored in some historical significance so like the Atari 2600 ends up with like a b or something just because of how many groundbreaking things Happ happened on that console
okay um but but one of our major considerations was how do the games for that platform hold up and this was something that David and I talked about he's the writer for it and you know how passionate he is about games yeah and he's super into the hardware side as well but he's a very very passionate gamer it seems like a video that that he would crush oh yeah he he killed it he did a great job um but anyway one of the things that started to happen as we made our way into PS5 Xbox series is it
became really difficult to evaluate a console that way yeah because what is an Xbox Series game we discuss how one of the struggles for the Xbox series is that unlike the 360 they haven't really had a box mover title not really not to the degree that Sony has um whether you're talking about Spider-Man or um okay Final Fantasy 7 remastered you know whatever the case may be what do you mean Halo okay so a no and B it's not exclusive you can't shift boxes with software that runs on other boxes yeah
and and Microsoft has really struggled not only is the Xbox series under selling the play PS5 by like 1 to two or something like that according to the most recent numbers we were able to find surprised it's honestly like that low most of them are Series S they're the basic one they're not even selling their premium console not really it's it's a it's a non-factor in the current generation race and so you know we're looking at this thing I'm like okay so Microsoft cly clearly saw the path here
to to be a a gaming services company uh so how do we even evaluate their performance in a race they're not even really running yeah that's interesting and even the PlayStation 5 one of the challenges that we had evaluating its library was that over the first couple of years because the PS4 had such an enormous install base and was reasonably powerful still over the first couple of years we saw so many games with simultaneous releases on both of those platforms that it really was more akin to a PC release
that runs okay on your older PC or runs great on your newer PC so how do you evaluate the game library of the PS5 here we are what three three years in I think three years since launch yeah when most of the games aren't PS5 games they're PlayStation games yeah I I think too like it's it's I think the main blurring that's going to happen like even with this announcement uh some of them are going to PS5 but not oh wait no they all are going to PS5 see that that's a little bit weird to me uh more
games coming to PC is not that weird to me and I suspect PlayStation games personally I don't think we're going to see a ton of them coming to Xbox just bad blood or what I think well no I think the reason why Xbox is doing this is so that they look less like a monopoly uh because they're getting a lot of issues lately with companies going after them and one of the discussions around that has been um that you're using this to try to crush PlayStation so they're going look we're
giving our games over to PlayStation for now are old games that people don't care aboutmore the issue is is that the way that monopolies squeeze out the competition is not by doing it immediately um we I was having an interesting conversation with someone about Uber's trajectory or like Uber's path to uh to profitability they're profitable now for apparently the first time and uh I had to take an Uber somewhere and it was like $30 and it was barely anywhere so it was as expensive or more
expensive than what I would have paid for a cab way back in the day and like Uber Eats makes no sense anymore at the rates that you pay for it it's like gee should I pay double the price for a cold meal the already ridiculous price yeah like you don't eat out much no but have  lately it's been a while okay um by the way Dan why didn't you join us for dinner after the shoot oh I didn't um I didn't even think to did anybody text you um I think probably when I was already home okay well okay
well first I invited you and then I guess you didn't hear me and then uh I didn't realize that you were going to be breaking immediately oh yeah I thought that you were probably going to wait an hour or two okay well we we did a crew dinner uh on the uh the the giant display thing and I was like yeah we'll do a crew dinner which means he didn't invite me to the giant display thing at or and I'm not crew anymore no you are's not crew anymore no I explicitly invited you to join the crew dinner which which
is uh when we like when we do an offsite shoot will'll often cover the meal just because people are usually inconvenienced in some way whether it's Dan and I understand I have technically already taken talking to the viewers not to you this is what it's like to work  camera oh no the point is sorry Luke sorry the point is L did did you did you read this at all the receipt no oh good okay so where would you rank um where would you rank Mexican on like uh like like no no no no no yes it's
delicious hold on a second yeah is this is this a is this a a like a generally premium priced Cuisine or more of like an affordable everyday usually more affordable okay um it and you know generally speaking you're hole in the wall versus your like you know chain or you upscale generally here generally more here generally more here okay so we went to a Mexican hole in the wall yeah and Delicious By the way Delicious By the way um we got two a tacos nice uh a taco platter nice uh they did add a guacamole o
that's expensive but nice y um a gringo P Lun whatever that is couple burritos a Dorito another burrito and an enchiladas plate so we fed um how how many were we Dan we were seven I guess without you something like that I feel like you just got taxed for being a white dude Gringo thing we got we got five Mexican gringa gringa I don't know what that means look do I speak do I speak Spanish okay um Gringo is is Google says Gringo is a person especially an American who is not Hispanic or Latino nice okay just
a second so five five Mexican Cokes okay wow we fed seven people like hold in the wall Mexican food how much do you think the bill was seven people is this after tax or before tax let's go uh let's go after tax and tip after tax and tip yeah oh I'm so CU remember tipping is like  people 160 bucks dude you're not even close it's way higher waa oh I was close to the sub total you're close to the sub can see can I see you were under the pre-tax pre-tip total yeah this is more
expensive per plate than I expected yeah for sure yeah yeah and like I was expecting like after tax per plate it was going to be like 20 bucks and it's before tax per plate 20 bucks and that's no tip yep and like you know it's one of those things where where on principle yeah the way that it is right now is not how I think things should work people should be paid a reasonable amount of money and then the price on the menu should be what the food costs and if there's exceptional service then
you can leave a small tip that's how it's like supposed to work yeah that should be like rare but here's the thing that's not how it works not at all and as someone who can afford the you know minimum eight you know it'll be like 18% 2025 on the three options or whatever as someone who can afford to tip like that and as someone who knows that that optimistic way that I wish it worked is not reality and that people actually do just depend on these tips for survival um I do
tip I'll just I'll just I'll press the stupid button or whatever but like that that's wild yeah oh it's yeah it's ridiculous I I I massively prefer so I'll even take it a little bit further I wish tipping wasn't a thing at all I wish it was just priced in and yeah maybe if it's over and above you just don't round or whatever and give them the remaining um but I also wish um like in in stores and stuff Tax was included in the listed price like do in Europe the fact there
are countries that have figured both of these things out and we're over here just like I don't know guess yeah like what no anyway I uh yeah I I I I hate it but it's one of those things where you know you could say okay well lonus having Luke guess after tip is not reasonable because that wasn't actually the price but what I was trying to say was it effectively is here because I know that that kitchen staff and that server are not they didn't receive any tips at all they're going to be like homeless they
will not be able to live yeah so so it's not really optional is it it's very expensive to live in PC and if you yeah I don't know earn your her event asks what about on takeout orders um if it's a place that I go regularly um I will tip well and if it's a place that I don't go regularly then I'll do like 10% because the reality of it is that someone packed it and I also don't know where the tip is going it often gets shared around but um what I do know is that even though
theoretically there's um you know lower overhead for takeout orders in some ways it can be a lot higher now especially with all the expensive um like more expensive like paper bags cost way more than plastic bags and they're not allowed to use plastic bags anymore and stuff like that if you get a drink they're going to try to like tape over the thing and they're they're taping closed the bags often or stapling it closed or else so even the even the restaurant owners themselves even if
they're just pocketing it there's a lot of overhead involved in in handling takeout orders uh so I'll just I I'll I'll I'll leave a small tip anyway because I I can't think of any chains that I eat at um that I do take out from so I yeah them I don't know if I would bother but even then like a lot of them are franchises and it's it's relatively small business owners that are running the restaurants even if it's you know a multi-billion dollar multinational that you know owns The Branding or whatever else
yeah MDA 187 asks if plastic bags are illegal in Canada how do you get your milk okay couple things oh that's hilarious actually number one pretty good not those ones the like disposable plastic bags for groceries and and takeout and stuff like that why why aren't the milk bags I ironically we can still buy plastic garbage bags so I can't use my shopping bag to line my garbage can but I can buy a completely separate bag to put in there brilliant why is that allowed brilliant pointless
um and then also the whole milk bag thing was as big a surprise to me as it was to you yes uh it wasn't until I did not a BC thing yeah it wasn't until I did my um my my my Quebec exchange that I first encountered begged milk apparently it's a thing this in more of Canada than I've ever known um and you can find it in BC it's just very rare but it is pretty much not a thing here it's it's gallon jugs just like our neighbors down south or paper cartons the because BC's kind of tucked behind
the Rockies we're we're honestly like much more Americanized than a lot of the rest of Canada I think um or we're much more West coasted yeah I would I would say like hyper similar to Washington Seattle area I would say that if if if I if I had to if I had to say like what our country would be it would probably be like BC Yukon BC Washington Oregon yeah would be like like wet wet Coast to stand yeah yeah um and then and then everyone else can kind of do whatever it is that they're doing um
those further south and further east there like quite related like I I I remember like every time I run into orgers or Washington I don't even know what you guys call yourselves like oh these are my people it's just it's just obvious like the accent is the same even though technically we're like we're Canadian and they're American or something like the accent's the same the the the alignment on a lot of stuff is the same it's it's just it's kind of funny um apparently some parts of the
states also have bagged milk oh yeah Oregonian is that is that it sorry I'm probably saying this wrong but yeah Pacific Northwest let's go uh um researchers have lost a window into China which is an interesting perspective on this that I would not have considered academics especially researchers focused on China have criticized Google's decision to quietly remove cash pages from its search results the feature allowed users to view prior versions of web pages which made it invaluable in tracking
information on the Chinese internet which is of course heavily censored with important information often being retroactively scrubbed by the government according to Danny Sullivan Google search liaison the feature was originally intended to help people access Pages back when the internet was far less reliable that were just down and not working uh which is why it has now been discontinued because it's no longer really needed and our discussion question here is should we preserve
features even when their intended purpose is no longer relevant um for Google's part I don't see why they would have any interest in this new purpose for that feature so I can understand why they're discontinuing it like they're essentially like a much much shorter term version of the way back machine right um and I can see why we don't want them to do that but I can also see how we have no real way of arguing that they should keep the feature because it doesn't benefit their business model in any  way yeah
it's unfortunate when we lose things like that but like it's a business it's not a government Luke I have something to show you remember we talked about I've seen this oh got him well that sucks anyway this is really funny I was going to try and convince Luke however briefly that this was the old Will Smith video and then the new one was Sora um because he had asked about what if Will Smith spaghet I did I did actually call it right away um for someone trying to rehabilitate
their Public Image uh this was a good play yes yep anyway I I I enjoyed he slapped Chris Rock right yeah I think they're like doing a movie together or something really I think so oh man did we just get 4D chest maybe breast Through Time  matter you're going to injure the poor man  man oh boy any who um uh so I don't know I'm not finding anything on this so maybe I just made it up or maybe it was a very old video from before this lap but yeah it's uh it's interesting because you know what I was I was
talking about when we announced Sora sorry uh when we not when we announced Sora when we talked about Sora on the show last week I talked about how it was weird how certain parts of the frame would feel like they were in rewind and other parts were going forward and like it didn't really have a good sense of time and how things would actually like progress forward um one of the editing tricks that they used in the Will Smith video uh cuz it's not AI generated but there are editing tricks is they used
like rewind and forward mixing and like that to make it look really weird um I think if the AI video stuff fixes that it'll be immediately significantly more believable we've got a bit of an update for you guys we've had some members of our community getting notifications from various monitoring Services informing them that they've been affected by a data leak from the LT Forum oh no uh this appears to be a bunch of very old leaked data which has been re-released onto the internet due to a massive leak
from leak lookup.com a data breach indexer which was uncovered last month uh there does not appear to be any new breach of the LTT forum and if there was you would be informed as soon as humanly possible yeah so just hopefully that um helps put your mind at ease speaking of your mind being at e soon it's reasonably possible yes well humanly yeah we might take a sec though to like verify impacts that's human okay sounds good are vending machines spying on students yes can you
let me do my job nope the University of waterl in Canada has announced that it will be removing several &amp;m branding branded vending machines because the green Eminem is too sexy and it's a  students sorry uh they'll be removing them following the Revelation that the machines have the ability to collect facial recognition data this was discovered when one waterl student posted a picture of a strange error message on one of the machines inv Venda vending recognition. app.exe one student
publication math news Tracked Down the manufacturer sales brochures which say that these smart vending machines can collect this is amazing estimated ages and genders of every client and send that data to various parties including Mars the owners of M&amp;M's inv Venda claims that their machines are wholly compliant with the eu's stringent General data protection regulation though that would only be possible if the machine requested explicit permission every time it stored a
users's data yeah I was going to say I have a big doubt on that one adaria vending Services who were responsible for the machines on campus say that the technology acts as a motion sensor that detects faces and activates the purchasing interface but does not collect user data insane idea here but just use a motion sensor are you aing idiot crazy idea I know I am a little out of it right now Luke I you know I'm just I'm trying all right I'm just I'm just going to bring Dan in as our host co-host of the W hon
get the out of here I'll go produce that's the stupidest idea I've ever  chill absolutely wild The Machine's facial recognition technology uses an extremely small unobtrusive camera and many students reported being completely unaware of any camera when using the machines because why would you be looking for that is there a picture of these like can we see it uh let's have a look let's bring up math news oh wow this is great this reads exactly like a university student paper I love it
um anyway yeah this is actually amazing what does that what does that block quote say if we do some actual trans the  page it's it's exactly as irreverent as I would expect it to be uh any who here's the picture so let's play find  camera I don't know uh I think I saw it where yeah I see it I oh wait it's can't be that I think so why would they embed it there why wouldn't they just embed it in the black fairly certain if I'm going to I'm going to steal the screen capture thing
sure um so that's a zoomed in photo of it which is why I was pretty sure that was it because I think this blue here is the blue of the Eminem that you saw this looks just like a like a broken hole like this doesn't look like it was it looks like it was hacked into it yeah weird yeah kind of odd that's bizarre dude freaking dystopia we should just start calling it The dystopia show because it's all we ever freaking talk about welcome to the W show we talk  spooky um all right disco elisium 2 is
dead I'm sorry S no yeah let's buy a really good IP and then worst news I've heard all year close it down Embrace a group awesome cool it's time for Wow after dark it's going to be a short one this week by the way guys uh nice Luke's not feeling well I'm blaming Luke how's the how's the underside of that bus treating you oh you know I mean you kind of feel like you've been hit by it so I might as well put you there yeah yeah cuz that's how that works um John asks is the PTM
7950 thermal phase change pad safe for a vertical Mount um this isn't going to leak from between my Ai and my CPU over time and also asks do you have a plush version for my CPU pillow that I bought last year keep up the decent work thanks John I love that yes it is is safe for a vertical Mount and we will keep up the decent work in fact we have some absolutely awesome videos coming I I wish I could I wish I could just make the WAN show better by just playing them for you and watching them together
Kyle's AMD ultimate Tech upgrade I'm excited about that I saw the ECC upload and I'm excited oh you watched it I haven't watched it I just saw it go up on ECC and I was like it's like 30 minutes long and blew by I had no idea the time had passed that's it's so good uh the all China PC really good uh Tanner did an outstanding job because rather than just buying weird Chinese stuff and reacting to it he includes a whole bunch of context who the f are these companies yeah yeah like who are their parent
companies how long have they been around how long do they say they've been around versus how long have they actually been  and in some ways a little scary yeah yeah it's so that's that's a really good one that I just reviewed man what else I don't know there's a ton of really good stuff coming over the next little bit I'm very excited um Dan hit me hey lldd picking up the ABCs of gaming for my soon Tobe born son do you see Ai Ai and AR headsets being useful tool to help kids learn I think we go through this
every single time there's a new techn iCal Innovation first they it was computers in the classroom are these a good tool for teaching kids like well yes but also no then we went through it with uh you know tablets yeah then we went through it with cell phones then we go through it with everything yes but also no is is the  um everything in moderation right not everything but yeah I mean don't don't moderate in moderation yeah that's a good one it's a good quote you need to excessively
moderate yourself now now we're getting dystopian again I don't know I think I think the way to to fight off the dystopia is to be constantly at War this is this is my whole new thing I'm into that I I think I've talked about this before 40K that's how it happened everybody was really moderate I don't mean war is in like shooting people I mean war is in like uh understanding that so many things around you are obsessively intentionally manipulative float plane chats just starting to list things that are not
okay in moderation only F your neighbor's wife in moderation no not anything in moderation I mean hey maybe maybe maybe there's an agreement there yeah yeah don't abuse that relationship seems very healthy oh man it's always good to to be positive about that sort of stuff okay yeah maybe maybe that's all copasetic only cannibalism and moderation uh yeah don't take more than  share oh man anyway uming chat's very reasonable cool yeah what's next uh jeez I don't know uh currently watching live
surrounded by a 40 foot video wall at Time Square nice lonus what's your limit on display sizes if TCL makes a 200 TV will you get one I won't have a big enough room for one the limit on display sizes is dictated by your space I think um the the smallest Samsung wall last time around when I was like when I was looking into it and I was like I kind of want one I think it was 143 in and the issue for me was that at 16 by9 that was kind of too big for my space at a wider aspect ratio 143 in would
probably be fine because as it turns out and we learned this when we set up the the big display um as it turns out the wider you go the shockingly little difference there is between the one uh part of that right angle triangle or the the bottom of the right angle triangle and the diagonal yeah like the difference between our diagonal and our bottom was only like 3et or something like that at that width um so I could probably handle like 140 150 in display if it was a wider aspect
ratio but if I had to go 16 by 9 120 to 130 is probably about as big as I can go in that theater room which seats comfortably about seven to nine people um so if you were to have if you had a larger room like I sat in this amazing theater room virtually in the uh in the big screen Beyond app that was like it was like set up like you were a mega baller and you had like a theater room to hold your like orgies in or something like it was enormous and had all this like soft
tiered seating everywhere and everything it's very relatable yeah exactly uh anyway sitting in there I was like I would need A50 to 200 in display at the front of this for it to for it to be big enough that everyone could enjoy it had an open relationship um that too it's very Progressive that's all Luke spend is this show over yet Luke doesn't spend money on anything but that that's why that's why you can't  anything oh boy anyway yeah I I I think that for for most reasonable sized rooms
we're there and talking to display manufacturers they seem to be kind of acknowledging that like high sense seems to really Envision itself as competing more in the premium space rather than competing in the big but cheap space because that's not going to be a space that really exists anymore in a little while everyone's just going to have a big Affordable TV yeah so you better get real good real fast now the good news is man though that 100 that 100 in or 110 yeah  amazing uh let's see what we else we got
hi lldd I work at a laser Tag Facility and a few of us were given the opportunity to remodel our boss's office what would you put in taran's office and is there an item that you would recommend I get I mean if I was remodeling your boss's office I would definitely get some kind of like shark and suspend it from the ceiling with a freaking laser beam on its head but maybe that's just me that that's actually perfect I love that idea just like like Aquarium style you know with
just the like the fishing line and you've just got this shark and it just has a freaking laser beam on its head that's what I want that's what I would want in that office everything else I don't even care but but like aquatic themed paint walls you know get some sponge on there gets a little bit of green in there get some seaweed decals and then get like a freaking laser beam shark and then everything's everything's oh my God everything else is gravy could do a mural on the wall with that then it
would be harder to remove as for what we would put in Tan's office we actually have a video coming on that we took some suggestions from uh the community and we will be building him a PC worthy of a CEO oh boy oh boy oh boy oh boy oh boy uh hey LT love the show it's the first time catching it live and I thought I'd support oh my God you spent $400 you bought one of everything you don't have to do that you could you could watch it again in a bit and he bought two of one thing two bananas
bananus ban uh with the oh the Gerald undun cab t-shirt it's a really cool shirt actually uh notebook um the tablet one that one's a cool one you open it up and the pages have like it's like writing on a little tablet it's little thing uh a banana for scale in yellow a mystery 40 oz water bottle a backpack and a screwdriver retro with a silver shaft very nice okay anyway uh thanks Eric um what do you got lonus are you tempted to daily Drive the s24 ultra and Luke have you played any sod I have not
much but it's it's been pretty good what is it what is season of Discovery I was going to say soldier of Destiny we were way off uh it's not bad though yeah thanks very believable yeah I mean it's I it's basically just Soldier of Fortune but with a d oh yeah Destiny I don't know it doesn't matter the point is um yeah I'm pretty tempted by the s24 ultra I I'm I've been not missing the fold as much as I thought I would uh speaking of witch down I finally wiped everything
off of it and it's in my office you can just oh no I haven't well I copied everything off it I haven't WIP wiped it but if you just remind me I know you said you wanted to try it so um sure it's yours you fixed it um oh that was my deal I told him he couldn't do it and then Dan was like you can't tell me what to do and I was like that sounds like a Dan thing fine if you can fix it you can have it I was I was actually like I just want to make sure that you can have your
phone that you love back lineus I don't mind that's very kind of you though no it was it was a lot more obsessive compulsive than that oh I had to I was going to do it whether you wanted to happen or not I I know everyone while he'll he'll like we I I have this chat called the the Dan tasking chat that AJ and I are in yeah because he gets asked to do like everything on the planet so we try to you know make sure that we're still aiming true um but every once in a while there'll there'll be some like
electronic repair thing that'll come through and I'll be like H does this make a ton of sense almost always it's no will it make Dan super happy that doesn't matter for productivity of the business I'm about to make Dan super super happy has anyone talked about the video that you and I are going to work together on no oh God no no Luke have you approved to this I don't he doesn't have to get unlimited without going through the proper channels it is my rule you're out of fre I'm scared now so um did you
ever see that CRT projector that ploof got for that video on a CRT projector I don't think I did but I recommended Chase get some for smash I grew up with a CRT projector with the three tubes and we ended up selling it to some Super Smash Brothers players because you get the CRT latency but 12T across all right so let's talk about CRT projectors for a minute actually no let's not talk about CRT projectors let's talk about the right to repair okay we got actually a second one of those CRT projectors um it
had been stored outside and uh is in pretty challenging uh operational condition it still works a little bit but what's cool is unlike the first one we bought which was more expensive and definitely worked the second one we got came with a service manual oh and that service manual is about 2 in thick and has literally everything beautiful every schematic for absolutely everything and I was kind of thinking you know what would be a really cool video is if we told the story of how we lost right
to repair because right to repair isn't something we're asking for it's something that we deserve to have back we had it that was normal that was a thing expected yes and so and so I thought as uh as a vehicle for that story we could use this this old Sony CR RT projector that quite frankly Dan I don't think is worth fixing even for tournaments at the land because it's too dim we have to get a better one you have to get like a dark room yeah but but kind of sick though
but we should fix it because we can and we should be able to is sort of the point that we're getting at yeah and I I thought it'd be kind of cool to get some other prominent right to repair Advocates and and sort of um and and so yeah so get so so Dan your job would be to fix the projector with this incredible service manual and it it don't worry it's not dead as a door nail it's a bit dead I would love to talk through my troubleshooting intuition as well which kind of is what allows me to
fix the things and there's also a bloke that we are in touch with who did a video fixing one of these a little while ago and um it I think it might be kind of a cool opportunity for a collab there so there's a lot of synergies you know to use a crappy horrible yeah business term but I thought I thought you'd be pretty into it yeah that do sound fun yeah so uh super fun so consider that something that we're we're going to do sometime sometime eventually we're not in a hurry because it's not like the
thing's going to get any older uh or dead but yeah when we when I saw that service manual man there's there there's like schematics for everything absolutely everything like you could basically take the entire thing apart down to board level components and rebuild it because the cost was because all that stuff was expensive not because you it's proprietary and you can't build one yourself because we won't show you how you can't put it back together yourself because we won't show you how
because you like just a totally totally different industry philosophy that's kind of what I grew up with as well that's what my dad did is he repaired CRT TVs um and VCRs and things like that and he would do those board level repairs um he still does that now for like you know Word of Mouth type repair stuff but in the early days they were simpler and you could ask the company for schematics um there's even some high-end audio gear because he does Studio audio Gear Repair because a lot
of it's still vintage analog extremely Boutique Niche stuff and some companies you'll you'll message and be like hey your thing's broken I'm a service tech here got any info for me and they'll send you all the service manuals and spare parts and schematics and then I know one company it's universal audio just won't won't even talk to you oh we got to send it back it's it's like a "$115,000 piece of vintage audio" equipment and they're just give it back like I'm not going to I'm not going to
send it to you the air shipping is too dangerous that's not reasonable it also weighs 100 pounds so anyway yes um I am tempted by the s24 ultra and also all  about uh I guess this is the last one nope I'm on the wrong page uh really happy to see you guys are selling PTM 7950 so much easier to get this way my question is did you have plans to buy and sell this since the video on it or is this a much more recent idea you'd be amazed how long things take to like do properly like we had to figure figuring
out how to get them cut who is going to cut it honey well no because if they did we're not really buying them in bulk anymore are we um so I think the the the the how do they how do they come I think the fulls size sheets are like four of these okay and then they're flat packed those would have been like whatever it's like $200 or something and so no no oh it's like very OEM it's just like bulk so we had to figure out okay well how do we do this oh no I was just wondering is it a
roll or is it a stack it's it's a stack of flat pack things uh so we had to figure out like how how to cut cut them we had to create installation guides we had to create packaging and we had to we had to Source it sourcing it took a long time because Honeywell just straight up didn't return our emails like sorry who the are you like they don't care um so it was it was after the community uh brought up the idea that because this stuff was kind of hard to get your hands on as an end user at a reasonable price
that we should Source it and we should sell it so we did that took a long time but hey it's there now exciting hey LL and D seeing as you design and produce so many products what if any inter product consideration and testing do you do how things look fit work together Etc a lot I mean the pants I'm wearing right now um oh look at that I have a screwdriver in it have a pocket that is specifically designed to hold a tool and that we obviously validated with our screwdriver this is an early prototype
that the screwdriver actually doesn't fit very well into but that's why we do  we made that with our screwdriver it doesn't you when you sit down it's like at a so we had to make sure that the pocket was at a reasonable height so that it wouldn't just like jab you in the in the gut uh regardless of how you put it in so it won't stab you if it's blade side up with a bit installed either um it called blade side I think so is it not I think so I don't know uh uh now I need to look it up bit side shaft
side the business end side yeah at least someone calls it a blade yeah sure yeah I don't know I just never heard that so I wasn't sure what is a blade screwdriver oh for crying out loud still used to drive a slotted screw head is called a standard common blade flat blade slot head straight oh that's just for slote heads though I don't know this isn't a slot it's Phillips screwdriver blade yeah all right I don't know there might be other there might be other words for it but no I didn't know any other word I
