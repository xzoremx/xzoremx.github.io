this ah much better and with no downside at all okay one downside but the other ways to silence your gaming PC or your console take a lot of time money and space that is unless you're willing to get a little creative here we go now guys this isn't a woodworking channel so we're going to keep keep the goals pretty straightforward number one is we want to keep this simple enough that anyone could build it with basic tools two I don't want to spend a ton of money and number three I want to significantly
quiet down my computer without harming performance or resorting to Exotic measures like sticking in another room I just hope I bought enough wood units to complete both our project and the segue to our sponsor seic you know seic for their reliable and energy efficient power supplies so snag your vertex gx1000 right now by clicking the link in  description here's what I'm thinking rather than building a fully enclosed box I want to make two identical u-shaped shells that have these slots
for air to move through them then I just slide them around our PC like so leaving a little Gap put a in on it and voila quieter computer to keep costs down our box is designed to be caught from a single 4x8 sheet of plywood or whatever other sheet good your budget allows for those of you watching in not America "that's 1,220 mm by" "2,440 but I'm going to stick with" freedom units for the rest of this video so that my Southern neighbors don't try to liberate the studio now most building
supply stores will cut down large sheets for you for a nominal fee so we have them cut ours into quarters to make them easier to transport and to make them a little bit easier to work with safely if you guys want to build along at home by the way we're going to have our plans on the Forum which will be Link in the video description our first cuts are to remove a 1x 2T piece off of two of our quarter panels that's going to give us our sidewalls and the outside end pieces now
it's worth noting guys we're in a fancy Shop but you don't need a fancy shop to do this a circular saw jigsa or even a Handa can get these Cuts done pretty cleanly just be patient measure twice cut once and all of that jazz with that said fancy tools do help sometimes and a nail gun like this one is a great way to attack wood pieces together before you secure them with screws you guys really did pick the scuffed piece of plywood on the face of the Earth hey um what's up with that wasn't me thanks Shaggy how
good are you with a nail gun never used  right okay wherever your nails go you're you're going to want to make sure that you pre-drill some pilot holes before screwing the panels together with uh your LT screwdriver or more realistically with your drill since you were already holding that and that's the real tool for this man I put that nail right where I'd want to put my first screw yeah I you might say I screwed up Pro tip by the way guys if you're not sure what size bit to use to pre-drill it's actually
listed on the side of the package with our third piece of plywood we're going to make our inside ends each of these is going to get a slot cut into it either to allow passive air flow through our box or for bonus credit to mount some fans we didn't Factor fans into our budget though so we're going to go with the slot and the easiest way to cut a slot is by drilling a starter hole then using a jigsaw if you don't have a jigsaw you can use a coping saw to do this by hand but it'll probably end up looking
like hey I don't know where you're going you that was actually me but to be fair I voted to use the laser but Jordan said no those are too expensive that is a fair point we're trying to keep this affordable but if you don't mind spending a little bit more money a whole saw can be had for about 15 bucks for the drill that you're probably still holding and you can just put a few of those in there and man with fans that would be sick anyway rby thanks you can cut for a bit while I cut we're both cutting 
too now it's time for a quick test to see if we're onto something here our gaming rig is sitting at about 50 DB from this location and this is not a scientific test by any stretch but let's go ahead and take our second piece of P it and put it there 3 DB however on this side we drop more like 7 to 8 and that's before we add anything to deal with the reflections that are allowing sound to escape from our box not to mention the gaping hole on the top while we were at home desperate we came up with a plan
for that too this stuff is really cool it's a fiberboard sound installation that's made out of recycled wood and before all you building material nerds go but lius I know it's only readily available in Canada but there are alternative State Side just look for a product called sound stop from Blue Ridge fiberboard big home improvement stores should carry it but if not they'll probably have some generic acoustic insulation soundboard that'll also work just be aware that both of those options are thinner than
sonopan so they may be slightly less effective you can use power tools to cut this stuff but we find it works pretty well with just a nice sharp blade and a utility knife perfect slap her in and as  uh-oh is getting a good friction fit nice sorry our main concern is making sure that any hard surface that   one oh this is kind of short Jordan that's okay all right if you're  it oh you put a hole in it to the cables that makes sense is it the world's most elegant solution yes a little bit no if
they wanted that they could have tuned into DIY perk's version of this oh wait he doesn't have one meanwhile he's watching this going you know a bloody boy they I would have done  whoa whoa whoa whoa hold on everyone  second damn that's a mic drop get it cuz it's a microphone I dropped it I probably shouldn't have technically but okay it's as quiet on the open side now as it was on the closed side before now okay I'm going to be about the same  side holy crap we're down to about 40 wow
and it gets even better to prevent hot air from just recirculating inside of our box and encourage fresh air to be pulled in through the front of our baffle and then expelled from the back we're going to add these little foam strips you can use basically anything you have lying around as long as you can pack it in here at the front oh dang no I'm not going to I'm not even going to get a full two pieces in there okay front's all sealed up oh yeah I can feel the flow those fans could end up working
a little bit harder  wow damn I don't even need the decimal  that damn wow we still have some work to do cleaning up the aesthetic we have some ideas involving a vinyl wrap and uh oh I don't know maybe putting the sides here on the edges like we had originally  test that is a flipping huge reduction and we may be even getting to the point where we are below the noise floor of this room hold on I'm going to go around to this corner and then we'll pull the plug and see what the actual noise floor 
here we're below 35 all right kill the  we're still marginally above the noise floor but not by much huge Improvement the question is how much does it impact thermals let's run it overnight and find  out okay  now I mean don't look that close no back up back up wait wait wait we're reacting to how it looks but it's on yep it's on now when I didn't note the scale of this graph I was like oh wow GPU temperature sure went up a lot no but once I saw it yeah this is great half a degree 
this is legitimately as quiet if not better than having your PC in a completely different room okay I had some idea that this was going to work you know way better than we thought it otherwise why would I greenl the project yeah but that's that's insane but this is flipping awesome and all told for somewhere in the neighborhood of $40 to $100 and what's cool about this is this principle can apply to all kinds of noise making things in your life in fact the real inspiration for this was when
we had a Transformer that was on one of our sets a number of years ago and I was looking for a way to quiet it down and I was like oh well could we use like these principles huge difference I just wasn't sure if it would apply to a PC so effectively hey Sebastian check this out this is Sebastian from the creater Warehouse engineering team okay we I am the tallest Sebastian uh we we made a box and you might not be that  ooh and it's gone it's gone that's pretty good he's not that impressed but
he's kind of course The Thermals don't tell us the performance story let's have a look at our GPU clock speeds over time okay that looks pretty darn stable that's great 85 MHz variance now that we know performance isn't impacted it's time to bring our setup into our in progress DIY sound isolation chamber it's not perfect but it's a fair bit quieter than the workshop let's start by measuring the sound floor about 33 I guess you'll just kind of have to take my word for it one of
the things that's in progress is our mount for our deciel meter one moment please all right Jordan want to turn the  Perfect Dude 42 43 DB from a meter away that's a loud computer yeah man you'll even be able to hear this on   everybody back down to barely above the noise floor see the thing is I'd love to just put the meter closer and to do a fudge test you totally can do that we could have done that but technically you're supposed to be like a meter away so in a nutshell
it's way quieter and thanks for watching and check out this message from our sponsor acronis if you run a business your it infrastructure is probably the backbone of your entire operation whether you have one location or multiple locations with aonis cyber protect you can relax knowing that you're covered by Cutting Edge backup security and Disaster Recovery technology all integrated into one platform their lightning recovery is great for multi-side environment and is

looking back on the project if we did this over I'd like to make it a little on the smaller side and I think it would have been worth the investment to go with it even just like a pine project board compared to the plywood that we used then we could have put a little bit of like I don't know Danish oil on it or something it could have looked more like a piece of furniture and less like a piece of debrand skin who make good skins you know anyway if you guys enjoyed this video why not check out the
one where I put a computer in a completely separate room in order to achieve much the same effect this is kind of better
