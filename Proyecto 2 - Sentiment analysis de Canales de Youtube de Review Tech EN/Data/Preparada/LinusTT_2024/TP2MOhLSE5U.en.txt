dude guys you're not going to freaking  out oh my god it works so good my car just went from midlife crisis mobile to midlife crisis mobile that freaking glows today in partnership with bbr we're announcing the most Hightech skin they have ever concocted in three different color ways glow dark and short circuit we thought what better way to show off how flipping cool it is than to wrap my entire car in glow feel cool yet I'm in a Porsche we're going to show you guys how
it works after we show you this message from our sponsor MSI save big on your next laptop with their fall Ready haul sale check out the thin and light stealth a16 AI plus which shines running AAA games thanks to its 4070 GPU and 240 HZ display we're going to have that and  description that was freaking sick I hope I mean I'm past Linus and we still have to wrap the car and we still have to make it Glow fortunately we have Pros to wrap the car at least leaving us with the glow now as you might have already
guessed the new glow circuit skin and soon to be my car are glow-in-the-dark or as the fancy boys would call it phosphorescent a type of photoluminescence say when these kinds of materials are lit up they can become photo excited a process in which photons from the light excite electrons in the material to a higher energy State storing the light's energy it's mine the excited electrons can then either flues or drop to a lower but still excited intermediate level and stay there for
some period of time then with the help of a bit of thermal energy or heat a relaxation can occur allowing the electrons to chill out and release their extra excitement or or energy as photons otherwise known as light or in this case glow so tldr you use light to charge glow-in-the-dark stuff except if you ever been a child you probably remember that when you play around with this stuff the only time the effect really pops is when you supercharge it and then immediately go to pitch Blackness
something that um isn't very likely to happen under normal driving conditions so what can we do the most obvious option would be to just leave my garage lights on all the time that way anytime I wanted to go out for a night drive my car would be fully charged and ready to go here's the thing that Professor Riley left out phosphorescent materials don't react to all parts of the light spectrum equally so if you look at these two flashlights one of them is going to appear brighter when I point both of
them at my glow material you can see that one is obviously more effective replace my garage light fixtures with black lights I'm kidding honey don't kill me my wife lets me get away with a  it so there's a few examples of Ivon putting up with a lot so our goal then is to get as much of the right wavelength light as close to the car as possible ideally without spending a fortune so I did what any San YouTuber would do and bought a whole bunch of different black lights for science tell
me about these agricultural lights you mean grow lights well yeah they daisy chain together they're cheap and they cover a lot of area wow that definitely pops the light color is actually not the same as my other black light the color doesn't tell the full story though well here's the thing traditionally commercial black lights average in the 365 nmet range which apparently is the best for glow-in-the-dark material charging but that assumes the quality control is up to Snuff which one do you
want next do you want the fire hazard sure is this the fire hazard it looks like a fire hazard it kind of feels like a fire hazard well they're individual they don't daisy chain I already found that drawback these are Amazon special I mean oo they're bright they charge well they definitely charge it well the fun thing with this one is leave it going for about 5 minutes and then touch the back I'll plug it in over here and we'll let it sit and do its thing while we talk about
our last lights these look like the point where we finally went let's just buy the brand name ones they've got what looks like adequate cooling the build quality is reassuringly premium including glass fronts instead of just plastic and after that story I read about that event where they lit it up with black lights and they were the wrong wavelength and people had a bunch of eye problems these seem like the kind of thing would trust more but I couldn't help noticing that these are at two
different wavelengths so why don't we start with 395 sure either of these are safe though right yep now this is way more like what I would expect a black light to look like it's got sort of that Bluey purpley Hue but this is supposedly not the ideal no and this the blue comes from being at the bottom of our visible range okay so the next light actually shows up a lot more white because we're not seeing most of it I mean this one still pops okay but definitely not as well as our other stuff what's the 365
look like so it shows up very white interesting buddy and this one is is 100 watt versus 50 watt right okay so what this tells us is that either our other lights are not actually outputting the power that they say they are or they're not outputting at the wavelength that they say they are because that is what it is supposed to look like and with the power they're definitely not do you want check on the cheap one sure oh wow okay it's definitely hot but this thing claims 150 WTS cheap 150
watt better 100 watt I think part of the problem in this demo might be that it's casting more visible light on the vinyl which hides the glow from us the good one is definitely still better let's  Lights the answer is yes so we've got our nailed down but a pre-flight manual charge up process with the car it's a little bit ridiculous so my initial plan for getting the lights pointed at the car was to build a paint inspection Booth style light array after seeing how fast this charges the Skins seemed kind
of silly so the new plan then is to build a single Archway out of extruded aluminum right at the exit of the garage that way when I pull out slowly it'll charge it up we'll do that in a sec first let's take a look at the delivery of the wrapped car dude it looks sick it either just looks like unnaturally white in the dark or it looks green way beyond my expectations it's amazing how much it charges from a distance yeah I think we might have overdone it how many these lights to be byy
11 now I'm thinking you should just Mount them on on the walls in here yeah where's the instructions this is Ikea right yeah it's in my head but it's very simple so we've got a bunch of brackets and we've got a bunch of t-nuts oh those look baller these brackets are going to be what Hold the top to the sides MH and then we've got a bunch of these small ones for things like this just going to pull a bit out of my sack pardon me 11 of these okay why don't I work on that so they're going to go like that this
should in theory just all bolt together and be happy now we did run into one issue the bolts that we were intending to use to mount the lights are too long or rather this materials not thick enough so that when you screw them down they actually bottom out on the aluminum Extrusion and then the light is all floppy so we had to 3D print some little washers to fill the Gap and now it's  screws technically they are the higher quality ones I know did you have a plan for how to actually  know LTT
store.com we pretty much got the entire frame put together and now we just have to see is it sturdy oh that's not bad at all it's not amazing but it's pretty rigid I mean even if you like bumped into it like it's not going anywhere I'm going to start cable managing and what better way to do that than the LTT store Cable Management stuff which I don't have in my hand although it occurs to me that this is aluminum which means we're going to have to mount some of our fancy metal plates
to make them stick we're so close while cable managing our power bars which are using the little uh Keyhole mounts here we've run into another issue the bottom light is too short to reach the power bar if it's on the top it fits if it's here yeah but we want to pop I wonder if I could just open that switch ow yeah I don't know about this Chief the last piece of this puzzle is automating the lights we don't want them to have to like turn it on before he leaves cuz ADHD he won't remember we have two
pieces to accomplish this it looks pretty simple it should be pretty simple but I promise you it's very over engineered this Philips hbe Smart plug it's a zigby smart plug we can control it remotely and this is the everything presents one uh kind of like DIY I think he's a YouTuber that designed this thing it has a passive infrared sensor similar to security systems in your house along with a millimeter wave sensor which is what we're going to be using today this in theory can just sit like right here
and as soon as the car crosses this line boom we don't want like anyone walking through the garage to trigger this thing so I went ahead and set it to 90 CM which is roughly 3 ft oh it's yo you know you are hello you are insufferable watch this and then I'll walk away give me a sec I set the timeouts to zero so it should be pretty quick boom off and if I go over here isn't that crazy so cool all right you can drive the bloody car in now wow this looks incredible you guys cable Managed IT and
everything well you were listening so you know the secret well no I walked in earlier and I triggered it so I know the secret that is freaking awesome cuz I was thinking about it I was like how are we going to make sure that it's not just on all the time and I don't have to manually press a stupid thing that is freaking awesome  Bruh okay did the theory work does it charge the whole car as you go through holy crap it totally works it totally freaking works that is awesome no way
man sometimes you have good ideas all right I know right it was bound to happen eventually like I have seen the car charged this is better oh you could do Shadow paintings on this too do it again do it again do it again dude except under direct Street Lamp lighting it flipping glows like crazy I needed to trigger like a touch earlier cuz it kind of misses the front end but just do that oh yeah no way  well actually maybe we should have hold on wait do we have any other the phones
are you freaking kidding me right now look at this steam deck it looks like it is from a video game look at me casually gaming with my glowing flipping steam deck there's a few different versions there's glow circuit which is the black and glow and then there's short circuit and dark circuit which is the blackon black I know which one I like you might think it's a little bit silly but imagine if you just had like a UV light in your room you're like you're in the gameing
zone you flip on your UV light and now your Xbox looks sick oh man I can't get over the steam deck dude it looks insane let's talk a little bit about the new circuit board drop this is no Normie inkjet printed vinyl dbrand had to develop a custom process just for this drop using special 3D printed UV gel ink to give it a texture you can really feel not just that but that actually in my subjective opinion improves the grip of the device as well while supplies last all orders will include this 365 nmet UV
light so you can charge up your phone whenever you want all you got to do to get it for yourself is head to dbrand.com 49 really is there another vanity Ural ground news does it ever feel like when you read or watch the news that you're being sold on an idea rather than given just the facts well ground news is here to help cut through the nonsense and let you come to your own conclusions they do this by gathering articles on stories from thousands of sources so that you can compare the coverage and
