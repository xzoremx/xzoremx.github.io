as Gamers we're running machines with four eight maybe 16 cores if we're lucky so when AMD launched their first 96 core epic CPU I figured well we're done here that ought to be enough chip for even the most dedicated Potato Head but the Spud Masters at AMD said no and last year launched a 128 cor CPU surely that must be enough right no it wasn't and thanks to Super Micro who sponsored this video I have the brand new AMD epic 9965 a CPU with not 96 not 128 but 192 cores making it alongside its Turin
family members the fastest CPU on the planet by a wide margin we're talking 384 threads terabytes of ddr5 ECC memory 128 Gen 5 PCI lanes and a 500 wat TDP I  I never thought I'd find myself saying only 500 watts of power consumption on a CPU but when you consider that AMD packed 192 cores into the same space they used for half as many just two years ago you got to agree it's pretty impressive I mean sure that's more than my entire first gaming PC but but compared to the king epic at that time
this new chip has double the core count and the same maximum boost clock for real world performance that utterly obliterates it so how did they do it well for starters just like amd's latest ryzen 9000 desktop processors this monster is powered by Zen 5 which comes with a bunch of architectural improvements like NextGen Branch prediction which allows these chips to predict their next move two steps in advance rather than one not to mention with greater accuracy and lower latency
all while increasing cash bandwidth implementing a wider execution path and adding a full 512-bit data path for AVX 512 workloads if all that sounds like gobbley that's fine it boils down to a claimed 16% average IPC uplift from zen4 to Zen 5 in PC workloads and potentially even more for high performance compute and the Enterprise workloads that typically run on servers let's get it installed but wait while 500 W seems downright reasonable for 192 cores it does mean you can't just plop them into
any old chassis and expect it to work you need a compatible bios sufficient Cooling and sufficient power so keep that in mind but it isn't going to be a problem for us today since super micro can build practically anything including this as 2126 HSN hypers server that they provided for this video This Magnificent machine can handle not one but two of "these monsters which is 1,000 watts of" just CPU that's 384 cores 768 threads now typically if you were to buy one from Super Micro it's going to come
preassembled but we went out of our way to take the CPU out so I can put it back in and show you how these new Chips use the same socket as last generation so if you have one you in theory could use it but you are going to want something that can handle more power not every motherboard is going to be rid to handle a 500 W CPU right out of the box you should check your motherboard manual this one purpose buil for this platform so we should have no problems at all M PTM 7950 LTT store.com it's a thermal
pad and actually perfect for this application because it's super durable these things can handle like hundreds or thousands of heat Cycles while barely even losing any of their original performance which is awesome on a CPU this big it's important to make sure everything is tightened down properly so that the CPU actually makes contact with all of those thousands of pins because unlike most desktop CPUs these days the CPU is actually held in by the force of the cooler not by like a little bracket
on top I mean there is a bracket but that mostly just kind of holds it in place while you're tightening everything down order 1 2 3 4 5 6 fully tightened one at a time yeah not a little bit at a time not a little bit at a time which is the conventional wisdom you know no I tried to do that on one of the CPUs and it it actually didn't post look how scary that is gorgeous now while we could have spec this machine with up to "9 terabytes of 6,000 megat transfer per" second registered ECC memory across its
24 dim slots that would have cost um probably as much as my car I think maybe more than both of my cars so I think the 1 and 1 12 terabytes that super micro sent over is going to be plenty for us this is 6400 I heard that AMD is doing like special models with certain providers that support 6400 that's incredible I guess this is one of them that's a big Improvement hold on that means standard server memory is faster than standard desktop memory what hasn't changed from last gen is pcie expansion
we still get 128 or 160 Gen 5 Lanes in single and dual socket configs respectively and this particular chassis can be speced for either eight eight Lane expansion slots or four 16 Lane expansion slots if we have dual width cards they also crammed another 16 Lanes into an ocp 3.0 mezan slot here all of which well most of which we aren't using for now but you definitely could while our hypers server is fairly well-rounded a solid setup for virtualization which we'll show you later or Cloud workloads
where you need a lot of cores and not a ton else aside from memory this chassis is also perfect for high performance computer cute and even AI I mean you've already got the maximum amount of CPU so with the rear slot stuffed with high-speed networking gpus accelerator cards maybe even all three at the same time there's not a lot that a machine like this can't do don't wait today is the last day of our Black Friday and cyber monday deals at LT store grab some of the best deals of the year on
screwdrivers magnetic cable management and more at lg. gblack Friday we're going to have it linked down below what we will be installing now is a few of these 15 TB kokia nvme ssds in the eight slots that each support pcie gen 5x4 funny thing about this chassis by the way if you're building out high performance storage for AI or I don't know something else that needs fast storage maybe with software like WKA it can be configured with up to 24 2 and 1 12 in Drive Bays thanks to the modular
design of the front so you could install an eight drive back plane like this one in each section with a bunch of 30 TB CM7 and you could have over 700 terab of Gen 5 storage in a single 2ou machine that's a theoretical read performance of 240 gbt per second across those drives in a single chassis or more than 330 GB per second if you went with 15s you know we get excited by fast ssds in our gaming systems but when you stack them up together in a stupid fat server like this it's kind of mind-blowing speaking
of blowing if you're speacking 500 w CPUs like we've got or gpus for AI or rendering you uh might actually appreciate the modularity of this chassis and the fact that it doesn't necessarily have all those Drive bays in there because these are some flipping wild counter rotating fans but they're still going to pull air better if they don't have a whole bunch of restriction in front of them so the bottom line is whatever your needs are super micro's hypers systems and the entire rest of
the lineup are designed with flexibility and modularity in mind you ready to put the top on did you look at the power "supplies yet 2,000 Watts 80 plus" titanium two of them naturally what are the odds this boot's first time but those giant sockets even if you do it properly like I don't know this thing same 85% 90 you did it properly yeah but I wasn't here when you put in the other one so waa she's going to go she's going to go these things take forever to post the first time that actually makes sense
think how long your desktop ryzen takes to do memory training the first time well is it up F yeah oh look oh that's great and you doubted well I didn't doubt much I said 85 90% all right can I reboot it uh-oh oh boy I think it's set to Max yeah I think so we should just leave it like that right yeah maybe not optimal speed that sounds more manageable oh thank God oh my God that's oh oh that's downright Pleasant wow now that we know it boots we should probably put a GPU in there right and what better
GPU to go with the oops Top Dog AMD epic Enterprise CPU then a top dog not Enterprise but still awesome Radeon RX 7900 XTX now despite this chassis being well equipped for gpus I mean the power connectors are like right there so they just plug right in and they've got a 2600 wat power supply option that you can upgrade to these slots are meant for full height fulllength workstation and Enterprise gpus not weird shaped gaming gpus so our plan is to put our GPU outside the server with a riser and a 
supply nice Flawless oh my God it Scrolls how much stuff can I do and still maintain 0% utilization could I launch a browser oh I'm sure you can play a YouTube video it's only 1% oh no it's it's at zero again once it settles in and it's doing its thing it's nothing it going to load One Core it's 384 cores it could load two cores and still be below 1% duplicate this tab uh well hold on hold on first I want to I want to try different I want to try different resolutions cuz we're not even at 1080p
yet remember this is this is happening on the GPU CPU Works a little harder it works a little harder CPU is at 10% so I think most of the this is GPU 4K here we go there's like some cores there's one core I see at 9% the rest of them are vibing thriving one might even say okay the GPU is at 77% according to task manager how is that even possible I think it's just cuz it's video decode okay let's disable Hardware acceleration I think this is going to hurt a little bit no 2% yeah
it's going to hurt it's going to hurt so much our memory is 0% too it actually just says 0.0 but I guess to get to 0.1 we're talking 100 gigs I need like a script to to open these over and over again I want to see how maybe we should just revisit that video on this machine how many Chrome tabs we get some more RAM we revisit how many Chrome tabs but we like automate it this time but let's move on let's move on for now uh cin bench do you have R23 so we can see all the little things uh I do but it wasn't
launching oh wow it just does nothing no I know doesn't even try to I looked in task manager and you see it for a sec and then it goes away I think it just doesn't know what to do with this many threats and 2024 is going to be a supreme disappointment what it's thread limited to 256 for some reason I don't actually know why that's it you didn't even say what the score is if that score was my child I wouldn't even speak to it oh what a flipping disappointment get out of my sight you could try blender
ready CPU rendering let's go I feel like this is going to take longer just to prepare the job than to actually render it that's a lot of blue it's a blue screen of success damn 12 seconds she doesn't get much clock speed though does she yeah this is also running with smt on like we're kind of at the point where you have so many cores that I feel like a lot of applications are better off without multi- threading or some might be anyways these CPUs between the two of them have over twice as much cash as my
first gaming PC had system memory like the first one I bought for myself yeah okay cash yeah and these don't even have that much cash no seven zip can't perform that great there's no way it'll go across this many threads CPU threads oh what limited again let's go compare this to Intel's new desktop chips real quick so 7 700 giips "which is 700,000 nips so it's like 3 and" half 9950 X's oh no no no wait wait wait that's B that's kilobytes per second yeah oh I see yeah so we're double the performance but
like okay well now we should play a game on it right sure I mean we have to this is like the worst possible CPU to play video games oh yeah we're at 4K High settings oh man that was cheesy that was cheesy not going to lie okay clearly this is not a gaming CPU I mean it's working for me what can I say no you could probably run if you had enough gpus like 60 instances of Counter Strike at this point dude no though should we do it it's been so long how many years has it been since we've
done many gamers one CPU this time we could actually do one CPU with 192 cores dude that would be crazy yeah we should do it I want to do it here did you know alt f4 makes the game run faster did you know that alt f4 doesn't do jack in this particular no I'm winning I'm winning I'm going to win I'm going to win Jake Jake I'm going to win okay what's next Doom maternal is a good one cuz Doom maternal is actually like fairly multi threaded supposedly here we go horde mode 4K everything Ultra nightmare
motion blur off raate tracing off looks pretty good it's 200 FPS uh yeah wow it actually does use some cores ehy yeah but like I I mean relatively speaking no but that's crazy though it's actually using like 16 cors I feel like but we're running at 200 FPS that means we could run multiple instances of Doom maternal on this thing wasn't the CPU usage at 1% yeah when I say multiple I mean a big multiple all right this actually feels great yeah yeah click things he's almost
dead kill him glory kill use more fuel buddy oh my God you're going to die J oh no oh no oh no leave me alone he called you an arrogant fool quick Glory kill I did it yeah again yeah let's go yeah this is great it's running lovely okay let's do something not stupid on it pass mark would be a good one cuz it'll show us like comparison to CPUs that are relevant I bet you in a lot of cases the numbers that we get running across both CPUs will be the same as running across
one or maybe even worse and that's just software limitations but you would never configure a system like this for a single workstation that's running one t a single workload yeah or at least if you threaded it across all of them you would have them be well aware of the fact that there's two CPUs and the performance degradation you get when you try to cross them yeah and we we're literally off the chart yeah like a lot so nobody else has submitted the CPU yet so let's run memory Mark and then we can
submit it sure and then we can see what it's like compared to other CP all right one of the tests is just how much memory you have I think we're going to do okay on that one yeah maybe okay oh 63rd mid AF the read and the right are going to be strong because we just have "12 memory channels running at 6,400" megat transfers per second click on  threaded oh wait what is that so that's megabytes a second that's how far I have to zoom in to find the highend available Ram let's go yeah we're definitely
winning on that one let's go I think maybe disc Mark we have to do too these kyok ssds are nuts could we be a little bit limited by our low thread speed though oh 100% dude do you remember how many drives we used to have to put together to see numbers like this yeah the crazy thing is like our storage server probably does 20 gigaby a second this is one drive all those drives but this is one drive let's have a look at our compare here so this is last gen this is the one we just tested that's a lot of
generation overgeneration uplift yeah multi-threaded basically 30% on the Dot from what I've read like other applications can be 45% or more well that's what a huge increase in clock speed and core count is going to do for you Zen 5 might have been a bit of a wet fart on the desktop but on the Enterprise side it is anything but this is the result did last night which is finally posted okay "189,000 and this is the master list of" all dual CPU submissions which naturally a lot of AMD in there dude we were so
close to the top of the chart we're very close it's so close kind of infuriating actually okay what is this though that's the 64 core frequency optimized one that's only 64 cores per C okay but up to 5 GHz the first last gen epic setup is all the way down in fourth place "flipping 35,000 points behind us and" those are the 3dv cash ones which are very expensive so that's our last gen "competition right so we're 60,000 points" above that absolutely huge generational uplift 30% as cool as it is to see this
mini course to pack this many in AMD had to design a smaller denser version of their Zen 5 Core called Zen 5c presumably standing for compact because they actually squished the same functional units into a smaller space so unlike efficiency cores you might see in other CPUs they use the same architecture and actually a more advanced process node compared to the full-size cores which pays off in a big way in power efficiency but these compact cores do have drawbacks AMD actually has a handy little visual to
make this easier to understand smaller size but the squishiness costs you in cash and it limits your maximum clock speed so for our many gamers project we're actually more interested in checking out the Epic 9755 sure it's got 64 fewer course but they're the bigger faster cashier ones which is pretty important when you're running that many instances of cod or whatever although with that said Jake the 9575 F sure only 64 cores but if we had two of them running at that kind of frequency
um it may be pretty interesting depending on how many gpus we can get working anyway all of this conversation leads us to a really important point with the diverse use cases that you see in the data center space there's no longer a one-size fits all chip or even core design that can be the master of every workload anyway let's change gears and fire up some more appropriate workloads in Linux we're in Ubuntu the latest one 2410 so very new kernel this is one of those tests that I have a lot
of context for that's actually not that good of a score dang it 60 seconds but here watch this let's set it to only run on our first CPU so we need to just copy that's the cores those are the extra threads copy those and Linux is so easy to do this uh the only tricky thing is we have to tell y cruncher to be smart about it too you can see it's only on num Noe zero yep only using memory on num Noe zero which is important and only using 384 threads which is 1 CPU 47 seconds what were we at 60 before
so we picked up like 13 seconds by turning off one of our entire CPU sockets even sillier let's do just the cores no threads okay damn 42.3 seconds so what we're trying to say is more not necessarily better especially on an application like this which is super memory bound you do not want to be Crossing CPUs unless you absolutely have to okay this is last gen yeah bergo so we go from 60 seconds actually see they tried it with multi-threading and without so we went from 60 seconds which was our 2p time
down to 42 let's do something practical well it might not be practical it is like a relevant use case this is proxmox the hypervisor and we're going to make some virtual machines well that seems very practical yeah just not in the way that I'm going to do it we have all these cores right well I guess we're going to need a few VMS you see what that's doing oh you're just copy pting your VMS I'm a little worried it's going to get upset but I'm how many are you doing like few that's not actually that
silly I mean massive parallelization of light compute workloads that that's actually right in this thing wheelhouse yeah but it's like Windows 11 desktop and and I'm talking like 192 okay yeah no normally it would be like AWS instances or something like like little Linux instances yeah yeah I'm talking like running web services full desktop window okay that's really stupid but will it work we have 384 cores that gives us two cores of em that's not bad it's not great I put the
one image on a raid zero of two of those kyok ssds and they're linked images so if you look at the actual storage usage it should be literally exactly the same as one that's pretty cool usually when you bulk start vmss and proxmox it does them one at a time but that takes too long so I made a script to just do them all at once how's our CPU usage oh yeah it's 15 15% look at the RAM usage climb oh my goodness I think I gave each of them eight gigs or like seven and a half gigs
oh you're running a YouTube video so we made a little script that when the windows instance starts it opens a random YouTube video on a list of like 250 that I popped in there and we run almost 200 100 instances of Windows and play back almost 200 videos with software decoding that is flipping Wild open up task manager on one of these let's see if it's actually struggling cuz it might very well not be sure they're not clocked that high compared to some of the other chips but
there's N5 for crying out loud like once it's running oh once it's running it's not doing that much so I've only given it two real cores allowed them to use two real cores and then it has four in here so it's chilling out remember it's still like booting up it's like indexing windows it's it's probably checking for Windows updates if these all start Windows updates oh my God okay so that's that's not bad no way dude I think it worked are they all on no way this cuz 192 instances of Linux I
don't know if it would be that impress I mean this will be impressive but this is like Windows 11 home Edition it's not stripped down at all I didn't disable anything I literally installed Windows booted it up set the script to load it's not optimized in any way shape or form how's our usage that's not bad dude half of our CPU yeah and of course the io delay 0% shout out kokia when you raid zero2 ssds that can do 15 gab a second each pretty fast bottom line then it's pretty clear that this new lineup of
Epic chips is going to pretty much dominate everything else on the market like I've kind of lost track of the last time any of their competitors had a Fighting Chance in the data center and I think AMD knows it while core for core pricing hasn't changed much in the last couple of generations let me say that another way core for core pricing hasn't changed much so this 192 core chip will set you back nearly "$155,000 at MSRP that means that this" "one computer on its own has $30,000"
worth of CPUs for the right customer where ongoing expenses like data center rack space Cooling and power are the bigger concerns this could be a very compelling value so Props to AMD props to Super Micro who sponsored this video you can check out their hyper servers and the rest of their h14 epic 905 server lineup by checking out the showcases that we did on the super micro Channel which we're going to have Linked In the video description they have some wild stuff like their new flex twins
which stuff eight up to 192 C CPUs in a 2u like this size guys that's "1,532 cores or a casual 37 dish," thousand in a 48 U mindblowing stuff if you guys enjoyed this video why not check out the one we made about our super micro Grand twin and some sick AI video processing Tech that was super cool and I'm kind of wondering are we ever going to deploy that yes nice
