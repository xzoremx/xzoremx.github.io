we did it David's hoarder garage is no more and in its place is "$20,000 of cold hard cash but um you do" still want to play games right so much more than that I want this to be the ultimate gaming Room slome Theater slw Workshop no exaggeration when we're done here I think this is going to be the best upgrade anyone has ever done at our company okay that might be a little bit of puffery sir but I actually do have very high expectations for this set up because there's no sponsor for this
upgrade meaning the tech tips are going to be a bit more practical and also high stakes since every dollar that David put into this came right out of the precious Collectibles he had to sell to pay for it so I think it's time to roll up our  dollars like I'm stretching out this segue to our sponsor proton mail take control of how your data is used online by deg Googling your life and choosing proton Suite of privacy first products you can check them out at the link in 
description this is my house wow I can't believe you guys moved in like a month ago yeah my partner's been working really hard on getting the space set up Priority was getting the booknook sorted wow and it's awesome this is incredible yeah we're very very lucky it's funny my girlfriend has the same problem I had a little while ago she loves collecting things this is a very valuable collection of books they're all like special edition oh reallys like I think this one's like 600 bucks or
something one of these uh one of these tour Edition ones is is that much and like everything is quite valuable on the shelves so oh wow part three of this  collection TV Corner looks great too other than oh I was going to say TV too high but I got the fancy mount it was so hard to install it took me like hours and hours but I also wall mounted the PS5 does it come down more so we can see that n you can see the top cool my only question is what are you going to do here I can see the bones of
some pretty interesting ideas what is the PVC pipe in the corner for we are going to make an RGB Cloud lamp that that a computer will be coming out of before we do that let's get the TV mounted okay I see you went with the LGC 377 in it was the best value olet I could find so per pixel dimming great blacks great motion Clarity for gaming both retro and new stuff right cuz you can throw filters on that and it gets not it's not a CRT and it'll never be a CRT but pretty CRT like it also has four
HMI 2.1 in including the arc Port which means I can use this receiver that has two HMI 2.1 outs for the two TVs that are going to be in here two TVs one's a monitor it's monitor not TV oh man okay okay okay let's go let's go 3 two one there we go oh it's not that heavy okay are you stuck behind the TV David nope you sure I can Crouch you're quite certain you're not St oh this is definitely the biggest TV I've ever owned wow you are going to be pretty close to this hey it's like a movie
theater I feel like there's going to be a pretty stark contrast between what David zeso did and what he's doing here she likes the ideas she won't like the execution now I didn't think you were planning to build a new computer also I couldn't help noticing that this was from the office well I didn't start out planning on building a computer I just sort of got one upgrade at a time until it turned into a whole new computer this looks sick though yeah this is from one of our streams Cherry treent it over and
it was in white which doesn't quite work with the vibe I wanted so I had Justin paint it to a dark gray black uh the aesthetic you got a black Borg Cube PC oh it's so sick and this is like top of the freaking line dude it's pretty close my only question is what's the deal with these bolts coming out the bottom a PC this beautiful doesn't deserve to rest on a desk it deserves to float in the sky and we have a mount for it to be floating and that is the base for it oh boy okay reys do you want to
get started on that wish me luck I will luck but that's not the only computer today no we are building my partner a new computer she's been stuck with my old 7700 K system uh and it's time for her to get something a little more up to date not fully up to date but I mean it's a 7900 XT well yeah the graphics card is good why don't I get to work on her machine great in the meantime I'm going to go help Reese but I want to give you a sneak preview of the extra piece for the Borg PC that uh no way oh
yeah oh yeah you just wait to see it okay that's pretty cool man you get a hand me-- down sop PC from David doesn't seem that bad 3900x 32 gigs of RAM to mount the Bor Q PC and make it sort of look like it's floating we have this piece of metal that we've cut and welded back together it'll drill into studs and then we have built a custom mount for the PC to mount on top and then sort of kind of stick out is not perfect and this color isn't exact match for the wall but I'm going to paint the
wall a Galaxy color editor put up a Galaxy that's what it's going to look like uh and we're going to paint on top of this and make it all kind of more cohesive and invisible you know s is not a brand that we look at very often on this channel but I got to say I'm pretty impressed with the value $80 us for curved glass and four of these fans were already included it's a pretty nice value a less impressive package is this motherboard David for all of his wonderful qualities is not always the
most organized and while I did manage to track down on the back plate I don't have the screws or the brackets for the front which unfortunately I do need thankfully I have the capability of channeling my own inner David and I'm going to steal the screws that he apparently didn't need for his new ring the upgrade today is not going to be complete there's still lots of little projects that are ongoing I started doing these comic book tabletops I'm going to do the same thing on the other
side I have a bunch of Star Trek comic books and I'm going to do a collage of all the Star Trek things that I love uh and I'm going to do a movie One for the console in the middle didn't get done in time uh this one isn't even finished but it gives you an idea of what it will be like in the future oh sorry I was leaned down here to do a shot to figure out what I'm going to do about Justin not including the AMD standoffs it looks like these zga 1700 ones will work in a pinch it'll
just be a little bit tight and then I saw what David did to the poor SSD that's in this m.2 slot there's going to be a lot of improvisation today guys cuz while the height of the 1700s is okay they don't fit over these posts so I'm going to have to drill them out I don't know i' got to fix that SSD BRB not going to lie David between you and Justin that computer is going to be the death of me oh oh what's the odds you have a vice uh zero okay I'll hold it by hand what are the odds you have a drill
and a bit that's a little bigger than this pretty good actually all right let's do it what could go wrong ow ow ow oh if I spin it backwards and I can just kind of melt it in there oh dude buddy that's sick they almost contact the standoffs almost which is exactly what we want we want a little bit of kind of spring pressure on these oh yeah dude we're good H what a relief I'm very curious if you can figure out what this is for it's a door yeah but it's not it's a climbing wall for a really really small 
bin oh controller wall magnetic controller wall no uh oh the idea is that this is going to cover that breaker panel but I still need to access it and so it's going to be on a barn door so it can slide in out of the way eventually it'll be painted black to match rest the wall the vision's great EX why APC blocks because what do you want to cut all these blocks this is the easiest cheapest way to get a bunch of little blocks that are identical David question for you yeah
how essential would you say front USB is for my partner quite essential cuz that's what she knows to plug into okay how essential would you say these fans are absolutely not cool cuz well I think you see the problem yeah that's not what that out now what I did didn't tell David cuz I do have another idea this housing on this thing is huge I think it could be trimmed what am I thinking this is really stupid are we going to get it it's really tight um I think we're going to get it don't
take this the wrong way but the whole spending your own money thing I wasn't expecting to find argb cables they were really cheap to find really cheap 40 bucks each yeah oh oh that's Canadian oh okay that's actually not B it was like 37 something each so if they work then uh great I mean they look like they should work honestly the space is okay it's still rough but it's it's starting to look like I can see what you were going for it's the vision yeah which is something there's still a lot of
something left though what's up with that cable management L what the heck yeah look this side looks pretty good that looks amazing okay but there's a lot of finishing touches that still need to go in like there's one motherboard screw in I just need to see it post before I do everything I have very little confidence that this is just going to immediately fire up I have high confidence not only in your ability to do amazing PC work but the fact that this was a PC that was
working yesterday well that's going to make me feel even worse when it doesn't fire up thanks David okay NE may not okay all the RGB works I was not sure if that was going to happen um and I'm not getting an output oh well um might need batteries oh it might need to be plugged in [Laughter]  uhoh let's try again with a thing just kind of oh it might be giving us a no keyboard error do you have a keyboard uh yes I've got a new keyboard for this video oh oh oh nice nice okay David
isn't even back yet but we already know that that was the problem everything's detected even the bent SSD so I think I'm good to button everything up and close this out oh this actually ended up looking kind of cool don't tell anybody I said that though is there going to be something  the table will be here they basically makes it to here David to his parents can we get lonus to drop things no we have Linus at home I think I've dropped more stuff in recent videos than you 
them hot glue what else St what else would you use epoxy yeah but then I could never get it off I want to basically 3D scan and like print something that's going to fit better and be flat cuz none of these are flat so none of them stay super super well so this is a temporary solution okay we should just put a crash pad under the door then I'm a man of vision this isn't a crylic Mount hey yeah is that a good idea I don't know I I had Justin make it cool okay where does it go onto this
so we're going to just this yeah no no she's close she's close she's real close yeah yeah she's going to go she's going to go she'll she'll catch okay wait oh yeah this has got a PC in it the thing about PCS is the weight distribution not even so she wants to go this way which I mean um how are you planning to hold the heads of these bolts while you screw in the nuts watch me uh you're going the wrong way oh yeah you're trying to take it off okay um oh God oh gosh I mean I don't want to tighten
it too much it's acrylic but I don't want to tighten it too little cuz it's a  flex can you see the flex in this Andrew okay stop stop stop I haven't heard any acly cracking so that's good okay giant Crash Pad there will be a desk right here it's going to be it's going to be low oh okay so the thing that I'm most excited about in this entire upgrade is this incredible work that Justin did on this Starship Enterprise model look at this thing that looks awesome custom paint job he did
like battle damage I didn't know he was into that stuff oh he wants you to know that he's into this stuff he he likes this stuff I want to see like plof versus Justin like uh like battle battle damaged armor paint off now have you seen some of plof stuff too oh it's so good this is crazy this looks incredible oh buddy oh that is so cool so this is like I guess so here's the part you're not going to like  stand oh God it's adding even more weight to this side David wait okay I'm
going to pitch him I'm going to pitch him something else okay um we're going to we're going to try and Comm in David to let us have it come off the shelf we could even do it in the top surface so you wouldn't even see it David we're not letting you do it what are you going to do we're going to drill a hole in the top of this shelf sure that's mine oh okay I'm easy uh okay um one drill please uh should we glue it into the Enterprise first absolutely okay hold on don't pinch just yet then cuz I want to
check the angle for this so we were thinking kind of like that right yeah okay so with that in mind it's time to pinch and now we play the waiting game for his theater setup David's using kind of a mish mash of older speakers so we just need to take a quick look and see what the rated impedance of these is so we can tell his receiver how hard to drive them uh Unfortunately they don't seem to Shay wait we could save ourselves some trouble do you have a multimeter I don't have a multimeter oh I have a voltage
chest I don't know if it does any I don't think it does it yeah that's not going to do that no multimeter huh cuz then we could just um find out the impedance it's probably 6 ohms so what happens if it's not does it just blow up um Spectacular One Way is much more worser than the other way and I forget right now do you want to find out uh yeah I'll find out no by doing I'm saying but there's only I mean yeah how married to you are how married are you to these speakers they're old hand-me-downs from 15 years
ago okay well we're going to go for gold then six ohms or higher I think it's okay what about the rears those are probably labeled right they I think they  names what yeah just know I mean we promised people this was going to be a more frugal practical Tech upgrade the speakers they at least have names you know yeah that's that's the bar there we go oh hey DM 100 that's right we don't have a multimeter but we've got a model number we got a multi reader he can read letters and numbers
is crazy these are eight ohm okay so that means it's six or higher the six or higher setting will be fine for these then these are the real Tech tips though you know hacking together whatever it is that you've got lying around and doing it in a way that's safe and doesn't blow anything up I like a little bit of blowing up okay so we're safe to continue with the receiver Setup Wizard I'm not getting any test tones are you guys sure you hooked all this stuff up right nope uh yes
what did you do David the wrong way no no that's that's fine for now I don't think I haven't done anything yet all I did was move these connections from the bottom to the top which shouldn't matter that's all I did oh reys when were you going to mention you haven't plugged those in yet what what do you mean you I mean I'm sitting here going oh the front's working but the surrounds not it clearly says they're  know okay get the best Sur by using the attach microphone yes I'd like to
calibrate now uh before I do that though I was thinking maybe we revisit this let's do it and we were thinking here yeah what's uh what drill do we need I said call her a drill they're children go get the drill  now yeah buddy okay I think that's good here we go you guys ready I think we should epoxy yet Moment of Truth oh buddy let's go that's so cool okay oh man we actually got we nailed the angle on the epoxy thing you see that as soon as I stuck it in there it didn't move at all so we've actually
got the weight kind of distributed correctly and then we can what we can I've got some black zip ties upstairs I'll bring them and then we can use those to Anchor to the to the pool here I'll be right back okay okay it was worth it it was worth it David I agree are we ever going to like maybe show your so her like new computer yeah is she here right now she's here right now all right it's not done done there's  okay it's so pretty it's rainbow I don't know what any of those
things do but I love them no I love it  yay we wanted to play some retro games cuz like you know David was going to like emulate retro games because you know he had to get rid of all of his consoles to pay for the the space but um apparently all of his Linux isos were on a raid array that died yeah you don't have a single retro game not currently well wait what did okay well you kept a couple consoles yeah okay well then we can play a game well then we don't have the filters yeah I I have a retro 4K I
only have the 5x though I don't have anything guys I don't have anything nothing I got nothing well I mean it's still a cool setup but we have to yeah we have to play a pixel game what filters do you like it depends on the screen I like the scale 2x ones you there's like a scale 3x or 4X the HQ hq2x actually is one of the ones I like really yeah I know I thought you I thought you were some kind of purist that looks terrible I love CT because they make smooth so I got an all that into
smooth oh man David you just lost all your Retro Gaming street cred in one move no do you know what would be lame is if I bought into what other people thought looks good I have my opinion my perspective and I bring that to everything I do including the filters I  me you know this might not be as big of a collection anymore but when you think about the quality per game G that we're looking at here now I like it better it seems more focused this is a sick collection I got
to say this is looking mighty fine in here it's not perfect uh as per usual my vision is huge my execution is okay but with the help of my friends I think we did a pretty amazing job so if you guys are all paid friends to me then what am I to you you know what I think the people can see where you're going with this all it needs is what like an area rug or two a little couch a little spit shine this is sick dude are you going to miss the Fidelity of the original consoles though
it's going to take me a little while to adjust I can tell that the input leny was off uh and it didn't feel quite right to me but I think it's something I can get used to and it's something that I can adjust and research and tweak uh and I'm very excited for the emulation of later consoles as well you know like PS2 PS3 this is about where we had the mic hey David y okay here we go oh I'm so excited I haven't had a good home theater setup you know what maybe ever not this good for sure this if you're
going for full immersiveness is a great size for this space for movies this isn't too big yeah I'm a little anxious for games but I don't think it'll be too bad well there's always that one there exactly choices you know we did this video recently so I don't really need to talk about it a ton but a cobbled together random ass Facebook Marketplace speaker setup is so vastly Superior to an entry level or even a mid-range Soundbar that that's just what everybody should be
doing if you're in the no and you don't mind baffing about with inputs this crushes what like any soundar you would have bought for this price crushes it I don't know man I think you might have nailed it hopefully you guys enjoyed the transformation almost as much as David did and hopefully you'll enjoy the this segue to our sponsor proton mail did you know that sneaky email trackers in your inbox can tell senders and advertisers what you read what you clicked and even follow you around the web well with
