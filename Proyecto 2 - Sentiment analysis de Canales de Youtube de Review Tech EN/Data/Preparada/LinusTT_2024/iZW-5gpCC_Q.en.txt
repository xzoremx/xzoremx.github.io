what the hell is this it's my TV except it's got a different model number it comes with a stand this time and I don't have to give my phone number to the CCP to turn it on come on man in all seriousness it's coming to North America Q3 Q4 which is a great thing because  and so this is what Fire's remorse feels like I've only had my TV for like 3 weeks and now high sense goes and announces the new 110 ux a drop dead gorgeous giant format TV that has twice "the advertised Peak brightness 10,000"
nits and twice the number of local "dimming zones 40,000 zones I mean okay" it's five diagonal inches smaller which my wife says is a lot but good Lord does it ever do a lot with what it's got the big highlight for me is the contrast when high sense abandoned their efforts to bring their dual cell technology to the consumer Market I was honestly concerned for their future competitiveness OLED was riding high and it seemed like many LED TVs would forever suffer from blooming and light
bleed between the brightest and darkest parts of the scene but on this set the onp paper size of each of these dimming zones is somewhere between a quarter and half an inch in practice the veiling glare in the human eye is going to be your limitation not the contrast of the TV what's not a limitation for me is my ability to segue to our sponsor headphone juice is not something you should be proud of these are your typical headphones that accumulate heat while you game e Wicked cushions add a
cooling gel to their cushions to keep your ears sweat free you can easily replace them on your headset check out wikied cushions and the link below even getting up close guys and masking off a bright object I can barely make out any bleed it's crap I think it might actually be better than the TCL I just bought which is really impressive because that thing "also has 20,000 dimming zones now I" would hesitate to say that it's as good as an ol I mean surely nothing can match
the Blackness of powered off but I will say good Lord is it ever close I mean of course we're going to need the labs team to put it through the paces properly before I can say anything for sure but what I can speak to today is the brightness considering that this event exists almost entirely so that every vendor in the world can show off their brightest TV to people who care about that it's kind of hard to stand out but even under the worst possible conditions there is no word for this but dazzling
give me some bright oh now I'll be the first to say that some of the previous stuffiness Wars your thinness your bezeless and even your high resolution got kind of silly I mean 8K is at maybe even already beyond the limit of what's useful for a TV but I don't feel the same way about the current brightness war with the right content more nits is more better at least for now because it contributes not only to the Natural appearance of highlights like sun glinting off of
shiny objects but it also contributes to the volume of colors that it display can achieve on that note high sense is claiming 90% coverage of the W 2020 color space which is on par with Samsung's claims about their latest generation QD oleds which frankly blew my socks off when I saw them in person in both cases this is thanks to recent advancements in Quantum do color enhancement layers that now have us at just around 69% of the range of human Vision which I think we can all agree is
pretty nice I just thought it would take a lot longer to get here this set features a native 144 HZ refresh rate 4.2.2 audio Wi-Fi 6E an atsc 3.0 tuner and high sense is even hoping for power consumption that is similar to their 85 in model though they did specify that they are not willing to compromise on brightness in order to achieve that so they weren't willing to quote a figure at this time and that's far from the only information missing from the show floor here that's that's the only sign
they have for this thing Hisense is not quoting supported HDR standards average pixel response times input latency or even a price but if it ends up anywhere near the same neighborhood as the TCL 1150 in I can imagine a lot of dentists doctors or other professionals struggling to load one of these into their cyber truck in the Best Buy parking lot if you want some help visualizing that we've got extras from the TCL unboxing at lm. g/f floatplane we'll have that link down below of course by the time you're
spending that kind of money I could understand the temptation to spring for the Original Gangster that's right the Samsung the wall is getting an update for 2024 and is now available in five different sizes 76 in 89 in 101 in 114 in and of course the monster behind me the 140 in version now this is very unfortunate Samsung has basically no information about this thing whatsoever so I can only tell you based on my eyeballs that the color gamut does look bigger than what we saw last time around
and in particular the brightness looks much brighter than the Thousand n Peak brightness that we saw on the last generation of course in order for us to tell you for sure we're going to have to you know get our hands on one for testing uh Samsung uh if you're watching we'd love to check that out but one thing I'm sure they're not going to be sending to us is this I just have no words for their microed transparent display now we've seen transparent displays before particularly oleds but
the difference here is that microed pixels are so so tiny that's a big part of what gives them their pitch deep blacks and because they're so small they don't get in the way so not only is it vividly bright in a way I haven't seen before but it's transparent in a way that I haven't seen before like it looks like a window except there's a screen on it I don't even know how we would test something like this so yeah not even going to worry about that what I will worry about is this message from our
