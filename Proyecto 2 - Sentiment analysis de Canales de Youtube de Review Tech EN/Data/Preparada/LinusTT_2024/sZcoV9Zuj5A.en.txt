you know we had a whole intro plan for "Elijah's $5,000 AMD ultimate Tech" upgrade and then I walked through the door and I'm like is that cat pee and also why is there a gigantic bag of discount no-name potatoes Welcome Home the crazy cat lady Vibes are so strong yeah I have three that's why I bought an automatic litter box the good news is the way Elija likes to put extra holes in things should make this the fastest upgrade ever if if you know what I mean oh that's not my fault please don't
break my house in all seriousness though his setup is already pretty good like we could be out of here by lunchtime all he wants to do is improve his streaming stuff so bit of a faster computer there and some new webcam there and what is that pile why do you have a Minecraft mini fridge that's just for decoration I'm also building a brand new Nas moving my current computer into another case building a brand new gaming system we're  and oh and I did get that litter robot
this is going to be an issue it's 10:37 we've only got minutes till your shift ends well we better get going I can claim overtime thanks AMD  AMD is here again to give you guys a chance to win one of three Rog Alli X's with Final Fantasy 16 powered by one of amd's best mobile chips the Alx is perfect for gaming on the go especially with its 80w hour battery all you have to do is head down to the description and follow the link for your chance to win thanks AMD for sponsoring this
series before we get started find oh man there is so much to unpack in here did you not realize you had a Funko Pop problem when you started needing to put them sideways to fit them on your wall like you kept buying them also more importantly why do you hate Apple Jack what do you mean where's Apple Jack I couldn't find Apple Jack these are really tough to find by the way excuses oh my goodness any true collector would have Applejack that's true all right I'll buy it on eBay no no
I'm is joke oh I don't want to be judgmental here but you waste so much money on what the is this these are I know what they are you you were asking I was trying to help I thought you didn't know I know what an amido is and I know how much they cost yeah no wonder you have to steal things from the office I have stolen nothing really like this uh that was a gift from from who from Ryan and Creator Warehouse thanks Ryan I don't know if he paid for it and this that one I paid for I used
my employee budget okay there's no way you actually bought a belfine keyboard that has got to be the one from short circuit I bought it before I found out we were getting one for short circuit you bought a bathwater keyboard I have good reasons my keyboard was breaking I like collector's edition things and I wanted a keyboard in that color scheme "it was great it was a good deal 1,000%" stoen well that's it's all part of the upgrade it's like backup stuff just in case we don't need it or we do need it you
know but yeah stolen like he went and took these off of our set deck so he could have the limited edition ones they were in the generic bin "backup I bet $1,000 they were in the" generic Vin I paid for every single one of those this has never been for sale I found a black shaft in a bin when we were allowing employees to make custom screwdrivers and I took it cuz it's a number two pencil see got the lead yellow yellow and pink for the Eraser this is just the stuff he had on
display no you're not allowed going in there I'm I'm dead serious wife will don't you dare wife will kill me please don't I'm not look I'm not looking okay Taylor will crack the whip yeah she's scary oh my God two whale plushies there's no way uh yeah I paid for one uh-huh why do you have mini PCS oh those are from my just on display those are for my old job I tried to make a cluster out of nucks and I I was going to call it the cluster knck but I never got to it I had like 10 at one point oh
my God there's more Funko Pops yeah you need to stop I have like how much does that cost last I checked it was like 180 Canadian I think we need to do a David style intervention with him no no please I mean I could pay off like every ounce of debt I have if I sold them you should not own Funko pops and debt well no it's it's for when the building burns down I'm waiting for the insurance payout are they even insured yep well I have home insurance on the the content in the home
and like it you know it you know it it's part of L it's it's okay we have three computers to build mhm I was thinking we could give Colin the nas he could just kind of work on it on the counter back there I think he's capable and then you and me can fight over who builds the brand new gaming PC or has to transplant that computer I'm not fighting you okay which one would you like to do I hate your case so much he came to a land at my place he brought this stupid thing takes up like half the
table so often I want to ask like what's wrong with you don't answer that okay I was going to say it's going to be a while yeah like you have a razor chair who buys this look at it it's so broken the metal is shearing I will fall over and it will break one day you know it's bad for your back hey yeah it's fine I'm buying a new chair next month I was already 2K over budget so I couldn't fix uh a chair into it drop a like on this video and leave leave a comment if you think it's time for Elijah to sell his
Funko pops while they're still worth anything get himself an ergonomic chair and pay off his Funko Pop debt well since you hate that case so much I think you should transplant I'll transplant the gaming PC I will build a new one we're giving call in the NZ calling you good he's good yeah okay cool and then what are you doing I'm going to build the brand new gaming PC why do you need two gaming PCs well cuz that one's becoming a dedicated capture SL streaming PC and then I'm building a brand new
gaming PC so it doesn't have to deal with the overhead of streaming you already have a capture card yeah but this one does two inputs so because I'm getting a new camera Sony zve E10 which HDMI please tell me with the amount that you're spending on streaming stuff that you actually make money at it yes the amount that I'm over twitch this year has covered it essentially all right there you go oh my God don't don't knock over dream machine don't knock over my Bel doine mouse
pad here Colin I would ask you to help him but I think he's sort of beyond that are these refurbished hard drives uh I stole them out of my old client's server they're like from 2012 they were recycling it I was like hey they're perfectly good 4 terabytes editor can you roll the clip where he said how much stuff he stole I have stolen nothing that was a gift I found a black shaft in a bin this is borrowed yeah I have a third one too but yeah stolen oh my God since this is just the gaming PC 7800
x3d basically like the fastest gaming "CPU right now until maybe 9,000 Next 3D" chips but we'll wait and see it's all going to be sitting on this b650 auror Elite ax you spent too much on your motherboard I did but it has 2.5 gig land which is what I want because I'm going to get a 2.5 gig switch down the road as well as the io is freaking just stacked on this thing so I'm that's why I chose it I went with gskill "Flare X5 ddr5 Ram running at 6,000 cl30" I don't know 32 gigs total that's more
than enough for a gaming PC right your upper lip sweats when you get nervous yes you called out my sweating in the last video there was not a small amount of comments were like how dare you call out a human for sweating lonus dude there's no way you're sweatier than me anyway I went with the two terab Kingston nv2 this is taking forever yeah well I'm working on it bucko and then the Assassin x 120 refined okay cooler  it remember how we gave Logistics crap in shad's upgrade for the cover
falling Jamie said I put the socket cover on and then the date I noticed you didn't mention your GPU I assume that means you're going to keep using the one from the old rig yeah that's doing all of like the encoding for Twitch streaming wait well why do you have a secondary machine then What GPU you're going to have in there you don't have a GPU I bought the the yesen Sarai 7900 XTX this was $150 more than a normal 7900 XTX it's really pretty I hope you've enjoyed how much the audience has
loved you up until now that's fine they're cuz they're going to hate this you know what that's fine yeah even our camera I was going to wait for you to figure it out like brother it's going into a rack mounted computer that doesn't even have a window I'll know about it look how pretty that looks it's pretty oh pretty unnecessary oh my God God they put a window over the pass through heat sink finnage so this fan can't blow straight through the card yeah it can no it can't
well it just get stuck at what point was I such a bad role model for you uh no hit me again what do you mean by wobbles it doesn't wobble what are you talking about well it was like drooping I think replacing this is a phenomenal waste of money I don't think it'll fit also yep you're replacing it I do need one of the ssds out as well oh sure because I'm dual booting on my main gaming PC oh really are you going Linux Linux is going to be my daily but there's a handful of games that I still use that
require anti-che and so that's going to have the windows drive and because it's a dual streaming setup I can reboot this computer without having to worry about the stream going down nice yeah okay that's pretty cool this is so overkilled dude you've got 32 gigs of ram in here yeah a freaking 12 core processor yeah well that was my main gaming PC like like you could have flipped some of this stuff and gone with something more modest well no no that wouldn't be the Elijah way yeah never sell anything
exactly where's your back plate for this I'm going to need that let me go take a look all right the man who keeps everything accept his mounting hardware new plan the PC will be powered by cat Monty you're so cute here's our plan okay I install the old cooler again but I do it properly this time and then we just have a gap in the rack and it has no top panel installed I'm fine with that that's actually what I was going to suggest so I hate that so much yeah well it's better than someone driving back to the
office I haven't even commented on the fact that his TV is on that wall and his couch is on that wall how the do you watch TV like that so like is this how it's normally like this I moved out of the way just for the shoot sure I well I also have a VR headset we could set it up today you want then I have VR room but that's way over scoped we're already building three computers it's not like you need a room scale experience for what you're doing in it where's this tissue box stop bet it's I
bet it's right there stop I have a wife I don't need to actually don't leave that in my wife would my wife would fing kill me no you dare leave that in oh you've got the Precision that actually would be a more appropriate where did where did the screwdriver go I was like so scared for a second this is Kyle's personal so I got so worried uh Hey where's the mounting hardware for your case oh that's in the server rack oh my God I completely overlooked the server rack Facebook Marketplace $100 liking these
cases pretty simple this is the same company that made that Cerberus little matx gaming saem that I have right sliger yeah that's yeah they they have multiple depths as well and different like options so you can actually get ones with 5.25 bays and other front IO and stuff I went with these because my server rack is pretty shallow so this is the shallowest they make this case and they actually don't sell Pink as one of the options oh they reached out and they were like hey we've been wanting to send
it to someone does the person who's getting the upgrade want it and I said hell yeah man these guys really don't mess around with the number of screws they include with this case look at this uh I need a power supply what am I using the old one oh right you're putting a 1200 WT 80 plus Platinum power supply in a freaking second AR computer I need the I want to make sure that this one never fails this one can't fail actually do you know which one did fail we just published the
labs result for the one that's going in the NZ and it failed both stopped functioning before we completed our tests so we cannot recommend it oh hey there we go nice now I've got enough room for your stupid Overkill power supply honestly hanging out with Elijah makes me so much more offended by just the exploitative sales tactics that companies use to get people to waste their money mhm I have this is who they're exploiting the face is this and the name is Elijah C for you am I
putting the Elgato card in here no you we are putting where'd it go the a media one okay so I'm putting the live gamer duo in yeah okay it's got two inputs one can do 4K 60 or in my case 1440p 120 and one we'll just do 1080p60 which is perfect cuz for my webcam basically perfect I'm pretty close to done this build I guess they didn't include any fan screws though right just about to put in fans well just zip tie them that's what Colin's doing what no yeah just take the lean Lee ones and zip tie them but no
those are I thought you were telling me take the lean Lee ones to get the screws from them no no no why are all of your fans zip tie cuz I didn't have any [Laughter] screws I'm getting that weird head I get where like I'm light headed from how stupid something is like that's a special headache Elijah you're welcome I also got these two 27in Dell monitors they do 75 HZ 1080p these are just going to be for my streaming computer on the side so that way I can like watch OBS
and chat so then I will take my current monitor situation and I have another similar stand that we're going to do on the other side so then I'll have five monitors total I have all the screens it booted oh you finished with the nas perfect it does does have display ports "but the CPU that's in here the 5,500" doesn't actually support onboard Graphics so we're not going to be able to get a display on it but I did pre-install the SSD it's configured so once we connect Network to it we'll be able to see our
nashar but we can see at least if it boots up oh she so we got our fan filter nice these will definitely stay dust and cat hair free or at least they would if this was going to have a top on it well we're going to just lay the top on top like we just like yeah okay are we putting this in there or what yeah Elijah are you going to put any of the PCI covers in no I don't it's extra air flow no it's going to take so long take some pride in your work Mama Mia that's a spiciest
spaghetti oh my God it looks so bad back here so these are all the peripherals for my streaming PC so like my stream deck my go XLR there look how much more quality that looks it's going to be in the server you're not even going be able to see it use zip ties to install your fan so that's all we need to know about you okay where does this one go on the bottom that goes on the lower one y she's at bottom do you need help um let's say no I said no I'm sorry there we go there
you go it's got a little she's a Lippy boy no move your hands move your hands you don't want your hands in there wow look at that you can fit so much computer in this bad boy okay where's the next one come plus no  C done you're get didn't you adopt more cats recently I have five now holy like I said I have some collections myself isn't that a great pink this is a great pink move your hands it was in oh totally scraping my paint thank you hey now we're racking boys time for the navs Colin you closed it
up well we got we got to show the people what's ins if he wasn't so funny all the things he says I don't think we'd put up with having him around that's true goon cave I thought we took the pin back how'd you get it I blame you I don't know wait you didn't hook up all your backplane that's fine I only have eight available because of this LSI card okay so this is really practical then you can get LSI cards that could do four of these cables to do 16 drives this does 10 3.5s and 4 2.5S right so you should
gotten one of those then I should have you need another fan these cards are not designed to sit here with absolutely nothing on like they got a little heat sink on them because they are expecting to be in a server or workstation with a lot of airf flow you need a fan here okay well good thing I grabbed the noons oh shoot I used them all uh solve your problem thank you what is this one it's from your air cooler that we didn't use oh okay cool a realistically steal more fans from work don't do that Alex gave
me permission Alex doesn't own them he's in charge of the inventory he's in charge of protecting the inventory so he knows what he can let slip by do you want to know what he sold me well I have two computers now right so that would in turn mean I need two keyboards and two mice this is why he doesn't want me going into that room so I bought the original belfine keyboard kit from inventory um so you have two of them now well yeah I have one of each she looks all innocent but she's a predator you
know that right why she Praise on well people like you that's fine I'll take it there that's kind of like yeah that's good enough it's good enough I swear he puts more time and Research into things when he like produces videos for you guys he cares a lot do you remember our first video nope what are you planning to store on this I shouldn't ask actually forget it forget I asked no I no you stream that you don't need to store that on hard drive yeah exactly I also record a
backup of every stream because you can record out of OBS at a higher bit rate than twitch allows you to upload to so then you get a higher quality source file look at that they don't go all yeah this is as far as they go uh no I'm so triggered right now okay fine then just  this oh no had you considered a KVM I considered it I didn't like the idea of it I wanted the second Bel doine keyboard a KVM would have allowed him especially one from Wendell those are super cool they'll do like quad monitors
off of a single one so you can just switch between the computers and have the same set of peripherals monitor keyboard and mouse for both of them uh but instead he'd rather clutter up his desk with more eirl merchandise yeah we need networking but I bought the dream machine SE oh that's cute foam yeah it's actually cool I like it how cute their foam is it's the cutest foam yeah I unironically play with it for 5 minutes at work when I unboxed the it acts as an NVR so you can have
security cameras and all that it acts as a router it acts as a switch um it acts as a UniFi controller so you can add any UniFi devices you like without needing a cloud key or anything like that and it needs some ears yes where's your ears at right here where do you want it top uh right here nice look at that all right for $100 I think it's a pretty good  yeah ow this you'll be proud of UPS yes I am proud that you have a UPS minus treat treat this with some respect dude dude
oh I'm taking this now do it do it yeah yeah yeah yeah did you know he had this no I had no idea I'm giving it to Andrew I didn't know I had it Elijah you actually can't steal stuff from work I didn't know I had it what do you mean you didn't know you had it I probably choose your next words carefully I probably had it in my backpack cuz we went on a shoot where we needed it and I probably took it out of my backpack and forgot about it 100% I was thinking about criticizing
his headphone choice but now I just don't have the energy anymore what what's wrong with it they're basic yeah that's why I bought them do you know what I was using before for the money you wasted on gamergirl crap you could have really nice headphones honestly I'd rather use in ear these are $12 jbl's I'd rather use them they're really uncomfortable have you ever worn these for an extended period time do you have anything nice to say like why do you come into everyone's house and
immediately criticize everything no I'm not criticizing that you're on a budget I'm saying that for the money those cost they weren't that expensive 110 us all right for the money those cost you could have something legitimately comfortable they are comfy I find them comfortable and that won't fall apart well yeah that I don't know they'll no I do know okay well just buy new cups from Wicked cushions but now they don't cost 110 anymore do they oh I'm going to save money by heating my
pool with my computer that way I save money also line is literally floods his entire server room so he has to buy new computer gear okay no no no no I made money I made a video about it and I will stream one of the streaming angles I set up yeah is so that you can like kind of watch the living room we call that the FNAF cam or the Five Nights at Freddy's camera uhhuh which is why I got the poe powered dream machine so I can put UniFi cameras nice and have them everywhere
right how many monitors are you plan to I'm going to have five well where do these ones go on the other side why do you need two on a secondary PC one for OBS and one for twitch why are you using your g502 well because that's my favorite Mouse well then why did you buy a Bel deline Mouse well it came with the set well why don't you sell it then because comes with the set so I'm not going to break up the set what I actually don't think that looks very good what what the mouse pad or the
keyboard I'll let you guys tell them what's wrong it's like a colorblind guy and did your interior design I like this this is looking good I just don't know what to do I don't understand what goal we're driving towards here he keeps saying we're doing a great job but I it feels like we're doing something illegal so now we need to do all the streaming stuff do you want to install my new camera sure okay grab my camera and grab the Elgato wall mount yes sir we're going to remove this foam panel we
are and that's where the camera can go wow oh there's there's an extra hole in the wall who to thunk it while he's finding a stud finder we've got the Elgato wall mount and a zv E10 which I have no idea anything about other than that it's a Sony camera and it comes with a lens and it's probably pretty good probably overkill for streaming and it does 4K I got my drywall anchors time to put some  change okay do you have a  "okay $88,000 worth of Funko Pops no" Hammer oh oh I got a hammer let's all 
go you use this to hammer something in  it yeah buddy all right Elijah we got this I know we do I've been confident the whole time hey I get it whole time because this is a lot of power in the rack I'm drawing from two outlets so I'm bringing a power bar all the way from over there and we're going to use our MCM just mounted up under the desk here these are the Key Bar holders hey magnetic Cable Management let's go lcg store.com baby I only got three of the anchors in without destroying them so
this last screw is just cosmetic nice that's pretty good oh yeah buddy hey not bad not bad uh do you have a power adapter for that because I don't want the battery to swell up I actually bought a dummy battery off of AliExpress nice so then this will just go in there yep just to a USB which I have a wall wart somewhere that will plug in perfect and then there you go go I don't ruin my nice battery nice I need the HDMI from that camera mhm so that's just a mini HDMI to a full
HDMI that's going to that a media capture card M mhm one thing that's really important with these micro HDMI connections is that you have some kind of strain relief on it we don't want the weight of this cable just hanging off of this connector because it will die it's not it's not if it's when um so what I'd like to do is zip tie these guys onto the mount once we've got it kind of locked in and then that way the the weight can hang off the zip tie putting Elijah's second graphic keyboard on his
desk by the way there's almost certainly going to be stuff in this video that will not make the YouTube cut especially in light of us having one of our videos pulled recently so uh lmg Dogg flat plane Riley week is coming up do you have flesh Cutters at least I really do have my special headache though that I get from things being too stupid these scans like you  you think if I wanted to make a limited edition stupid keyboard I couldn't yeah but you'd spend four years developing it
and call it the keyboard that one was personal okay I think that's everything plugged in other than power what did we even upgrade today what do you mean added another keyboard and a mouse that's it and two monitors a really nice camera this oh yeah we did a lot today yeah should we try and fire it up what suppos OD do you think they work yeah exactly tell me if I'm running you over you're good you're good okay you can probably stop keep going okay I'm plugged in oh there we go hey there we
go see those fans those are the Le and Lee fans they're just screaming I probably just need to configure them here we go Bud here we go Bud we need the pass through from that capture card right that's the one yes I wonder if I need the a media stuff uh if you just want to go and give her a little check there bud oh I flicker oh I got three okay hey well that's great look at that that's great this actually kind of a sick config so 7800 x3d best gaming chip you got the 7900 XTX that
you overpaid for because whatever and the point is that if you're running Windows and Linux going AMD is a great option for your GPU then over here you've got your old system with the 12 core ryzen 3000 processor 32 gigs of RAM and a really good encoding card so that's your streaming machine and you know what I got to give you credit other than looking like it was you know aesthetically designed by a man um It's relatively clean yeah it looks sick mostly because I cleaned things thanks
all right when I saw this at Walmart for $35 it's a mini fridge that is just in the shape of a creeper it holds 12 cans of pop I knew I had to have it I actually had bought another collector's fridge with Call Of Duty Black Ops 3 it's the Juggernog one over there it also fits 12 cans uh but it broke so I needed to replace my fridge I guess it is so flipping hot in here and this is not going to help but it looks really cool well it's a mini fridge I can just leave it open not how it works oh but in all
seriousness the setup looks pretty good look Mom I'm a streamer she's not proud audio is not working I'm a streamer I'm a I'm a I'm a streamer and I need to reconfigure it to all of the audio coming out of this one to make sure it's going to this OBS I haven't been able to do that yet because we were just getting it all working I can do that I don't want to spend any more time it's already I'm in the OT time now you can't get OT for upgrading your own house uh yeah I can how does that work
in the province of British Columbia employees are only mandated to work for  sup new camera who even needs a cameraman anyway when I can have three drywall anchors oh yeah you want to go look at the lit robot oh so you have the hopper I don't have the hopper yeah which generation do you have I have generation three okay so this is the fourth generation oo so there it is okay uh you got an error on it yeah they're still getting used to it but they have used it like basically right away and
now I have an app so I get notifications at work every time they poop nice yeah and then the hopper you can kind of see it on the the back there yeah so it adds more litter every time they use it when it detects that it needs it it essentially is just like oh it's a little lower on weight puts a little bit more in that's actually kind of great cuz like topping up the litter is the only real work you have to do with it yeah great success does look good it thinks it's running at 4K too cuz we haven't quite
configured a media and it's handling it like pretty good Beast yeah that's what you get when you get 7800 x3d and a 7900 XTX saarai Edition specifically the the sac Edition does not make it faster yeah it does no it doesn't it's like RGB it doesn't make your computer faster oh I don't know about that why else would I get it because you're gullible thanks AMD we managed to move his three machines to a rack which honestly ended up looking pretty freaking amazing we've got these which is wonderful uh more
monitors actually this is quite the battle station and this camera looks so much better than the garbage you had before and it was fine but this is way better this does low light and this apartment has you know not great lighting so this will be you're going to have to get the setting styled in a little bit this can do better than that oh 100% I'm going to play with it after yeah we know you're going to play with it after look at this keyboard stop if you guys enjoyed this
video maybe check out Adams the first AMD ultimate Tech upgrade it definitely was a vibe
