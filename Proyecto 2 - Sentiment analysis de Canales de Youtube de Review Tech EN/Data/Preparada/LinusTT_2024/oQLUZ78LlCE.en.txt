"we just got a 100,000 screwdriver shafts" but there's one small problem what do you mean we can't use them all right there now you have "99,999 problems fortunately we have this" tormach Mill that allows us to take a piece of metal and shape it into anything we want the problem with these shafts this knurling is too soft for a screwdriver it'd be great for something like a pen that's when we got to work Tada but we're not done here it's not fidgety enough instead of a basic click
we went with a much more satisfying bolt action then we smooth out these sections so it's comfortable to hold now we have "up to 100,000 scribe driver pens to sell" you but thankfully they're on sale this Black Friday at lm. g/ pen
