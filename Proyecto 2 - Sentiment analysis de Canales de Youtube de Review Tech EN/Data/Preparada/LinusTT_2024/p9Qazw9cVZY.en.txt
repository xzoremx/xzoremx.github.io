it was almost 2 years ago that we shot a video about a stunning Asus laptop display it used glasses-free 3D technology that was so Cutting Edge that isus had to custom build it into older machines so that we could see it without them revealing the other Hardware that powered it but you never saw that video long story short Nvidia decided that you guys wouldn't be able to tell the difference between gameplay even gameplay footage and benchmarks of an unreleased G GPU a GPU we weren't even
using so yada yada yada video dead but I'm still excited about Glasses free 3D technology so we're finally taking a look at something very similar but from Acer this time spatial Labs view technology is just about everything we ever dreamed that a giant 3DS display could be we did find some let's call them interesting decisions that we need to talk about later but the effect is just straight up awesome awesome I mean look at the way this segue pops out to our sponsor seic their Prime TX
1000 wat power supply is a fantastic choice for your next upgrade or build its hybrid fan control helps reduce noise without temperature spikes and it even comes with a 12-year warranty learn more using our Link in the video  wow yo that's so sick is that cool or what uh oh god wow it really makes you want to throw up when it's getting it stuff together uh that's actually the first line after the intro that I was about to read but it looks great once it kicks in the effect is shocking and we
didn't script this Jake just wandered on set and was like oh I'm going to try a thing cuz I'm a magpie yeah it's pretty cool right while the pair of 27in displays that we're looking at day have only been available for a few months the fundamentals behind this and older glasses 3E 3D is pretty similar first thing you need to do is sacrifice half of your resolution to produce the 3d effect though when you're starting with a 4K display the result is a lot prettier than it would have been on your
old Nintendo handheld also unlike the 3DS which used a parallax barrier technique and then later added camera- based ey tracking to improve the 3d effect on the new 3DS these spatial Labs displays utilize a lenticular layer over the screen you could think of it kind of like an array of cylindrical lenses that are all standing up in front of the screen that combined with camera based eye tracking lets the monitor adjust what each eye sees to give the best possible results and I can even move
around as fast as this without breaking the 3d effect oh oh oh starting to glitch a little bit there that's fine and it handles even pretty extreme angles yeah there it cut out still pretty darn good oh I just realized we haven't told you what these are we're using the Predator PSV 27-2 gaming Monitor and then over on the other side is its twin brother who went to business school the ASV 272p Pro 27 between them I'm just going to rip this bandaid off "you're looking at about $5,000 Freedom"
dollars which for those of you counting at home was buy you an RTX 490 gaming PC a valve index VR kit and an iPhone 16 Pro and making matters worse unlike the demo I Saw 2 years ago these are LCD displays rather than OLED meaning that especially in fast-moving scenes you're going to get a significant amount of cross talk but let's say you're still interested which one should you be looking at to answer that we could look at the spec sheets except they're basically the same we could tear them
apart with the Precision screwdriver kit from LTD store.com accept their looners and in fact even the warranty is the same so it turns out that most of the Thousand difference is in the accessories the software and the gamery paint job wow despite their similarities though their capabilities are quite different here let me show you I'm going to load up the spatial Labs experience Center that comes with The Predator version of the monitor we've got a model viewer a video player their true game
which we'll be taking a closer look at in a minute and also spatial lab go which allows you to view full screen 2D and side by-side stereo content in 3D spoiler alert that's going to save the day in a little while first let's try out the model viewer hard of the eyes God damn this is out to here for me which seems like a pretty average size and then in terms of depth like I'd say it feels like it's about back to here through the back of the Monitor and it's kicked back into 3D now
there's a menu right Jordan where you can adjust the depth yep oo here we go Crank It Up okay max depth 50 not to 50 oh well with the size of our model it just doesn't really need any more depth but potentially I could oh I could zoom oh buddy that is hilarious okay it looks like it's right here it looks like I'm touching the end cap of this screwdriver right here oh that is brain breaking when it touches the edge of the frame though and completely breaks the effect also
there's a bit of a vignette effect in this software so that just oh that really messes with my eyes I'm going to have such a headache when we're done this video I'm like I'm too close to focus on the object that's being spot out at me that is sick it looks like it's coming a solid 18 in out of the frame there's no way you'd want to operate it like this dayto day though I'm telling Jordan about this but he can't actually experience it because it uses cameras for ey tracking well it can
only track one pair of eyes at a time right so if you were you know looking at this with your design lead or something like that you'd basically have to have them come over and then I'd go okay okay you look it doesn't look very 3D right now you done looking at it yep is it not working I left you left no no come come see how long the changeover is I want to see how long the change over is okay that's 3D 3D okay my turn okay oh yeah there we go not bad check out the player
next does this come up every single time every time UAC doesn't every time but the uh explanation does okay brilliant uh okay what should we do with this one load up a video okay browse or pick one of the two at the bottom there actually yeah sure as far as the actual stereo separation goes and cleanness of the image goes this is great like it's not good it's great I don't know that I would trade this for HDR cuz these are not HDR capable displays but it's fun I gu get a
little bit of the 3d effect if I'm like right behind you no way get as close as you can get as close as you can I lost it now damn hang on hold on what if you're right above me like does it align vertically like if I'm down down here oh yeah that's pretty good really oh I lost it no no it's gone oh I got it 3D okay yeah we yeah I've got it too no wa okay so we can watch together as long as we're like this i' be in your hair enough of this let's talk about true game effectively this is a wrapper
around your other game launchers steam epic GG Xbox Live and it automatically applies a custom 3D profile when you use it to launch supported games at the time of filming that's just over 150 games in at least one of its two different 3D modes that boil down to that totally looks 3D and that kind of looks like a pop-up book by the way did you catch the glaring issue with that last sentence 150 games now Acer says they're always adding more but they are reliant on game developers approaching them to
collaborate with them to create that custom 3D profile which as you guys can probably imagine doesn't happen that much with that said there's some really solid games on here Lego Star Wars let's go dude Star Wars scrolling text is going to be sick oh God that's awful when it's when it's cut off by the frame Oh Oh that's oh okay yeah we can skip this man there is a really nasty Shadow on some stuff and some of the reflections from the floor seem just completely wrong it is safe to say from
my experience in this game that the fact that it's supported by true game is no guarantee that it's going to be a quality 3D experience because I can see ghosts on both sides of objects and there are situations where there reflection in the shiny floor I don't know how to describe it other than that it's weird oh okay I figured it out when you jump your upside down reflection comes out of where your character model is so it's above the floor oh that is weird did you notice
that yeah I don't know if that happens in this game in 2D but if it does that's terrible let's try another game all right trying too that seems like a prime candidate trying was a big 3D Vision game back in the day the 3D worked quite well in it oh yeah the 3D looks freaking awesome in this game and what's interesting is I'm not getting any of that weird cross talk I think that may have just been down to that previous game like you're still going to get a little bit of motion blur
compared to if you had an OLED but the cross talk seems like it was just an issue with that last game and the way that it was handling something I wish you guys were experiencing this with me like this is the kind of thing a friend comes over and you show them your like cool monitor that can switch into 3D mode and they're like no way and then you tell them how much you spent on it and they're like no way the eye fatigue is way less in this game way less this is so cool it brings
me back to the first time that I saw World of Warcraft in 3D Vision like it blew my mind but something I don't miss about that era was The Limited game compatibility fortunately Acer has a solution and it's spatial Labs go which is an alternate mode to get unsupported games working this works in any app or even game that supports side by-side stereo rendering on its own and on r/ stereo 3D gaming we learned that you can even inject alternate shaders into some games that don't support it like super
depth 3D and get it freaking working that really expands the library of games so why don't we try risk of rain too here I can already tell there's one weird thing about it the menu is just behind the screen for no apparent reason and that unpleasant doubling of everything effect is oh well it was a thing in the menu this seems totally okay it's not the strongest stereo effect but it definitely adds an element of depth to it like I can really feel the ground coming out toward me even if I have no
front projection right all I really have is depth into the screen tearing looks absolutely nasty in Stereo 3D and that was always the case it is one of the few situations where I would argue that pretty much everybody should be using vsync this is kind of awesome not going to lie like I there's no way I'd spend two grand on it but if I had it in front of me I'd be like oh I enjoying playing this game right now I would like to continue playing this game you know what I'm saying there are problems that come
with using custom shaders though oh I know not all games are going to support it antiche does not like it yeah that makes sense as cool as it is to play like this though I have to wonder if the money would be better spent on a VR headset let's not think about that for now though first let's take a look at the pro display starting with the physical differences on top of the beefier Bas the bundle includes a Mini PC Mount and this very nice shroud that really is very nice like it attaches
magnetically it's got this nice little velvet in here that not only helps with glare but also made a significant difference to the effectiveness of the various sensors on the top bezel especially in a bright environment but the big difference is not in the hardware it's in the software what can we do thanks to that extra ",000 well for starters as you can see we" can not play games with true game full disclosure here guys we actually got the pro display first because we figured
well of course the pro version will do everything that the consumer version will do and more but the software detects which display you've got and insists on only installing the correct version before it will let you see a  voxel we were confused so we reached out to Acer who confirmed that true game is strictly consumer facing I think it's Acer who's confused because only the pro model supports spatial Labs experience Center Pro giving access to things like developer support plugins for Unity
unreal you know game engines plus Acer's own open XR and steam VR Bridge packages but as useful as this might seem for game development no Acer intends this version for only big important tasks like Medical Imaging education GIS showroom displays pretty much anything but childish video games the good news is you can still hack it with spatial Labs go it's just that your mileage may vary thanks to its unofficial support so let's give it a shot shall we uh how do I spatial Labs
go it alt G alt G alt g b oh God yeah yeah you don't want to you don't want to see that you don't want to see that give it a second to kick in don't no I want things to happen now I guess the your REM me very part launch app it's there yeah I see it well I don't know it works sometimes basically yeah we had this working before it's basically the same display other than an arbitrary function lock thanks to manufacturer boneheaded so bottom line overall this is still a category of products that I would be
excited to see make a comeback but it's one that I am starting to lose hope for in the face of competition from VR headsets usability price and convenience all need to take some major steps forward none of which seem to have happened in the last 2 years but hey at least trying to looks great so great that it makes me want to keep rooting for this technology the way that I root for our sponsor delete me your personal information might be sold online without you even knowing it but not all heroes
