enhance enhance enhance enhance enhance enhance enhance what kind of camera is this with over 500 crime Focus TV shows out there they've done anything and everything to try to stand out from the pack including using technology to solve difficult cases unfortunately some of the errors that they've made involving computers phones and anything else digital go beyond creative license to the point of outright inaccuracy and to help us break down some of these scenes we've got of course my co-host Luke from
the W show and Wendell from level one tax who are going to be telling us what they did wrong and who knows maybe if they did something right we're going to be kicking things off with NCIS a show that's been running for 22 seasons and over 450 episodes considering where you found this baby there's no way I'm just going to jam it into our Network which would explain the purpose of this contraption the laptop isolates the SD card and the cage isolates the laptop from the rest
of our Network okay that is actually not terrible completely unreasonable and ridiculous but possible no it's not because she plugged in the SD card to a powered on system before closing the Faraday cage yeah that's unfortunate because that's the plot hole and does she have a wireless mouse plug to go into a laptop a laptop that's in a faad Cas that's a bit of a problem McGee would put up a virus scanner and okay analyzing the files without opening them that's not unreasonable that's not how
you scan a virus though no I mean I guess that's how you do if you're a badass build a firewall that's build a firewall so she's manually typing this okay  kitty I should have gone with the shark I don't think that it would work like that no wait didn't they no the firewall it AE right through it and then it bypassed the cage through the power cord whatever can bypass the cage through the power cord if you're networking through the power cord obviously hold on a second
it's a laptop did she ever actually plug the laptop into Power something is plugged into it and going through the hole yes the laptop is plugged in which isn't really the question anyway doesn't solve much why would you build a firewall if it was not connected not supposed to be connected to the why wouldn't it just always be on well it shouldn't even be connected to the network if you're just expecting a local whatever can do this I am going to need help to stop it and fast so would I yeah
I don't it doesn't none of those things work that way no but you know what does work is this message from our sponsor T get super affordable phone plans with awesome freebies and excellent customer service from T stay tuned to learn more about how you can be saving money with their custom plans or you can learn more  next up we've got another scene from NCIS oh no no no no no that was almost a real blue screen that blue screen is from like what 95 hold on what did the 3.1 blue screen look like no it's just
nonsense yeah it's just a blue screen my computer just crashed I've lost everything damn it not really how that works you can have a blue screen and all your data is still there I mean you lost probably what you were working on this level of freak out would not be warranted until you reboot and it's like can't find boot device yeah she's running Windows 3.1 though so autosave is not really a thing well you know it's really not possible to lose everything mind if I take a look uh-uh
this paper's too important I need somebody that actually knows what they're doing got too good with computers among his degrees he has a master's in computer forensics from MIT oh that's too bad is that a degree I looked at going to MIT and it was like Hey blah BL blah the lady that I was talking to was like no we don't give out master's degrees they're it's a consolation prize for not getting your PhD so if you come to MIT you have to be all in on the PHD and I was like oh that's
interesting so you're saying he's a loser essentially wow the losest of winners you know with all the weight you've lost I didn't think you could throw that much shade you look great quote the agent That'll Walk In in here with him a functional mute I suggest you don't mess with him too much what is he typing into a blue the blue screen's still there right yeah yeah that's really hard on your on your wrists too all right there we go there is your I love the sounds yeah auto save was
turned off so I uh took the liberty of enabling it every 60 seconds should have the problem again autosave well prevent blue screens you heard it here first right but she didn't have autosave on so how did he recover it magic is that a 12 core 16 with a 10 Meg pipe I need the faster response times for the new by power oh everything's wrong so far I'm just skipping over that is that an II power logo no one talks this way I mean if it's from a point in time where 10m was
a lot you wouldn't say 16 core it would have been like a dual eight core or something or quad four core yeah and you would almost everever if someone complement your Tower go number of CPU cores internet speed there's a lot of people after my high scores that's not how that works you're competing head-to-head for latency to matter you're not trying to set a high score and then uploading it does she need to upload her high score really fast you hold the high score in virtually every massively multiplayer
online role playing game they don't really MMOs don't have high scores what some Modern MMOs actually do sort of have scoring this came out in 2010 this was still sort of a thing back then actually sure could you have the most money in Evon line EV on line had kill boards back then though sure you could she didn't have time to play any other game then unreal T didn't really have that yeah virtually every MMO that just means you're cheating you singlehandedly killed the entire skan
cord from is of cardas and blood fund 6  Eve the least of this's problems is that a 16 core processor didn't exist at that point if you're wondering at this point how do these scenes end up so inaccurate you're not the only one and according to this very old Reddit post they do it on purpose as a fun competition to see who can create the best worst it scene roughly 90% of the audience of these shows don't know better or simply don't care anyway the example they gave is those awful Zoom enhance scenes so why
don't we take a look at some of those isn't this a reflection on the decay of  but there's no pixels ah the pixels it doesn't work that way oh my God this this would be all just large language model hallucination at this point yeah it didn't work that way then it it doesn't really work that way now if every once in a while a psychic can contribute to solving a case maybe an AI hallucination can do the same thing I mean a stop clock is right twice a day baby I can tell by these four pixels
it's this specific logo good job AI it's like wait a minute this is the security camera at the underwear store freeze there rotate 75 de around the vertical please oh that doesn't that uh none of that works do you know how many cameras it takes to do that at a sports ball game should watch the behind the scenes on The Matrix and uh see how many cameras they use for bullet time it takes that many computer take us around on the other side it can hypothesize Chris yeah can you rotate us 
please what do you think it is that's a 3D model did these guys predict AI hallucinations I I think he said like can we bring it around the other side and he said it can hypothesize it can hypothesize that made me Dumber rotate zoom in remove occupant Frisk enhance pants Vector D7 what pocket content what kind of camera is this enhance enhance this is the final level of enhancing enhance en and and meet me at the strip club tonight it all goes down XOXO I don't think for that so
I don't even mind that one that is so obviously taking the piss a lot of them I actually don't believe that Reddit post I think they actually just have no idea what they're talking about you've been trolled that one was okay clearly parodying yes yes moving on CSI has had over 800 episodes over the years which makes you think surely they must be getting better at this right so what do we know about this Apollo you know that g that IP looks reasonable in the background and the
mail header looks reasonable in the background all right and that that actually is AOL from the early 2000s this IP is slightly less reasonable but sure oh yeah that one not reasonable you know that garbage those numbers at the bottom of every email yeah it's actually a unique number that registers the location of the center's terminal kind of an address Internet Protocol address CSI has access seven different IP addresses means you use seven different computers well that just for one email
no um no that's strange could be a network that's not that strange I have seven computers also no this is all very believable conversation though so you're saying the dialogue is good even if the tech is terrible well no the tech isn't necessarily terrible you can look up the IP addresses that someone accessed your service from and then they could misunderstand how it works it's also true that uh in only in the last five or six years from your mail headers like if you use Outlook or a client program not
the web that it's only just got to the point where removes the name of your computer from the mail header and it's clearly ancient yeah if it was multiple emails and they were compiling this yes but you wouldn't have all of this in one email oh yeah and they've just got like straight up the address of the prison nice IP address doesn't like no exactly pinpoint the address that you're at in the case of a prison it might register but why would that prison have all these different IPS it shouldn't yeah for
weeks I've been investigating the cabi killer murders with a certain morbid fast I mean that does look like a shitty alternative news site sure time I'll create a guey interface using Visual Basic see if I can track an IP address whoa I mean I could use a Salad Shooter to try to make some mulch for my flower bed I'll create a gooey interface using Visual Basic see if I can track an IP us if it weren't for my horse I wouldn't have spent that year in college that just doesn't mean anything
it's definitely been the case that when someone that I knew was trying to do something that was more advanced than their skills was like hang on a minute let me just give you a gooey that'll let you play with it there you go good luck do you need to make it in Visual Basic that would be only if I were trying to punish myself yeah Dante and Brooke are both in this shot mean somebody else is filming means there's a third player Walter can you zoom in on that they didn't have selfie cameras
yet whoa wow what just happened what is that oh that's an iPhone 4 that would not be happening on an iPhone 4 what  happened yeah apple doesn't allow you to do that which is one of my big pet peeves with iOS you can't zoom on photos they artificially limit how much and they do they have this awful animation that's like it's one of those little things that just it doesn't really matter I can put it on my computer and I can look at it there but why it's like Wendell did you know that you cannot lock an iPhone
to landscape really why because you that's why sounds like apple you can lock an iPad but not an iPhone but not an iPhone so that's one of the reasons that we have issues with our prompters all the time sorry I'm okay okay I I just ran a diagnostic on the bomb it's the tablet's ringer that's the Detonator I think I can write a script and just tell the ringer not to ring CH it's not even you can write that much code from scratch did you guys see how fast that progress bar was moving it's the
Detonator I think I can write a script to just tell the ringer not to ring it's not even you can write that much code from scratch he's dead you have a better idea Nelson actually I do I saw next one on toin site there a piece of mware that turns off cell phone ringers he going to need to update that code adusted to the tablet yeah but the frame should still be the same crmit I'm sending it to you now okay okay this might actually work also if it's just like the tablet and the little wire is going to the
plastique like I'm probably going to take a chance in ripping the wire out of the plastique like does it go to the blasting cap if I pull on that does the blasting cap let go like that seems reasonable can you comment on it using the same framework if you had a piece of malware that was like say a piece of iOS malware and it turned off the ringer that might not be implausible but that's really stretch right compiling it is going to take more time than you have right and also app like the certificates
and like there's a there's a certain amount of suffering that you have to go through as an iOS Developer that I don't know why people put up with it makes me want to stab myself in the temple with an LT screwdriver I've got one right here it's our upcoming Precision driver hey you know what will stop the pain an LTT screwdriver to the temple we just passed 742 th000 crmit did it work nope nope definitely did not work how could he even have tried it already yeah just importing the
certificate takes longer than that oh it's speeding up whatever this is unbelievable someone dos the site what apparently the bomb is somehow linked to a web page that's getting traffic but the denial of service you would have no traffic oh yeah that would stop it eventually like you'd have a lot of traffic and then you'd have none maybe the reason why the bomb hasn't gone off is it's not a progress bar it's an active users bar uhhuh so it was going up quickly in that one scene but it
might have gone down and now they're dsing it to make it go back up again private key but this thing has more logic boms in it than stuff okay can you walk us through a logic bomb a logic bomb is when you have a program that has something in it that you're unlikely to encounter in normal operation but when you do encounter that the program does something completely unexpected it's like a booby trap in the program so like if somebody enters a username um that is completely unexpected it's like oh
that's this user let me just go erase a disc if we're not super careful we could easily destroy what why interrogate The Prisoner when you can just look inside her brain not unreasonable I actually love this don't do that to get a hard drive though that was a hard drive wasn't it yes yes and also when they access whatever files on this hard drive they're still going to have to deal with your logic bomb but in general finally someone went for a direct approach good job we'll scan the data as well a little
little too direct all right little too direct where's your clean room buddy stop where's your gloves it was going so well so when you open a hard drive it's now uh dead also where is her LT Precision screwdriver kit yeah she just sort of like slid it off that came apart more easily than that iPad we'll scan the data as read only then search the disc image to extract key bypassing all the logic bombs I thought you said this was going to be that is not how an encryption key can be obtained actually
the better way to obtain an encryption key is like if the machine is running and it's decrypted you could turn it off and use a liquid nitrogen or a air compressor that's turned upside down to freeze the memory and read the memory that is actually a forensic device that law enforcement has but the system would have to still work you would have had to not take a hammer to it it would have to still be powered when you do that so that there is some hope that that data is still in the volatile memory I
figured out a way to track captain cold how the cold gun is powered by an engine control unit a microcomputer that regulates air to fuel ratio so the subcooled fluid in the chambers don't overflow and explode right that's plausible enough yeah there's computers and everything regulating everything this ECU was receiving updates wirelessly from my tablet if I boost the signal using Central City's Network and send a false update we'll get a ping back and then that doesn't work that way
boosting a signal is not how you get an up and ecus don't usually it's like is it cuz you were running an open wi-fi network and it connected to an open wi-fi network and which case how did you know are they trying to find it is that what they're doing or are they trying to like this ECU was receiving updates wirelessly from my tablet was receiving them from the TBL Cal City Network and send a false update we'll get a ping back and then okay I think they're trying to find it and they're out of
range so it might make some amount of sense first I have to hack into the city's Network so I don't know 30 minutes maybe I can do it in less than one when it comes to hacking I'm the fastest woman live oh that was not as  pictured all right doesn't look like that what is she even typing into nothing she's not typing anything all right I'm in are you kidding maybe she was controlling the windowing system from like the no I don't know that one was okay other than the I'm the fastest
in the world scene it wasn't great I don't know how they're going to find it based on what they did I mean even you might have been able if you're connected to like if the city had Wi-Fi all over the city and you didn't have mac address rotation then you could ask the network controller like where which access point has this Mac address and get close yeah but you've got Mac address rotation working against you and also it doesn't work like that yeah but you know what does work like that the segue to our
