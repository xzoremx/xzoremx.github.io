I have always wanted to show you guys the inside of a GPU Factory and thanks to power color and framework we're finally doing it but there's one small catch in order to show us absolutely everything from start to finish they have to shut down absolutely everything from start to finish meaning that it is costing them hundreds to thousands of dollars a minute and we are going to absolutely get kicked out after 3 hours I think you can take notes faster than that with the constraints it's going to
be a bit of a speed run but maybe that's the fun speed fun like the Speedy segue to our sponsor seic you know seic for their reliable and power efficient power supplies but now you can know them for affordability too their vertex lineup is  description okay it's not completely shut down be pretty boring to an abandoned Factory but uh we're told that this line would be running it anywhere from 2 to three times the speed during regular production you can see just waiting for it while they're better
known as powercolor tul has been around since 1997 and has produced graphics cards under multiple of their own Brands as well as for partners like diamond in the past they won't disclose their total manufacturing capacity to us but let's put it this way they're a tier 1 AMD Manu manufacturing partner and even this small taiwan-based manufacturing line "can turn out about 20,000 units a" month they did invite us right when you're operating at this kind of scale every little detail matters even the
very small ones here's a real good example of that shipments of surface mount components get inspected via x-ray to ensure that they are exactly what they say they are and that the right quantities are on each one of these tapes this is done for both new shipments as well as reels that have been used multiple times for small production runs so you can see this one has multiple count stickers on it and is now down to "3,728" V's they also perform manual spot checks for both incoming surface mount
components as well as pcbs this is an engineered what flatness meter I guess it's a super super flat piece of granite and basically see that if the variance from  mm it's done it's out now that all our components are validated all we need is a quick antistatic shower and we're ready to visit the smt line where they're going to be mounted to our boards for step one we take those trays of pcbs and load them into the end of the line our timing is so good we actually get to see that happen right 
go oh look there it goes next up we need to apply solder paste to every point on the board where a component will be placed this is done by essentially just scraping a squeegee that is covered in paste over a stencil with the board sitting underneath now something to note is that these stencils wear out after a "th000 or 10,000 placements so every time" they run a new model of GPU through they have to inspect it to make sure it still has the appropriate thickness looks pretty good to me but no one asked me
they asked the machine in here they inspect the application to ensure that it is accurate and it's the right quantity and if an error gets noticed the information is looped back to the previous stage so that it knows hm something's not going quite right next we get reunited with our old surface mount component friends who are loaded into the pick and place machine in the optimal locations in order to reach the maximum placement speed of "77,000 components per hour holy crap"
look at this thing go I have never seen a machine this fast which makes sense because this is a state-of-the-art machine that runs at nearly double the speed of their main lines and you guys have got how many of these things here 1 two three four five of them but this this investment makes a lot of sense when you consider what this facility is for they're just 15 minutes from their R&amp;D headquarters so they will often do things like quality analysis so they can transfer that knowledge to the main line
or development of new products so speed and efficiency is of the essence as you can see the biggest components go on last with this side of the machine handling vrms and this side handling display connections and the really good stuff like memory and GPU dies which I'm told I get to load into the machine oh there we go uh oh too far let me you one one time and you is it in the wrong spot oh I missed you unlock oh hey okay well I did it mostly right if your GPU is in the wrong spot you'll 
blame and there it is a finished board at at least in the sense that a pizza with all the toppings on it is finished now we cook but not in no regular oven boys this right here is the world's most advanced Pizza Oven not only does it have different temperature control for the different zones but they build a special profile for every board that goes through it to ensure that the solder melts absolutely perfectly and by perfect I really do mean perfect at the end of the baking proc process they
ensure that the solder melted correctly and that every component was positioned exactly perfectly by doing a 3D freaking scan as you can see this one no good it's got a lifted lead that is so precise now it's done JK we still don't have a power connector and there's no capacitors there are still some components that are better placed by human hands so let's go visit that line at least most of the will 10 to 15% will get pulled aside proactively and sent to the X-ray inspection room
where they can use this machine to get a 3D view my God that is so cool of the BGA joints under components that cannot be visually inspected like the memory and the GPU die now they let me in at the first station each jig gets two gpus and any 8 Pin pcie power connectors then we get our fan header followed by capacitors capacitors some more  capacitors once that's all done the back side of the board gets sprayed with flux then it gets pizza ovened again until the end of this machine where oh my God
that is the coolest thing ever the back of the board runs across a liquid solder waterfall in order to solder all of the through board components man I feel like a kid in a digital candy store here after the backside gets soldered our little tray gets popped onto this little  inspection oh for some reason I thought it was going to slide but that makes more sense if there's adequate coverage of solder it goes into the middle and if there isn't it goes to the next station
sometimes there just isn't quite enough solder or two of the points are accid entally bridged and that can be quickly repaired by a skilled technician the touched up boards then get cleaned all the shoo gets removed then all the boards come back together for a final visual inspection and our QA technician at the end of the line scans a QR code and says hey I check this it's definitely good to go moving upstairs you can see we've upgraded the gpus we're working on a little bit here these
are bound for 7800 XT hellhound Sakura editions just like you saw in our cutest PC video and stage one is ah yes visual inspection again I guess for what to make sure nothing broke yeah to be extra good and sure with that out of the way it's time for assembly to begin in Earnest starting with little plastic washers over all the screw holes to make sure the PCB doesn't get scratched IO plate and oh screwing on the io plate that's very important next up back plates go on followed by those also
being screwed in which is equally important cuz you don't want your GPU to arrive in pieces is then oh God I love these coolers that looks gorgeous all the protective peels come off the thermal pads and pre-applied thermal goop oh that one didn't have any peels on it I swear I saw one with peels earlier I'm not going to worry about that the point is the fan gets plugged in here then we've got one two three stations that all apply screws to the cooler through the back of the card
followed by another visual inspection that I think could best be described as sanity check you know does the fan spin also a good thing wait what about second final station where each one of these cards gets loaded on to a test bench they got to have a lot of test benches yes they do and unlike the assembly lines this part of the factory runs 247 with every single GPU being loaded into a full windows environment and running a combination of AMD diagnostic tools and Enthusiast ones like you in
heaven and furmark but hold on a second one of these things is not like the other the motherboard's in sideways and that doesn't look like any desktop graphics card I've ever seen that's cuz it's not it's a mobile GPU specifically the one for investment disclosure framework for the framework 16 massive shout out by the way to tul for being willing to take on this weird low volume product in an effort to make laptops less disposable super cool really appreciate you guys guys and appreciate
framework too for helping hook us up with this tour in the first place oh sorry sorry it's going back it's going back this next room isn't technically part of production it's more part of development but on the subject of non- disposability every new model oh my God goes through reliability testing in a 45 degree chamber for an extended period burning to ensure that it's not going to have issues out in the field oh this is truly awful then when they're done in here they go to the Zer degree chamber
to make sure that I don't know you can game in Antarctica coming back to production it's time for the final step retail packaging now unfortunately they're not packaging any gpus right now so half of the line here isn't even in use but rather they're packing up framework dual m.2 SSD carriers this first station is flashing firmware then the serial number of the board gets paired with the QR code on the sticker for the packaging then it gets begged boxed boxed into a bigger Master carton
box and sent off um everyone gets a souvenir GPU today right nope they all go here instead where they're staged on pallets in preparation for shipping to markets like Hong Kong and probably to my friends in the good old usnd a so if you're an American this right here could be your next GPU that one uh as long as everything goes according to plan plan if it doesn't it ends up here the team here handles both internal failures from the production line trying to rework or Salvage any valuable components as well
as failures from end users this station gives us an error code telling us what exactly is wrong with the card in this case it's a bad GPU which means it goes in the pile and gets transferred over to the other side of the RMA department where the board gets heat it up and the GPU gets removed then we go to my friend the baller he takes a brand new GPU installs it in one of these little Jigs and then he's got these little tiny balls of solder that he basically plays you know those little games that you
play as a kid where you have to get all the little balls and all the little holes well he plays that on a GPU and if he misses one guess what the cardal working then it goes in the oven where all of the balls get melted and and it's ready to be remounted now under normal circumstances when they find a defective GPU they just send it to AMD to test but we asked them very nicely to show us the manual reballing process so they did thanks guys since we were already imposing anyway we asked very nicely if
they could show off the full capabilities of their latest generation BGA rework station and put a GPU back on for us so my friend is now applying solder paste to the board itself using using oh okay yeah another mask now the GPU and the prepared board get loaded back into the rework station heated aligned and reapplied obviously guys this is not the kind of thing that you would want to do very often but for Diagnostic purposes sometimes it is necessary what an incredible tour massive shout out to tul
for their Hospitality today and of course framework who helped took us up with this tool asked me to just take one of these random 7800 X T Sakura editions and put a little signature on it they said if uh if you don't want it they'll handle the RMA but I'm just going to I don't know put a little so there you have it if you buy a 7800 XT secure Edition it might be signed hopefully that's something you want at Linus Media Group the business team has to do a ton of communication
coordination and writing For Better or Worse that's where grammarly comes in they're an AI writing partner that works where you work and upgrading to grammarly premium has saved our business team more time thanks to useful features like tone suggestions this ensures that the tone of the writing is never too formal nor too friendly it's not what you say but how you say it tone matters now they can tell lus to stop dropping things so often without being rude plus with the premium app actions feature
they can now link Google Drive links create task on monday.com or insert gifts into their emails in one place without switching tabs and by upgrading to grammarly premium they even get "access to 1,000 prompts per month sign" up on upgrade to grammarly premium at  lt6 we'll check this at the end uh guess we found a broken GPU on the framework line so uh QA it works and you guys watching to the end of this video works for learning how gpus are made if you enjoyed this video hey why not check out
the Micron factory tour where we saw a different smt line where I made my own memory module that was pretty cool
