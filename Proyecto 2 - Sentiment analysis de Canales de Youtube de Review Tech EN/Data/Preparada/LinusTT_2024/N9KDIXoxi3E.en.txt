welcome to Scrapyard Wars where Luke and I compete to build the best computer on a fixed budget we get to play with an enormous $800 including a hundred bucks to spend on whatever we want from our sponsor Jawa at the end of the week our setups will be put through the ultimate Gauntlet to find out who wins scrapyard Wars  you ready yeah we'll make it work my name's still lindsy right yeah yeah yeah yeah uh we're trying to make a computer for our nephew Ryan right now we're
mostly looking for a keyboard a mouse maybe a power supply if there's one of those sorry I'm not 100% up on the terminology but the main parts I'm hoping the disguise is working ayzen system ryzen 1700 see look this one is right underneath the here would you mind if I ripped that one out would that be okay also some Ram maybe but it would need to be ddr4 which I think that might be DDR three yeah some power supplies here all these are going to be 350 what I don't have a screwdriver with me here um do
you have one with you or I we can go upstairs and grab one from there too okay we've got another youth shelf upstairs with stuff I'll see if there's anything else up there cool thank you very much okay they literally just like walked right in front of the car I know this guy knows me I used to come here and get free Tech all the time so it's going to be a little s unfortunately the the platform we currently have is ddr4 but I appreciate the the look found oh nice okay awesome
it was Box about this size and it just had a whole bunch of scrap that's okay I appreciate it power supply and the mouse will will come in handy good luck finding the rest of the pieces thank you now that this is concluded I will say I noticed the LTT screwdriver did you recognize me at all I do yeah might be a little easier without the glasses without the glasses and the uh NE tattoos the beard and the tattoos and stuff when we were about to leave he gave me a few looks that were like a
little longer than they probably normally would have been and I could tell he was like trying to pierce the glasses a little bit and then we went inside and he haded me the LTD screwdriver and I was like well all right and I was like okay from here on if he offers anything like crazy then we I'm going to have to say no but we got an old Power Man 350 wat power supply I think this is like an IBM Thinkpad Mouse so all we need now technically is a a keyboard audio solution and a chair AIO
this mouse sucks we're probably still going to want to buy that combo set and we don't need the audio today is that right I guess technically not we could get the audio tomorrow so we're doing okay actually so I think we should head back and try to get this computer going all right I'm adjusting Lanes oh my God done woohoo hey there we go oh just uh you know part of the life have to have a constant makeup person brother what's up brother here's the rundown our GPU arrived from java
which means combined with storage we have everything to put together our final computer we've got the deal to sell most of our leftovers but it's way in Vancouver super far away and the deal sucks H whole offered $10 fee and me in the afternoon I think we might have to take it I guess if that's the best we got that's the best we got with all that said priority number one is to get this damn sweater off I'm dying right now it's so warm okay let's get system built have you ever built a computer before yes
okay good build a computer go no kidding I'll help okay let's do this thing I have a gift for you oh these Jaa special edition screwdrivers get rid of this one this one's gone look at these Beau colors from our sponsor Jawa well I mean it's from us isn't it yeah we made it but we wouldn't have made it without their colors thanks Jaa we're actually going to be giving some of these away on Flow plane at the end of this and Jaa is also going to be giving some away so go to
check them out online I'm taking all of the whoa thanks Daniel and then let's get all these cheap fans out of here and then we're going to replace them with the no toas that are in the other case oh yeah that's something you can do Sammy do I also get a Jawa audition screwdriver for now thank you wow lots of KN to of fans oh yeah no sami's got more what yeah more fans oh I found us some speakers Sammy check out these speakers yo 20 bucks you smell like glue well you smell like we're about to get a good deal
that's good thank you 6 p.m. ah sorry you're doing great Sammy how is the selling going I don't think anyone else has messaged so when are we supposed to meet pal I haven't confirmed yet but this afternoon oh my God it's afternoon we do not want to get stuck in rush hour traffic today no I know it doesn't really matter but it's not getting these nocta fans we want the nocta fans question for you lus are you doing Windows 10 or 11 well unlike some people I'm compatible with Windows 11 what do
you know about the other system I know that I'm compatible with Windows 11 and they're asking about Windows 10 so I say we're on Windows 11 I don't know how to scoot this fan in it's really tight okay there you go I don't want to break anything no no you're good if you break it just remember this guy's oh okay one thing I'm concerned about is we bargained with no one we tried with the gpus and they were both just like no and those were a lot cheaper than the rest of the market we probably should have
tried to bargain with 170 guy for the system but once he recognized you I couldn't bargain anymore and it wasn't worth not getting it at that point cuz we needed something we're we're going to lose CPU stuff we will I I guarantee you they'll have a better CP lus is going to take a more rounded approach I bet you his setup is going to be nicer in general I bet you he's going to have a better CPU and then we're going to come in with the like the club with nails driven through it of a 3080 be like
what's up you want to go big update we've got a new buyer his name is Budd he's willing to take the stock cooler instead of the hyper 212 but he want want the better motherboard but he's way closer and I talked him into taking the cougar c yeah let's go so let's saw get this board out of here because we're no longer using it okay and we got to get the CPU swapped and we got to get out of here and I got to put my beard back on when are we meeting him uh we're meeting him before
2:30 as soon as I told pal that I had another offer he's like well what's the deal oh all of a sudden he wants to negotiate you know what you pal in all fairness I respect the hustle I do respect the hustle respect what we did to other people in previous shows and this one messages me like bro I swear nobody keeps their word these days whatever man enjoy and I'm like if he backs out I'll let you know he goes he ain't oh so knows what a good deal it is you pal one more this cooler is
going with this board this CPU comes out though so that's our 4500 and then our 3600 is going to go in here you could throw like a tiny bit more goop on there but the goop that's on there is probably F you know what here here goop transplant oh yeah should we take a photo of it before we put it on no he he wants to boot it up while we're there wants to see it post which makes sense so what I was thinking was oh that's a lot whatever so what I was thinking was we will just build it can we try to post
it before we leave yeah do we have another Ram stick he gets one ram stick oh he gets one ram stick why am I you're building his system oh I see uh these fans um you can just basically find anywhere that looks like that and just kind of plug them in uh management who is she I don't think we're going to do Cable Management on this bad boy nice got it perfect thank you hard dri is in everything's in the reason I want to see this post before we go is that if for whatever reason this system does not
work now is the time for us to tell hey look sorry uh we can't spare the motherboard or whatever you know this is mostly Daniel's system anyway we've got his Ram his cooler his motherboard it's just the CPU from the weird Craigslist guy all right okay all my fan spin that's a good sign GPU fan spin thank you Jawa show me an output anytime buddy it's okay sometimes it takes a minute or two no HDMI signal from your device going into standby mode I wonder if it needs a bios update well we're going to
have to gamble we've got to go meet the guy let's make sure that this one posts Now's the Time hey oh there we go uh let's power it off here's what we're going to do Sammy we are going to do the world's fastest bios update I need that CPU this CPU the one that's in there so here's what I want to see I want to see this motherboard post with a definitely compatible CPU all right not stressed not stressed it's still not posting no it's stuck on CPU are you kidding me oh no no no no no this is bad did we plug
it into the GP power supply correctly yeah come on come on come on oh I think it's doing stuff it's doing stuff oh thank God okay okay I am sweating absolute buckets right now and Flash come on come on come on come on no no this is fine everything's fine what time is it at 5 to do we're still going to be okay but we have to go like now hey here we go yeah so the BIOS on this board is from 2020 so that's why it "wasn't posting with this 40,000 series" chip just hadn't had support added for
it yet this is good let's take a moment and talk about one of the great features of java if you want to skip the hassle of listing your GPU for sale on a Marketplace you can sell it directly to Jaa to help offset the cost of your upgrade hilariously after all the negotiations with the guy that we're selling this one to we actually would have gotten a very similar offer from Jawa so we could have just saved the trouble check out java. and you can also participate in the giveaways that they have lined up
for scrapyard Wars thanks for sponsoring this series Jawa what's our ETA Sammy uh 17 minutes plus sweat over a few minutes so it should be 20 hell yeah here it is I need to see it post with this chip this is it this is where we find out if it post with the 4500 mean the compatibility list says yes theoretically it's fine yes okay let's go the t-shirt's not great literally says LT on it or he just doesn't know who we are this is it hi further PC I'm just going to go into task manager and like just plug in my
mouse oh yeah no storage right no so it's not going to boot into task manager it'll just be the BIOS but it posts yeah yeah it looks good to me sounds good okay okay thank you very much have a good day thank you have a good day uh young man do you uh do you know lonus Tech tips yeah oh really would you recognize them if you saw wait no way do you want to be in the video are you serious yeah wait really hi hi I always thought if I saw you you see them in the video not recognizing like
oh if I saw them I would know now I don't we got him I didn't it's fake dude I'm not this old B old what are you trying to say right now that went about as well as it could have possibly gone Tom you missed it but this was someone who regularly watches the channel watches the podcast literally knew we were doing scrapyard Wars right now he's like I hope and still didn't make me very good good work man so what's our next stop to pick up the the desk right we need the truck
we're going back yeah we got to go back we'll pick up a chair and lunch and then come back and then at 400 p.m. it sounds like we're going to pick up the keyboard mouse keyboard mouse mouse pad okay while Luke is out getting some more stuff I was taking this to the shop to give it a dust and holy crap I am glad I did this is nasty and a fire hazard oh my God okay so we got the chair it's in the back we strapped it down I don't know how excited they were to see Duke they said nothing zero words when I got
to the door I picked it up said thanks still no response left nothing but hey we got a chair there we go a little bit better there's still a tiny bit of dust in there but I don't want to take the air compressor too hard cuz it'll spin that fan this is more than clean for kind of this top down look here and even just from the back so I think we're going to be good there we made a decision really early on because we were trying to get things shipped on time from Jawa where we were going to get a
standard SATA SSD because we weren't sure what platform we were going to end up with and if it was even going to have an m.2 slot or whatever else but that's not like a normal problem that you would have if you were doing this we're actually upgrading because we found that the best SSD option that we could find was an m.2 off of Jawa anyways luckily we've we've been able to do a bit of a swap there we found this Patriot p300 on Jawa which was great we unfortunately can't get it in time to Canada but
that's okay the judges deemed that this Intel 660p is more than equivalent enough for us to install in our system that way we'd actually have a system to turn in today thankfully I think that SSD might actually like save us saved one of our benchmarks I I still don't think we're necessarily going to win that one they might have a better platform they have a better one with like more cash or or or something we'll still lose almost certainly all the other CPU bound benchmarks but hopefully
we crush the GPU ones enough and I hope they let us put R tracing on cuz if they let us put R tracing on we will destroy  are you nervous you look nervous no I'm not nervous you look super nervous it's ddr4 right yeah you know if it doesn't work we can just plant some like thermite in there and when they go to start Benchmark we just light it all on fire and be like whoops as part of our promoting things that are available on LTT store.com each team got one of our PTM 7950 phase change thermal pads these
are a great thermal pad material from Honeywell that performs really really well super easy to apply you don't have to deal with any kind of liquid metal type nonsense it's non-conductive and we're going to use that to get really great temps on our CPU but I'm also considering maybe putting it on the GPU is it worth it to tear the cooler off this thing what's our budget so we got 130 bucks monitor mouse mouse pad desk chair and everything else this is so doable I messaged someone with a
Logitech mouse earlier did I hear P oh he's available from 4:30 to 5:30 how much is this guy 15 bucks for a Hyperion 402 maybe ask Buddy if he has a mouse pad can well he's only available from 4:30 so we need to go pick up the desk okay first and then we will go to Mouse guy well 15 bucks for a mouse pad or for a mouse right I was going to tell you I wouldn't normally bother to repaste a GPU this new it's probably fine but knowing that the judges are going to be looking at temperatures I'm going to
repaste this thing Ben Q 144 Hertz he's willing to take 70 24 in monitor comes with DVI cable and power cord DVI cable might be a bit loose but that monitor might be uh DVI only for high refresh rate as well it's disced uh specs DP 1.2 let's just do it I can stop looking at DP to DVI adapters but we have to pick up the the desk first if we want to leave we have to leave basically now you  me how bad is it it's fine nothing nothing broke okay that was fun pencil's downtime today right for the computer
hoping for five no no you'll have the computer before oh yeah yeah that's fine six is fine I'll have the computer for you before we go out again yeah ideally you and Luke will go together to hand the computer's off we have like four stops to make in the next couple hours here we need to go now but but Windows update okay Windows update this guy's down for another $5 thank you so much negotiator nice you were the best period it's possible this hard drive does not work Sammy you dropped it hey ah sorry
yeah definitely not detected I know that much I mean we don't need it I don't think we need it as long as they're not installing too large of games how much is our SSD our SSD was 20 bucks no but like how much store 256 oh that's fine should be okay can you swing by an occasionally Windows update yes I also haven't put the latest NVIDIA drivers on I can do that other than that she's tuned let's go I feel like where Samy is really going to come into her own as the superior assistant is tomorrow when
we're setting everything up to be aesthetic cuz Elijah's got a lot going for him he's pretty techsavvy very enthusiastic but aesthetic sense Sammy you got him right yeah so casual all right we are off to our last pickup of the day we are trying to get a keyboard mouse and mouse pad combo for 10 bucks then that'll leave us with just an audio setup that we need to get so we're hoping with you know basically the entire day of tomorrow we're going to be able to pick up some free speakers or
something from somewhere I won't have the makeup tomorrow hopefully whoever wants to sell it to us won't recognize me all right well Luke and Glenn are still out I am going to attempt to enable XMP we'll change that to XMP profile one let's see if our computer boots again now it's starting up again which is good oh maybe not oh oh oh oh come on bios okay that's good uh memory 3200 look at that eight oh this is getting me excited I've been very stressed just trying to get everything installed and
working like I'm I'm confident it's going to boot and I'm confident we're going to be fine but it's just I'm still nervous yeah so we're on like a 2017 bios that's not great let's update this so we got back from the keyboard mouse and mouse pad I think it's a win uh I I won't show you all the stuff now because of like dangers of driving but ooh that doesn't sound that great actually it's definitely like a cheap no back plate look at that kind of like knockoff mechanical
keyboard but it's a mechanical keyboard technically and the mouse is another one of those kind of like it looks like maybe like a final mouse or something like that it's not and we technically have a mouse pad so it's okay stuff considering we got it for 10 bucks I'm very very happy with it Mouse guy I was like would you go down to 10 he left me on red I say okay no problem I'll still come pick up around 5 now just where the devil or you going Sammy this is like a strip mall yeah it's a business they're
giving away desks and chairs and they close at 5:00 p.m. wait oh my God that would be hilarious this is my real TI's office no way what we might get an opportunity to see if I can pass to someone who knows me reasonably well hi um we were told to come here for a desk to pick up let's go we'll grab the desk first okay yeah it's pretty heavy uh Ben still work out of this office yes he does is he here right now uh he was why watch my hands all those put that corner right there yep
there we go so the green one's Greener but that one's kind of better condition yeah I think we should take the one in better condition take the take the gray one okay yeah uh do you mind if I see if Ben's around sure you can go of okay thanks so  okay hello uh the ladies downstairs said you were giving away some desk I just wanted to say thank you hey welcome recognize me yet he bought a house from you oh more than just that the getup is we're shooting a video this is one of my team
members we're filming you sorry Ben sorry to Ambush you like that anyway thanks for the desk you're welcome all right see you later Ben oh the look on his face is hilarious so Ben sold us the El the lmg office he represented us when we bought the lab yeah he sold me and Ivon our first home no we we we go way back with Ben wait DVI out on the board yeah PS2 it's like first gen ryzen bro it works okay okay oh you want know the best part to get the board updated to the latest
bios I had to do five bios updates cuz I couldn't jump from the original it was on the original normal it was on 2017 but it booted we'll see how it goes there is one fan on the Zotac that is off balance and so when it stops it'll get lopsided and then when we reboot it picks up again but I can fix it by just like kind of giving it another go should we just tape it so it doesn't ever spin so here's where we can really game the performance that Labs tests is not final performance as long as our system is
stable when we drag race it it's fine the things that Labs testing that are our final is things like noise so we take the tape off tomorrow yes I'm so  out uh well this is just cyber Punk being cyber Punk starting to take off dude we are averaging 60 FPS you murdering innocent civilians yes that's what that's a mentality we need in scrapyard Duke good training young Mike we got to use that on the streets what quality setting is we're Ultra at 1080p that's pretty sick that is pretty loud though and I don't
think we're going to be able to use side panel's not on either sure yeah that's not better at all is it kicking off a lot of heat no and the air volume is also very bad yeah these fans are pretty rinky dinky should have just taken that whole system from stratum just pulled the fans out of it cuz having no fans in the top too is like kind of rough yeah you going to be able to mess with fan profiles and stuff too yeah I mean our GPU is getting up to 87° 88° maybe we shouldn't mess with fan
profiles yeah CPU is at 50 our CPU is like fine actually taping plan was fun but when it's cranked up that was on Q yeah wow when it's cranked up the fan is fine and honestly I think we might need it yeah let's just let her be loud she's just a loud computer cuz I think people got to realize like gpus are loud push can we steal some of the sound foam what  like I think it just is loud though yeah I don't think it's going to help that much yeah I'm trying to I'm trying to
game but we got zero minutes left so I think we just got to kind of line isn't back yet so you got bit more time a cou more minutes yeah we're ready and he's late that traditionally comes with downsides I'm just saying what the downsides are varies I don't know there's been crazy ones where it was like 10% every 10 minutes or something every 10 minutes over the deadline was minus 10% I believe to your score and it sort of depends on how late he is like if you're like 5 minutes late it's like who gives
a but if he shows up at 6 that's kind of a big deal I saw I messaged them being asking what the UTA was so typical lus always late yeah I gave them permission to pick something up later but I told them they had to be back at 5: to do this so they're late for that part of it I said Sammy could pick it up till 6:00 cuz I technically they're on 10 till 600 I might just send you in Sammy for this pickup oh man like now I'm negotiating with David apparently we don't have enough storage for all the benchmarks
maybe we should have looked at what the Benchmark requirements were okay that's not going to work for tomorrow he says oh man I mean uh can we get a random hard we have to get it done by today I don't know what's going on yeah how are we going to get another Drive I mean we can afford it yeah I had no idea we were going to need more than 256 gigs so it's this complex here hey what unit was it we don't know where this what unit this guy lives and he's not responding so the mouse deal is dead
I guess so bummer now David's calling me hey David how are you I'm not going to lie I still have not looked at the Benchmark requirements I suppose it mentions that we need some amount of storage it's not specifically specified that you need a certain amount of storage um then I guess we won't get anything docked for that that's not true hold on hold on just a gosh darn minute here if it's not a requirement it's not a requirement uh it's an implied requirement that the benchmarks need to be installed
you can't have an implied requirement sir is the problem that your drive is broken yes my drive is broken but I had one working drive so I figured I was in good shape Drive Works what which one the 750 I just plugged it in and it detected right away really oh Mouse just replied sorry well then that's great so we'll use the hard drive so what I had intended to do actually was set them up as tiered storage but we can delay so Luke can go hand his PC in they can start the testing on his then when you
get back you can set up the tiered storage no I don't I don't think I'm going to be able to cuz to set up tiered storage you have to install to the hard drive can you just tell me what the benchmarks are and then uh uh I can pull it up just like you could have based on the document I sent out earlier today we have never had it in the past that you have to have all the benchmarks on the drive at a time so if that wasn't explicitly in the rules I expect there to be no penalty for this and the fact
that I happen to have a working drive it turns out that's a bonus did you really think we were going to all stand around do that or are you just playing a game uh to try and win we've done that before no I'm serious sto the amount of storage unless it's explicitly laid out is just whatever it is and you just install whatever you need when you need it when we've tested in the past okay that's what the subjective scoring is for is bring your to marage there that's going to be up to the judges but yeah it will
affect the subjective scoring yeah yeah that's fine no no I knew that um so David put whatever the most storage dependent ones are on the SSD and then put everything else on the hard drive I guess okay sounds good all right thanks David we doing this thing how much was it 15 hello Mouse guy yeah here's the mouse oh thank you great do you think you'll like this yep lots of buttons gamer yeah it's good it's my exgirlfriend oh oh sorry to hear that no no no it's fine oh then I'm glad to hear that
yeah I built a computer for her and everything so uh so 15 yeah okay how'd you learn to use uh build computers it's pretty easy like honestly if you watch on YouTube it's super easy to do what's like a good Channel yeah we got to build one right now so oh really yeah just what would we look up you think like honestly uh NCIX will do for like 100 bucks too if you're like very unsure about like what you're doing no good Channel sir I don't think NC is in business remember Express oh okay what
was that channel that uh that that you knew uh lonus Tech tips oh okay oh lus is he's really good oh okay really yeah I heard he's from Vancouver I think he's in langle yeah a really small world yeah yeah okay thank you would you want to be in one of linus' videos I mean I think you're wearing his shirt right now so really yeah really am I look like him yeah do I do I look like him yes you do are you sure yeah okay how long did it take you to recognize me I actually thought I I recognized you pretty early
and then I noticed the shirt damn the damn shirt I had the sweater in there we've been running around today man thankfully I think that SSD might actually like save us saved one of our benchmarks so it'll take a second to cook up cuz that's just what steam does our disc usage is climbing we're at 627 700 to dude I'm so happy about and like our CPU is unpacking on all threads dude if they have to download to that hard drive yeah they're screwed they're  brother okay so we're heading to our
next protocol I'm not in David's good books right now I'm kind of afraid to ask him for a favor but we might need to be allowed to pick something up a little bit after 600 today it's 5:30 not here it's a little ridiculous like it honestly probably doesn't even matter for the competition but I just I just want him to cook we did it you were ready in time we crossed the Finish Line I'm proud of our child I'd be happy with this computer me too do you think that you have the better system when compared to Linus
it's always hard to tell we saw a CPU that he was selling knowing how he tends to approach these challenges I think he'll have strong points that are weak points for us and I think we'll have strong points or are weak points for him so I really don't know how it's going to come out our strongest point is GPU our weakest point is everything else but our weakest points aren't like that weak like the CPU is pretty solid we were running some stuff like in cyberp Punk we had no CPU bound issues even with the
380 I guess we'll see how Labs deals with it cuz that's going to be the yeah the real test it'll suffer in some areas I suspect he has a better processor I think that'll be our hardest Point have you guys put any thought into the Benchmark you get to choose because we know we're CPU limited we're going to definitely be avoiding picking those games we don't we don't want to do no counter strike that's what we're currently thinking probably Tomb Raider if I remember correctly from my days
Tomb Raider scaled really well with CPU and GPU but and GPU is the big important part of that and I'm guessing because you are running a 3080 you want to have your settings cranked high resolution we would love to do raid tracing on everything we just want to put that out there right now it's 2024 you should just have raid tracing I don't understand why this is even a conversation any amount of time of our lives spent without ra tracing from here on is a waste so I I believe Tom's
Hardware said it first what is life without R tracing yeah exactly it's time to hand your system in for testing all right here it goes oh boy don't fail me now hey there brother hello m m Miss David hi I can hear you now okay we're going to arrive at our second last stop for today at 6 your second last stop at 6 well that's what I was going to tell you is it would certainly be convenient for us to do one more stop today after 6 but we we don't need to but we would prefer to do our last stop today in
costume which has a clear content benefit and then take a small time penalty tomorrow yeah fine sure all right that's about the best outcome we could have hoped for Sammy yep and what are we picking up at this spot again uh monitor sorry I just have a hard time hi uh we're here to pick up a monitor uh you can come on inside oh thank you hey sorry SC through the garage oh sorry Hi good thank you so I'll just take this or do you want to give him the cash oh thank you and then again like I was
saying though the cord is a little bit ficky so like sometimes you'll notice that it'll cut out in and out so um we have another one I think thank you very much have a great day no worries take care guys thank you take care take care I don't think you recognized us no I don't think so uh shoot Sammy didn't you say this one had display port yeah we looked it up uh I think it's a different model oh doesn't have display port this will be interesting I think what might end up happening is we might have to get a
display port to DVI adapter if we want to run it 120 Herz so we'll have to see how it goes shoot this may have been a miscalculation this monitor but that's okay that's okay overall overall it's going to be a really good package we've got a monitor wait are we at Luke's complex holy sh we are at Luke's building right now for our last pickup of the day this is Luke's response here oh there that's it right there look thank I just don't use them oh sure so there you are as long as
someone can use them then oh great thank you okay I really appreciate that no worries all right take care yeah okay all right thank you not so much as a Second Glance some nice little edifier speakers 20 bucks let's do it we made it our last pickup was at 6:30 so you can penalize us however you see fit well how do you think you did your system's basically complete we had a few options for configuration we almost ended up with a 3600 but we ended up with a 4500 ryzen processor because the speed was
almost the same and the price that we were able to get flipping our 3600 was better cuz the 4500 nobody knew what the heck it was we got our hands on a 3070 for what I thought was a pretty good deal 16 gigs of RAM XMP worked just like that needed a bios update in order for everything to be hunky dory but I think it's a great system for the price overall I still don't know how much we paid for it well we'll uh price out some Ed parts and we'll find out for ourselves but our first inspection so
far we did open it up we're actually quite surprised to see oh okay secret surpris well what's the point of me talking to him I thought he supposed to tell me how my systems doing you should have read documents I sent you I'm building a gaming PC we shared a test plan we got input from everybody on how to best break or sorry test your system it's a great gaming system it's a great gaming system for gamers I guess we're going to find out tomorrow thanks for watching this video comparison is the thief of Joy
that's what this is all about it it's very creative I give this actually a full 25 what look at these numbers though this testing that I definitely extensively did on my own before turning over the system also wow wow is that ever quiet what's my CPU Temps at hey get out of here get out I'm allowed to see this is my damn system I can look at whatever CPU temps I want get out of here
