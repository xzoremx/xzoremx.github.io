the Bros guy asks how often should you upgrade your PC parts but I'm going to turn this one around and I'm going to tell you when you shouldn't upgrade your PC you should never upgrade your PC because you saw an ad for something that promises to be so much better you should never upgrade your PC because one of your friends upgraded and you feel left behind and you should never upgrade your PC because you've got some cash burning a hole in your wallet and you're just looking for a way to spend it the only
reason you should upgrade your PC is if there's a game or application that's not running well for you and after doing some careful research you find that there is a part that can make a big difference and only you can answer that question thanks nexo for sponsoring this short you can learn about their nexo gripon case at the link in the video description
