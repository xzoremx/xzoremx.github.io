I can't believe she's finally dead yep guess I'll need a new one then but my budget for a tablet's only $300 I'd like to spend less if I can don't  you and it's a good thing I am because the budget tablet Market is a veritable Jungle full of Predators there's scummy manufacturers selling last decade's tech at this decade's pricing there's devices loaded up with adwar and spyware masquerading as deals and sure iPads are really great but sadly iPads aren't $300 or are they we scoured the bargain
bins to find the best deals and we've come up with five tablets that won't waste your money or your time and we found some big surprises for one thing budget tablet came pin Amazon is nowhere on our list this time around and for another there's this surprise segue to our sponsor Ridge it's not too late to grab a last minute gift for that friend or family member you definitely didn't forget about so get up to 40% off during ridge's holiday sale by using our Link  now let's kick things off with our sub
$100 contender Walmart's ONN 10.1in tablet the last time we looked at a Walmart tablet we called it the E-Waste special they've upgraded their creaky plastic and plastic build with metal and glass it not only feels significantly more premium than their older tablet it even feels I'd say as good as Samsung's entrance in this Roundup which is twice as expensive but while the build quality is excellent for the price point the screen resolution is just 12 1280 by 800 which is pretty low for this size it
also isn't very bright and it's not that pretty wait where did you guys get my grade four report card making matters worse the ONN has only 3 gigs of RAM which slows down multitasking to the point where even updating apps in the background can render this tablet sluggish for minutes at a time the ONN also lacks a headphone jack though it does come with a slot for expandable storage which you'll probably want to use is because this thing only comes with 32 gigs of storage 10 of which are
consumed by a surprisingly bloat-free Android 14 based operating system that is a refreshing chain from the ad-ridden experience of most inexpensive tablets which is probably the biggest argument for this thing for all of its flaws it's just $98 so at the very least we have got to give Walmart a most improved award even if it doesn't score an outright recommendation if you know that your work load will be light and your eyes aren't too judgmental or you want something that you can throw in the
backseat to shut the kids up on a road trip then this could be a perfect solution just be aware that Walmart doesn't seem to offer any promise of future software updates and the same goes for our next pick the oldo cube iPlay 50 Pro Mini we decided to look at this one after seeing a surprising amount of enthusiasm for it on Reddit and you know what it is pretty slick at least on paper basically every aspect of it is significantly improved over our $100 tablet making it better at
multitasking gaming well everything however while the internals might wow the performance Improvement really is very noticeable here the externals are a little less impressive the construction while metal lacks refinement with parts that aren't flush even the screen we actually measured as a little offc Center there's no Biometrics of any kind even if that is true of most budget tablets and the single speaker is truly aw thankfully though you can at least plug some headphones in with the 3 and2 mm
Jack and there are other things to like it comes with a combo SD and SIM card slot and the screen while offc Center isn't half bad and includes a screen protector it does suffer a fair bit when viewed off AIS but it's higher density than our last tablet making it much better for reading and watching and is a a huge upgrade overall over the ONN that is assuming you care about more than just raw size like many unknown budget Brands I wouldn't expect much by the way of customer support device updates or
accessories we're running Android 13 with a year old security patch which is a yikes but that's kind of par for the course and we were very pleased to find that unlike other budget tablets we had no issues with widevine support what's widevine you ask it's a form of digital Rights Management that's used by most major streaming services it's what makes it so that when you try to screen record Netflix it shows up black anyway the part that matters is that we were only considering devices with widevine level
one that's the level that will allow you to stream in HD rather than being stuck at 480p on Netflix moving on if software support matters more than Best Hardware for your buck you might want to take a look at our next Contender now I'm going to be real with you guys Samsung's tablet lineup is large and confusing ranging from excellent and expensive to complete dog and they seem to go out of their way to make it darn near impossible to figure out which is which for example there's the Galaxy
Tab S6 light and you might think hm okay that must be a tablet version of the Galaxy S6 phone that came out over 9 years ago but you'd be wrong the S6 tab actually came out 4 years after the S6 phone then a year after that it was cut down a little bit to become the tab S6 light but the story is hardly over that tablet was refreshed as the tab S6 Light 2 years after that and then it got refreshed again this year and is still called the tab S6 light but enough about that it's the A9 plus that we're looking
at today specifically the 8 gig ram version which we chose in hopes of getting a better multitasking experience like the competitors we've seen so far the A9 plus has a metal construction but unlike those it's lighter weight which is kind of refreshing a refreshing feeling that Fades once you start using the thing see in spite of its name brand qualcom Snapdragon processor it performs no better than the Aldo Cube and even manages to chug when just swiping between pages on the home screen I think
this has got to be a software issue I mean it has a high refresh rate 90 HZ display that looks butter smooth when you're doing other things but now that we're spending over $200 I don't really care whether it's the hardware or the software I'm a lot less willing to make excuses for any kinds of issues maybe it's the infamous Samsung bloat I mean even if we exclude the 16 Superfluous Samsung apps we got six random apps from third parties that were pre-loaded on this thing look Samsung I invited you
into my home I didn't say that you could bring all your friends don't get me wrong it's a pretty decent tablet once you remove that crap I mean the display is kind of ghosty but I would describe it as adequately sufficient the lightweight build really is easier to hold for an extended Peri period than our cheaper devices and the cameras are the best we've seen yet same goes for  speakers it includes micro SD expansion and it's even slated to get four years of software updates however it's still
clear that Samsung has cut some Corners in order to hit this price point there's no real biometric authentication no Inc Screen Digitizer for S Pen stylus support no support for decks with a monitor thanks to the USB 2 charging port also like our other budget options today it supports only Wi-Fi 5 but if you can get over the Samsung isms you've got a pretty well-priced tablet that will satisfy pretty much anyone who's using the device for primarily content consumption and you also get a robust
accessory collection that could even help you get a little bit of work done speaking of work done check out the BBL on this Lenovo like damn girl she's a thick boy with a large 11 1/2 in display eight speakers and a built-in kickstand the Lenovo tab plus is positioned as a media consumption monster and I got to say it kind of delivers the screen while not the brightest has great contrast and handles motion well not to mention gives plenty of room to multitask and the speakers wow do they ever get loud and 
they're probably the best ones in our Roundup which spoiler alert does include an iPad let's put a pin in that for now though LTT store.com and come back to the tab plus the all metal housing contributes to a very premium feel but also results in a heavy tablet that can be a bit unwieldy to single hand the integrated kickstand does help with this a lot because you can just put it down and okay this is really cool it opens up all the way to to nearly 180Â° allowing for a nice drawing or note-taking angle
with the sold separately stylus it also comes with ample onboard storage and RAM and expandable storage too and with their media Focus they also included a headphone jack but you knew there was going to be a butt the processor which it shares with the much cheaper Aldo cube is a bit of a downer especially because of the way that it holds back an otherwise well-rounded desktop mode my my biggest issue though is not the processor it's the bloatware Lenovo aggressively tries to trick you into
installing unneeded games and apps while you're setting up the device and even if you cleverly navigate their dark pattern obstacle course you will still find that the device has automatically dumped a bunch of garbage on your home screen I'm talking 17 additional apps plus an apps for you folder on the home screen where you can download even more apps that you never asked for it's confusing and honestly disrespectful but with that said the worst offenders can be easily removed and Lenovo is promising two
Android version updates and four years of security updates a pretty compelling value proposition at the usual street price of under $300 and sometimes as low as$ 250 let's just hope they don't use those updates to cram even more ads into the user experience now it's time for the big surprise at the top of our price range we've got the iPad 10th gen which unlike last time is brand new rather than recertified and is also get this pretty good it's not without flaws I mean let
he who has never removed a headphone jack throw the first stone it's got stupid apple pencil support a stupid Folio keyboard stupid slow usb2 speeds and a stupid lack of expandable storage but now that the cost of Entry has dropped to 300 bucks even below that in some recent sales a lot can be forgiven making the iPad maybe the easiest recommendation on the whole list I mean sure the so in here is four years old but unlike the rest of them at least at some point it was a flagship
tier s so which makes it more than enough for all but the most hardcore of tablet Computing and there's the screen it's still an LCD but it is a darn fine LCD it's a nice LCD panel and while Apple doesn't provide details on product support for the iPad they have an excellent track record of os and security updates with most iPads getting anywhere from 6 years or more of full OS upgrade support and thanks to Apple's Battery Replacement Service there's a solid chance that you will actually get
that kind of lifespan out of the hardware on the subject of battery life while no tablet here struggled with every one of them managing what I would consider to be all day battery life the Wallmart tablet surprisingly beat everyone else by a decent margin in our tests speaking of margins if you're in the market for a cheap tablet now is probably a pretty good time to pull the trigger at least if you're an American there is a strong possibility that tariffs are coming and you the consumer
will be the one paying the price one study showed that overseas produced tablets so all of them could go up in price by $200 on average I don't know that this will actually happen and I doubt that it would hit this price point quite that hard but what I'm getting at is cheap tablets might not be getting cheaper so if you need one now might be a good time the question is which one for the money the ONN tablet is pretty hard to beat for the money then my next best contenders have got to be the tab
plus and the iPad 10th gen whichever one you can get for cheaper if you're techsavvy I do think the Aldo Cube I play 50 mini pro offers phenomenal value for what it is but it's not the kind of thing that I would recommend for a normie relative like these ones are and on the subject of being techsavvy this is by no means an exhaustive list the budget sector is a thickle beast with sales and price drops part swaps and more so let us know in the comments what options you techsavvy folks recommend
