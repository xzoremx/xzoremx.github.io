I can't believe it after Nvidia and AMD just completely abandoned the sub $300 price point or gave us intentionally nerfed options Intel has finally done it they released the first good budget GPU in over 5 years it doesn't cut any Corners it's got 12 gigs of vram which means that new games like Indiana Jones will run properly it's relatively efficient and best of all it's got raw performance that beats the RTX 46 handily at both 1080P and 1440p if I had scripted Intel's press conference for
this thing it probably would have gone something like this 49 it's been a difficult journey to get here for team blue their first generation had famously buggy drivers with some games running poorly or even not at all which led to such low sales figures that the department has been the subject of near constant speculation that it would be cut but believe it or not they have squashed most of the bugs most of them we'll talk about that later first the tldr last time we asked viewers to
consider buying Intel Arc because we were desperate for them to emerge as a disruptor in the GPU duopoly this time we're asking you to consider Intel Arc because it's freaking awesome to the point where I would say that it is the only choice for gamers who want to spend $450 to $700 on a tower or for those folks who have waited so patiently for an upgrade to their faithful GTX 1660 or or 10 series it's time to bag up that old GPU wait wait don't throw me out yet let me out oh no sell to our sponsor
Jawa instead why let your old Hardware collect dust when it can collect cash check out Jawa below and get an extra $10 on top of your base offer until the end of this year let's start at 1080p where AMD and Nvidia are more than happy to gou you for the luxury of being able to play First St City in cyberpunk the b580 makes an impressive debut running neck and neck with the 4060 TI 16 gig a card that retails for $450 you heard me this one is 80% more expensive and check out the b 580s
direct competition the $300 460 and the $250 RX 7600 they're behind by nearly 15% and Intel's lead increases in Red Dead Redemption 2 where they improvements to Vulcan support have lifted The Fortunes of even their last generation cards and brought the b580 in line with the 7700 XT a $400 GPU this kind of utter dominance though isn't across the board in The Last of Us Part One the b580 falls back in line but then even this poor result has them beating Nvidia and amd's current Generation price competitors in
f123 AMD takes the lead but they've historically performed really well on the track and in the old but gold shadow of the Tomb Raider the b580 barely inches past the RTX 460 in average FPS and loses in 1% lows which we classify as a loss in returnal the b580 is neck and neck with the 4060 TI and the 6700 XT only taking a clear L from the 7700 XT which again I remind you is a $400 card and then finally in atomic heart the b580 sales lose some of their glorious wind but hey the most expensive
card on the charts was bound to win at least one game wasn't it looking at the overall picture Intel you've outdone yourself you've pulled off a commanding generational uplift of 55% and beaten your old Flagship even by more than 20% you've Fallen shy of the 4060 TI but the bottom line is if Gamers out there are looking to upgrade their Aging gpus for high refresh rate 1080p gaming you've given us something to finally recommend to them not just point at the least worst thing but to recommend to them
this is a truly incredible achievement for Intel and they did a lot to make it happen their new BMG g21 so interestingly they don't call it a GPU leaves no stone unturned in the search for performance improvements they've jumped to a new process node and made several architectural and Driver overhauls that Intel claims gave them a 70% Improvement in performance per core and a 50 % energy improvement over last gen which makes me wonder why did they hold back if 20 xc2 cores is good then
32 cores on a b770 would be better speaking of bigger nearly 37% of steam users are gaming at a resolution that is greater than 1080p these days and that number keeps growing as 1440p and 4K monitors continue to come down in price so can Intel compete at 1440p as well the short answer is yes across our suite of benchmarks the b580 overtakes the RX 6700 XT and narrows the Gap with the 4060 TI to just a few perc as for Intel's promised 10% lead over the 4060 well it appears they were actually being
modest across our game selection we found a lead of 20% though it is worth noting that this will vary depending on game selection starting with the famously vram hungry The Last of Us Part One the b580 holds its position on our chart embarrassing Nvidia again with the b580 is 1% lows besting the 460s average FPS shadow of the Tomb Raider demonstrates just what an incredible generational leap Intel has pulled off here and it seems like something about returnal really likes Intel because all
of our team blue cards get a nice little bump in the rankings I'm kind of running out of ways to say Intel's doing well so um in Red Dead Redemption 2 intel did bloy and in cyberp Punk they blomen the competition while making it glaringly obvious just how overdue the 1060 and the 1650 were for a valid modern 1440p upgrade with strong if not mind-blowing performance in both atomic heart and f123 it's clear that Intel has achieved what they set out to do made a killer value 1080p gaming card that's also
capable of 1440p there are some caveats even Intel admits that they don't win in every game and a motherboard with support for resizable bar is mandatory for Arc gpus and the b580 isn't a top-of-the-line Benchmark Buster so if you have a higher tier older card like a 3060 TI you shouldn't feel compelled to upgrade here but as far as downsides go those are pretty minor and there's more to like than just the raw performance let's talk about Ray tracing which is a little more relevant these days all of a
sudden than it used to be especially when you consider the games are starting to list rate tracing as a minimum requirement while we didn't have time to develop a test for our boy Indie we did check out the RT performance in a few other games tracing those Rays still results in a significant performance hit but nvidia's mature and well supported RT Tech allows them to beat the b580 in a big way in atomic heart at 1080p in returnal the b580 catches right back up to the 4060 TI but falls back into the
pack in f123 overall you can have a solid plus 60 FPS R Trac gaming experience a assuming you're willing to fiddle with the settings just a little bit speaking of which alra settings at 1440p that's beyond the reach of pretty much every card we've tested today the entire lot failing to break 60 FPS average in any title but the extra vram on the b580 earns a a sizable lead over the 4060 in returnal and in f123 even if it can't pull out a win in atomic heart amd's RX 7600 o it's basically crying in
the corner trying to figure out why it's even here and if you're wondering where the flagship R tracing title cyber Punk is well uh we had some Intel problems it seems to not like running at Ultra Ray tracing settings on CPUs with 3D vcash but before you start hanging Intel about game compatibility they are aware and they are working on it look Mom we made the patch notes and since the launch of Arc compatibility has massively improved Hardware box recently showed in a test
of 250 games that 233 were completely playable there were still issues and some of those were in major titles that took a lot longer to fix than we would have liked but hopefully Intel will continue this upward Trend in compatibility now knowing the price and the 1440p performance numbers you wouldn't expect this to be a 4K gaming card and you'd be right it's not a 4K card even in low settings in cyberpunk we don't see great frame rates at least not natively but Intel's got some more
tricks up their sleeves desperate to not completely miss the boat on the AI boom Intel has packed some juicy AI into the b580 in order to up its performance oh I guess if I'm going to talk about AI I might as well dress the part with my tech bro vest from LTT store.com Intel's AI powered render enhancement sauce comes in the form of xs2 xss 2 has three main parts an AI upscaler that renders the game at a lower resolution then uses AI to upscale to your display resolution xss frame
generation which creates extra frames by interpolating Visual and in-game Vector data and then taking the two frames and making a middle point to enhance animation smoothness and a latency reduction component that helps to cancel out some of the extra latency from the aforementioned frame generation in fewer words they've invented Nvidia dlss Nvidia frame gen and Nvidia reflex and what's nice is that unlike the time that AMD invented Invidia reflex with anti-le plus Intel has implemented this in a way
that the game developer bakes it into the game meaning you won't get permaband for turning it on we're not going to be doing a deep dive into image quality at this time but we will'll be looking at performance and we will make some anecdotal remarks about image quality xss has already proven itself to be a solid upscaling technology and xcss 2 successfully builds upon that Foundation when turning on super sampling to its highest quality level in cyberpunk 2077 at 1440p Intel wins an FPS thanks to the
raw performance advantage that they already had but their super resolution solution doesn't scale as well Nvidia sees a performance uplift of 42 and 32% in the lows and averages respectively while while intel only gets around a 20% boost we see the same Trend at 4K the b580 doesn't gain as much performance from xss as Nvidia does from dlss but wins by just being a more powerful card the 4060 though it doesn't even hit 30 FPS here but the story changes a bit in f124 the only title currently available
for us to test XS 2's frame Gem and this is where things get wacky in this game the upscales are better matched but in frame gen it's a blowout Intel is introducing way more generated frames with performance skyrocketing to 70% over the upscale result and double over native rendering and it is almost indistinguishable from native rendering unless you really know what to look for and if you ignore those Tire artifacts that arise from the upscaling not the frame gen it's weird it has doubled the
FPS with barely a drop in quality heck you can even get over 100 FPS at 4K with xss turned on granted Intel probably worked pretty closely with the devs to make sure that this launch title would leave a good impression but a good impression is a good impression while Intel pitched this as a gaming card first and formost they did include some other value ads like their enhanced media engine that now supports more codex than Nvidia or AMD in modern av1 encoding we can see a clear generational
uplift but Intel can't quite match the speed of nvidia's nank encoder and it's worth noting here by the way that while AMD does compete on this chart it does so by outputting the wrong resolution 1920x 1082 and yes that is a hardware level problem yikes in the more ubiquitous h264 the b580 snatches the crown although margins are pretty small across the board here now thanks to their Optics rendering blender sees some good old fashioned Nvidia domination at least on the cards that have rt cores
and interestingly the b580 performs significantly worse than Intel's last gen cards Intel told us this is expected but didn't really go into why our best guess then is that it's due to the relatively smaller number of XE cores on this card compared to the last gen but that didn't slow it down in gaming so yay gaming moving into our AI testing nvidia's dominant position means that most AI software is developed with Cuda in mind making it easy for folks at home to get up and running quickly the good
news is things are getting easier for AMD and Intel users and if you want to run some computer vision large language models or image generation at home you can probably get it working on your non- envidia GPU in a few extra steps and generationally Intel has made a massive leap in performance taking the lead in our stable diffusion image generation Benchmark by a pretty big margin in computer vision it loses to the 460 although just barely so if you can get it running it works great as long as you
don't mind using a bunch of power to generate a portrait of your ant as an actual ant speaking of power we haven't even talked about power yet the physical PCB of our card is stinky and Intel takes advantage of this by implementing a new flowthrough cooler design thermals are well under control with the hot spot on the b580 never passing 76° in either synthetic or gaming workloads the b580 is targeting a TDP of 190 Watts that's 25 watts more than the RX 7600 and 460 TI and 75 Watts more than the 4060
non-ti so it's clear that even with all of their improvements Intel does have a ways to go with Nvidia pulling off a clean Victory when it comes to Performance per watt even if Nvidia doesn't seem to understand what performance per dollar is the b580 uses just one pcie 8 Pin for power so you won't need to upgrade your power supply that is unless you have a power supply that is less than 600 W even though it should only draw a Max of 225 Watts with that power connector we saw some
transient spikes up to 241 watts in F1 that is significantly higher than Intel's advertised 190 Watts so in conclusion maybe it's just cuz it's been so long since we've seen a great budget card but man I'm excited like how many times have I had to say well you could buy this shiny new thing but it kind of sucks and you'd be way better off going with something last gen or secondhand or just not upgrading at all well not today I mean eBay deals obviously still exist but but this is a new GPU that doesn't
suck with modern features and it's worthy of Celebration even if intel is a little late to the party see the thing is AMD and Nvidia are poised to release their next generation of gpus early next year so it isn't out of the question for a couple of companies that have had their stock prices double or 10 uple to make a move to Nuke Arc B series from orbit also the looming thread of tariffs could impact the affordability of these cards but hey it's going to be a pretty sweet ride up until that time it's a
great GPU that will give you great performance without destroying your wallet hold on scrap that bulky wallet anyway because a sponsor Ridge is having a holiday sale you can get up to 40% off lots of people here already use rich and I'm going to buy some for people who don't but lonus is paying for it well lus is filming on set I've been hiding under here just as expected his old and buky wallet fell out just like that I cookie shop at rich.com and recycle L's all wallet oh well thank you this is for
me thank you now you know how to be popular check out rid's holiday sale we'll have the link in the video description if you guys enjoyed this video go check out our review of the original Arc the benchmarks and graphs aren't really relevant other than to give you the context for how far we have come this is truly a wonderful achievement for Intel and for the world and Canada 249
