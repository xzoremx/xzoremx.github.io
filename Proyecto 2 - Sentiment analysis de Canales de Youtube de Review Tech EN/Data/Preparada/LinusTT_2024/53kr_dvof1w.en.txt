welcome to Scrapyard Wars where Luke and I compete to build the best computer on a fixed budget and this year it's going to be interesting because we get to play with an enormous $800 including a hundred bucks to spend on whatever we want from our sponsor Jawa at the end of the week our setups will be put through the ultimate Gauntlet to find out who wins scrapyard Wars yeah go go go do I keep all the   what this year the rules are mostly the same except for one major change our
teammate can make pickups after the 5:00 p.m. cutoff we'll be bringing them in shortly we still aren't allowed to research or plan off hours nor are we allowed to use our industry connections or our influencer clout for deals which has become harder as the channel has grown and my face has become a bit of a meme that is why our first stop is a  unusual there's actually one more change this year you're not building just a computer you're doing a full gaming setup for $800 oh so like monitor
keyboard mouse yes oh I can do that desk chair desk too easy unless he defines chair I'm just going to show up with a log I don't need to Define anything cuz there's three parts to the score there's going to be Labs testing there's going to be subjective judging and then there will be a benchmark drag race at the end oh so you need to oppress the judges with your setup well that is harder than isn't it yeah oh it kind of gives you a box or nose we're going to put on a few
small pieces to agid you a little bit Yeah cuz that's what I need make you look a little bit more tired grumpy Haggard biker yeah and you're a biker you're probably getting all that hitting you clearly I'm a little ways off from my close up but that doesn't mean I can't start working on my plan of attack we know the first name's Duke what do you think for the last name I think you kind of mentioned offand a bit ago Sons of Anarchy there was like teller Dax Morrow Morrow Duke Morrow I like Duke
Morrow that's a good one you know what the end result for the makeup supposed to be have you given any thought to your identity as this finalized person not even a little bit it might be time to do that pick what bike does Duke Morrow ride I like that one okay Luke has a full Alias ready to go what I'm probably just going to cheap out and just be my grandpa boo you need a whole identity my grandpa's cool I have a whole identity I'm John I'm from the Prairies as is tradition we start by
scoping out the usual secondhand marketplaces Facebook has come up in a big way since the last time we did one of these craigsl is like dead now man looking at gpus over on Facebook right now I'm kind of wondering if my $100 on jawwa would be best spent just getting a decent GPU and then fighting my way through like crappy old Lenovo pre-builts that are local honestly so far finding the things on Jawa seems the easiest but I'm trying to make sure that I look everywhere we'll shop around a
6700 XT is like $400 Canadian Dollar on Facebook and as low as $240 on Java so it's like $320 bucks wow oh yeah aside from pricing there's a couple talking points uh put the market in the hands of Gamers you can find parts pre-built systems new and used and they've got individually vetted verified sellers so that's probably what I'm going to want to go with so I can make sure that we get it shipped up here in time that's exactly right are we considering things like shipping cost
and stuff like that no no no no we're getting it like expedited so it'll arrive tomorrow they're not actually available in Canada they're making an exception for us I kind of wish they were though looking at this right now meet your teammate what's up brother name is Duke Meo Duke so I've got a bit of a bad update for you okay turns out um never buying your own computer components and not reviewing computer components for I think 5 years since the last Gra spred Wars means I have no idea what's going
on the what I've done is nothing well I have some good news okay I have a plan that I think will win us the game brother there's a whole bunch of mom and popop Tech shops or even just small Tech shops that do like small to medium businesses they have recycling piles oh we could probably just call them so get as much get like BC cases power supplies things like that when I was working at a place several years ago they were recycling eighth gens CPUs whoa I love this one thing that I was doing actually
was Googling around for recycling places because something that won me a scrap R wars in the past was finding free geek yeah yeah totally free geek is closed now oh yeah I forgot about that wo I like this deal what the hell is this Tower only 250 bucks core I 78700 32 gigs Ram this is obviously a custom build comes with a tower cooler woah wo cic 520 wat power supply dude I should just go buy this I might not even keep all that stuff I like 4 days I can flip some of that stuff we're going to turn a
paperclip into a house let's go I'm going to be super formal in my communication I think that's going to be part of my Persona I don't have a lot of money what does he want to oh he wants to play fortnite I'm going to spell it wrong thank you John okay send message we're going to see how it goes apparently presentation is some amount of the judging I don't know how much like if we end up with kind of an ugly computer M my idea was that we hide it by like desk mounting the computer
basically and I have found a desk that had like cable management holes in it and all that kind of stuff that was free it says pickup available today so we should offer like now it's in Langley too so it's nice and close overdale this guy's like yeah just come by and pick it up so we will go pick it up today h this is interesting what the hell is a ryzen 54500 oh wait do I have a message back already I'm not a gamer you need to look at the specs and draw your own conclus
clusions sorry can you advise if this is the best deal you can offer me all right well he got back to me really fast that's a big improvement over the Craigslist days what do I want my angle to be I got to impress the judges if all I had to do was build a fast computer no problem who are the judges can we cater to the judges yeah I'll tell you the judges it's Nicole plof and Riley okay so plof we need a good Monitor and keyboard Riley is going to want minimalism I want to make sure that we
try to spend nothing on desk chair things like computer case stuff like that but we should still try to do cool things with it I should start figuring out what I'm going to expect to pay for like a desk I mean it's got to be free right oh it's free as things that I'm a little bit concerned about is peripherals and monitor Labs won't be uh testing the monitor they'll just be testing the computer but the the monitor will be more sub experience wao this monitor is 300 HZ for
$175 honestly you might want to even just send it that's really good it's a 24 in 1080p 1 millisecond IPS slow motion dude I can get leftover paint for like five bucks like if I like painted up the walls near my setup and stuff I think that'd go a long way there's one system on Jawa that's like really sick it's like legitimately pretty well specked out my my biggest concern was that's American basic our budget I think that'd be like $800 yeah so you have to get like a free monitor free mouse free
keyboard free desk free chair R it 400 bucks man there's some deals of course C Sonic Focus gm550 man will not come with storage okay that's what's missing on this buddy for 400 all right hi just sending some messages sending some messages High lus never better oh  okay it was the reverse of what happened when he shaved his beard off honestly things are going a little rough okay for team lonus and Sammy okay I found a couple of pretty good deals they are not responding to me oh I found one okay
deal Buddy needs 2 hours of notice but it's for a core i78700 which is okay yeah that's like worse than mine and I play games that run out of hamster wheel so what I really want is a ryzen 3000 Series there's a couple good deals out there one of them I can call but I think it might be actually better if you place the call so guess what you're up now we need a store you're my daughter-in-law so that's why you're communicating for me okay I'm trying to buy a gaming system for my grandson I
guess he's your son then I'm 23 you could have a son yeah biologically speaking look I'm not saying you're a responsible daughter-in-law I don't have a lot of money I'm a pensioner okay you have reached mailbox number we're going to text I guess that makes it a little bit easier okay um okay go uh stand by what I mean you're good for now are you sure you're old man finger store should I type it off if we get the whole computer for free we could spend the rest of the budget just on ploof monitor
his current monitor that he has I'm down but that all depends on you getting it for free so why don't you call the tech shops yeah maybe I should and see if they have a Rec seconding pile they let you dig through this person's mailbox is full you can okay I guess we're calling somewhere else so Luke is also doing this right now you have reached mailbox number 64 hey there I was just calling I just heard back from uh buddy with the $400 3600 machine it's got a 1660 super in it
already we could probably flip that for a few bucks b450a Pro Max 16 gigs rip Jaws 3600 Focus 550 W power supply Serenity Now nice looking case Okay lots of nice looking fans and stuff will not come with storage exclamation mark that's fine we can find storage I worry that this place is going to know my voice though cuz I've definitely G you got me do it hi there bit of a bit of a long shot but I've just been calling around trying to see if uh any of the computer shops have like a recycling
pile or something if you've got anything you were planning on recycling if I could sift through it that would be fantastic yeah I could I could ask one of the the bosses would I be able to give you a call back yeah absolutely I I really appreciate it what was your name L uh duke duke duke yeah okay I'll give you a call back okay thank you holy crap What's Your Name dke by the way they probably know who you are cuz I've been there and they've talked about lmg so this might be a
little bit interesting I hope they don't agree to do it just because they might have a sense of who you are if they do it should be fine cuz it's free right not really oh I suspect it would be against the spirit of the competition ah I see but I'll try to be pretty convincing this buddy has no GPU in it okay but does have storage okay oh God what's this now I can help you out with that if you're not the most text having oh that's so helpful I am asking my daughter inlaw to have a look at your
listing for me she is quite knowledgeable no pressure though what do you mean no I put things together I've made one PC that's it you know how to graph data visualization right yeah I could do that on a MacBook what time would we be looking at I I don't mind this one ideally we should be picking up at least something today or it's going to be a big waste of Tom's time to make me up can we come in oh uh uh uh uh no pressure an hour can we come takes an hour to get there 1.5 hours we're going to immediately
flip this GPU okay cuz we're going to pick up something else but we got basically everything else that we need here other than storage so we just got to find storage do we have we don't have one oh okay so you just wanted something else mhm where do you want to meet up oh God we're going to need like an outfit for me by then well we're committed now Sammy should we call Black laab Glenn that's the guy who uh we did like buying out the mom and pop tech shop give it a shot I'll give a call we'll see if Keith
answers they picked up my recycling last week ah okay yeah I'm going to ask him if he can do $25 off but I feel like I might have committed already am I going to be one of those guys that shows up $50 short and is like well do you want it or not no I hate those people I actually hate them I would be like I don't know this man someone just reached out to me so I'm not sure that's Luke they just low balled you they sound like a jerk pleasure doing business with you that sounds very Boomer I know well it's
what I'm going for man yeah no response from any of the tech shops I'm going to feel so dumb if we buy a 3070 knowing we can get the rest of the parts for like nothing I agree so overall update we're debating on buying 3070 on jawwa and it is well priced on Java it is actually well priced uh compared to our local area right now but the issue we're potentially seeing is if we spend that little of our budget on a 3070 and we get the rest of the computer for very cheap we could have theoretically bought
a 3080 and so now we're trying to weigh our options of should we just bite the bullet and get the 3070 should we wait for for this one of the tech shops to call us cuz maybe they'll say yeah come look through our recycling pile well we could buy the 3070 hear me out do you think someone here wants to buy a 3070 we sell it to them for $20 more that is actually fine you I don't think we could sell it in in in the company but if we were able to flip it on Facebook market like a day
and a half yeah cuz it's it's showing up from java if we buy that stuff has happened by the way yeah it's just very hard let's see 3070 okay what's a 3070 going for 2300 wo wo wo $260 is this just like an amazing deal the only thing we're going to get that might be better would be if we could get a 6800 XT okay I don't think "we're getting that maybe a 6,800 XT what" about a 3080 equivalent AMD card that's what I'm looking for right now got it oh man I'm I'm a little scared to just take
the first deal I see on Java but like I think this is like the best deal if Luke doesn't get this I think he's like boned the thing is that like I feel like if it's the official store they would have tested it question mark that's true cuz that's like a big chunk of change right and we can't get it back still going with that then yeah I'm I think we're still going to go with it found 100 Herz 1080p 22in monitor for 50 bucks or we get that monitor that we saw that super
Overkill monitor cuz if we get a 3070 or 3080 it'll be able to drive it but then that monitor is 100 Canadian it was yeah it and it's all the Java money so we would only have 600 bucks left which then would be 500 for a 3080 so we' have $100 $100 for the rest of the system and peripherals there is a $75 one it's 24 in 144 that's sick isn't it yeah 75 bucks and then we have 25 bucks still on Java so spend it on that SSD what's the most we can get for the max price of 25
bucks we can get a 256 SATA or a 256 m.2 sheesh brother or we spend 28 so we go $3 US to Canadian and we get a 480 sat you want to do that I think that's that seems pretty good to me okay we need to find out what the cheapest SSD we can get is oh wait buddy here has tons of them okay no no we can yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah okay so we can we can get them for 20 bucks Canadian locally now we're trying to make a commitment on the GPU so that we can have a pricing for the rest of the system but we don't want to
actually spend the money so we're going to ask someone if we can make an agreement to buy the card and say can we pick it up tomorrow with full intention to actually do that but by saying we're going to pick it up tomorrow we're buying ourselves the time to figure out if it's even technically possible so that is 100% the goal we're not going to try to bail on this person um but we want to lock in the deal $380 and 800 system is insane I can pick it up tomorrow is there any wiggle
room on the price smiley face I don't know if I'm deleting the smiley face I don't know if Duke Mero would send a smiley face oh sorry yeah you're Duke c i oh I never checked my email whoo whoo whoo wo I heard back from this guy I'm 3 after 6 today okay original Craigs List oh whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa okay but it only comes with 8 gigs of RAM but it has a better motherboard it has a Quadro 600 that's like really old I think Quadro 600 is worth $5 where do you see 4500 u in the
posting I mean it says 4500 that's not a CPU wait what the H is a ryzen 54500 oh it is a desktop chip how okay with bending the rules are you we're okay with that what if we like bought this and then we went on like a selling spree over the next bit because I I think this deal is crazy okay like I think this guy has no idea what this stuff is worth there's five noctua fans the noctua fans are worth $200 I say we do it okay and then we sell stuff and then we have to sell stuff to get back under budget
okay Luke would do the same thing I don't know if we actually want to go with his name but hey young Mike such a stupid name what's up if I come pick up today at 6 can you give me $20 off see this isn't so much a budget management exercise as a cash flow management exercise because the jawwa cash hasn't left our wallet so as long as by the time the jawwa card arrives and the cash is back in our wallet by then then we're good okay right I didn't hear anything and I we'll allow it cuz it sounds interesting
okay okay okay okay between these two deals I think we're in really good shape because like Orizon 3600 is worth like 90 bucks this's all mental math which is not my specialty have you seen the tattoos wa you got one by your eye damn your nose is huge I can't get over the nose the nose is pretty huge this side is enormous yeah I really don't look that different I think if I put a hat on though yeah a hat would help here we go here we go we heard back okay sure sure sure 20 bucks
off we just got 20 bucks off let's go $20 is the difference between Victory and crushing defeat okay in scrapyard Wars $20 is the difference between cute desk and not cute desk that's true and it'll get us points with Nicole right cuz she has a cat right yes I'm still on your head all right let's do it I think you should do it you want me to shave his head you should shave his head why are we even why are we doing this at all does he need to be convincing as well is Linus's person also getting disguised is
that a no the problem is Elijah is actually kind of recognizable uh we do need to go to our first Port of Call very soon though here's what I'm thinking Sammy okay do you want to make a quick trip to the Valley Village we have a separate budget for clothes for our outfit okay you got to help me out here I'm fine if you try to actually style it you don't have to go straight bald what does style it mean I don't know do a lower taper fade straight bald  know I already regret it I don't know if
this is the right time to say it I've never cut anyone's hair in my entire life if you want to see the uh the full you know uncut version of me brutalizing Elijah's hair uh check it out on Flow playay and if you're not subscribed there has never been a better time we're going to be releasing every part of scrapyard world a little bit early on the platform and that's on top of all the incredible content we have cooking at lm. g/f flat plane but wait there's more if you're itching for even more
scrapyard Wars goodness Jawa has an entire giveaway campaign running right now they gave us a sneak peek and I got to say you're going to want to check it out for yourself that's at the link below now back to the video sorry I'm a little focused right now but yeah check it out I appreciate him being focused oh my God that's a lot of hair I'm giving young Mike a buzz what does that say I don't want to this rip okay I don't want it to be like  something we're here at Valley Village
line is giving $50 in cash I was tasked to specifically get him a hat we'll see what embarrassing things I can put him in there his named BJ but he wears socks with sandals at the office so I don't know how much worse it can get $ 13.99 we'll go with this I'm an adult but not like a real adult I think this one is more fitting of a boomer man with a daughter-in-law who's 23 years old sold how much is this one $7.99 it' be really funny if we had a fedora his head's kind of small isn't it maybe we
do have to go with a cap then we'll go with this one it's very beige and sad pants are hard cuz the thing is like he's so short so I think getting shorts is like the safer option here khaki might work like he goes boating and fishing every once in a while he sold his house for $3 million even though he "bought it for 150,000 it matches" okay we're good you look like that could just be your haircut yes I did it I mean same with you I just look like I got you mentioned it I think
you said it well I just look older and like I had some bad decisions what do you mean great decisions now look here young man my God he looks way different than I do you don't look that different you look older we're we're hoping a a hat is going to be a big part of the sale I haven't I have not seen myself yet to be fair you look older as well as oh my God you just look a lot older I feel like you've maybe got a bit of Advantage here cuz people will be like nice to the old grandpa trying to
buy a computer for probably what I'm assuming you're going to say is you're like young gosh I never thought of that oh you just gave him advice no trust me he was going to do it anyways I'm buy a PC for my grandson yes yeah have you seen the neck one yet oh not bad actually I like that yeah it's good you should get neck tattoos no you know you can have hats from here right oh a pirate hook what Elijah whose team are you on you could also just wear a freaking helmet you know what that sells the look
a lot that I'm going to leave and get in my car no you want to go with like the Canadian flag the Canadian flag is really good this hat is definitely too small for me I think it was a child-sized  what your laugh is so distinctive though I got to not laugh found any good deals yeah actually I didn't nice I got no good deals nice all right see you later  you hi there honey give me a kiss wow that's actually like very realistic not bad huh no it's pretty bad how's it going I mean how's it going
young whipper snappers my goodness you young people it's inspiring seeing y all working so hard in here the visual change is actually people won't recognize you I think I've seen the other team and they look very much like the other team look at that Callin speechless dad well you have a hat but I bought you a dad hat which also might work we got to go basically like immediately so I'm just going to thr this is a shirt it still had the tag on it doesn't really matter what it says because I grabbed you a
sweater I grabbed you a sweater okay maybe we'll throw the sweater on and then I grabbed you like khaki shorts cuz I wasn't I didn't want to buy long pants and have them be too long because okay you know so good luck go I made sure that they didn't have weird stains or holes on them so thanks we are headed to Valu vage or Value Village to try to get the rest of my costume like the clothing portions of my costume Elijah is off to go pick up the desk and potentially other things from some Warehouse I'm
hoping he can come out with a desk and a chair now my eyes ain't what they used to be I I think we're I think we're going to turn right up there is that right all right what's this accent hold on hold on let me let me try again you should have gotten uh coaching from Gary I don't think any of these beat the Canada hat and I close enough to the  now yeah is it actually work yes we just get this and then I can check what shirt I have in the car and go nice yeah well this is it yeah first deal am I going to
pass I hope so if you just like look down maybe hopefully he's taller than you so that's rich coming from you uh am I going to get away with this   sorry um so we're yeah we're here to pick up the PC our success hinges on selling some of the components that we' bought his name is John isn't that lius I didn't tell you this but I'm $80 over budget do you think he's faking selling stuff this listing is being reviewed did Luke report it that would be quite the actual move sorry for being difficult here
