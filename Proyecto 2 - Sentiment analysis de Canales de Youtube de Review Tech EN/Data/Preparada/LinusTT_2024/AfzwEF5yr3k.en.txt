with the help of our sponsor life's wave electric toothbrush we are giving David's extreme home upgrade machines the full treatment I'm talking coolant change de gunking o-ring lubrication by the end of this you guys are going to know how to get your liquid cooling system running as good as new no matter how scary it is oh my God can't believe I just put my mouth on that what is that "we've never Revisited a $5,000 Tech" upgrade but looking at this I feel like I should be keeping a closer eye on you
guys this is disgusting my favorite is you can see the line where I once dusted but then it's now been dusted over so there's like mhm beautiful texture of dust I might have been responsible for this zip tie was I I think so yeah this is kind of a roast of you I like that no no I didn't pick the parts for this is any water even getting through here yeah I think the first thing we're going to do assuming that we didn't configure our loop with a drain Port is pop one of our tubes in a way that oh it's easy to
catch all of the water now to ensure that my instructions are clear and complete we're going to have David work on his second system while I work on the main one you might not remember but this is actually the second episode of lonus cleans David's tech for free one of my favorite tricks to clean out a loop especially one that you're about to    God can't believe I just put my mouth on  alive much better funny note about their packaging by the way when I first saw this I was
like wow they really ripped off Apple packaging and then I found out they are literally using the same Factory  uh it's a quick way to get everything drained out so that when you disconnect your hoses they don't start leaking water all over the place because even once you've drained the reservoir radiators can hold a significant amount of water now look if you're looking at this so far going oh my God I want to let you know a little secret water cooling is not necessary to have a great
gaming experience I happen to love it it's one of my passions and if you're a silence Enthusiast or you just like hot rotting things for fun you might want to take the plunge but the reality is that the inconvenience generally outweighs the benefit while no one really likes talking about it least of all the manufacturers of aios all kinds of water coolers can require maintenance in order to perform their best now the additives that they put in the coolant and the low paracity tubing that they use in these
all-in-one Solutions should keep them running Gunk free for many years but if you read the fine print many generally means something like three or five and I know a lot of people who expect more than 5 years of dependability from their coolers so while we're focused on custom water cooling some of these same principles could be applied to an aiio that is no longer performing its best what's interesting is I don't see where these flakes came from in either the CPU or GPU block I don't know if that's
reassuring or even scarier let's see how nasty my CPU block oh yeah oh shoot did you get CPU temps before we started because I didn't know it was this gross I didn't think we were going to need that I promise you cuz I've seen it before that this would have a multi-degree impact on cooling performance basically this acceleration plate right here the slit down the middle of it is completely jammed and the water that's coming into this block is not able to get at the fins very well
it's slowing it down significantly we need this loop Clear and we need this block clean yuck I do have to question the overall complexity of your setup here David you've got the gaming machine and then you've got if I recall the nz/ capture PC that's right virtualization yeah the idea was that I could game unfettered on the gaming computer and then stream and capture at the same time on this uh but how long did that last not very long I went to an older system that I had that's a little
higher end uh and I've been running that but every time that I've needed to upgrade or fix or change it I don't even want to think about it I just like shove in the back ignore it what was your biggest mistake water cooling and that's a really good point almost no one has a system that has compromised nothing on reliability and performance whether it's a cheap HBA or a low-end motherboard and so often I see budget wasted on RGB or liquid cooling that could have been spent much more
effectively elsewhere so did you learn a valuable lesson at least David oh yeah that lonus will fix all my problems if I wait long enough and pitch a good video thanks lifein for that you get the manual toothbrush and I get the lyen so we can do our comparisons I don't remember ever seeing anyone else recommend this stuff but I've always liked Brasso for cleaning my blocks it's compatible with Copper Brass duh aluminum chrome nickel and it contains a fine abrasive that helps to remove even
tough oxidation and build up to get the Brasso off we're going to need a hit of some other soap I guess now's a good time to mention the IP 7x water resistance of this toothbrush not every electric toothbrush is waterproof one  later not bad you can see around the outside it still looks scummy but if you look closely you see copper through it so that's not something sitting on the surface we've actually worn through the nickel plating there's nothing I can do to fix that with a toothbrush
okay so we both did pretty good but getting into those little crevices there there is no question that even though mine are finer I was able to clean them better I mean look this is not a life end talking point you talk to any dentist they're going be like yeah you should probably use it like yeah because they freaking work of course if whatever Gunk we found in our Loop ended up being organic we can't just clean the parts that affect performance or it's just going to grow back so the next part I
want to clean is this acrylic top now my understanding is you can actually use Brasso for that as well but you can also use household cleaner or a headlight polish like this one whatever you do do do not use alcohol or it'll end up looking like this you know I'm going to take a shot with the Brasso and then we'll try those Plastics stuff dang Brasso you awesome and life and I guess you guys help too check that out that is really good that took 2 minutes now that David's done a round of manual
cleaning liyen boasts that with their app you can configure their brush to oscillate up to 60Â° and it has 10 levels "of power that vibrated up to 66,000" times a minute using their proprietary servotech they claim it's three times more powerful than the competition so let's see if we can take his block to another level David I had it at like 30% before that was plenty of power uh okay yeah I actually have been using using this thing for a couple of weeks now and that's the first thing I noticed
about it it's like holy crap is this thing ever powerful not going to lie David everything you did kind of a waste of effort that's a lot better yep again there's absolutely discoloration on the Block but that's copper that's where the nickel plating has been worn Away by the erosive power of water looking great do you think brass will safe on this painted stuff I think this is anodized aluminum I'm pretty sure when I looked it up it was not but it might be let's see Z mini z mini I mean I can find out
for you how do you find out it's aluminum so there's but that's not even the loop that was having the issues it will I think this GPU block might be a little bit wonky there's like it's like where it's oxidized I thought that was dirty but now I'm not have you hit it with the toothbrush oh I've hit it with the toothbrush that's what happens when you mix Metals I didn't mix the metals yeah so it eats away at the aluminum and then I believe it deposits on the copper on the copper the good news is I wasn't
actually really planning on using this card the bad news is I was planning to sell it and now I can't really do that now that my Block's as good as it's going to get it's time to put it back to get wait double check make sure a that you've got all of your O-rings in place because if they're not you're going to have water shooting everywhere inside your PC and and number two if you're a smart boy you're going to want to give them a quick lube before you reassemble them we use the cinko stuff but anything
silicone not petroleum based should do you just fine for those of you who do Automotive work this won't be new information but when you are reassembling anything with a lot of Fasteners you're going to want to go in a star type pattern to ensure that you're not just cranking one side causing the oing to slip out on the other side and then cranking that down leaving it in a position where it's going to CA a league oh I'm so happy with this result I'm a little behind David I think he's actually done his GPU
block already but you know what I say quality first now we find out if David's going to get some really bad news losing  3080 all right I have more bad news oh I don't like that this block cannot be meaningfully cleaned without us pulling out like the heat gun and undoing the adhesive on this and ripping these two pieces off are we doing it I think it needs to be cleaned you saw what was in this Loop yeah let's do it all right the resale value goes also this is acrylic
oh our temperature control is not going to be great so you break my 380 what happens well look no you're going to do it no I advising you as your veterinarian that your pet needs surgery oh God if it's you're telling me to do surgery on my dog I'll be there every step of the way I don't want the liability oh my God David what are you doing I might have put too much Lube no you did put too much Lube who taught you how to do this Alex you no I did you said put it on your fingers and rub it
through and that's exactly what I did I said put it on your fingers and run it through yeah you just you didn't tell me how much to put here that's the problem oh my specificity Linus now I'm teaching you how to teach who's the master  little hey hey hey hey there we go yeah buddy cuz this one's not all corroded and stuff so you can really see what a good job you can do with that there you go woo not bad huh almost as shiny as my toothbrush we've already talked about the numbers that are possible thanks to
the sophisticated servos with tech that life and claims has only ever been used in robot arms before now but it also uses hall effect sensors to generate consistent brushing power and that helps it hit that 60Â° oscillation within an accuracy of 0.1 de which is pretty cool when you see the price I've been using one for about a month now I've been really pleased with the results of it and I've only had to charge it once in the entire time that I've had it you remember your janky solution for this
pump no strip the wires and shove them into here oh yeah and you were like replace the cable I'm like what what cable the pump yeah you just take this and then you uh you know put a mered on it and then you get a Molex and you put a mered on that and then you make a Molex end for it sounds like sounds like something that never happened no it happened I just disassembled it for the video oh it stinks the pump stinks oh God that does stink it's green is it possible that we had no bioside on
the day of the shoot and I said hey make sure you throw some bioside in here it's been drained and filled a couple times so every time I move I drain it cuz this just they're so heavy with water in it so I think I actually did put iodine in it the first time but not the second two times and now he knows just in time for him to never water cool again yeah looks it's a little worse for the wear but the inside is clean and for that matter so is the back which means now is a perfect
time to replace our thermal goop it's generally good for five plus years but David never does maintenance and I'm not coming back to this thing so we're going to upgrade to the PTM 7950 phase change thermal pads that we just started stalking on LTT store.com this stuff lasts a freaking long time yeah I'm going to find a way for you to come back to this no no the these just came out of the fridge so that means I need to move pretty quickly to get it measured right and cut if I wait too
long it's going to melt that's the phase change part of phase change thermal pad so why does it have to be cold when it's installed cuz it's going to go to room temp right away because otherwise when you pull the plastic protective covering off of it it rips it apart oh okay as for the rest of our pads they're in pretty good condition and I'm not worried about those ones drying out over time I guess you really are passionate about water cooling cuz you've been in the game since before there was PC water
cooling parts there were some okay but a lot of people were using pumps from like aquarium suppliers and stuff like that back in the day there used to be a point to it water cooling was and actually still is the quietest way to cool a computer but it's only quiet if you configure it in a particular way the average person putting an AI in their system or even building a modest custom Loop is not really getting the silence benefit that I would be looking for you need big radiators with super slow
moving fans a particular pump like it ends up being a really big system yeah and computers are kind of getting smaller these days tell that to the GPU makers got them speaking of a particular pump this is the one the Lang D5 and its variants are among the highest performance and more importantly highest reliability pumps that you can get for PC water cooling so I've been holding holding on to this one for 8 years in hopes of restoring it to its former glory you see it went
through some stuff when it was installed in whole room water cooling all that time ago and we had a cheap reservoir from Princess auto rust and uh well this this will be your greatest challenge don't quite have enough to submerge it okay there we go so there's that like water filter thing right yeah that's what it is oh no way I have never seen that before yeah like that's the shoo that's the shoo it was just a tiny little piece and I went to pick it up and it like fell apart in
my hands it's that that that EK little puck yeah so they've got this anti- Vortex like kind of mesh Puck thing that is included in some of their reservoirs and something about your system you know I don't know that those are compatible with iodine oh maybe I've used iodine in my Loops for a long time but that's not necessarily something that EK recommends that makes so much more sense than this tubing which was our leading theory so far cuz we've deployed this stuff yeah
dozens of times internally and it's been great but then I mean the same goes for  know radiators can be a little physically challenging to clean but the idea is simple you just get yourself a pair of oven mitts then you fill the radiator with the hottest 7525 water vinegar mix that you can handle you plug the ends almost sealed not quite sealed and then Shake lettuce what are you [Laughter] doing you really do want this to be as vigorous as you can possibly handle for  handle oh and the reason that we don't
fully seal them is that the radiator starts cold and the fluid that you put into them is hot and what can happen is if it's sealed pressure can build up and then when you go to unseal them you can get vinegar water spraying out of it and it's really unpleasant so we want there to be a little bit open so that pressure   all right that's probably once it runs clear I'd give it another blast or two with just the hot water and then you should be good to go now for our last component a lot of people don't bother
cleaning and reusing their tubes but as a certified cheap skate I do nothing gets me going like saving a buck all you need is a little pipe cleaner like this you can get this at the dollar store and then for good measure if you use compress fittings or realistically any kinds of fittings you're going to want to find anywhere where the tubing's deformed and cut that off if you had a little bit of extra length then your runs should still be good and you can totally reuse this 
we've soaked these Rusty Parts in CLR for quite a long time now we're going to  it's still pretty Rusty but it's definitely an improvement I'm back in the system looks I mean so much better yeah a lot better you um mounted your Reservoir a little wrong but the uh the clamp goes on the pump not on the it's an aesthetic Choice good job thank you but the temps are great check this out how long has this game been running oh hour okay Okay cool so let's just pop over into Hardware
info we're looking at GPU temps of I don't know maybe 45Â° Hot Spot temps of 56 and our CPU temps are sitting in the neighborhood of about 55Â° it's pretty quiet too yeah only the power supply is making noise okay maybe water cooling still cool it's uh it's definitely cool it is but I will not do it again that's pretty cool oh my God his arm jeez it's fear I can definitely see the fun immediately though oh yeah as unrealistic as it might be wait what how did those guys are really tough like
you'll have to slow-mo to get around them and shoot their tanks oh all right or I could just not I could just do the conclusion of this video our blocks might be clean but our toothbrush heads are decidedly not do not Brasso then brush your teeth thankfully The Replacements are affordable they're about 10 bucks for three and while there are a lot of Alternatives actually to what we did like an ultrasonic cleaner or a flow cleaner or just plain old elbow grease I'm pretty impressed at how
these worked of course the best alternative is to optimize your Loop so that it doesn't need as much maintenance in the first place low paracity tubing like ek's zmt or zero maintenance tubing will reduce evaporation from your system so you don't need to do as many topups but that does nothing to prevent growth so I always recommend distilled water with a couple drops of bioside like iodine to make sure that things stay sanitary in there just make sure that it doesn't um interact with anything else
in your Loop we don't know that that's what happened to ek's little filter thing but maybe it is of course none of that stuff looks as good as the cool tubing and colored coolant so if you do want that stuff it's dead anyway cool just make sure that you configure your system with a drain port at the bottom and your pump directly below your Reservoir you'll find this whole process if you have to do it much faster and simpler just like brushing your teeth we have a few more things to cover for Life
Fen their wave toothbrush lasts about 2 hours on battery and charges in Just 2 and 1/2 hours and is available in three different configurations with this one being the world's first aluminum alloy electric toothbrush built from one seamless piece it's a little specific but hey at least there's a benefit to it cuz you won't get any dirt build up getting into the crevices it starts at $70 for the plastic version and they all have the same ergonomic handle extra "wide 60Â° oscillation and Powerful 66,000"
vibrations per minute that mean you can deep clean your teeth or your computer like a pro if you guys enjoyed this "video maybe check out David's $5,000" Tech upgrade yes it was full of exactly that kind of chaotic energy but maybe more even h
