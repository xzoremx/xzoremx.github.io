we've had our share of controversies on this channel getting hacked uploading April Fool's pranks that were too believable that time Colton issued copyright strikes against ourselves twice we've also removed plenty of videos from our Channel sometimes due to typos or other errors that needed to be corrected or disagreements with sponsors but you know what's never happened in 15 years we have never had a video on our Channel taken down by YouTube without our consent is what I used to say that
is until last Tuesday when I received a notification that our video titled degoogle your life part two ad free YouTube was removed from the platform and I was issued a community guidelines strike warning a warning that turns into a full strike if I repeat the offense except what exactly did I even do how is it that a video about open maps and ad blocking can fall under harmful or dangerous content I've done more dangerous things for a DE Grand sponsor spot and those are all still up speaking
of obviously those guys weren't going to miss an opportunity to insert themselves into an LTT controversy so they sponsored this video and we'll talk  later first let's go through what happened on August 20th we published degoogle your life part two and after about 2 weeks and 1.4 million views YouTube Took the video down and gave us a warning for violating their terms of service or TOS but why I mean we've uploaded numerous other videos that cover topics like ad blocking vpns and
alternative YouTube clients what is it that made this video specifically harmful or dangerous we get part of the answer in this explainer paragraph that says that this category applies to videos which violate YouTube's terms of service or emphasis here encourage enourage other users to do so which includes content that provides instructions on how to download YouTube videos in an unauthorized manner there's a lot to unpack here starting with that I don't understand how that is harmful
or dangerous except maybe to Google's bottom line they want you to pay for premium for the privilege of downloading videos which is well within their rights but I don't think you can make the argument that downloading video is harming the community in any way unless we've Dimension hopped and gone back 40 years and viewing that content could cause the thought police to cart you away for reprogramming but let's put that aside because the arbitrary categorization isn't really the point the video was
removed because for several of its 23-minute runtime we discussed a number of ways of accessing all of the content on YouTube without interfacing with YouTube directly including by downloading videos now to avoid this video getting removed I'm not going to repeat what we said and I'm not going to link L to the re-uploads that other users have graciously provided for your convenience what I am going to do though is not issue copyright strikes against those guys and I'll give you the one
adree YouTube hack that I actually thought was the coolest one uh for whatever reason if you copy the URL of a YouTube video into Bing you should get to enjoy an adree experience now saying that shouldn't violate any TOs and if Google doesn't like it they can hash that out with Microsoft I I recommend an MMA match between satian Adella and sunar Pai other than that I don't know if there's a path to us making this video available again on YouTube because if we re-uploaded it that would be
violating the to again netting our Channel a strike which is a pretty big deal YouTube has a pretty clear three strikes and you're out policy with strike one stopping us from posting for a week strike two stopping us for two weeks and strike three permanently removing the Channel alog together not posting for even just one week would result in significant damage to our business and with around 100 people working here supporting their families that just isn't a risk that we're
willing to take no matter how cheeky I'm personally feeling about the whole situation and besides if we're being honest we probably should have known this was coming we aren't the first channel that this has happened to because of discussions around downloading videos and even channels that are on the larger side like Lewis rossman's have gotten struck for promoting a particular desaturated Corvette app that includes just such functionality now obviously he didn't end up getting banned forever
considering that his channel is still around but they were clearly Furious that he'd been so Brazen and I mean it's pretty obvious Why YouTube is upset about this at the end of the day we both knowingly violated the TOs and in a manner that has a clear impact on the long-term viability of the platform as much as I hate to say it they're kind of right here I mean imagine if you created a restaurant let's call it nacho gong then someone punched a hole in the back of the restaurant giving everybody
direct access to the kitchen and then started giving out the food for free food that you paid for now obviously the bandwidth and storage costs of serving a video are not the same as the Food Supplies and prep costs of serving a meal but they are real costs that the platform does have to bear and the payment for them is ads and tracking on YouTube you don't have to like those things and you can continue to circumvent YouTube's payment system as long as you're able I'm not going to judge you but what you
can't do is sit there and say well I have no idea what they're mad about and you shouldn't be surprised if YouTube does someday patch the undocumented API exploits that third party platforms are taking advantage of so when that inevitably happens then what do we do well I can't speak for every Creator but what we did is we made our own own video platform with float planes and exclusives so if you like our content please consider subscribing over at lm. g/f flat plane where you will still be
able to find degoogle your life part 2 with no ads or sponsor Integrations along with plenty of behind the scenes and exclusive content that was in many cases deemed to be too hot for YouTube or in most cases actually not algorithm friendly and I mean I hate that it's come to this nobody wants more subscriptions but we aren't the only one on who see the writing on the wall and want to reduce our Reliance on Google's fat tee plenty of other creators have also set themselves up on Alternatives
like patreon to offer their fans something more that doesn't come with intrusive ads and tracking as for the future of our content here on YouTube well we're definitely going to keep uploading but we're also definitely going to play it a little safer with respect to thirdparty YouTube clients and tools with that said though we haven't dawned our tricorn hat for the last time and in fact we've got a video coming very soon on the various ways that you can activate Windows 11 ranging
from buying it for $200 to activating it for a lot less than $200 so make sure you're subscribed and I will see you over there just like dbrand sees us through difficult times like this those guys are always there helping reduce our dependence on Google tube and other Tech Giants and they've got something special for you guys helping you reduce your dependence on INF Fior skin and case companies they are offering until Monday 10% off sitewide all you've got to do is go to the link in the video description
