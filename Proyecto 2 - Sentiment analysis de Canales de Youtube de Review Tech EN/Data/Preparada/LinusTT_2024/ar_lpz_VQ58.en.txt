why on Earth would anyone buy a 55 in TV for "$20,000 when they can get one for 250" bucks it doesn't even have features no high refresh rate no variable refresh rate there's branding and buttons everywhere and these bezels look straight out of my grandma's basement it doesn't even have any God dang HDMI ports or a remote control but what it does have is features and cap abilities that are coveted by creators and not this kind no offense this kind One does not simply see Lord of the Rings or Star
Wars until they've watched it on a display like this one from Flanders scientific who happened to be in the neighborhood and were nice enough to swing by with their latest and greatest so we could take a gander it boasts near Perfect Color accuracy tetrahedral interpolation 12bit 444 signaling zero image processing nonsense meaning that for the first time in my life I will finally see content the way the colorist saw it the way the director saw it what content you might ask well
to start with we're going to be checking out the remastered segue Trilogy to our sponsor hetner if I know you you're looking for a company with gdpr compliant high performance Cloud servers that offer OnDemand cloud computing platforms and apis on a metered pay as youo basis classic you don't miss out and use code lt24 at the link below to get â‚¬0 off the XMP 550 mastering monitor is likely the most accurate display I have ever laid my two eyes on it's QD OLED so we've got incredible viewing
angles and color that pops it's rated "for 2,000 nits Peak brightness in a 4%" window and well 55 in might seem small by today's t TV standards it's actually big for what it is with most of the predecessors to this product being in the 30in range now I'm going to tell you a lot more about it with some help from the labs team but first I've got to experience it now we didn't do a TV Roundup for 2023 so for comparison we've got two outstanding TVs from 2022 one with a first generation QD OLED panel from
Samsung and the other with the competing W OLED panel from LG now neither these "is going to do 2,000 nits more like half" of that but they still might hold their own okay because that often boasted about number that's Peak brightness in a tiny window once we get to bigger window sizes the Gap should narrow and in filmmaker mode hey theoretically these displays are super color accurate too but maybe I just don't know what I'm missing to find out I've asked Brandon from the lab to join me and he's going
to be taking us on a little tour of some some content that might either tell us well this Flanders thing is amazing or uh hey don't bother don't worry about it which will be awkward with the Flanders guys there but what can I say whoa you guys are going to notice that the LG G2 looks wildly different from the two QD OLED displays that is due to the different spectral power distribution on the G2 and the way that cameras capture TV output now in some scenes it's going to be a subtle difference but in others
this difference is going to stand out a lot but I can assure you that in person the G2 was relatively accurate to our human eyes it was a lot more subtle also please note there are some really dark scenes here that our cameras didn't capture very well so for the best experience you're going to want to watch in HDR man the other displays almost look like they have cheesecloth over them is that right do we King in that makes sense consumer displays have AVL or auto brightness limiting which is to
protect them so that they're not issuing warranty Replacements every six Flippin months also because I guess they would have to comply with energy standards that a professional display wouldn't so they're just dimmer for now for now it should be noted that for a brief period of time a is not going to be nearly as much of a factor we just unplugged and replugged these TVs and you can see now they're a lot closer even if you can tell already Shadow detail I actually find the green saturation is
a little bit better than the W OLED it's not much even the trees themselves are popping a bit more here yeah they kind of blend into the background there on that one but to get a better idea we're going to cut the lights and we're going to have a look at some test footage we're going to start off with this house scene here right away look at the Samsung it's close dude it's purple yeah I know that what HDR is supposed to do is it's supposed to make things look more true to life but what blows me away
is that I feel feel like I'm looking at a dollhouse with an actual light in an actual window on the Flander scientific yeah I think it's like just the consistency of the color it just makes things look way more realistic it's not white it's light this is going to ruin everything for me and look at the oh my god I didn't even notice the Samsung doesn't have a fence nope the burglar could get right into the backyard you know LG is doing a much better job at retaining detail in the shadow compared
to Samsung I think the LG is still raising the blacks a little bit though do you see where the garage is to the right of it there's like some dark detail but it's pretty dark look at the LG it's raised a bit right like even the sky behind it so they're retaining that detail in the shadow but they're cheating a little yes where Samsung's going the opposite way they're giving them like that punchier look but you're losing you're clipping all your black Detail no question I would take the
Flanders then I would take the LG actually and then the Samsung for this the Samsung is not handling skin tones the way that I'd like yeah I'll try to pause it when it goes back to her face um particularly the Asian skin tone yeah Samsung tends to oversaturate even in its filmmaker mode we've noticed that things look a bit Rosier more saturated on people even the dirt like look at the dirt compared to Orange yeah dirt's not orange LG doesn't look too bad no no to their credit it's it's more accurate
even if the capability is not quite as good look at his hair he's red yeah and his skin he's red and back to what we said about realism right true to life what color is a late night Street Lamp it's yellow it's not orange that's what it's supposed to look like and that seat is a blue leather not whatever that color is it's got pink in it yeah I can't believe how bad the Samsung looks this is the TV I have at home and I'm sh well right and guys you got to remember Brandon test displays for a living like
how long you been doing it now uh four over four years yeah and that's how easily like even we're Bamboozled there's no way that that was the director's intent looking at this we're supposed to be able to see everything that's going on like she here look look at that she's wearing a purple shirt yeah she's wearing a black shirt with purple I don't know something along here this scene doesn't look too bad no none of this bothers me and that reminds me part of why I had a hard time
differentiating there was cuz I was kind of busy looking at the content and no matter which of these TVs you have that's what you're going to be doing most of the time so these are still Hair S splitting differences that we're picking at it's just fun if you're a giant nerd these strawberries look really good they look super eat those yes they look pretty washed out on the LG yep they don't they don't look they look okay on the Samsung but it's still not as red it's not no it's not it's not
as accurate oh and look at the shadow detail on the uh reflection it's like all gone on the Samsung oh yeah so on the LG but you're de saturated but it's yeah it looks like a ghost of what a strawberry is supposed to look like in the reflection the top looks all right but those are those don't look as delicious those are more sour and those are super sweet as long as it's not a super saturated color the LG does okay and I believe the Mario movie the mastering display primaries are P3 which all these
displays should be able to do now my understanding is the Mario movie was mastered for a peak of 800 nits correct according to the metadata so theoretically any one of these displays can reach it the brightness that we need to see even though Samsung it's oversaturating Bowser's eyes a little bit there see they're a bit too orange it looks nice like my eyes like that but that's what it should look like so LG pretty close honestly the LG is very color accurate I'm really glad we're
looking at real content now though because looking at test patterns or the ASC footage made the difference seem a lot differenter mhm looking at a real movie which is going to be mastered with Home displays in mind a little bit more I guess I don't find the difference nearly as noticeable no can you pause it right here I can I want to say what a great still Mario's hat does look a bit oversaturated or a bit like maybe pink or purplish compared to here the true version looks almost right in between
the almost too orangey Samsung and the almost to I don't know blue purple yeah blue purplish that's going on on the LG I think especially with uh animated content you have less like memory colors to reference right like you don't have realistic skin tones and all those kind of things so it's I think it's just a lot easier to be fooled than thinking this looks that's true and like back to that night scene where I was like oh yeah no I know what an ugly yellow Street Lamp is supposed to look like
well this rainbow burning fire could be anything he looks almost palad and dead on the Flanders which he's Rosy on the S was clearly the intent they're not supposed to look life full Brown uniform green uniform this is probably the starkest difference I've seen between the right color and completely the wrong color that looks like it could have be made out of leather also you can tell that this is daylight lit because on the Flanders there's a bit of a Bluey cast to everything whereas we're losing that
with the oversaturation of the greens on the other displays mhm here's what I want to know maybe this is my first question for the Flanders folks is the problem that it's more work to just not do any processing yeah fundamentally I always tell people it's it's more about what we don't do almost rather than what we do is that really hard to not do that the problem is most of the chips they use are off the shelf chips from companies like mediatech so we don't do that we do everything on
fpg that's why they cost so much so it's cost savings thing slash an willingness to build your own processor from the ground up to not do any of this BS there another dark scene with oranges oh my gosh the Samsung is doing so bad yeah and not that Brandon has a horse in  TV incredible o okay dang it I want I mean even here that's an orange fire those are red fires y oh that looks so very metallic according to httv test the "scene coming up should be 2,000 nits" coming off of Gandalf so the maximum
capability of our Flanders and well beyond the maximum capabilities of our consumer TVs here yes although it is a bright scene very high APL not sure how  here oo pause it everyone's handling this pretty well there's clip going on the Samsung though I don't know if it's because of the color stuff but you can't make out nearly we're losing the trees in the uh whatever the light source that's behind gandal mhm it be pretty good oh yeah yeah yeah you can barely make out the form of his body through
the robes on the Samsung mhm and it's also just not as bright I think the Samsung is uh tone mapping a lot here I'm also losing the folds in legal's Cloak uh yeah so these two are about the "same they're both hitting around 1,000" nits off of this little beam yeah the Samsung's down to about 700 okay and I guess that's probably because of tone mapping one thing we didn't focus on last time around is an undesirable behavior of the Flanders if you were using it for consuming content and that
is that if there is a signal that is outside of its maximum brightness range rather than just tone mapping it down and trying to smooth out the transition it it'll just Peak which is to say it will completely lose any detail That was supposed to be there and you can really see it on the bird's left cheek here on the right side of the frame here there's nothing left of the feather detail there whereas actually the LG doesn't do a very good job not doing great Samsung though retains some of the texture
that's supposed to be there oh yeah LG actually manages to Peak even worse than Flanders yeah LG does have Dynamic tone mapping on right now but that is the default behavior in filmmaker mode yeah yeah and it's just not working very well huh oh yeah W this one's really interesting um hey look there's green there yeah first off the colors are completely different yeah but here this is a great quantization uh banding test pattern so just look at the Samsung you can clearly see that white circle just
ends right there and then another Circle yeah and then look at the LG the LG is much worse you can really see it's like looking at the rings of Saturn around the Outer Perimeter yeah whereas the Flanders I guess that's what uh you know know 5D l or whatever the crap it is that they're using is going to do for you how did how did how do you guys describe the L we use tet a tetrahedral interpolation it looks so smooth here it's falling apart so yucky on the rest of them this is not a bit rate issue
this is the ability of the processor to interpret all the different little microsteps of color that might exist and you can see the consumer displays are falling flat on their faces there's more to this thing than just a pretty face though build quality is solid with an aluminum chassis and a graphite heat sink and it operates fanless in spite of "the fact that 2,000 nits even in a small" area can generate some serious heat and this is cool check this out part of why this display is so expensive is because
it can offer up information that might not be relevant to you but is relevant to filmmakers like showing false color or a live read out of luminance and waveforms so you can make make sure that what you're looking at is as you intended and that's the reason why you or I budget aside might not actually want to use this as a home display also the lack of HDMI etc etc the XMP 550 is a tool for professionals and it offers no post-processing whatsoever that includes or rather doesn't include tone
mapping this TV or more accurately display shows the footage in its unpr processed form with only a custom 3D l or a lookup table to make sure the colors are displayed accurately and because of that when we show content that was mastered at a higher brightness value rather than roll off pleasingly and retain detail it'll simply clip that's intended because a colorist doesn't want to be fooled into thinking "this is what a 4,000 nit scene looks" like so it's kind of a safety mechanism
to ensure that they know hey you've gone beyond the capabilities of this display and you can do that but you're kind of grading blind at this point but wait hold on a second grading blind isn't this thing the be all and end all all right we're working on a tech quickie that's going to help further explain color spaces and terms like chromaticity in the not too distant future but when it comes to HDR and Rec 2020 that's a volumetric color space that can go all "the way to 10,000 nits beyond the"
capabilities of even this display I mean QD OED has gotten Us close in terms of color saturation but the brightness just isn't there yet now the primary competitor to the XMP 550 is Sony's new BVM HX 3110 a dual layer LCD mastering monitor that uses a technology similar to the high sense 9dg that we covered almost 2 years ago it can reach a "whopping 4,000 nits but the color" saturation is narrower to hit 100% of the entire volume you'd need basically Pure Color wave lengths like freaking
lasers displaying your image and that's going to be a while also despite the Sony unit offering extra brightness there are a few reasons why you might prefer the Flander scientific display first and foremost they're really nice people who are entirely nonthreatening no I'm kidding but but seriously the near-perfect viewing angles thanks to the quantum do OLED panel mean that you can use a single display for both working and showing references to your client or boss someone who's likely to be a big deal
like a studio head or a creative director to illustrate why this matters we had an older dual layer LCD mastering display at LTX and Brandon was constantly instructing people to no no you have to stand directly in front of it or it really doesn't look right second oled's Lightning Fast self aiss of pixels give us zero rise or fall time motion blur not to mention Inky blacks without any halation or blooming right and also the price yeah I know right at only "$220,000 it's really well positioned for"
a brand new mastering monitor our quote for the BBM HX 3110 was almost "$30,000 and it's under a third of the" size of course though your choice might be dictated by creative requirements rather than budgets if your film contains scenes like this for example the a or auto brightness limiter that protects our QD OLED panel might preclude its use even if it's doesn't operate as aggressively as a consumer display however if I was working on something like the Mario movie I'd be a
fool to go dual layer LCD at any price just like I'd be a fool if I didn't sign up for a notification for our new Precision screwdriver the Flanders is also finally a viable alternative to the venerable BVM X300 which is still sought after today despite being discontinued that one used a true RGB stripe OLED panel which avoids washing ing out color with a white sub pixel but being older "It could only reach 1,000 nits in a 10%" window they're also not getting any younger so Burnin is becoming a concern
with these displays there are other options that are still in production with the BBM e251 and 171 but those are 1080p at 24 1/2 and 16 1/2 in respectively if anyone watching this video actually needs any of this stuff hey we'll have links in the description below for now I want to throw over to Brandon from the lab to talk about our measured results from the Flander scientific model due to our limited time with the XMP 550 we are only able to test its color accuracy with HDR signals
for our testing we use the Delta e ITP metric for our color error evaluation since it's designed for high luminous values and a wide color gamut two integral parts of HDR as we saw earlier the S 95b is skewing a bit red and on top of that it overs saturates but it's still reasonably accurate as is the G2 however the XMP P 550 is a clear winner hitting a Delta e ITP average of less than two and a Max of less than five this is by far the best color accuracy I've ever measured what's even more
impressive is the lack of any major change when adding luminance error to the equation see how the values are nearly identical the same can't be said for our other ass sets especially the G2 that's because the XMP outputs light and color basically perfectly to give us accurate HDR content its PQ eotf curve is tracking nearly identically to the HDR standard meanwhile the G2 and s95 B both have minor inaccuracies as well as a worse white balance by comparison and even with the XMP 550 capped out at
18800 nits with a d65 white it still handily beats our two other TVs overall a very impressive piece of technology for the people who need it even if it does also kind of highlight that there's still room for these displays to improve there's no such thing as a perfect solution right now now you might have noticed we've been toying with HDR recently and you're probably wondering hey lonus I'm watching this video in HDR right now do you guys need one of those and depending who you ask production
