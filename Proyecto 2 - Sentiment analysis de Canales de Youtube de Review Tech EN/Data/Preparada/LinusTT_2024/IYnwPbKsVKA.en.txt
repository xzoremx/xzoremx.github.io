you know most of the time the guy who picks the lottery winner doesn't get to win the lottery how did you end up with an AMD ultimate Tech upgrade especially since you already stole one of the secret shopper PCS not to mention this TV these dark plates this miniature shoe this Ikea blanket and this light that used to be in my house it's a random draw dude the Bingo ball handler can win too seriously though what else could you possibly need your setup is already sick just some doct to for Petty 
decoration and that's not all I see computer upgrades a home DJ setup wait I got to admit this was spoiled for me but you got a gold grill did you carve the AMD logo into this it's it's only fitting right does it fit yeah it's custom made oh my God just roll the intro  I can't believe I missed the most obvious stolen merch listen he modeled for it okay he earned it right the computer may be stolen but apparently Beggars can be choosers we're going to be upgrading this first you want me to put something
on the counter not really it's not my counter I mean who needs a static safe workplace when you can bring a static material and put it cut this so my landlord doesn't see it as I mentioned you guys might remember this PC from secret shopper 3 it's from Star Forge complete with penis rocket logo it's not a dick for some reason it's signed is this because we were going to give it away or something and you no that's just for me I'm just missing Shay's signature so Shay hit me
up funnily enough star Forge was the only one to use a radon GPU in their system so we're going to be keeping this 6750 XT and just upgrading our platform with a ooh 7800 x3d 3D vcash processor this is as fast as it gets for gaming some ddr5 memory and of course a matching motherboard sherro um question for you have you built a computer before like is that a thing you do or I took the GPU out once and put it back in cool yeah oh God we're adding one of those EK aios yeah Chase won that at the Christmas
party this is like before my time but he was nice enough to give it to me because he wasn't using it so thanks J that Christmas party gift was like the smartest five grand that EK ever spent the millions and millions and millions of views that they have gotten on these things so if any Brand's watching this we have a Christmas party this year while Shard tries to figure out how to remove the motherboard AMD is giving three more of these away to some of you lucky viewers all you have to do is
follow the link in the description to enter amd's been killing it both with continuing to sponsor this series that you guys all love and also giving you guys some pretty cool gear let's um see  doing wait you just removed the one screw that whole time that no that was good that good you know what you can remove any cables you want just go for it just rip them off wait not doing all the other one you just no I'm I'm kidding okay I warned you I've never done this yeah yeah no you're doing
great you just going to like Facebook Marketplace this or whatever trash can's right there you don't have to suck up to AMD I  AMD in the intro you know how I was like you know the ball handlers not allowed to win the Bango or whatever he he he handles the relationship with AMD for this series so that's the context there hi Ray now for building up the new platform tell me have you at least ever watched one of our build videos yes okay  oh my God wait wait why is there no
socket cover on this motherboard Elijah I had ask Logistics to do a quick post test and I guess they forgot to put the cover on hold on hold on new role play new role play okay I'm Logistics okay  Bus no I looks fine it looks like it's fine so normally a motherboard oh here it is oh so maybe it was on maybe it just normally a motherboard comes with a cover to protect these delicate pins that are in the CPU socket but somehow this one came off and it's very easy for anything banging around in the box or
you know someone accidentally handling it and mashing their fingers in the socket to completely mangle it and the cost is so high to replace that socket that you might as well just buy a new motherboard in most cases so that's a pretty stressful thing I'm not stressed you're stressed I'm not stressed  stressed nice haircut don't find out soon Whoa stop surely you can't put this CPU in without your AMD Grill in now I have to confess I don't know much about grills and Grill culture so you might
have to explain this whole thing to me you can either get your actual teeth pulled out and put gold teeth in there or these go on top of your teeth so it's they're like retainers made out of gold I got Sebastian to use the tormac machine to put a little little tiny tiny AMD logo on the on the middle tooth okay um but backing up again the idea behind a grill is just it looks sick oh wow it's like like a bit to get on there yeah cuz it stays on oh my God and how much are these worth uh like $600 it's
14k gold that's pretty good where where are they from uh G grills they got ship from Houston Texas all right okay what games do you play pegle pegle Deluxe or pegle extreme pegle kns uh that one I've been playing Skyrim for 13 years uh nice I still play it I only got a PC like this year I used to play on my PS5 yeah okay uh a lot of Red Dead 2 um cool a little bit of I think it goes right side up right oh yeah yeah the right side up is definitely a plus yeah I see the see
the little arrow nice yeah you got to give her a little bit on this boom there you go look at that there goes the dynamite all right let's put this back together wow a man after my my own heart putting things away as we go and keeping the workspace tidy you got clean as you go right I'm impressed I worked in the kitchen what kitchen did you work in it used to be called uh mags 99 it used to be a KFC Taco Bell but someone bought it and they started making real food in it speaking of uh
Fried Chicken here are the Rams um see you guys think segueing is easy I just make it look easy so here's what I know about Ram just watching the videos I know you're supposed to go in odd or even channels one and three or two and four M two and four are the first ones it does technically vary from board to board you know what we're going to check yo stickers got little dragons on it oh my God they do not include a paper manual with this motherboard we're going to go two and four it's probably two and four 
right how's that second bus Logistics you know Logistics are our unsung heroes okay they get so little they get so little time in the sun okay they do so much for us what is wrong with you people was that open or did you open that uh I don't know it might have  Logistics doesn't matter which way oh yeah I'm assuming since that side doesn't have stickers and it's pointed to the camera I'm assuming it goes this way right fun fact I believe he is actually right that is not how to
Landmark memory um but I have noticed a pattern that the vast majority of the time the sticker is toward the CPU socket which makes it more photogenic it got to look good yeah would you like to know how to actually know how to put it in you just kind of right oh I mean yeah no I mean how to tell how to tell though like the notch isn't in the middle oh one side's long one side's short always yeah so like you're supposed to line it up but like no that dude that works yeah good job guess now is a good time to
shout out the ram since I can so conveniently read the sticker from this side DDR 56000 cl30 32 gigs you could load in lots of Skyrim mods all of them do you play modded Skyrim uh I have started yeah since getting a PC it's way way easier you played like 10 years of Skyrim without modding it yes let's get this in the case while we're on that do you want to do something other than call out logistics sure what maybe you could light some incense actually please don't I I'm sorry but we got incest here
I this one's called Jamaican girl yeah also money also where you at why don't you set up I don't know where's the DJ setup going to go uh on the CX CX is part of our upgrade actually but I know oh we hate Furniture so I took the liberty of putting it together beforehand oh perfect okay so why don't you that yes sir at least the logistics kept this manual that's going to be the running gag in this video you started it by driving the bus Glenn I have a task for you go back to Logistics give them an
opportunity to say their piece after we're done shooting here okay because they deserve it they work hard I know and these guys don't respect it I was in logistics I was see it was there just fell off in transit I I legitimately like I I made a boo boo on that am I what am I doing wrong here oh yeah it is tradition to check and make sure there's nothing under the motherboard before we uh put it down there's cables there yeah there's cables all right I'll give you a hand why don't
you go show Elijah where you want your DJ stuff I'm just going to get the motherboard install what even is this uh this is a DJ controller flx 4 I'm not like a professional or anything I'm just going to like have fun at home so this is like more than enough the cool thing it has uh smart effects while you're mixing it helps it's like training wheels and it also has smart fader so it bat matches is uh the two decks together automatically when you're fading in between songs so and then I also unboxed
this mix five it's actually pretty useful cuz uh everything's basically going to go through this cuz this whole cic is going to be like a like a music setup because we're going to have so many things going through the same set of speakers and subwoofer uh this is going to bring everything together and put everything through at the same time all in one place oh cool okay so we're going to have that oh my God Elijah please don't lose those pieces where' it go oh that's a sampler uh drum machine
sequencer Allin one type of thing yeah it looks like Lego it it does it kind of does especially with these little little pieces that go on no no hold on that's the wrong one brother they're colorcoded another audio Source a sound Burger yes sir so I saw that that at CES this year and I thought it was the coolest thing ever what is it it's a it's a record player oh I think they originally released these in like the 80s or something and they what records no no I think they've been
around a lot longer since the 80s but  fine that moment when Elijah schools you about history got him he doesn't know anything one anyways uh they released a very limited number of them like couple years ago and they sold out immediately so they kind of made it a permanent thing in their lineup this pops open you got the needle you kind of like click out you put the record in here and then this goes on top of the record to like kind of hold it in place shut it turn it on oh so it's battery as well
yeah so it has I think it's 12 hours battery and it has Bluetooth so you can just like take it anywhere shro I've got your motherboard in and I've decided after watching you for a while I'm just going to keep going that is the smart choice I would say so why don't you guys um learn about coffee I used to have a Express machine before and it was semi-automatic but it was kind of a pain in the ass to upkeep and clean this one's fully automatic uh it grinds the coffee packs the shot pulls the shot and dumpster
little puck in a little bin that you can dump out yourself what is one of these worth this looks crazy expensive 850 worth it is that Canadian rubles or is that like Canadian Canadian okay so like $600 something like that yeah hey look look who it is it's Reese from Logistics where your were your ears burning I guess so so I'm so I'm told at least who was the one that did the test boot with this motherboard I don't I don't know probably Jamie I assume it's okay so he's throwing Jamie under the bus okay
it's just Jamie from Logistics then no these guys are on a team he would never throw Jamie under the bus he's answering a direct question why are you forcing him putting him in this putting him in this uncomfortable situation pretty comfortable these fans are going to go on top again nope why not uh well I put the EK vardar ones that came with your AIO in the front see yeah and then I was lazy but that's less RGB I want RGB fine was going to quietly not put them back in
but fine fine fine not on my watch fine fine fine fine fine fine sorry what what I'm just checking what is on your watch oh speaking speaking of watches oh did you get a new watch I did oh look at that okay what'd you get I got the new Apple watch Ultra 2 oh wow because and hear me out because you just like throwing money away that and also the bigger battery because honestly it's a pain point for me look at that that's beautiful the Humane pin looks better wow it's really heavy you shot your
"mouth you seem to be over your $5,000" budget uh by like $60 Canadian Elijah I'll put the sheet on screen oh we never put the D in there lus is on lunch it's all   you what was that oh yeah we might need a fan  out okay well just just do your best it doesn't look the greatest but I think once it's up against the wall it's  good of course you're the type of guy who buy a gold  front oh it's like almost perfect I didn't need to do any of that cable management we could have just hung ice 
we're doing the goie TV lights right now all wish home theater video that we did at Linus's house we put this on his TV and I liked it thank you GOI shout out to Hershey keep this an editor editor keep this in thank you Hershey yeah you want to see the Elijah special Glenn best part about modern cases bro solid back panel take this off please do not tell l he will check it it's way cooler when it's darker and it's an actual movie that you're watching but like this is like pretty cool to like demonstrate it
right these are the headphones I got for the DJ controller okay so by the company they make cool uh modular headphones uh modular headphones yeah yeah yeah so you go on their website and basically pick and choose what parts you want this specific setup was $140 I don't know about you but I Che through headphones why I thought that was cu's job uh we both do okay like father likees son and the beauty of these is you can replace the specific parts so you don't have to get a whole
new set of headphones oh no he just  bro oh no it's like in there you know for $150 you can buy a pretty good set of headphones these feel super cheap but I think it's because they have the modularity to them so I will judge it based on how they sound but they don't look over-the toop special it's on purpose too though cuz uh for DJing you want something lightweight and like so you don't like really feel it on your head cuz you're listening to it for like hours possibly exactly right so it's
this is like a pretty lightweight setup and it's like one of their cheapest setups that they have to and y'all thought Colin couldn't speak using his   damn clearly anywhere CA have to around LTT store.com except what is the arody disc oh those are for his car oh no you did not get like Spinners did you I wish I wish I actually did look for Spinners like really hard but apparently they don't really make them anymore in24 remember the old rally cars that had the little salad spinners on
their wheels mhm the way they worked they would pull air they would act like a turbine and pull air through the brakes to cool them better and the wheels themselves were designed like that these are add-ons uh that rotor form makes I always wanted white Wheels but I was terrified of washing them this way I can have white wheels and I I can just pull them off and clean them that sits on the wheel yeah and they got these machine aluminum wao caps W that go in the middle okay those look kind of
cool okay even I like these woo damn  nut whoa watch this you're going to love my nuts now that's my generation mem I mean yeah there we go you're good so just hold that in place yeah and then do you want the black one I like no no the black one doesn't fit do you mean it doesn't fit because uh the threads are shorter cuz that one has to go deeper you know what shrod I like the way it looked before yeah cuz you got no taste this looks really stupid dude like this looks like you like
didn't take the PDI like sticker off the wheel or something looking great is very much you know an opinion they're like but holes we all got one looking great as like butth holes I mean I'll opinions opinions in this case I think you're on to something well I don't know my car also exists very true this man drives around in Barney and is criticizing my wheels it's a shame cuz I really like the rest of your car's look you know what shot maybe in motion maybe in motions it's bad why don't you get in get in 
hey wobble that's a pretty fine job Elijah thanks sir yeah it's nice that star Forge did all the cable management for you in all seriousness I I cut out most of it because they had everything wrapped up so tight back there which is not a bad thing take this off please do not tell lonus yeah I did it all back up  well why is your awkward energy so high wasn't one of the things you guys were going to do while I was at that meeting cable managing this desk no did you really just put two cable Ties on here
and call it a day oh that did sherro really steal these cable ties from the office no big moment let's see if this thing still oh who hi hi yeah you forgot about me I think he thinks I'm also a dog cuz I'm so yappy I mean you do have to dog in you AMD 7800x 3D with 3D cash thanks AMD I'm having a hell of a time now do a smile show your grill this is great I'm not complaining okay fight someone in here all right here we go no not a guard fight a woman or something fight someone you can beat
are you even hitting him yeah he's losing Health you can see it at the top okay so why don't we play an AMD certified game here something from the last you know decade have you played Halo infinite at all sure okay I love m Master Chef is it too late to repo all this stuff technically no it's technically Still Company property oh you didn't launch it so now we get to wait 25 minutes for shaders to cash Jesus Christ how many things does it load I'm not getting any  here we might leave a little bit of the
context for that in the float plane cut lm. floatplane maybe not I'm not going to promise it though have you ever played Halo I was a I was a PlayStation boy so no oh you got oh let's go how did you manage to get a Kill playing like this do you even strafe bro listen if it works it works that's your teamate team don't worry about it there's no friendly fire so who cares yes there is yes there is you don't even check Corners brother don't worry listen has it been detrimental no dude you march across
Open Spaces you don't even check  yes oh my God hey yeah get wrecked okay what kind of drink do you want I don't drink coffee we can do a latte yeah that's coffee so this is the outro so yeah I'm trying to understand the point you asked us all to get on the couch and have mugs yeah well cuz shro was drinking coffee in the beginning right so we're just reflecting on what a nice upgrade this was thanks AMD upgraded dog upgraded DJ upgraded car upgraded coffe side car downgraded
car upgraded PC I can't wait for this to be a 10 out of 10 on YouTube in our analytics dashboard 10 out of 10 is bad very editor just delete the video you can still get AMD to pay though right yeah yeah all right then it's fine thanks AMD thanks AMD appreciate you see you at the next upgrade guys we didn't throw do you want to throw to a video oh yeah if you guys enjoyed this one oh God Matthews sure that's all you got to say
