if you've ever stayed in an Airbnb I'm sure that you've wondered can I sit on this toilet without worrying about some creep with a spy camera there's got to be some way to know for sure and there is they aren't cheap but this is an nljd A type of counter Espionage device that has famously been used by the CIA and other intelligence agencies to detect everything from hidden cameras to microphones to data transceivers in fact it can detect any electronic device even  this cool right there's one of my
cameras there's another one freaking sick found another one this thing is so powerful that it will cook your eyeballs and is literally illegal to use in Japan Switzerland France Germany and many other countries so given how difficult it can be to access Cold War era spy equipment for many of you we also grabbed this cheap bug detector off of Amazon to see which one works better H this one seems to be detecting a segue to our sponsor shut up MSI their Meg core liquid ey 360 AO
cooler Sports a head turning infinite mirror design and has some Nifty quality of life features like an integrated installation bracket that's compatible with both Intel and AMD check it out at  below let's start with our Bayside bug detector from Amazon it cost us only $30 and with that considered it actually has a lot of features it can blast IR to reveal cameras it has an IR detector defined night vision cameras a magnetic field detector for GPS trackers and an RF detector to help find devices that
are transmitting on Wi-Fi or Bluetooth frequencies it's this last one that we hope will be the most useful for tracking down a hidden camera or microphone let's try it out let me just turn the sensitivity up a little bit and oh lordy I'm not near anything so that's a problem shut up the guides for how to use those things often instruct you to turn off any Wi-Fi or Bluetooth devices that are in the area that's no problem during the Cold War but is virtually impossible today and even if I could turn off all
of my neighbors Xboxes it's still going to be very susceptible to false positives see in the80s a light bulb transmitting RF that would have been a dead giveaway but today it probably just means that your Airbnb host really likes RGB shut up the final downside is that if a spy device was configured to record locally or to only transmit on a schedule we would have very little hope of finding it that's why the pros ignore toys like this and instead rely on real tools like this meet the REI Orion hgo
4000 a nonlinear Junction detector or nljd it's kind of like a metal detector but specifically for electronics and I'm going to show you guys how it works but before we can do that there are a few safety items absolutely do not point this at your head or eyes it is a microwave on a stick and it will lightly cook your eyeballs and turn them opaque not use it if there are anyone with a pacemaker or a hearing aid in and also do not leave it in close proximity to any part of your body for more than 5
minutes in a row okay with all of that in mind the first mode we're going to use is search mode this doesn't tell us much about what we're scanning but by using pulses rather than continuous output it allows us to use maximum scanning power without being illegal you see the FCC won't let me be or let me be me if me wants to Output more than 3.3 watts of RF radiation but they only specify average power and search mode operates at only a 6% duty cycle meaning that our Peak power can be much higher
without stepping into the illegal realm so what we're looking for then is a high second harmonic response which is this red line here since that is the signature of a transistor we're also looking at the third harmonic here on this yellow line which might be an electronic device but is more likely a Rusty Nail in a wall so let's give these  here aha oh do you see that it changed over to semiconductor so there could be an integrated circuit hidden right here and to show you guys that it won't pick up a
false positive I can scan this circuit tree hoodie from LTT store.com and see that no in fact these circuits are just screen printed on so let's go ahead and change our mode to listen now instead of bouncing around both bars I can narrow in on just the second harmonic that I'm looking for and I can actually hear in my headphones bunch of static bunch of static bunch of static and nothing so what's in here then could it be a hidden Arduino yes it could and the coolest part is
that it is completely unpowered and not transmitting anything but our nonlinear Junction detector didn't care it was able to easily find it anyway so the only question I have now then is how in the Sam Hill does a microwave Blaster find Electronics well originally it didn't the nonlinear Junction detector was invented during World War II by Charles boville to find corrosion under the paint of planes but before long they realized hey it was also really good for tracking down spy
devices as you can imagine though as quickly as the nonlinear Junction detector became popular so did methods to defeated it the CIA for instance spent a bunch of time and money creating the SRT 107 a special microphone that has filters built in that will shunt the signal of an nljd to ground rendering it ineffective meanwhile the Russians developed a different plan when they were mixing the concrete for the US Embassy in Moscow they hucked a bunch of dead Electronics into the mix so that
there' be no way for the Americans to tell the real bugs from the false positives very cool history or lesson lus but none of that answers the question how in the Sam Hill does a microwave Blaster find Electronics okay okay to understand how the detector works though we first need to understand what a nonlinear Junction is the nonlinearity that we're talking about is on the current voltage curve for something like a resistor or a wire you get a simple straight line like this
More Voltage equals more current which you probably know as Ohm's law when you have two dissimilar materials touching though like say for example this brass and the oxidized brass that has formed around it will get some nonlinearity on the current voltage graph that looks something like this and here's the fun part basically every semiconductor is also a nonlinear Junction because semiconductors contain diodes diodes are typically made out of silicon with one side having small amounts of antimony
added to it called n type material and the other side having a small amount of boron added called a ptype material an N type has free electrons while a ptype has holes that simulate a positive charge since one area has an excess of electrons and the other has an excess of places for electrons to go naturally some of the electrons will diffuse from the nide over to the PS side leaving What's called the depletion region in the center add power to the diode in the correct direction and once you have
enough voltage to overcome the depletion region in the center about6 Volts for silicon current will flow reverse the direction of the battery though and the depletion region will get larger preventing the flow of electricity and making a diode what it is a device that only allows electricity to flow in One Direction all of this results in a current voltage graph that looks like this pretty nonlinear right to detect this nonlinear Junction then all we need to do is run some power through the
device any sort of RF radiation will induce a bit of current in a wire or a piece of metal that's nearby like this little wire that we hooked up to our oscilloscope and as you can see all I have to do is put this here and I end up with a sign wave and since this wire is a linear conductor it will simply radiate out that signal like the sine wave we originally generated if the signal goes through a nonlinear Junction though the reradiated signal will have additional components and that allows us to tell the
difference between a diode and a rusty nail because of the dramatic difference in how they react to a voltage or a current applied to their circuits now that we've got the oscilloscope hooked up we can see how the differ modes operate this particular one is search continuous where you can see that it's basically just firing out RF at a variety of amplitudes and frequencies to see if it can elicit some kind of response it's throwing spaghetti at the wall to see what sticks if we switch
over to listen mode things start to look a little bit more stable but we don't get the real picture until we Zoom way out that right there is the pulses we were talking about where it's blasting with higher power on exactly the frequency to find exactly what we're looking for and then chilling out so that I don't get a knock on the door there is one thing that kind of ate at us though typically the current that an RF signal will induce in a wire is very small like we're talking on the order of
Mill volts but since a silicon diode won't allow any current to flow until about 6 volts how the heck is this thing able to detect anything well the answer is simple by making it very very powerful we saw over one volt in our wire that we stuck next to this thing because again guys it's basically a microwave on a stick very cool so conclusion then if you want to be confident that no one is spying on you should you run out and get one of these well there are actually a couple
problems big problems like you might imagine this thing works like in a video game right you press up on the d-pad it enters detective mode and it highlights all the key objects in the room but uh not so much the recommended scanning rate is about 1 square ft every 3 seconds and that that's for flat surfaces so a typical small office could easily take 2 to 3 hours to scan properly while an executive office could take more like an entire day it is a long and tedious process that as a
general rule of thumb takes about as long as applying three coats of paint to every wall in a room another problem they are eye-wateringly expensive a questionable AliExpress unit starts at about "$10,000 with name brand ones like this" Landing closer to 15 grand that's actually one of the reasons that this project took so long to get off the ground we had to wait to snag an older unit on eBay which still cost us a couple of grand that is still a lot of money for nons spy agency folks but I
think the biggest problem though is that an nljd can't detect the most likely way that someone's going to bug you outside of an Airbnb the chances that someone's going to go to the effort of hiding Electronics to spy on you are fleetingly small not because no one wants to spy on you but because these days everyone has a camera and a microphone on them at all times sometimes more than one why would I bother physically breaking into your place to plant a device when I could
just remotely access a device you are already carrying with you from the other side of the planet without ever leaving my chair so if you're concerned about cameras in your Airbnb that's totally valid but the best countermeasure is just to look around for anything suspicious we're going to link to a couple of decent that we found on searching for spy equipment just like how I'm spying this segue to our sponsor it's over there you can't see but it's there look I can detect it
