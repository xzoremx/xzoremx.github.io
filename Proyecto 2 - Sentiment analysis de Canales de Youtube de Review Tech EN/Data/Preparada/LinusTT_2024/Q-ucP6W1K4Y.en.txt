I know I shouldn't be surprised Kyle given it took you 3 years to make a screwdriver but really 2 years and "$5,000 to plan and build a table that" not this table this table oh Kyle set out with a simple goal to use his engineering knoow and amd's money to build the world's most powerful gaming table one computer not enough two computers sounds good All That Remains is to see if we can get through the rest of this without killing each other you cut this one the tubing kind of looks can you be less of a
"downer what it's AMD $55,000 ultimate"  intro guess who's back guys it's AMD with another chance to win a sick giveaway they're giving away three of their ryzen 8700g processors all you've got to do is head to our Twitter at the link down below thanks again to AMD for sponsoring this series before we build the table I need to see how much stolen goods there is here now you planned for me to be in this room so obviously there's not going to be anything here no there's no stolen stuff in my house
canned goods huh yes my wife and I used to can a lot um we've stopped is that a euphemism four you stopped when you got married I guess no when we had kids did I miss something am I getting old this area is like kids Central mate um it's my kid was the first product tester for that thing realistically though I'm not upset about this what I'm upset about is that engineering sample don't see the ABCs of gaming it's in the kids bedroom cuz we read it to them every night before they go to sleep you do
that this used to be like Lego Dimensions all the way across there all my PS2 games PS3 PS4 Wii games um but now it's just kids stuff so you see there is hope you noticed he has a wife right what am I missing every single jab you do see my wife got it but like Elijah gets it I freaking what do you mean there's hope is this at all plasma yes wow so I had a choice of building two computers or upgraded the TV I haven't won a TV in the last three Christmas parties and I'm hoping to win
a TV at some point it does the job as 1080p so my sound system is I think a Best Buy special it's Precision order I I wouldn't swear by it it produces sound it's definitely not stolen from work yeah I mean our company didn't exist when that TV came out realistically I wasn't going to find anything until the tech Corner fiber optic display port cable AMD paid for it oh oh it's part of okay it's part of the upgrade there's no way that you're not over your allocation of screwdrivers hold on this is the
second one that was made stol in it no that's a test thing how can I make the screwdriver and not you don't even work in this department to us I specifically put as much LT merch everywhere sprinkled around the house so every time the camera pans there's LTT merch and this guy's whing about how much LTT mer I'm clothed by your company so I won this at the Christmas party before lonus says this is his I broke the power switch when I assembled it and to open this again is such a pain in the
freaking bum hole that instead of trying to open it again I just pulled the wires out and now I hot wire the PC to turn it on and off the LTT was in that whole b-roll frame I I'm not good with caps mate you don't even take stuff that you're going to use why did you shave there is what all right why did he shave this will be the video where I explain it then I booked a Hydra facial what the freak is a Hydra facial it's like a facial treatment the point is that it costs the same whether they just do half
of your face or whether they do your whole face now I don't want to troll origin but their systems not that cheap there's no way you bought this no one a Christmas party no wait is this one one of those laptops that has the two power bricks the two power bricks it weighs a ton it's literally got like desktop Hardware in it you know when you said you were a gamer I thought you might play somewhat more advanced games I guess this makes sense though 3 years to design screw driver I paid for that one
of those might be from the office it was cheaper than buying a server rack okay it works look this even slides in an out you could have just stolen one from work like everything else I didn't steal anything from work you found nothing from work that have stolen not his phrasing you found nothing from work that I've stolen ah we found Kyle's games those were the kids games upstairs I understand now wow no wonder you need a gaming table uh there's more there for all these
Miniatures that you haven't bothered to paint the game's just as functional if you just play with the gray ones right yes eventually I'll paint it I've only been in this house for about 40 minutes and I've already heard I'll get to it enough times to last an entire marriage how how long did it take you to upgrade your first house upgrade it yeah before you employed the whole company to work on your new one yeah it took a while I mean you prioritize your own stuff this is nice this was a Kickstarter actually
uh we needed a custom board gaming solution and this is just steel frame with shelves that you can change the height this cost uh after shipping about "$1,300 it's a lot of money for a shot be" careful what I know no but this is finished W it's finished w painstakingly sanded and Polished I get it did I touch anything okay listen bro but you like let's go let's sand it yolo all the freaking time with you can't do this with this thing it took like two freaking years let the record show how
carefully I lifted this without so much as jostling it against anything else let the record show of all the times lus has dropped oh my how do you do that you just let the record show okay that they're not a lot lot of dings and scratches on the stuff in my house I know when to be careful with something what are you talking about isn't there massive goues in your bedroom oh my that didn't sound good this is a good time to explain how this table came to be well when a daddy
tree loves a mommy tree oh pardon me I've uh but the record show it was not me who dropped anything I what I was saying is if it doesn't fit in the hole find a different hole don't try and force it into the hole okay I I literally explained Kyle look here have a seat I'm calm okay look I'm com sit on your sit on your calmness blanket no but I can't sit cuz my ass is  stuff okay my back pockets are full of stuff that's not better I have two SC if you have a problem just get a colostomy
bag I got to be honest with you uh this does not appear to be pre-tapped I don't see place where this goes oh yeah it doesn't go in there sorry I'm going to have to take the L on that one um no you need to put them in this we no we can understand now that it's very obvious when designing this table I did what I always do I kind of look for inspiration so I did a Google search for what's already out there and kind of came up with an amalgamation of two that I really like I knew I wanted a
table that was a poke style table one with a recess plane surface however I like my tables to be multi-functional so I I also wanted to have a system that I can put on top very similar to the table that we destroyed in the intro where you could have a board game in the middle and you can put the topper on top and now have a normal dining room table now the question is what do you do with that topper when you're plane because if you notice the big topper that lonus and Elijah walked in earlier in the video
when we had to take it off the table it needed two people and then we had to like put it against the wall and was awkward as flip so the first inspiration was from a fow Canadian by the name of caute gaming if I bushed the name whatever they designed a system to house the table toppers within the legs of the table which is way better than just throwing it on the floor now eventually eventually I will have dividers that will hold us in place you can see how the actual slats rest yeah there'll be
three on this side and three on this side you will have a perfect triangle in between the three leaves from each side so you're going to put a computer there so I designed it with one computer in here to slide in okay but then I thought well the other leg is going to be awfully lonely so we may as well just make it symmetrical and stick another one of these on the other flipping side huh nice legs thank you I work on them every day what's the next piece y ready yep oh it fell into one slot
that's not in mine you are not wrong that's the nicest thing he's ever said to me oh I numbered it oh yeah that look pretty cool hey nice nice my gosh took me too long to get these are uh six-sided dice right so if you turn them if you turn them up like on one of the things there's numbers do that's why I thought they were dice do you roll them like as a bottle Flip or like a oh balls no can you have four and L us have one please okay well here's two no no I want no no oh my give him
number four you take number one that's not number I think number one where's your bathroom now is probably a good time to talk about the hardware that's holding everything together what we have is these threaded inserts with these horizontal bars that thread in to the machine screw side of the threaded insert then you face this d0 portion upright and then you insert these into something that rests over here then it goes into all oh oh God I think the wood took less damage than the ceiling you
could just have us move stuff and then it just might not get damaged ooh got him you put this inside the hole here and just slide it in and it sits there all that's needed is a grub screw inside the top of this and it holds legendary back Force machine screw not even even holding it lt.com knock to a screwdriver it's on there now now I need you to drop these inside the big hole with the Holy side facing the Audi side okay let me check if it's the holy side I guess we got it
nice I'm just going to do the other one cuz this is going to be quicker called parallelization maybe we would have finished the screwdriver faster if You' used it if I remember correctly someone had a midlife crisis halfway through it and made me redesign part of the fre uh bit storage system sorry I have a lot of pent up rage I don't like all this fighting no it's good it's not real fighting we're not really going to get divorced that's what my last parents said quick question for you were we
supposed to put the dowly things in on some of them there's more holes drilled that un needed what's your name Elijah I put like five extra holes in someone's wall what he's actually really nice so ni such a nice guy otherwise Elijah wouldn't have walked out of there in one piece after what to his don't move it is this a bad time for another Madagascar reference move it I like to move it move it oh King Julian that's not screwing in very nicely what we need to do right now is
flip why are the two strong guys on one side oh Lordy looks good thank you it's at this spot what happened no if he sees it he'll never unsee it I am going to see it the second you move your hand anyway he's standing there all day hey sweetie we might need the the the the that is a beautiful table thank you we put it together oh I'm sure you worked really hard yeah we did yeah I just he giggling and swearing upstairs really cuz the only person you were up there with was uh the baby the last thing that
needs to happen is I need to put like a million pocket screws all around the bottom of the table to hold the rails to the plywood you know that it's not a pool table though right uh so why do you need pocket screws there's no pockets can't argue with that logic line is Sebastian folks he'll be here all day yeah I will there is way more extras than just the table on float plane lm. g/f flat plane go check it out basically me Kyle and lonus kill each other for an hour it's great I have a really
important question how are we going to measure and Trace out on the fabric now that you put the whole table together I thought we were going to trace the plywood onto the fabric uh that sounds like a u problem it's your table it's a u problem you'll figure it out my angel you prob smart he seems stressed no I'm fine I'm not stressed this is just my does he have like a favorite meal or something I'm fine our problem here is that we don't have an edge that we can trust like typically that's my crutch is
I'll just grab one that I can say okay yeah this definitely straight but this one is just ragged as hell I don't think it's even going to fit under there yeah that was him cutting it at work with a random pair of scissors so that means we are going from scratch ass balls here what Kyle y I really hate to be that guy what what's up but I genuinely think that we should probably be popping this off and the best way to tension this is probably going to be to run the screws through it why no why do you need
to tension it look at it yeah I'm looking at it this is something you knew already isn't it we talked about it yeah you put under and now it's fine oh I'm going to just pick up my cards here's what we're going to do Elijah and I are going to go build some computers and Kyle is going to undo a lot of screws I was hoping to build the computer today but he didn't finish the table so you decided I didn't to build the camera Nick light did don't he suggested it this is your video you had full thing
to be for fun we've decided to do this as a challenge I'm going to be building Kyle's machine while 30in builds Leon except I apparently getting thrown a bit of a curveball because I have to pull the AO cooler out of Kyle's current PC and you just have to build a computer yes also we both have only this space to work that's fine I call the table also curveball for You Leon has some hard drives inside her machine that she would like inside hers nice he called Leon's machine this is
mine it was it has an asset tag for this computer give it man these are nice machines ryzen 7 7700x eight cores Zen 4 b650 I aorus Ultra motherboard I got to say I'm finding the size of these computers a little confusing given that we're using uh little tiny motherboards but shout out Kyle shelis almost every other his and hers element of these upgrades that I've seen before she has gotten a like B tier upgrade while he has kept the best stuff for himself these are both the
same so far yeah I think they're both the same throughout but we'll find out I guess as we go see he's not all bad hear that Kyle I have been downstairs 5 minutes and I think I've heard five insults apparently I chose a more powerful computer for me and then threw my wi to the bus and got her some cheap that's not what we who that's not what it always said but thanks for admitting it hey Kyle what kind of display did you get was it a monitor or a projector brother look I got the alien I got the
alien wear one that plof suck it what I know what kind of display you got okay then why did you ask cuz you're projecting I don't know what that means I don't see built computers why don't you talk less and work more I don't see a finished table that's your fault that's your fault damn I didn't know he got an oven as an upgrade cuz you're getting roasted good choice of ram though DDR 56000 cl32 well configured system you got help with this hey do you doubt my ability so much that
icon come up with a spec he did get help didn't he no I didn't they also got the 990 Pro the 2 TB version in each of these Kyle's is already pre-installed so lonus has a bit of Advantage um but yeah that's two terab for gaming that's perfect now like that's a lot of storage I really did draw the Short Straw here in order to get this aiio out I have to get out a whole bunch of stuff behind this motherboard this computer is coming completely apart speaking of Hardware he paid for there is no way that this is
under budget what's under budget I'm talking about that I don't think you're within budget which part which part the part where you've got like two high-end gaming PCs I thought I saw a 7900 series GPU in one of them I can promise you right now the computers are within budget I paid for the entire board game table myself ah okay that makes sense see you later no please I just I literally just paid for house cleaning okay to be clear Kyle already had a pretty decent machine ryzen 2600x 1080
TI it's just that the new stuff is a lot better when I first got this upgrade I was planning on Thunderbolt but learning from this guy's mistakes I just plan to do Straight optical cables so that's why we have that optical cable and that's why that panel is off the wall oh well that panel's off the wall because I haven't closed that panel from when I got heat installed 3 years ago okay you should have um said that it's off so we can run cables yes it's off because we can run cables so the other side of that
hole that we just shot comes out on the other side of this wall so all we have to do is run the cable down across the floor to the computers  table now it's time to figure out where all these ssds are going to go hit Kyle yep do you have three SSD slots on you oh there's one on the back one on the back and then I already have one SSD in there and I believe one can go on the underside of this carrier board oh God he's trying really hard to contribute right now he's doing good I mean I can
just go Kyle you are walking living breathing content why do I feel like you're um making content no shut the no what's the what's the word when you taking the piss no not taking um patronize thank you that one I love America okay well we we should I'm not cutting it no no no no the last time I cut this fabric put us in the situation  now how's it going uh um I don't want to say you're right just yet I just was genuinely wondering how it's going cuz check this out yeah
that's awesome that's literally exactly what you want and now we don't even have to get the cut perfect cuz we can just have it you just hide all of it yeah how are these cases to build in so far they're triangular there is only one case in the world that would fit the exact design that I did and that's that one what are you compensating for nothing because um I have three kids so  did you test fit if you have enough 8 Pin power connectors for your graphics card on this power supply yes we do well
I have different power supplies okay let's use that one then before you use a modular cable from one power supply on another you need to make 100% damn good andure that they use the same pin out because otherwise you will destroy what is on the other end of it which is why I Austin check it RMI and axi do not use the same pinout unfortunately fud um RMI may be able to handle the high transients of this thing though if I have to extract the power supply then I guess I will when you said did I test
fit everything it was just user error cuz you could have moved that bracket a little bit to the left but I'm saying if you had test fitted it that bracket would have already been moved yeah but I moved it on that one but not this one cuz I haven't built on this one don't blame the fact that you don't know how to use the case on me did you read the manual it's in Chinese but did you read it I'm not an but it's funny would you guys talking smack about me while I was downstairs we didn't
actually please cut to the part where were talking smack about how ECT these two machines shout out Kyle these are both the same so far I can't wait till he watches this video I know for his wife system we have the RX 7800 XT in this case it actually mounts vertically along this side here so he did give her the worst system oh that's true pretty sure I saw 7900 XTX in his I guess okay for the difference in price they could have both gotten XTS but no he had to have the topof the line I see how it is
I take back all the nice things I said before my wife doesn't do as much gaming as I do maybe she'd game more if she had a decent GPU hey Glenn if you want to see Power Supply D pinning it's really cool just kidding it sucks 4 to eight yep all right rock on we just made this cable work you see this oh my God what do you have a c19 power cable are you fing kidding me all right I have a 1250 watt in my old case I'll just bring it up what you're joking it's 10 years old oh it's it's an FXX power supply when FX
XFX when they still used to be a thing which is why I didn't want to use it okay this power supply might be 13 years old but this thing freaking slaps it's "80 plus gold 1,50 WTS it's actually not" even that big like it's that much shorter than the 1500 watt that I just pulled out of here and it's got a hybrid fan mode thing it C Sonic made here's something cool remember when we did that video on that super cool Honeywell PTM 7950 thermal pad material that was like a thermal pad that performed better than
thermal paste well guess what we got in touch with the distributor this is actually Kyle's doing and we are going to be selling at this right on LT store half of that half of this okay L it would be a little bit too expensive ah got it anyway we're also going to be selling individual 60x 60 pads if you don't want to cut it and when I say 60 I mean 60 mm but basically we're going to have a legit source for this stuff that's actually somewhat reasonably priced for a change so you can use this
super cool thermal pad material I cut it way too big oh my goodness for your CPU I cannot for the life of me figure out how to peel these stupid thermal pads anymore pouring it in your fridge for at least a couple of hours before you begin what it's too warm it's a phase change  now oh yes yes yes yes yes yes yes okay face change you want to see if it posts post it you're the host with the most post then we shall call you Malone hey posted man this thing is even easy to Cable manage in too cuz like you
just hide everything behind your sexy graphics card yep so easy all right we're booting it three two that's a positive sign three drives  go dude these are heavy so this is it this is it final form baby it's rock solid man so um just across the hallway or yeah it's just over the floor like no no I just mean in the long run probably just across the floor and just put like a stepping pad or something um any other ideas I realized that this is a little late for me to be coming to this
realization but these computers being in the table serves no purpose at all no you could just as easily Huck them in the network closet and then you'd achieve all the same absolutely noise and and cooling benefits UPS absolutely but how cool is it to have two computers in a ball gaming table actually I take that back we play DND d a lot and even though we play in person we use an online program to move the characters around a company called wormwood makes pretty much the exact same top I reverse
engineered the top from videos they made of how they build it so you ripped it off kind of I reverse engineered it I so you ripped it off I got so close that we found out we're in breach of a patent that they just filed in my defense they hadn't done the patent when I started this project it's been fairly recent so we reached out to them and they were good sports and because this for personal use they were okay with it okay and they were even kind enough to send over what I consider
in my humble opinion to be the main reason why I chose the top is the ability to have magnetic attachable accessories okay now you obviously don't want water where you're gaming right obviously that would be stupid oh you want to you want to move  oh okay that's pretty cool you want it on the inside no problem and to show you how close I got to their design this is from them this is really cool yep but doesn't explain why we need a computer in the table so because we play D and D online
we each need screens I see so you know how you did your car and you have those USBC powered screens yes I'm going to embed those into wood play surfaces have them magnet into the table and run the USBC connector into Mr USBC over here won't you work on that one but you can plug it into the back of the GPU or the back of the GPU yes yeah obviously that's not going to happen now right because the technology doesn't exist I will figure out a way and then we can talk about it but right now
they're going to the table because they're going to look sick cool okay that looks awesome though I'm going to take some monitors and new peripherals and I'm going to install them upstairs sounds good that's a good idea see you later bye I found Kyle's new monitors but I'm not really sure what the configuration is supposed to be yes so you need that as your secondary even though you have a 34in Ultra wide qdo Leed yeah absolutely this is a 165 165 when you overclock it yes oh okay
pretty sick monitor what games do you guys play together uh what's that game called where you B Gate 3 no I play Boulders gate takes two yeah it takes two play it takes two it only took me two guesses we uh play Minecraft together these are these systems are a little overpowered for it takes two in Minecraft that's fair um I used to play WoW before my guild it's a little overpowered for wow can you tell me something you're going to run that justifies the 7900 XTX do maternal cyberp Punk cuz that's not
optimized I mean are you going to play it no got to love that AMD money it's just got to flex it man for the past few weeks I haven't been playing games I've been building board game tables yeah I spend a lot more time setting up my gaming setup than gaming these days I get it it's been a while since I've looked at one of these I'm sure I can figure out how to put it together 3440 by 1440 165 Herz this thing's awesome though thousand nits Peak brightness HDR the only problem for Kyle is that this
is the kind of monitor that until you've seen it you don't really feel like I don't really need that you know right but she's going to be right next to it seeing it I think he's going to end up with two bro not all over my new screen I have kids they don't use this keyboard  do these are super cool we have had quite a few people ask us hey we've seen you use Optical display port and Optical HDMI cables to run a long-distance display a lot of times but what about usb these are for mono Price It's called
The Blackbird 4K and this one will do up to 50 m over a cat 5V cable and then all you got to do is plug in power at both ends and it'll carry up to four usb2 devices so that's perfect for mice and keyboards and things like that even though it isn't going to have the kind of speed that you would would want for say you know a USB external SSD of course I mean Kyle do you even need that up here or this is just for gaming this is just for gaming then who cares wiggle the cable no not too much just Wile oh
good job pull okay I got it I got it thanks thanks thanks stop stop okay stop good job Dad we're ready dad oh you know what he does need us to do though he needs us to see if that monitor turns on if you guys see anything turn on on there then you're going to shout it's working okay hey we have one working computer let's go all I had to do was be the one who touched it oh wait wait wa hold on hold on hold on I see I see a crime being committed over here I'm actually in the building and
someone other than me is reading the ABCs of gaming for bedtime story am I allowed to read it no all right we'll let your mom do it then is yes how many more minutes that do I need your dad for yeah not so long that he can't come up and tuck you in okay deal yeah okay you read I can read okay okay okay B is for button pushing these is fun to do which one's blue do you know good job we've determined that it's probably a GPU driver issue right now on Elijah's machine because Kyle didn't run ddu so
he's got both amds drivers and uh their friendly competitor so we're doing a proper driver install and we're pretty sure that once that's done we're ready to go but hey look at this all three displays are lit and listen to that no noise besides my Ser why is that there I haven't move it downstairs yeah I I'm not not now later this looks amazing is this just staged for b-roll and all that yeah pretty pretty much well it's going to look freaking awesome I can't believe how this setup turned out we got the
computers in they're on the rails the finish on the wood looks am amazing the accessories just pop on and off oh man speaking of pop that red surface turned out absolutely perfect I can't believe how well it goes with the table and while the cable management to the upstairs might need a little work there's no denying the results that is a night and day difference up there we've got dual monitors on Kyle set up with a 3440 by 1440 QD OLED and I mean what is still a pretty sick gaming monitor a
secondary man does HDR look good on this thing and even Leon's machine in spite of being a hand me- down special looks and performs awesome so thank you so much AMD this ultimate Tech upgrade  SLO but we got through it and look neither of us is dead yeah I mean we might have lost if you guys enjoyed this video check out one of our other AMD ultimate Tech upgrades uh maybe atams if you enjoy the chaotic energy
