we make a lot of videos which is why over the years we've built out over 2 and a half pedabytes of bulk storage but somehow it's not enough It's never enough and that's especially true when you consider all of our upcoming projects the videos just keep coming the badminton gaming center needs capacity and if I am ever going to deliver on that free storage backups as an employee perk concept I'm going to need a lot more storage like at least another pedy worth in this economy you're right
storage ain't cheap but what if I told you that I could get a pedite for half the price I'm listening well we can in our quest to find the most cost-effective storage upgrade we stumbled upon these they are recertified drives but the recertification is done by Seagate themselves and they come in at just about half the price of the same drives brand new so like any other same person would I immediately handed eBay my credit card information and ordered "$10,000 worth of them that's 60 drives"
so you got to be wondering lonus what's the catch come closer and I'm going to tell you it's our sponsor MSI they've got laptop deals on Deck this December from the sleek and slim modern 15h aai to the gaming Powerhouse Katana a15 AI you can save big by clicking our Link in the  okay the real answer to what's the catch is we don't know yet that's kind of the point of this adventure you see the best advice that we've ever gotten and given is to avoid secondhand storage so this
is kind of untreed territory for us but the deal it was too sweet to pass up now it's not like we were worried about getting outright scammed eBay has pretty good buyer protections and the main sellers of these recertified drives seem to have excellent ratings with most of the drives even coming with some kind of warranty but there's still a lot of questions like what does recertified even mean are they used it's hard to say I mean the eBay listings for these drives say that they have extremely low
power on hours and no bad sectors which would seem to suggest that they're basically brand new but if they were recertified by Seagate the manufacturer then in theory they could just reset the power on hours the next thing the script says is unbox them but there's not a whole lot of unboxing to do like is this how they came well it's it's not like when you buy an individual drive it's not like they're all going to ship in like Amazon packaging when you're buying 60 they come in trads and that makes
sense okay so how used do these look I would say they look pretty not used to me not at all there's some fingerprints but you know our inventory people definitely put asset tags on them not on this one oh it's freaking clean we gloves even the screw holes I don't think these have ever been mounted to anything look at this 22 2022 are they all like that 2020 2021 so these were manufactured anytime over the last few years I mean these drives didn't come out until like the
end of 2021 like December oh yeah that one's 2020 so that must be a very early one where did they come from server Parts deals ah yes on eBay so in instead of buying our drives from seagate's own store we chose server part deals they sell them either Factory sealed still recertified but sealed or they actually crack them open and pre-b bur in test them for up to 50 hours according to server part deals the chance of getting a DOA Drive is actually much lower with those Burnin ones so we opted for that
when we picked these up last December sometimes it takes us a while to catch up to our production ideas we found that The Sweet Spot was these 20 terab drives for $180 a piece and looking on eBay seems like we actually got a pretty sweet deal they're closer to $220 now but even that is a huge discount compared to new and you could probably save a bit by buying from them directly rather than buying through eBay Disclosure by the way server part deals is one of our sponsors now but not on
this video and they actually weren't when we bought these drives from them no we we paid retail for these should we plug them in yeah I want to see if the hours are correct okay we got Cate SE tools we've got one of our drives here yeah Drive details smart 21 okay that checks out that's like nothing essentially yeah great now we just need a machine to put them in since our goal is to Save A Buck we're going to reuse as much Hardware as possible starting with this 45 Drive storinator XL 60 that
we decommissioned a few years ago it still fits 60 drives just like it did when it was part of our original paby cluster but now it has double the capacity cuz we're using 20 TB drives man I remember when we built that so many people were like you're crazy dude just just use the cloud bro news flash the cloud is expensive bro and even when it isn't getting your data back from it is really expensive it's actually been pretty validating seeing how many folks have been migrating back
to having their servers on Prem now to be clear we do use back Blaze backups but only for backup and only for our active projects now obviously a home or a small business user is unlikely to have one of these kicking around but everything that we're doing could be scaled down to just a handful of drives in a Nas chassis or even a single Drive in a recycled oplex like that one that Jake has right next to him which is the same one that we showed off in our hexos announcement video there's actually even
people selling 3D printed Nas cases that look pretty cool the point is you don't need to buy dozens of drives in a fancy old server to get a great deal or at least what we hope is a really great deal you sound so confident oh I'm confident all right I'm confident it's time to rip these out of here oh it's almost as old as me it is not on the subject of our server being kind of old there are some Choice upgrades we want to make to this old girl before we throw her back in the rack oh yeah if our
inventory records are correct the CPU in that machine is over 8 years old and perform Sim Illy to a first gen ryzen 5 I mean look don't get me wrong there is absolutely no shame in driving the car you got and for home use realistically your network speed is going to be a bottleneck before your CPU but we happened to have some newer Hardware sitting on the shelf specifically this ASRock rack Rome d8 2T with an epic 7402p 24 core processor according to PassMark it is nearly five times faster
than the old8 core that it's replacing now one important tip if you are going to be reusing old gear like our old board make sure to update the BIOS to get the latest security patches and definitely replace any dried out thermal past this one should be good I I redid that not that long ago okay board's in but I forgot to check the memory it looks like yeah we got 256 gigs of ram in here which means we should probably put in some more the rule of thumb is about 1 gig of RAM per terabyte of
storage for read caching but our workload is actually pretty read light so I think we're just going to leave this for now what we're not not going to leave are these hbas these high point 750s were end of life years ago but more importantly they just kind of suck So the plan is to replace them with some LSI 9200 series cards now these are also very old like PCI Express Gen 2 a but for us that's a feature since they happen to have the right connectors for the cabling in our machine so
specifically we're going to be using a pair of genuine LSI 8 drive cards and then three of these 16 Drive cards two of which are genuine and one of which is an eBay knockoff now we had a whole video planned on these things back in the day which is actually why we have this I think this one's the fake one yeah it doesn't say LSI on the front whereas the other ones do but the thing is counterfeit silicon is pretty unusual and I suspect this is just old chips from maybe failed boards in some other
way that have been resolder onto new boards so should be fine I guess that's part of the adventure I've had some friends who've had these like cheap cards work for years without issues and others who've had them die in a few months we don't have much choice either way since the legit ones are really hard to find I'm almost done wiring up all the drives then all I got to do is Chuck a little m.2 boot Drive in there and then in our last slot that's not it uh I'm going to be using a melanox there we go Invidia
connectx 6 dual Port 100 Gig network card oh you want to put that in too we're also going to use this cool adapter do dad to connect this 2 and 1/2 in Dell Gen 4 nvme SSD that we had lying around and then we can use that to help with read caching or level two Arc it can hang out let screw it in first what I don't need to screw nothing in you screw it in look it fell out that's because you didn't screw it in way to go Jake didn't say drop it on the be careful that's from startech they kindly
sent that to us thanks  startech now to keep everything in this area cool I'm going to throw in a noctua industrial 3000 RPM 140 mil fan that way we won't have any issues with overheating on our network card hbas or the nvme SSD that's in there now to find out if it boots I don't actually know like it  should n my optimism is steadily decreasing if you have a situation like this where you're not getting a display signal from a computer you're trying to troubleshoot a good way to check if it's
actually working is to use caps lock or numb lock which you can see when I click caps lock it is turning on and off so clearly this system is posting it's just not outputting the display signal for some reason or potentially this cable or the monitor is not working I'm going to try the ipmi and see if that works hey okay it's working sick with that out of the way let's talk software there are obviously a lot of options but our go-to for a while has been trass scale it's free which is always great and most
importantly the ZF FS file system it uses is perfect for large setups like this and super resilient so if we have any issues with these drives which I hope we don't our data should be fine if you're a home gamer you might also want to check out hexos the userfriendly nas software Linus invested in once it's out of Early Access but if you're not feeling adventurous there's always unraid whose main claim to fame is the ability to expand its array one drive at a time or there's open media Vault we've
got trass installed now everything seems to be working and we can finally put some hard drives in heavy as a full  help it'll take a sec for them all to get like detected and imported but let's see how many we have so far ooh is she working I mean it's on but I haven't looked at the drives yet so I guess let's see how we doing 61 wow they're all working well they all show up well yeah I mean we haven't made an array yet should we run a smart test on all of them first can you do that all
at once oh yeah nice wow well that's great so they all pass a short smart test if you're getting new drives you should do more than that you should usually people recommend zeroing them all out not because you need to clear the data but as a burn in to make sure that all the sectors are good and everything is happy we're not going to do that right now but it's not a bad thing to try and in theory server part deals has already done that for us cool so we can make a pool now oh boy what do
you want to call it swimming what so it's a swimm swimming pool no I don't like that I'm going to call it ocean I'm not salty since this is primarily archival storage and since we have a lot of discs we're going to group our drives into six 10 Drive raid Z2 vdevs that two in the raid Z2 means that we have two drives worth of data protection kind of like raid six so for us to lose any actual data we would need to have three drives fail and all three would have to be within the same 10 Drive Group which
which is fairly unlikely since multi-drive failures like that usually happen when you end up with drives from the same bad batch and since our drives are recertified it's much more likely that they are from different time periods and different batches and the script says in theory because we hadn't actually looked at the stamps on the chassis yet in practice they are very different 2021 2022 they're all over the place now for a home setup you're probably going to go with something like
a four six or eight wide raid Z1 or Z2 depending on how important that data is to you but with the new r z expansion feature you can start as small as two or even three drives and then expand that existing group as you want to add more drives that's pretty convenient yeah well we can click Start now or go yeah do it so we should have 873 tib bytes what are you for t to TB 960 terab damn hard drives have just been kind of quietly in the background getting like kind of awesome kind of thick well I've
paid absolutely no attention attention to the it's like children uh our cash SSD is not detected most people if they're trying to build something like this at home they're not building with a petabyte of drives they're not going to have a cache SSD in it so let's have a look something about it is not happy we will have to figure that out later yep I'm not expecting like crazy numbers cuz it's really old hbas and we have a very wide vde depth size I mean but 8 gigabytes a second
that's pretty good or giby bytes oh I'll take it goes up and down and up and down it's hard drivve so we're not really gonna get much better than that well dude I'm not gonna complain about that that's sick we're not even GNA be able to realistically do that so yeah that's great but most of what we're doing on this thing is sequential anyway exactly that is like five to seven times what we would even be doing over like a 10 gig connection yeah which is most of the accesses we do except when we're doing
backups and stuff anyways so great freaking awesome yeah I mean the drives they haven't complained wait this is great but remember you said you were going to reach out to and find out what's the deal with these drives I did they didn't respond at least they haven't yet and it's been like 4 days or something like that okay I did find a press release on their website about this program with eBay and it makes it sound almost like they're taking drives that people were going to throw away
like from a data center recycler and refurbing them I don't know it doesn't say anything conclusively and they look really new they look really new it seems like our best guess is that they're just customer returns or something like that okay well bad batches they rehabed one way or another in total we spent "$1,160 on 62 drives which compared to" the "235,000 we would have paid for new ones" seems like a pretty good deal as long as they don't all crap out for now things
look good but it's hard to say what the long-term reliability is going to look like I'm hopeful though especially given that none of them died immediately so even if they do the fact that we're using ZFS means we should be able to resilver and repair the in a pretty safe way yeah I mean most hard drives either die like in the first day or you know 3 four 5 years later right server part deals also warranties the drives themselves so should be okay yeah and full disclosure um I took about
half of these drives for another project and they were running for 6 months and they still don't have errors okay well that's a good sign yeah and to feed my data hoarder habits in this economy I actually switched over to recertify drives at my house and and I've got two more or three more of them actually that have been running for multiple years now and they've been great now a brand new exos Drive is going to come with a 5year warranty instead of just two but given these are around half the price with
halfish the warranty it was kind of worth the gamble for me but let us know in the comments if you've had any experience with recertified drives either good or bad like I don't know we get Flack sometimes when we show a good deal online and then it goes out of stock a few hours later and no one else can get the same deal but that shouldn't be the case with these there's an entire industry around reusing recertifying and refurbishing Enterprise it equipment and there seems to be no shortage of storage
devices uh one of our favorites is the those jbod disc shelves oh yeah those allow you to connect a bunch of hard drives to like an existing system and uh we did a video on them a while ago you should check it out yeah we also came across a pretty wild deal on some nvme ssds when we were researching this project so uh Happy deal hunting out there for now it's time for me to go hunting segue season to our sponsor ground news when you think of the news you think cold hard facts right wrong
