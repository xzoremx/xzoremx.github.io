up everyone and welcome to the W show we got a great show for you guys this week Asus apologizes for their strange and expensive repair quotes what was our headline today I forget something like uh the Apple un your news iPhones are undeleting old photos even on devices that have been wiped what what else we got going on this week Microsoft announces Proteus controller another like uh controller that helps you have inputs if you have difficulty with standard controllers uh and also there's
a live service like MMO game that is going offline into a single player/ Coop game and is removing all of their microtransactions well that I mean that last part sounded good yeah   Squarespace H shs and uh uh uh-oh magical I take one bite of food and you guys just you know those are our sponsors you guys that are sponsors trying to blame me for  iPhones have been undeleting old news many users and this has been reported by The Verge and Mac Rumors many users are reporting old long deleted photos are
resurfacing on their iPhones as if they were recent photos following Apple's 17.5 iOS update this includes devices that were previously wiped resulting in embarrassment for at least one user who wiped their device before selling it to to a friend only to have revealing photos reappear on the device it is unclear at this time whether this is an indexing bug or a synchronization issue with iCloud but many have reported finding long long deleted photos including sexual images meaning that
this is unlikely to be a problem with recent photos being inappropriately retained wow is there ever a lot to unpack here and I would like to preface this by saying look this is not unique to Apple this particular incident is uniquely happening to Apple but this whole issue where Cloud providers are not actually fuing deleting something when you press the delete button is a widespread issue now in some cases this is a feature more than a bug for example I don't think we're doing a back Blaze
read this week but one of the things that we mention whenever we talk about one of our sponsors back Blaze is that for a fee you can actually extend their data retention when you delete something and the idea is that it's a it's a recycle bin which if you if you've ever like sent an email and then been like oh wait and then clicked the undo thing or whatever because you you misspell the word or did something wrong like that having an undo can often be quite nice and in the context of something like
back Blaze where the things that especially B2B customers are backing up to their service could be Mission critical and that is that is it that's their offsite backup uh the ability to you know undo an accidental control a delete um or even in some cases a malicious deletion totally of off-site backups could be absolutely critical but in the case of services where it is being communicated to you that when you delete something  gone man this is challenging now now something that we don't know right
because this is saying old long deleted photos right something that we don't know is were these photos are these photos on another I device somewhere are they synchronizing to iCloud through that and then is this simply a case of the device ID somehow not not being UNL correctly from that iCloud account like there's there's a number of different ways that this could transpire but the bottom line is that this is a broad issue where Cloud providers are a not deleting things that you mark delete
necessarily and not managing that data  um adequate I guess is the word that I'm looking for yeah so what I want to know okay our discussion question here is is this a temporary bug or is it indicative of a deeper issue with information storage that needs to be addressed I mean absolutely the second one but what I want to know is what is the liability here and when are these companies going to answer for these things yeah cuz like I mean there's the there's the there's
the sexual images angle which is I think like the main one that's coming up especially in the article that we're seeing but what about just the Privacy there's privacy issues there's photos that might be relatively traumatic to people yeah they might not want coming back they deleted for a freaking reason and having that put like you know front and center in front of them can be pretty frustrating and annoying um and I mean oh man like here's here's here's what I want to know like apple is a
company that purports to take privacy very very seriously how exactly is it that this data wouldn't be stored in an encrypted fashion and if it gets synchronized to a device how would that be  authentication I mean tell tell me you know more about this kind of stuff than I do it's not necessarily stored in an encrypted fashion well why not it's more difficult and if they feel like they don't need to just like who cares that's not a good response brother I'm not saying that's the truth either I
have no idea I'm just saying it's not I I don't I don't necessarily know that they're stored in encrypted fashion um like uh photos on iOS do they back up to iCloud uh we might be able to figure this out I mean if you pay for iCloud sure so if you don't pay for iCloud then it's who knows theoretically yeah your only your five gigs are going to back up and then that yeah that should be all that's synchronized to iCloud like even with the um that that huge celebrity image leak that was all things that
people were storing in iCloud there was no way to to get something that was locally stored off of a device off of it um it was it was all through I believe that was mostly through uh authentication theft and uh third parties getting access to people's iCloud accounts I'm not 100% certain it says your iCloud data is encrypted the encryption keys are secured in Apple data centers where we can help you with data recovery um and only certain data is end to end encrypted uh but I don't
think we're talking what an end to end encrypt encryption scenario like this isn't being grabbed part way so I mean why why okay obviously there's a there's a computational cost right but yeah with how with how with how many accelerators we have in modern devices don't you feel like and to end encryption I can understand not wanting on everything that can get pretty annoying but um the the encryption in general which it says it has to be fair on iCloud um that's not that bad and
they say that they have it so that makes sense to me um how it would be unencrypted like did they did they log out of everything before they sold this device to their friend to be clear uh when he says unencrypted decrypted how how it would be decrypted well I mean theoretically when you wipe an iPhone it's wiped so the only way did they do that though they said they did and it and I mean realistically I don't know man um oh I mean no I this kind of checks outc how could you okay so your
friend would have to log into their iCloud account you can only be logged into one iCloud account at a time on an iPhone from my understanding so as soon as your friend logged into their iCloud account anything that was synchronized with the old iCloud account should be gone I would like to think so I mean I don't know how any of this stuff works so like commenting on it is is a little bit difficulty uh handyman pointed out something that I was kind of reading into but wasn't sure about either where
on the the end of what I was reading says Advanced Data protection for iCloud is an optional setting that offers our highest level of uh cloud data security and handyman is saying that the key is only stored uh on just the user side if you have that Advanced Data protection enabled so they have the keys for everything on their end I see if you're not running Advanced Data security which I would assume like less than 1% of people are running yeah if it's not a default I don't think
users going to be touching it totally and like Google has the same thing almost no one runs it um so they they absolutely have a way to decrypt it on their end there's people in the chat that are saying this has nothing to do with iCloud uh sounds more like data wasn't deleted off the device storage but the thing is that the the way that nand flash works like it's um once you do a secure eras which from my understanding is part of the device wiping process for both Android and iOS
at this point once you do a secure erase Nan Flash doesn't work the same way as old mechanical storage did where you could kind of reconstruct at least parts of files by just looking at contiguous ones and zeros along the the tracks in the platter it's not like that once you once you delete the index of what all of those zeros and ones in all of these um in all these Nan cells correspond to there there's not really a meaningful way to reconstruct that the only way that you can recover data from from a
from a from a nan flash device is by recovering the controller like you you essentially have to restore that that index that's stored on the controller you you can't just get it from nand chips so so from Apple um on the iPhone go to settings General reset and select erase all content and settings this is a secure erase of everything but iOS so it's sounds like you're right that's what they're doing people are talking about like uh you should talk about how o os's Mark things as deleted that's not generally
what he's talking about what you're talking about is removing a pointer to a file effectively so you you tell your operating system to delete something and instead of actually deleting it cuz it's like whatever this is Flash it just forgets where it is and then we'll eventually write something over top of it that's not secure erase though and it won't even it won't even write something over top of it until you've removed it from your recycle bin potentially depending on the operating system you're
on like for example um I I haven't been using an iPhone lately so the last Apple device that I used daily uh was The Vision Pro and I wanted to delete um a screen recording and I deleted it and it warned me immediately it was like hey this is going into your your 2B deleted folder and you'll have to go in there and you'll you'll have to delete it I just I wanted to play around with the file management on the Vision Pro because was trying to I was trying to transfer screen recordings off of it and
so I was just like I was doing all these screen recordings and I was like oh my God there's no way to there you can't just plug a cable in and transfer data are you kidding me okay so how do I get rid of stuff on this thing and so I was I was trying to figure out how to delete a screen recording and um and so I I ended up having to kind of navigate through that all the little icky picky details that were in my notes for the Vision Pro didn't really end up in the review because we were so late because
we got the device so late that uh it ended up being more like okay what New Perspective can we give on it everyone kind of you know I didn't to talk about their file explorer whatever right um but as far as I could tell the way it works is it goes into a recycle bin for 30 days and then it's automatically purged from there so you wouldn't be at risk of overwriting anything until it's purged from there but it should be noted that the iCloud account that I was using or the yeah the the um iCloud account
that I was using did have extra data storage purchase so it was also syn online so then there was an additional step in order to delete it off of there as well was a whole thing yeah I is this like person who sold their device thing is is that a one-off I I don't even see that in the well it looks like lots of users are reporting the photo coming back but is the sold device thing a  I I think these could potentially be different scenarios they could be um like like someone secure erasing
their device and selling it to someone else and this happening is different than someone just randomly having photos come back this includes previously wiped devices so as far as we can tell at least one user um had revealing photos reappear but it might not be just one user who ended up with photos that didn't belong to them showing up on their device guys if you've uh if you've read a bunch I have spent the entire day today building a computer for our CEO which by the way is going to be awesome we took
suggestions from Reddit for what the theme of the build should be we ended up with all kinds of great suggestions the one that we ultimately settled on was all Chrome and Luke seen it it's pretty amazing actually it's pretty cool you haven't  though oh is it like actually going to be uncomfortable for him to work I mean it doesn't sound like problem oh my  down should be decisive and a man of action moving around talking to the people anyway it's going to be great um so yeah all I'm getting out of this is
that uh none of none of the sea levels are going to have chairs anymore so let's not rule out user error I guess is what we're what we're trying to say on some of it I'm not I'm not saying the thing as a whole but but uh you run into scenarios like this where like some some people that had this genuinely happen speak up and then a bunch of other people that just like screwed up but don't know also speak up and it it ends up getting kind of lost in the Lost in the sauce a little bit
um there's enough reports here that it sounds like this is actually probably happening to a certain degree but I don't think based on the information that we have that we're going to be able to figure out like the mechanism that's failing y um a lot of people just seem to generally be kind of struggling with iCloud like SC in float plane chat says I've had photos that I delete locally stay on iCloud and not show specifically that they still exist it could have redownloaded that was one of the things
that bothered me when I was trying to delete that thing from The Vision Pro as well as I couldn't tell uh I I I couldn't I couldn't tell this device level or Cloud level how I was deleting it and I could see apple taking that approach for the sake of what we were talking about earlier the ability to restore data I bet you that's a lot of this issue man resyncing with a photo you know sometimes when you delete a photo you're like I want this gone this needs to be yod yeah um
yeah and I understand Apple's design philosophy you know big simple buttons you know but sometimes right click is the answer a context menu is just Superior um your philosophy be damned uh so we'll see yeah I don't know well we we'll see how this goes going to be interesting why don't we jump into our next topic here you want to pick another headline one uh sure how about the controller want to talk about the controller yeah this thing looks sick it's very cool look at this thing Microsoft announces
the Proteus controller Microsoft has announced the protus controller a modular controller with swappable face plates and customizable components for gamers with various mobility issues the cube like modules can be snapped together in countless different configurations it's buttons are remappable and its analog sticks can be swapped out for 3D printed sticks with custom grips um and those several files for these sticks are available on uh biow waves website bio with a B yo so
I'm going to share this now so they're showing right here we are open- sourcing the mechanical connection mechanism for the Proteus controller this will allow you to 3D print different components such as handles analog sticks mounts whatever you can think of here are some examples of download firal some of these These are cool and these are sick so it goes from like just fairly standard concave top analog stick to ball grips XL rest that's super cool so for chins or elbows so you can control a joy stick
more easily and hopefully more comfortably um ridge cap analog sticks a thin grip analog stick which could be very interesting because um if you notice how it how it tends to flare you might be able to attach something to this um so you could move in like a different plane but have it adjust a joystick which is very cool um control grip analog caps and square head analog sticks and by open- sourcing the mechanism they're making it so that not only are they making these files able to
be downloaded and others able to be downloaded later but you should be able to design your own as well which is very cool because as far as my understanding goes that Community is kind of all about customizing so being able to 3D print and design your own is probably going to be a pretty big deal super cool and with the way that 3D printing materials are changing like it's not like this has to be made out of just standard pla like you can you could make them actually comfortable you know with like
multimaterial printing yeah so you can have you know a nice stiff shaft and then you can have like a like a softer end cap and man this is it's one of those things that Microsoft just I don't I feel like doesn't get enough attention for the fact that they do this kind of thing I mean look they're a soulless Corporation let's let's treat them as what they are any any company with shareholders at the end of the day is going to look out for its bottom line first we know that but can you grow up
really trying to hold it in  helpful both of you get your together oh man um anyways anyway so the point is yeah okay they're they're a corporation but I feel like this is the kind of thing that when they do we should be paying a lot of attention to we should give be giving them a lot of praise for absolutely because realistically this makes no  this it's it's not going to pay for itself um this is legitimately about enabling gamers and that's super cool I I love it yeah and to to note as well
this doesn't replace the Adaptive controller the Adaptive controller is wicked cool um and honestly I could end up seeing a lot of setups that end up using both absolutely um the one problem that they're run to they running both is just that it's going to be fairly costly um this prodeus controller costs about 300 bucks um it's on sale right now actually um if you go to buy it I think it's $5 % off right now uh let me see really quick yeah so it's it's 15% off right now but uh it'll theoretically be 300
bucks long run USD um but that kind of makes sense cuz it's very complicated I think the Xbox adaptive controller while being super cool is a little bit more basic um this is a fairly complicated controller but I like seeing stuff like this like you said it's unlikely to make a ton of money doesn't excuse buying up game developers and closing them um that that's lame but we we can hit him for that and also praise them for this yeah cuz this is this is great this is like
the opposite this is like the opposite of that this is this is making gaming more accessible and and friendlier yeah uh which is something gaming needs sometimes something on on the other end of this if you're like this sounds cool but it's not applicable to me on the other end of this in my opinion I'm surprised that especially people on the pro scene don't find more use out of things like the Proteus controller and the Adaptive controller because if you are able to enhance the inputs that you
have mhm by making it so that you can introduce your feet or or something else yeah or we you know bringing back our old concept of clinch to prone yeah yeah I was I was wondering you could make that work with the Adaptive controller very likely could yeah um but yeah I I especially for games that have a huge amount of inputs I'm I'm a little bit surprised you don't see more utilization of these just for like making more competitive yeah yeah so consider that as well why don't we jump into D Dan what
are we doing next next up is meres okay let's do some merch messages if you guys are new to the WAN show Welcome hi welcome to the W show I already said it once but uh really though welcome to the L show Welcome to you specifically we don't do Super Chat we don't do twitch bits you can send one if you want we'll take your money sure fine I'll put it in the pile JK use it to pay nice people like Luke and Dan and all the other you know dozens and dozens of people who work here um but what we really want you
guys to do is we want you to get something back for the money that you are throwing at your screen and that's why we created merch messages all you got to do is go to LTT store.com check out some of our amazing products over there and uh in the dang it cart whenever we're live you will see a box where you can leave a merch message it will be responded to by producer Dan and he can either yep just like Chuck it up here like this or he'll respond to it himself or he'll send it to someone else
internally who can best answer your question or he'll curate it for me and Luke to talk about here on the show so we're going to do a couple curated ones but first I want to highlight a couple of things that are going on on the store right now it's finally here Luke this product has been in development for like 2 years whoa It's the dip dye hoodie uh Maria asked me specifically before the show I ran into her cuz um we're having a we're having a lan at my place this weekend and uh her husband's coming and
so I was like yo are you coming and she's like well he's coming and I'm like yeah but are you she's like I don't know I'm thinking I'm like yeah it's fine just send him it's it's fine he could he comes to a lot of he's a part of the event yeah he's he's a he he comes to softball night and stuff he doesn't really need to be plus one anymore at this point but anyway the point was I ran into her and she was like okay okay you often show the product page and you know talk about the new product but like
pay attention to the photos she she's really proud of the photos for Dan and I were talking about these before the show they're really nice oh killing it yeah phenomenal look at man they went and they got like color matching glasses and that one is amazing that's awesome the ones where they have the games yeah I remember uh cool she called out in general chat hey does anybody have these props like it was premeditated and like okay we're going to do this it's awesome freaking awesome Pokemon
game Japanese version too so I love see I love seeing people like use their Creative Energy to do something different hey my first phone what the Motorola v-box right there that's a phone yeah well sort of I mean it's phone it's phone like in functionality phone adjacent yeah so there it is my friends the dip diey hoodie it's here you two could look this cool while you game yeah okay maybe not that one this cool you could look this cool while you game no I'm I'm I'm I'm just I'm just making fun of David
um anyway we've got the dip dieye hoodie uh what else do we have going on this week that might be worth sending a merch message over um oh no that's that's the new big update well I'm going to put mine on it's not that warm and uh Dan do you want to hit us with a merch message yeah sure I've got a few here for you let's see hey all with dating apps like Bumble getting on the AI hype train how do you think that application of machine learning might influence the next generation's dating habits if at
all you seen that Black Mirror episode right yeah hang the DJ all all I've heard from the the the dating scene for a long time now is just screams and Terror uh yeah our topics for later just seem to be looting people um I didn't know that was a topic actually yeah we're going to be talking about uh have your AI date my AI um but why don't we just why don't we just do that topic right now and then we'll and then we'll talk yeah so Bumble founder uh Whitney wolf herd stated in a
recent interview that she thinks the future of online dating get this is for apps to develop a personalizable AI concierge that you can confide in talk about your insecurities and get pointers from she then likewise suggested that in the future we'll be able to send AI Bots based on our personalities on simulated dates with other people's AI Bots as a way of confirming compatibility and  matches huh so I mean is Big Tech basically just treating black mirror as a Playbook at this
point you know the show doesn't have to be prophetic like we can still stop this what happens if like someone's AI traumatizes someone else's AI are they liable like what is this what does this even mean so our merch message question that's the important one thank you very much for uh checking out LTT store.com our merch message question is how will this impact the relationships of future generations and I think it's going to be rough I feel a little unqualified to talk about this to be
perfectly honest with you because I have never even dated online like that was still taboo when I started um when when I settled settled down wow no no no no no no no no no no no no sit down Freud sit down that's made that made it worse you shouldn't have brought him up settled down yep yeah good luck by the way guys just just chill chill good luck a person be in your favor a person 123 says dating apps already broke dating for my generation this is just the obituary I've heard that a lot I've been
reading a lot of articles that gen Z and Millennials are just saying see you later to data apps right now match group seems to be kind of desperately trying to keep um what was the old big one Tinder uh they they seem to be just desperately trying to keep Tinder revenues up putting in these like new ways of like sending people like paid things or whatever these like super Premium Accounts and stuff like that as far as my understanding goes even more than it originally was and it was
originally very much this it has just turned into um extremely short-term engagement Seekers yeah uh SC sco says as someone in gen Z almost everyone on dating apps just wants short-term relationships right now there's another word for short-term relationships it's called um and yeah so it it was heavily like that uh like early on wasn't it I thought that was the whole point of Tinder but it you could still like find relationships on there right cuz that wasn't what like plenty of fish was for
yeah and there there was there was other sites that were specifically not really for that even though it still happened obviously and then Tinder was more for that but some people were not looking for that on those types of services like the swipe Services some people were actually just looking for long-term relationships and had to deal with all the the people that were not um and as far as my understanding goes as someone who hasn't used it in a decade um hearing complaints from people that
do it is only that now and like there's there's people asking I have genuinely had someone ask me like how would I go about finding someone to date I'm like how the heck am I supposed to who asked you that yeah okay I just me I'm like brother I've been in a relationship for like actually almost 10 years like what do you want I don't I can't help you  chicken but it's like it's weird because ever since dating apps became a thing approaching people about potentially dating when you don't know them yet in
real life became kind of like notably taboo really but now the dating app suck so it's like actually what do I do I don't know see like I I um yeah I man meeting people in school that was like was so easy yeah like we I I feel like rough after that if you're in school still do not take for granted how easy it is to network and like expand your Social Circle and make connections if there was something that someone could have you know that that if I had been able to internal Iz properly um
that I that I wish I had had processed when I was in school it would have been make way more connections because once you're an adult I I was talking to um shoot who was it someone on the team I think it I think it might have been David who's uh thinking of joining an adult sports league and I was like man that sounds awesome and I would love to be a part of what sounds like a super cool thing for you but that is just not going to be an option for me because I didn't play that particular sports ball
as a kid and picking up a sport as an adult is freaking hard and the reason I'm bringing this up is that one of the one of the few bloody ways that adults can can Network outside of work and can make new connections is is through activities right and like I I don't know about you guys but like for me Sports is is one is one of the go-tos and it's man it's it's so it's so hard people can be so clicky uh a lot of people Forge their lifelong connections like when they're in their teens and
it's hard to break it's hard to break into those groups like I even noticed this in like other uh in like parent groups right where all their kids are already friends and all the parents are already friends and don't wander away hold on um and all the parents are already friends and and penetrating that click you're always kind of the well we only got three campsites so you're the fourth one like you're always you're always that right in Edge case yeah um maybe it maybe it will work
maybe it it works for this one event but like and I I feel like you like man if I here can can can you come here for a second I wasn't because if I If I Didn't Have You see look y Von's here hi lady um I would just have okay here let's have some fun I would have no idea how to meet people okay van here come okay what's up okay I Die Tomorrow how do you meet people you're gonna make me cry you're really far away from the mic oh okay you have to be way closer okay this is weird um how would I meet people
um man I don't know because I think online dating is being phased out too isn't it yeah that's kind of what we're talking about right it's essentially the topic and I've heard how terrible online dating in general is too um oh man so like if if you essentially let's just assume you're cutting out online dating yeah I would probably try to take some classes and see if I meet people with similar interests okay so like hobby classes yeah yeah or I I do activities like I'd go on Hikes or um things like that I
this I getting a dog is a good thing okay so if you so if you take up hiking  out this was information gathering okay what would you do oh man cuz like I'm not the kind of person to oh sorry I'm not the kind of person to go party or go to a bar or do any of those things like and and especially with kids it's so hard with kids um yeah what would you do I mean I heard VR porn is like really good now so you just wouldn't basically no I I I am I am like I'm I'm I'm I'm helplessly addicted to being in a
relationship like I think since I turned yeah I got mad at him because I was like you know what if I died you'd like date immediately no I no I I no I wouldn't I would be I'd be trying to pick up the pieces of my life I don't even know what bank I use like I would I would actually have some stuff to deal with for quite an extended of time okay I have a folder on my computer called if I die you haven't updated it in like 9 years okay I'll update it for you okay that's not the
point just don't die this is a real thing no it's actually a real thing she definitely has that folder but she definitely hasn't looked at it in almost a decade I've been busy ah yeah me too I don't know what would you do Luke uh I don't know I gen I genuinely have no idea because like I I've told line is some of the stories of how I like tried to meet people in the past like one of the silly things that I did that worked um was I was on a bus and someone sat down next to me and
I just like held my phone fairly far out so it'd be really easy for them to read and started texting about how they were like cute and that's actually pretty clever and then they read it and were like hey like blah blah blah and I was like yeah do you want to go out and they're like yeah sure I like it it worked but like how do you how do you create that scenario yeah was that like on the way to school or something like that cuz school is it wasn't I was going to hang
out with someone but I was going to hang out with someone that was UBC and at a time that I was University age so it sort of worked out cuz there's a bus at UBC yeah so like how do how do you make sure that you know the the right person actually happens to sit next to you on a bus like this is such a random scenario that you can't plan for and man I'd have uh well you can plan for it a little bit no that's what I did I saw lonus in class and I was like hm I think he normally sits there I'm going to go sit
in that row and I sat kind of away like slightly away okay okay but here's here's a weird thing though can uh you can wait the dice a little bit here's here's lonus and I though as a guy if you go on a bus and you see a girl sitting beside your generally you try to not sit right next to them because it can be seen as like well actually he didn't sit right next to me he sat he didn't notice me at first and he sat I you're saying you sat next to him right no so I sat in the Row first and then he
didn't notice me he came in and sat further in and then he noticed me and then started talking to me and then moved closer yeah so you can kind ofus has the Riz dude but honestly like I this I mean that's a fair move though if you're in conversation and then you have to move closer that seems fine but like in general but School makes that so easy because we were sitting in the same class learning the same subject material man like in the real world when are you going to have that opportunity that's
tough I don't know I feel like it's even harder for us because like I never really dated I've never had to do that whole thing so I I don't even I don't even know yeah I mean if I had to give like the best advice that I possibly could it would be find the awesome one and then like lock her up before anyone else even gets a shot at her that's I mean it worked great for me so you know I do I I would say like I don't I don't some like uh advice to younger people I guess is to once you're at an
appropriate age lock her up like lock that up oh I knew what he meant come on you guys come on you guys but it once you're at appropriate age date and like move on early if you don't like the person and start trying to learn the things that you like about people and understand what you yourself need in a relationship what you can provide because you'll start recognizing as well like okay I'm not good at these things and if you end up dating a person who clearly needs those things well then you
should probably just end it and move on and find another one because when you're in say University this is like you're saying the easiest time to like find people you'll find immediately the day you exit University it becomes infinitely harder so what do you guys think about dating friends of friends cuz I feel like that can dangerous yeah I honestly nothing againsts to any of my friends that I've ever had but I'd honestly I'd probably rather have an AI recommend someone to
me Ser seriously cuz at least an AI is not going to have some like agenda yeah yeah yeah that kind always be weird okay well you know playoff hockey is on now going to sports events is that a thing going to concerts I I don't know how do you meet someone at a concert I can't even hear anybody and almost everyone there's in like a pod and it's difficult to approach someone when they're in a pod concert's bad but what about sports events you I I think you specifically said you would do Events
and Adventures which is a local company that I heard it on the radio typical Millennial stuff right there I heard I heard about this way to meet people on the radio that's how I heard of them too okay okay I have a I have a thing for advents Events and Adventures I was planning on doing this before I ended up with Emma really because I heard it on the radio I I used to listen to the fox all the time um before like you know car is not Fox News no yeah yeah yeah yeah it's a local
radio station it has nothing to do with American News uh we are in fact Canadian um but it's so lowly rated it I I never looked it seems like such an easy thing to do well right yeah all you have to do is it's only 3.2 Stars so like how did you how did they how do you do this and then a lot of the trips they're like or the advents and Adventures are like Hey we're going to go fly to some like country really so the cost is like like I was thinking like hey we go I don't know
to or something yeah I thought it was just doing something like we go do the cheese taste like I don't know I think they do that sometimes but they also like like if you look here I'm going to go on their website look at like this one this is clearly like they're they're out there I think that's bamp Alberta like these are Big these are Big trips events let's see virtual events okay that feels like online dating hot air ballooning wine okay these are a  reasonable another thing that I think is
kind of weird about a scenario like this though personally is when everyone there you know everyone there has like the mission of yeah it that makes it weird too does it does it stink of desperation or like yeah like something's what does it smell like you know like I have never personally met someone who said like oh yeah I I got with my partner through this like matchmaking thing I've met people that say they met them through online dating I've met people who you know all the the
gamut of other things but Events and Adventures other various matchmaking Services I've never once heard of someone be like yeah it was through this thing is that because they're trying to hide it is that because it doesn't work I have no idea I don't know I wish we had better answers for you guys uh it sounds like it's horrible like I my um uh she probably won't watch this so it's probably okay uh my older sister told me about a thing she heard and she basically said something along
the lines of uh dating in your 30s is like going to the thrift store and finding the least broken disgusting thing and taking it home and hoping it fits and I was like I wanted to cry for her because like she's she's not making a joke like she's uh yeah I've heard 30s plus dating is just atrocious yeah she's she's she's found it challenging and it it sucks because she's such a beautiful soul right like she's she's awesome um and I uh yeah it just yeah it just made me it
just made me sad um Avery Studios says in your 40s it just gets hilarious and honest and almost easier I think I mean that's that's I suspect that's because that's when you're hitting a higher rate of divorcees oh that kind I've heard 30s is like the dead zone so the pool opens up again yeah this is what I've heard at least interesting my understanding is there's my understanding is that 30s is a dead zone and then like 50s and 60s is a dead zone and then you have retirement home flings
yeah heard that's like totally a thing I've heard there's a lot of banging in  home I've heard that from a lot of people including people that work at Old Folks homes so I like totally believe that it's real um birdie num Noms says uh you are much more likely to meet someone doing something you love to do or simply being fully aware of your surroundings I agree however considering the audience and most people watching right now and myself what do I love to do um play video VI games you want to have a wow
wedding and and and working out and like working no one everyone is headphones on you don't want to talk to anybody most people are sweaty and gross and the line between like a like a playful banter at the gym and being like a creepy weirdo at the gym is like is thin and honestly it's best off to just not at all just focus on what you're doing get your job done and get out like it's my look I don't I don't do gym gym I I do badminton gym so I'm just kind of I'm I'm speaking out of turn a little bit
here but my understanding is like at the gym you're pretty much not even supposed to like notice if a girl is hot like you're not supposed to be looking to honest because like eyes on the highway kind of thing a lot if you think about it a lot of movements that you have to do if you're properly doing movements condos seexual are going to end up being things that put body parts in areas that look attractive so they're not doing that for you they're doing that cuz they're trying to keep their form
correct and do this exercise properly so you have to understand you have to like clue into that and the best way to avoid any misunderstandings there is to just stay focused on what you're doing like one of the things that I do is either straight in front or up yeah your ey line is straight in front or it's up cuz as long as you're not looking down you're good or side like if you're doing a workout and you're looking at someone on the side right like it's so but like you can you better be hot you better be
like Ryan hot if you're going to try and pull that off so things can get pretty monotonous right like you're you're doing the same movement three sets of 12 you're doing it 36 times you might get kind of bored partway through don't let it happen straight forward or up if someone is in your ey line straight forward look up okay do the same rules apply for girls uh probably not to be honest yeah like would it bother you guys if a girl was at the gym watching you guys work out I mean it depends
right like if it's like and it's like a whole gaggle of them then yeah that's pretty uncomfortable are they making fun of me in general I don't think it really bothers me too much but you do have to understand that like the playing field is not the same so I don't know I don't think I really notice it a ton to be honest I don't really care because you're not looking yeah what a fcking Chad just like you know whatever don't even notice it anymore I do what I'm going to do it's
fine uh we've got wardis asking what about dating at work is that okay was it ever okay so man that is is I've never been interested that's always seemed like a major stay away from it to me it is so full of pitfalls um of the three of us Ivonne probably has the most knowledge when it comes to um like HR legal compliance and like all the all the company side stuff that there is um what I will say is that if there is any kind of direct or even indirect  that that's not good don't do it that's
not good for anybody don't do it for so many reasons and like even outside of that man like I I was I was reading about um uh oh something you can do though if you become friends with them potentially they're friends but not them okay so your advice is to become friends with people so you can do their friends I mean thanks Luke just that's that's a super normal form of dating is getting recommendations from your friends this is actually you're trying to you're trying to make
it weird this is actually super normal I am trying to make it weird but like yeah just you know I was reading about how uh Kaye kuoko I I forget how to pronounce her name but Penny from The Big Bang Theory and Johnny GOI who plays Leonard on The Big Bang Theory they um had their relationship on the show and they had a relationship in real life and after their relationship in real life ended they at times had to do we're in a relationship on the show things together obviously that's a super extreme
example but like even if there's no supervisory relationship think about that nothing nothing is a sure thing you know no matter how compatible you guys think you are with in the first week or two um so before you take that step consider that you might have to work on a project with this person after some kind of bitter messy breakup I'm like if you hate your job then like whatever who cares then you can just leave your job and get a different job or whatever after but if
you like your job and you think maybe they like the job too you could end up kind of stuck with each other in a really awful icky way for an extended period of time yeah and some people pull it off obviously yeah but it's just it's very it's dangerous and even for those that are successful there's a lot of couples who don't make it when they work together there's just too much of overlap in their life was that a concern for you guys um I feel like I remember conversations
around this like 2013 era but I don't I don't remember the like details or conclusions I just think it was something that was discussed I'm very curious about why you laughed you go first this is great you should you should be on the show more often oh man that's a good point it puts significant strain on our relationship at times  fair I feel like we are kind of a different couple though we do do a lot more things together than most people um I think uh what what what do they call
it enmeshment I think that's supposed to be an unhealthy relationship style but I'm pretty sure that's us mment man you can't be admitting that on L okay fine I'll leave my foot to sleep anyway enmeshment is a concept in Psychology or Psy therapy where families uh have personal boundaries that are diffused subsystems undifferentiated and over concern for others leads to a loss of autonomous development I don't know if that's 100% fair I think I think uh I think lonus has significantly more autonomous
development with the V around if I can if I can project yeah I uh well well it's not the not the Aton I definitely develop more with in my life I would I would be a stunted boy if it wasn't for her anyway I assume you dropped by to say that you're leaving and that making sure that I have a ride home yeah I I know about the land I want to get there sooner rather than later yeah all right bye thanks for jumping in uh right we should do sponsors I think we also left hanging merch

that decision I don't think I was part of that decision I think it was a good decision I think that was uh Nick and um I was involved and there might have been some other parties involved but I was just float plane at that time um the features looked good the customizability looked good the functionality without investing in development looked adequate um I think that was a pretty heavy reason why at the time yeah I don't think them being our Canadian Bros was a factor but like it's neat they may
be Tech Bros but at least they're Canadian Tech Bros yeah yeah I I don't know we we we were happy with the features not not saying anything negative about woo Commerce like the site but we uh yeah we like the site shopy has been great a great partner I would I now that I am influencing some of those decisions I I would make it  ways what I don't know I feel like it's  why moving on hey D my second lanyard is about to break it the swivel if you had the chance to change or add a feature to
an existing product what would it be uh  excluded um oh man that's a that's a good question what would I add to an existing product I mean nothing's perfect obviously pretty happy with most of the  add okay how do I answer this question without teasing you know like a V2 of something uh oh oh I would definitely I would definitely add more options for water bottle Lids uh I think that's something that if we had the same Inventory management capabilities that we have today that we would have been able to
tackle in the past so you can like mix and match your lid with your order and that's that's something that I'd like to go back and undo yeah that's fair that makes sense all right hey guys I mentioned the FF tactics mod reach to reach the future to Linus a while back still recommend it Luke we modifi the game's code directly in myips assembly is this a useful code language to know uh I mean it seems to be working for you yeah I mean I I don't know I'm not very familiar with it
um one of the ways that you can try to find out is try to do some digging on what companies use it and why um like one of the reasons why people talk about Cobalt a lot is because it's relatively heavily used in the financial sector um big money there important things running on it and companies that are going to be willing to Shell out a decent amount to get stuff done can confirm that's still on my to-do list nice it is haven't gotten to it yet but it's on there what are we
hearing what is that that's a bird wow Microsoft ads ads ads ads Microsoft has announced that it will be adding a Game Pass recommendation card to a panel in the windows 11 settings homepage for users who game on their PC this ad will also appear on home and pro will also only appear on Pro and home versions of Windows 11 and then only if users are signed into their mic oft account if the user already uses game pass on that computer then the recommendation card will instead advertise a new or
potentially interesting game likewise the windows 11 PC manager tool a utility security tool that's available in only certain regions now suggests as part of its repair tip section that users can repair their system by switching back to Bing as their default search engine these things aren't directly related to each other other than that they're just more obnoxious ways that Microsoft is making windows just shut up get out of my way and let me use my computer this is software that for me anyway I paid
$100 for fck off actually though like if you guys want to have a tiered system you want to have free Windows and it's full of all this no problem if you if you don't pay for the product you are the product blah blah blah blah blah fine but when I pay a $100 for a piece of software which to me is a significant amount of money I expect your ads to off completely agreed that is all I have to say about that yeah I have a message in floatplane chat from Joshua Carol um said the UND
deleting picks just happened to me after seeing the show title I started the update on my iPhone the update just got over and it's real PS of my ex including suggestive ones are back in my camera roll have been awkward man PS I have my  off yeah what yeah so it's not sinking it's like finding so it it might be the pointer thing yeah old pointers yeah it's finding files and reping them out at least in this case that's what that sounds like because there there's no way it's
sinking if he has iCloud off and I guess depending on how much data you write to your phone like you might not run over it yeah we we we we don't necessarily overwrite our phone data unless we're like you know regularly recording long videos right like it's not like you can fill your phone up with apps anymore the way that we used to the oldest photo accidentally recovered was 21st September 2022 wow that's been from like a year and a half ago that's that's rough man just be glad
that you have this Wan show to point to point the current you know at so you can be like um um this is why they're there imagine oh my God Ivon and I hand hand each other our phones without a moment's yeah I do that too like it like we're in a a very trusting I about to say very open relationship we're a different different meaning these days different different meaning look no judgment no judgment on my part whatever works for consenting adults is works for consenting adults um but we're in a very
we're in a very trusting relationship and and to us that's no big deal but I can't I I'm not going to say that if pictures of an ex-girlfriend were just like they in my camera role yeah freaking when she went to you know look for a recent picture that we snapped to the K if you if you ever read this artic that would raise some questions if you hadn't read this article or watched this W show and that happens what do you do what do you do this is this is probably going to happen to at least one person pray to
[Laughter] Zeus strike me down now fix this or just do it or just just  me oh my goodness cuz like yeah like like what how do you explain I you're just at a complete loss this picture is just here and like people are saying that it comes to the top of your camera roll right like it must show the date because uh the metadata probably shouldn't be changed yeah there's like a there's got to be a way to find the date that it was taken but it would have jumped to the top of your camera roll 
like as someone who hasn't used that app cuz I don't really use iPhones I would assume that's cuz it was like recently accessed or something like if I was the person finding this information that would be what I would jump to right like you must have looked at this recently or something Apple single-handedly fixing  issue I can't take credit for that now who was that in flow plane chat that's pretty good I don't know someone good  bubbles relationship ruined you only you got in this relationship because you
didn't have an Android you got out of this relationship because you didn't have an Android nice uh Google gave us back the old web search then hit it Google has announced that it will be rolling out Gemini infused AI Google search for all users which includes results organized using generative AI as well as AI overviews used to summarized topics Google has also added a web search tab that filters out everything but text based results wait similar to how Google search used to work in the 90s and
2000s generative  results which includes results organized using generative AI I don't know don't don't overthink the talk the uh notes sure organized using machine learning okay there uh Google has also added a web search tab oh yep there we go uh okay so the web search tab is hidden under the more drop down menu meaning that many users will likely never find it but it kind of looks awesome I was looking at the side by side in The Verge article and I was like dang that actually looks way better oh cuz just
like the the random like carousels of products and stuff are just not there um Google also presented uh Google also announced updates to its AI models uh Gemini Nano now has multimodal capabilities so that is like more than just text there's also a new lower latency Gemini 1.5 flash model blah blah blah blah blah Google also presented project Astra which the company calls their vision for the future of AI assistance at this point I'm just going to wait I I'm not even Cortana
Siri at some point one of them is going to Rise Above the Rest be legitimately useful and I'll try it then I just I just can't care anymore we're in we're in the rapid development fight phase which is which is fun but if you're if you're not that interested yeah I would just I would I don't think there's a huge point in being lightly paying attention yeah if it's if it's not your job to cover these things for a living you don't need to try Alexa AI which I assume probably exists in a beta state
some I just I don't know who cares um perceive live audio and video answer in real time blah blah blah Google slips a check to the doj this is kind of funny according to a motion filed by Google this morning the company has written the federal government a cashier's check for triple the maximum damage is claimed in the doj's ongoing antitrust trial triple the company now claims that these monetary damages should be considered moot the motion also argues that the case should be presented Ed to a judge
rather than a jury both because these kinds of cases are typically decided by judges and because the case involves a complicated intricate technology ecosystem which the doj has acknowledged is highly technical often abstract and outside the everyday knowledge of most prospective Jers discussion question here is why doesn't Google want a jury H wow you know no admission of guilt but like hey here's the maximum amount of money times some multiplier that you guys might have I'm really glad
that antitrust is heating up I hope they go after Microsoft again for all the stuff that's going on with Windows right now I love that they're going after Apple who have just been have been given a free pass just for what being trendy like you guys understand there there are they are just as much a part of this capitalist hellscape that we're all participating in this like post like anything mattering less a part of because they charge more other than shareholder returns right like the whole
Tech the whole Tech financing system is like broken because there's this expectation of this explosive growth in the money that you invest into these companies and it has to come from somewhere and guess what somewhere is you apple is by Apple's absolutely a participant they are prime participant in this and the fact that they were just like given a free pass because they have a cute commercial where a trendy guy is like you're a PC you wear a suit like are you for real I think that's pretty
old at this point but yeah he you uh what is this about uh I forget I forget exactly what an trust thing this was something good I hope yeah yeah F yeah uh what else we got today uh did we go back to the merch messages we owed them yep yeah yeah yeah we did okay cool you want to talk about the live service game that went offline and removed microtransactions I know nothing about this game what I do know is I jumped on the steam page right before the show and recent reviews are
mostly negative which is bad uh and all reviews are mixed and it's currently in Early Access okay so let's start the stage is set um developer Airship Syndicate has delisted its mmor RPG wayfinder and has announced that it will be transitioning the game from a free-to-play live service game which just that's all I need to know to dislike it heavily um to a single player offline game with optional two or three player co-op and no microtransactions what a pivot the developer likewise
claims that they will be adding content to deepen the game's RPG elements the new road map includes that Airship Syndicate uh the developer plans to relaunch the game in Early Access for a one-time purchase of $25 because again it's it's no longer a free to playay live service game so they got to charge for it uh this and there's no microtransactions they need to make money somehow that makes sense this decision seems to have upset many existing players so that's why it's
mostly negative right now especially those who bought the game for $150 with the exalted Founders pack as they feel they invested in a very different game than the one they are now getting that's fair consequently several have posted negative reviews on Steam demanding refunds also fair to be completely honest if you're completely changing the entire game you should probably get a refund uh the root CA of this change appears to be the fact that wayfinder original publisher digital extremes which
recently closed its publishing Division and divested from the game transferring ownership over to Airship Syndicate themselves the development team called the change a big shift but a necessary one to guarantee that the game is around forever forever is a strong word yeah in better gaming news um H the uh the the I think it was the the mission lead on cyberpunk huh uh hold on they they they worked on the like the the mission design for cyberpunk um was this before or after it was this is
super cool they um they were celebrating that cyberp punk has officially oh wow crossed over into I they were either celebrating that it is officially very positive all time or they were celebrating that recent is overwhelmingly positive who highlight over recent real quick or the the overwhelming deposit 99 is that 99 95 95 wow yeah so Shout Out CD project red for like royally fing this thing up and then man sticking with it that is both Lucky the fact that people kept buying the game
enough and they had enough cash reserves to do it not every developer would have even had the option they just would have completely run out of money yeah luckily CD project had a lot of other things going well for the yeah so so so it's lucky and also whatever the whatever Integrity is in inte integress high integrity let's go with that um so shout out love it you know let highlight positive stories that we come across as well that's really cool so great job you guys VG Supernova says no they shouldn't
have released it broken initially so no praise nah that doesn't that doesn't work doesn't work for me no we this is we hammered on them when it came out and it sucked and now we praise them when it's good it's the same thing with Microsoft we went after them when they did the studio closer thing and then we said hey cool You released a really neat controller we can't just be we we look how many how many companies are even left making games we can't just hate all of them forever anytime they do anything
bad we can hate blizzard forever if you like nice okay nice and and we can we can be mad at Bethesda for a long time maybe not forever hopefully they fix it come on guys okay but we can be mad at them for a while but like what is the point of just being angry all the time even and like is it worth it no it's really not so if someone does something bad even EA someone pointed out EA is dead yeah sure but I mean leadership might change the people that work there are going to change constantly like the
the company's going to be a completely different company in s to 10 years think about the kind of company that you don't necessarily normally think of as a company think about a sports team okay dude from from from from 10 years ago to today how many people on that Ro yeah they all they all have the same brand on their shirt right but how many of those people are even still there is the team that you're cheering for today the same team it's it's the team of thesias right
yeah and there are cases where long-term leadership does result in a culture that is just Ed out from the inside we've seen that but you've also got to understand that even those like rotten companies are going to have people that are really passionate and really dedicated and really positive and really excited and really worth supporting and so when those projects go well and when like okay um Ubisoft is the publisher for one of my favorite series ano yeah um so what I'm going to refuse to buy
and to buy it and we can simultaneously look at how 1800 has been treated which is amazing they've got so many seasons of of extra content and it's like meaningful extra content not just like not just like some stupid cosmetic you know statue you can and they do have that but they've also got that's usually a part of a big content pack which and people want that sometimes there's there's uh what are they called Beauty Builders or whatever yeah like we can celebrate what's really good and that
doesn't mean we have to forget the things that were bad and that when something else bad happens we can definitely you know we're not stupid right like we can definitely start to notice patterns but come on guys it's not is it good for your own mental health to be angry forever that's that's another thing I want to I want to bring this up to agent Rick Justice posted this and I I've been thinking about this as well he said I like the wayfinder thing they they couldn't afford to keep it in MMO
uh when the publisher dropped out instead of killing the game they made it still playable that's my main takeaway as well and like I'm like ah yeah they should refund those players they may not be able to like having your publisher just leave that's got to be really rough and I suspect that out of their out of their options of only bad out of their only bad options they chose something that in my opinion is pretty good um I don't know it sucks for some people it sucks for the people that bought that
$150 pack and then now the game that they you know they wanted to buy it's not going to be that anymore all that type of stuff I get that that sucks I'm not saying it's good for those people but their Publishers gone they can't keep running this thing they they they try to do something that is good and I I I yeah I don't know it makes sense I think it's good and right okay what I was going to say was was ano 1800 has been treated super well and then from that same publisher from Ubisoft we get stuff like
skull and bones and it's just like yeah I mean we'll we'll we will sit here and talk positively about how no 1800 has been treated it's fantastic game it's had really good advancement over its current lifespan all this other type of stuff and then also crap on you know the first quadruple a game ever like it's it's you can say both things right um New York subways are adding AI gun scanners how the devil is this even supposed to work New York City will be testing AI powered gun scanners in their
subway system they come from a company called evolve and several US states are likewise considering installing them in schools New York's mayor has promised that the city will conduct an analysis of the scanner's accuracy despite the fact that the city already tested the scanners 2 years ago and found that the scanners alerted around 26% of the time and its detections were 85% false um with another 14% being police officers only 57% of alarms were determined to be legitimate cases of non-law enforcement
persons carrying a weapon likely indicating that the alarm sound when the person happened to have a weapon was essentially a coincidence yeah I mean I would believe that 57% of Americans just happen to have a gun on them so like I don't think you can in New York can you well yeah but just I I don't know just anyways yeah I mean yeah fair enough it's America Second Amendment right what do you mean yeah like don't do the accent come on got got our American viewers out there you can't just can't 
like well they can yeah they can but don't shoot in the air don't shoot in the air yeah they probably know that critics claim that the system could potentially cost Millions it could cause Transit delays and needlessly place citizens in frequent conflict with the police is this like if you get if you get falsely flagged like are you just are you you just like well endowed yeah that's when your own government uh you know tells you that your penis is too big he's packing falsely flagged hey
packing get is that like is that like super sick is this an honor is this like when you get called the cheater in a video game falsely flagged attack yeah um yeah it's like thank you for saying that I cheated in Counter-Strike because now I just feel like I'm good it's like thank you for saying that I had a gun isus is apologizing for their strange and expensive repair quotes um uh okay Asus has issued an apology for causing confusion and frustration uh in its RMA processes following multiple
reports from customers in Canada and the US that the company was issuing massive bills to repair minor and superficial damage while failing to fix the actual issues that the device had been sent in for at least one Canadian was quoted "nearly $3,800 Canadian dollars so that's" about just under "$3,000 to fix a plastic safety indent on" a power connector on his RTX 490 which is more than the C originally cost to buy because it was allegedly not covered under asus's standard warranty while the
issue was eventually resolved Asus never clarified the reason for the odd quote Asus says that any repairs covered under the manufacturer's limited warranty have always been and will continue to be free of charge and that they are revising their repair pricing structure for outof warranty products including a review process for abnormal pricing to ensure consistency transparency and fairness they likewise state that they will no longer automatically offer repair quotes for cosmetic imperfections that don't
affect device functionality I think that Asus has a lot of self-reflection to do I mean we encountered this back back when we secret shopped them a while ago where we basically had to drag them to water to get them to drink to solve our problem and it wasn't even that they didn't ultimately solve it or that they tried to give us the runaround for us it just came down to more incompetence I think um right if you if you listen to that video and just kind of listen to our our
poor guys trying to explain that our issues we just want you to explain power  I guess all I can really say is give me a reason to not be mad anymore you know back to what we were back to what we were talking about just now I don't I don't have the energy oh yeah yeah good call anymore to be mad forever so what I need to see from Asus is I need to see a clear and obvious change I want the next Reddit Thread about Asus customer support in our in our subreddit to be about the out standing exchange with
them yeah turn it around and like and the storytelling Arc of that was was amazing you like host videos or something yeah I know right that was fantastic the the tie-in of the previous topic and was so good came to me in a dream um I dream of graphics cards uh and like this is a this is a tough one for me because I like the products generally speaking they they've had some Duds um pretty much every company has had some Duds I've ran a lot of as stuff over the years me too and I I have this
this this sucks cuz this makes it like how do you recommend and you know what you know what I I'm I'm glad this is happening right because it's it's time that they finally got a wakeup call because they've always I don't think this would have blown up the way that it has if they had largely had a lot of Goodwill built up with the community but they don't and that's the problem and so those years of like yeah they fixed it but like the experience kind of sucked it was pulling
teeth or they made this they give me this weird repair quote and I'm like no don't fix that and just like like like these years of kind of annoying stories um have built up in such a way that all it took was for a match to drop and of course it was going to go up in flames and I'm I'm glad that they're finally taking notice and I hope that we see you know real prolonged change um and what I also hope is that other entities in the tech space sit up and take notice of this
because the kinds of horror stories that you see from an isus are the same kinds of horror stories that you see from many of the other big PC component makers yeah it's just that Asus is the biggest and they happened to be the one that got called on it um so hopefully everyone else is sitting up taking notice of this and going okay we got to get this together um and you know what the reality of it is these complaints about these companies are not always in good faith I had a really bizarre exchange with
someone in my DMs a while back where they were like hey is a big sponsor of yours and I want you to like talk about this story of how like awful my experience has been and what happened was they AR made a laptop and Asus was like yeah it's broken and um we're going to replace it with this one and the guy's like okay and then they were like oh actually we can't get that one it's this one and it was a better machine but it was AMD and Buddy was like I want Intel and I am outraged and I was like yo um this
is a significantly better machine it has it has it will give you better battery life and better performance it even has a higher MSRP um you need to relax and you need to just take what they're offering you because it's a good offer and then he ended up instead of being mad at Asus he ended up being mad at me and Asus and I'm like sorry I'm not going to lie to you nice sick I mean this is this is like a common whenever there's like uh band waves in video games you get a lot
of people riding the I was falsely flagged like whenever whenever that starts becoming a big thing a lot of people will jump on that train trying to get get some of the Goodwill but asus's problem is that there were enough legitimate stories that they're susceptible to it yeah so I guess you know what and everyone for for a while because this happened everyone is going to believe anyone that claims that they were mistreated even if they're just trying to abuse so and that's going to cost
Asus a lot more in like claims than if they had just dealt with everything properly in the first place so now they need to to effectively overcompensate to uh get out of this so good luck um and I think you know in terms of our collaborations with them going forward we we really need to see a difference that is measurable within our community so some people are pointing out that uh there there might have been a specific reason why they wanted the Intel system or that some things are could work better on the
Intel system he didn't trust me that I I was getting I was getting he's condensing a conversation yeah about this they just wanted Intel CU they were brand loyal to Intel and I'm sorry but I just don't have a ton of patience for that this is this is something that lus would have discussed he's he's condensing the conversation I I love so many of the people that I've worked with at Intel over the years um you know I I respect a lot of their a lot of their processes uh you know I respect their
engineering Acumen and the product and and all those things but with all due respect if you are like some kind of um loyal Fanboy to Intel that's that's pretty up like I uh I just I  yeah uh Marvel Rivals game devs apologize for Banning negative reviews Banning negative reviews the team behind Marvel Rivals an upcoming hero shooter has apologized for requiring creators to sign contracts including a non-disparagement clause o Banning public statements uh detrimental to the reputation of the game in order to
participate in its close Alpha play test hm in their apology the team referred to the issue as a miscommunication and stated that they encourage creators to share honest thoughts suggestions and criticisms as they play they say they are working with the creators who voice concerns to revise the contract so it is less restrictive the issue was first flagged by uh by stream Brandon lnet AKA seagull by streamer got it that makes a lot more sense AKA seagull who expressed concern
that uh many creators have signed the contract without really reading it uh just so that they could access the game non disparagement Clause yeah that that sounds uh like a mistake not necessarily a miscommunication um I suspect this was supposed to be an NDA because it's an alpha version of the game so they were like hey don't talk about it yet the number of times that I've seen a professional law office basically just like copy paste something oh dude we talked about this on the show
a while ago yeah we did I think I last week I have caught the I found the thing that they copied it off before like yeah so I I suspect it wasn't a miscommunication there's probably been a handlon razor here I suspect it was a mistake and someone is just covering their butt going like oh yeah miscommunication that's not what I meant I mean which might be true cuz they didn't mean that cuz they didn't mean it to be in there I think it was a mistake um glad they're fixing it glad they're
apologizing I think it's I think it's frustrating you know as an end user or as an observer to see something like this and go like well can't you guys just own it can't you just tell us what actually went wrong but the reality of it is most organizations for legal or privacy or HR reasons can't necessarily just say yeah it was it was Jeffrey from legal who screwed it up like they actually can't do that um literally be legally unable to um people pointed out that apparently you were able to stream
it so it's not like it should have been covered by NDA okay interesting um another person deep blue said I mean it's an alpha game you may not want people to be overly critical of it since it is clearly still in development um I don't think that's fair I still suspect this is a case of the right hand not talking to the left hand um and I I I suspect that if it wasn't for human pride and HR rules and legal rules probably we'd get a more uh a more straightforward answer but this is
probably the best we're going to get yeah I think I think if you're doing something like that and you're worried about criticism because it is a true Alpha while a lot of games will like sort of pretend to be an alpha or beta um I think that's just something that you you push the creators to communicate you might even make it so that a requirement of the contract is to communicate that this is like still in development Alpha not final blah blah blah blah blah um all right is it time
for after dark can be I'm missing my own party right now so anything is possible oh he can do it remotely now sick yeah me last time for yeah everybody should be lazy automation is great uh let's see sup dll I would love to know if you guys have been following the rather impressive AMD stricks Halo Point Apu benchmarks and specs leaks and whether it will be bad news for Intel's battle mage I am hoping for the best it looks like it's going to be flipp and awesome and very exciting I uh I I try not to
take leaks with any less than about a wheelbarrow full of salt so maybe um I'll I'll evaluate it once I've got my hands on it but if it's anywhere near as good as the leaks look yeah Intel's got to figure some stuff out Dan um I push I pushed the wrong button again what's this that's that's our sponsors Luke they I'm sorry really I'm sorry I even double checked and then I just pushed it anyway he got me on that one darn it what's this what is a computer what's a computer stop all the
downloading I really hope people understand the Joe that entire video lives in my brain rent fre oh computer your video my computer good I'm glad you understand that oh that's I yeah um pork chop sandwiches was a uh very often said thing in my house um  people I miss Proto internet yeah me too uh next one yeah Sher if you if you finish that one off I'm sorry ruined that I I don't know I haven't followed it spec leaks battle mage yeah we'll find out soon yeah hello D I'm currently
in Flight School my dad is convinced that I will be the last generation of uh commercial pilots with the maturity of autopilot and planes how do you feel about no crew flights uh also party shot party shirt restock we are definitely still going to need Crews but it might be more like bouncers did you see that fight that broke out on a PL on a plane recently no but I mean there's been tons yeah did they taped him to the chair again that's been a standard maneuver lately I don't
know but that's hilarious I haven't actually seen people being tap yeah the people that freak out if they won't settle down they just like tape them to the chair and then people just don't sit next to them and it's like okay we'll wait till we land and then someone can deal with you that's awesome put the new Atlas robots on there just like fold them up in the like overhead baggage you meant the atlas robots could just hold up the people you have become Cube both can be
both can be true um I I don't know I I suspect people are going to want human supervision for a considerable amount of time um but probably not forever so I don't know I mean the nice thing is that  now all right the plane is its own bouncer I mean that was just that one plane that couldn't stay straight cuz it was Boe that's pretty good sorry I like that one hey I heard lonus talk about his theory about Nvidia making a shield 2 in a past video now that Nintendo has confirmed a switch 2 is in the works do
you think it'll happen I still think so I still hope so I think Nvidia just wants Nintendo to pay for the development of the Chip And then they're just going to release a shield Pro two that's what I'm kind of counting on cuz that thing is bloody old at this point and I want better AI upscaling it really is Luke you often promote helping open source projects is a way to build your resume as a software developer do you have any Foss projects that you want to drw more attention towards uh 
lld I'll explain I'll explain there's a there's a video that's actually quite good from F if you look up F T3 on YouTube there's don't contribute to open source it's actually a very good video um the point isn't to not contribute to open source the point is if you are the the problem with telling people to contribute to open source in order to make your like GitHub more attractive for potential recruiters or when you're trying to put it on your resume and stuff like that the problem with that is
that that often promotes very poor Behavior Uh where people are spamming commits um that are often not helpful uh in sometimes actually just bad and wasting the time of the maintainers of said projects um and it it's it's become like actually an issue so if you like it looks very good on you if you can make meaningful good useful contributions to open source projects but it can be a red flag if a recruiter or a person doing hiring stuff like that um if they look at your GitHub and then see a lot of
garbage things so what Luc is trying to say is don't let let him suggest the project find something you're passionate about and really make have a meaningful impact on it that's going to look way better if you can if you can make actually good commits to something that you're interested in so you're actually going to spend time working on it if you're not wasting the time of maintainers so you're actually like giving them good stuff that will reflect very well but just being like hey
suggest something to me so that I can get hired um actually like just isn't really going to work so find something that brings meaning to you there's a lot of stuff out there I'm sure you can do it hey W dll more specifically Luke what do you tell your Barber when you get your haircut I no longer go to my lifelong hairdresser so I have no clue what to tell a proper Barber I Google Captain America Winter Soldier and I find a frame of Chris Evans that shows his hair off decently well I mean would
you consider a frame that shows off his butt cuz that's a good frame too probably if they could if they could make your butt look like that they'd be a pretty good Barber yeah that's true got that cake uh but yeah I do that I uh I I would look up myself I guess but I find finding that actually to be a lot more difficult than just looking up uh Winter Soldier Chris Evans so yeah that's what I show them go to a salon and make them pick yeah I did that once apparently people hate that that was
really bad yeah apparently like uh like waiters and waitresses like freaking hate when you're like surprise me someone told me that it depends on the person I think I do it anyway "sometimes uh Hey guys my 1,00 person" company recently went bankrupt and was bought by a giant conglomerate and I'm worried so much is going to change but I  this God I don't even know I'm trying to imagine like okay my company went bankrupt and was bought and I'm worried so much it's going to change but I love
my job I mean that's me except we are not bankrupt and have not been purchased um how would I deal with this i' probably cry a little and then cry a lot um I would pay a lot of attention yeah ask a lot of questions yeah um be visible that's I I would say that's critical um be visible to New Management it doesn't have to be like you know for doing the best thing definitely you don't want it to be for doing the worst thing make sure they know your name though um that might give you a shot at
being treated like a Human Instead of a number not save you at all but a good idea though um but try to yeah I would I would pay a lot of attention and prep for the worst but also you know these people might not be bad people to have connections with even if things go south they're still working in the industry that yes you're in so you know don't just like be a jerk at work um try to do a good job hopefully things work out hopefully you like the new workplace and hopefully you get kept on
but if any of those things aren't true you can still leave with a good clean Bridge behind you um and you can try to use this time a little bit to prepare to potentially leave if you do need to so yeah lightess have you ever dealt with the Rival fallacy what is it like achieving the level of success that you have how does it feel after uh I had to look this up um uh hold on I need to I need to do another one really quick before I lose it I accidentally archived it and I feel
really bad I don't think I can find it anymore oh no oh yeah no no no it ended up in the right place okay so I had to look this up um so it refers to the belief that attaining a particular goal will lead to long-term happiness so the most important thing to understand is this belief is not grounded in reality I I don't think I've experienced the arrival fallacy because I I don't think I ever believed that I had a um I don't think I ever had a belief that achieving some kind of goal with
like Linus Media Group or uh you know having kids or like in my relationship I don't think I ever believed that that would um result in long-term happiness I think that uh if anything I had a completely separate issue where I was so focused on survival that I wasn't really giving any thought to what success looked like and um and what an end game looked like I mean I I you know strategized and planned right you know we talked about evons if I die folder you know earlier
in the show like I I I would talk about like here's what I would want to happen like if I was out of the picture for some reason to the company and stuff like that but like I I didn't I I didn't really like internalize it and um you know for me uh reaching the level of success that I did when I did that I've been thinking of retiring stream where I I spoke from the heart about how I how I felt about you know being at a point in my life where realistically I've done everything I set out to do whether I
whether I had really you know written that down as a plan or not um reaching that point where um you know nothing really mattered anymore like if I if I died that day um my kids would go to school you know they they they'd have all their University paid for and like um I think the company probably could have survived at that point like it would have been kind of tough going for a little bit but they probably could have figured it out um I don't know empty like it it was challenging I had
to I had to figure out how to find a purpose again and I talked about that at the end of the stream just um you know figuring out how to how to do something because you want to um and figuring out how to want to doing it on your own terms rather than just because you have to cuz switching over from just like fight ORF flight survival mode to I I I can survive now um I've achieved the goal I have a big problem with that personally if I don't have a fight I tend to mentally fall really fast I like need
something to kind of rage against to a certain degree um but uh something that I've tried to do is have a have a Next plan it's like if you have a goal be like okay this achieving this goal will unlock my ability to progress into this next thing if you can do that that can be pretty good like for me a lot of stuff recently has been Fitness so it's like okay if I get to this certain level the certain Benchmark that I'm aiming for that will allow me to focus on this other more
different thing and just try to always have the next thing kind of planned out so there the arrival isn't really so much of a you can maybe celebrate it but it's a short celebration then it's back to work yeah all right L me go to bed it's late and float plane chat it's over it's after 4 in the morning there hello dl. my dad calls himself a tech Enthusiast but doesn't watch the WAN show what suggestions do y'all have to get him plopped on the couch next to to me appreciate all y'all do I don't know
the knucks are having a heck of a playoff run watch some hockey yeah you know you don't have to I mean what what tech entertainment show would you like be plopped on the coou for a long time like watching you watch  like I don't know does he like marquez's stuff like kind of tech but uh waveform I like a podcast are we trying to suggest Tech entertainment shows I think so Silicon Valley yeah watch Silicon Valley watch show heck yeah watch Silicon Valley watch technology connections sure go watch that stuff
technology connections is sick yeah all right there good we got a good one oh crap uh oh oh no uh sorry I I I moved it somewhere I'm just going to read it I know lonus loves talking about Canadian housing problems have you seen the latest headlines about the CRA coming after tenants for taxes of foreign  it just sounds like yet another um yet another fake solution um I I think that unless they're spectacularly stupid you know our policy makers absolutely understand what the underlying issues
are and they've shown clearly that they have no intention whatsoever of of fixing them um institutional investment in residential housing needs to stop um if they want to collect more taxes they need to collect taxes from people who own many properties um like that's that's the way that you can both enact a wealth tax which is something that they obviously have a great interest in if you've been following Canadian politics um that's a way that you can enact a wealth tax
while also easing the pressure on people who need access to housing um and you can hit two birds with one stone but the reason that nobody wants to do it is because the policy makers are land owners and they benefit from always rising land costs so instead they are enacting you know oh here why don't we take taxpayer dollars that we take from everyone and why don't we use it to as like a to give out as a rent subsidy and on the surface of it that sounds like a good idea it's almost like a universal
basic income top up kind of thing for um for the for the less fortunate for lower earners but in practice no what they're actually doing is they're giving it to land owners they're giving it directly to land owners themselves which is themselves um so it's pretty it's pretty fued up um so no I don't know I I I I saw a headline about that I hadn't looked into it in any detail but the whole thing is just it's um and if I was in charge we'd do it differently but I'm not and uh I'm not going to
be but what I am going to be is gaming yeah we'll see you again next week same bad time same bad Channel I got a land party to get to time for some tape to
