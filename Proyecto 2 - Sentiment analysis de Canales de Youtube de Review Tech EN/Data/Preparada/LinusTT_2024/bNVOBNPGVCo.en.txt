and welcome to the W show Australia has been actually no I don't care as much about this one it's really it's really interesting and it's really important but what I actually want to talk about is an influencer who is suing another influencer for infringing on her vibe I have so many thoughts on this actually Luke um hold on I'm going to need to can can Dan can you can you get rid of Luke for a second there's a lot of beige there's a lot of beige in in Luke's uh Vibe right now and that could be
infringing I'm infringing I would like to I'd like to avoid a loss actually hold on I need these chairs I need these chairs out of the frame there we go okay we have a non-infringing dang it we have we have a non-infringing Vibe I got you uh okay oh perfect that's great um the labs did oh oh man we've got so many great topics this week uh fine the labs did a super cool article about power supply efficiency ratings and how the power supply you buy might actually be better than what you would think based
on the label on the box what else we got okay D we can put everything back Australia ban social media for kids under 16 and uh gaming in the USA is about to get rather table that's not funny I think it's  the show is brought to you today by jump Cloud LG and vessie and also our laptop partner LG and of course debrand and secret Labs who are our skin partner and uh I wouldn't have skin without dbrand and also our chair partner which Dan conveniently covered up with Luke right
as was about to point at it way to go Dan good timing as always all right why don't we jump right into our headline topic for the day which I actually forget what it is Dan do you remember what it is you're an advertisement uh oh oh yeah we didn't even know dud we didn't even talk about that it's going so well so far that's awesome um LT store has had three sponsored Creator videos go up this week um including two long form videos and one short Luke have you seen any of
them none you have seen none perfect uh so we have a we all of our all of our influencer marketing is going up in Reverse alphabetical order so it's going to start with Zack builds and Zach's Tech Turf and then we skip all the way to M our yeah go ahead do we do that on purpose we not even a little bit no no 100% no no our third one is Macho Nacho Productions and I'm pretty sure we would have been able to find at least one or two Tech YouTubers who are um you know between Zed and M anyway check this out
this is such a cool video has already got nearly half a million views from Zack builds obviously I'm going to want you guys to go check out the entire video and not just the LT product placement in it but but but watch this watch this watch this hold on wait for it wait for it that was annoying I can't believe it didn't work from the factory BL blah blah blah ready to keep pushing forward he's don't worry something interesting is going to happen soon let me segue to our sponsor ltd.com let's go let's
go I got to tell you I did send a rather tur email to the business team when I saw this spot go live and the reason for that is that while uh Zach actually did an amazing job by the way this is incredible of showing off the screwdriver showing off everything that's good about it the strength of the magnet um the completeness of the kit uh he did just an outstanding job talking about the quality it's really well shot the one thing that he didn't do is use  project fortunately fortunately the good
news here is that in spite of any perceived beef that may exist on their side uh I have nothing against I fix it a huge huge advocate for for their uh for their mission and all of that anyway we just we didn't get to him in time and uh he did say in the sponsor spot that if the screwdriver had gotten to him in time to do the project because it arrived after he' done it okay I was that's that's rough all right yeah if it had gotten there in time to do the project he would have
preferred to use it he didn't say he really liked it so that's that's really good to hear um anyway I got I got I got a real kick out of that and I was like yo guys um look like it's fine but like really and they were like no no no no no no that's how it went down anyway uh so we also had a video go up with Zach Zach's Tech Turf this one I haven't actually watched yet uh this one's a short oh wait I didn't even know who it was but I know the guy's face I 100 oh I'm so sorry I'm so
sorry other Zack um yeah my bad anyway tools PC Builders actually need a knife all right fair enough Cutters yep fair enough most importantly screwdriver  go freaking awesome so that's our second one that went live oh look at this he's got a whole bunch of them okay that's pretty cool uh so that's the second one that went live and then uh also Macho Nacho Productions this is a really cool video you guys are going to want to check this one out as well Nintendo never gave us a
switch Pro so modders did um also just a really really nice really nice spot for the Precision screwdriver and yes guys I can see you in the comments I hear you in the comments shrieking about us uploading a promotional video with influencer marketing for a product you literally can't buy right now because it's out of stock trust me I don't like it any more than you do but hey look okay we're new to this okay we're you can sign up for some newsletter about when it's going to be
back in stock or something and I don't know Nick said it was going to be December is maybe when they have more information so we'll we'll get such a classic like us problem that's the that's the exact type of thing that we would screw up that that's very on brand yeah so there's this great project as hype as as as F and like you're going to love it and like yeah I don't know what yeah too bad maybe it's our Strat maybe just nobody consulted me and that's our Strat you're going for the the luxury
product Strat you know yeah it's it's a it's the new Burkin bag the LT Precision screwdriver I got to make an appointment for it but you're not allowed to make appointments yeah put it in your put it in your loved one's stocking next Year hope that they don't need to screw anything together between now and then anyway you guys are going to want to check this video out as well super cool um and yeah I I don't know what to say about this other than that go check out those videos uh massive
shout out to them for for working with us on this I mean obviously they didn't you know nothing in life is free we we believe in paying people for their work so these are uh these are these are paid sponsorships as you guys would would expect from and you can expect to see a lot more we have a couple discussion questions uh the first one is does it feel weird to go full circle from sponsored to sponsor um and I got to say I feel like I feel like this is hardly full circle so much
as it's that I am going in circles right because I started out as just like uh like like a paid mouthpiece to make product videos for Rich video merchandising on product pages and then made my way into like like like independent sort of opinion SL tutorials and guides and reviews uh while also maintaining the other thing in parallel and then started doing sponsorships also in parallel to then creating products and like sponsoring myself to sponsoring others to splitting off the lab to be
its own like Independent Media review thing to like I don't know I just got I got a lot going on I got a lot going on over here um but yeah no I you know it feels kind of cool it's it's um it's not the same feeling as seeing the product get reviewed like independently reviewed um but I would say it's honestly kind of more fun in like a different way if that makes sense like it's just it's more surreal right like it it feels like an outof body experience a little bit that if that kind of sense something
that's been I mean it's it's I've always had this reaction where like if I'm if I'm watching a YouTube video and then I notice someone's wearing like one of our shirts or like one of our sweaters or something it's always like oh whoa like it kind of it's It's jarring in a good way if that makes sense like it kind of I don't know you have to take a second and kind of absorb it but now it's happening where shirts as as much as I do like our shirts you know I didn't even really
think about it I'm wearing one of them right now um they they feel more on the merch side of things when someone's using one of the tools and they don't talk about it and they're not making like like it it feels like it wasn't a conscious decision it was just like no this is just the best thing that I have for this then it's it's it's almost a different form of reaction I don't know it's kind of and like one thing that's really different about the sponsorship thing for me is that I've I've talked a
lot about how I have a very kind of limited schedule and I can't I don't have enough time to fill it with a ton of YouTube I don't watch a ton of YouTube I don't really uh I don't really sample my own products so to speak um but I have felt compelled to watch these videos from the creators that we sponsor because and like look I would never because I've been on the other side of it I would never like give myself credit for their hard work but I do feel like we supported it right like I feel like
we helped enable them to do what they do and it's it's it's a really different feeling it shouldn't be I mean we enable people to do their creative work all day every time Riley uploads TechLink you know Linus Media Group Incorporated has enabled something you know that's what we literally do for a living but it feels a little different when it's these small smaller creators or in some I mean we've even sponsored creators that are arguably our size or bigger depending on
the measure right but right I don't know it feels it's it's Vibes it's good vibes yeah yeah I mean that makes sense I mean especially when you know that's AdSense on Tech content isn't that amazing so at the end of the day a lot of what keeps the wheel going around is this kind of sponsored content so it's fun helping keep the wheel going around for other people as well and what's cool about that is that one of the things that we've made a conscious effort to do over the last
five years or so maybe longer than that actually over over the years is to is to diversify our sponsorships and make ourselves less dependent on the brands that we cover and that's a tough thing to do because especially when you're first starting out the advertisers Target whoever is the audiences that most overlap with the people who will buy their products which for review is obviously going to you're going to you're going to Target the reviewers who are making videos that viewers are
watching that are reviews of their products right so you're going to have this inherent kind of conflict and you can manage that you can mitigate that you can have good agreements you can have strong moral fiber good character and you can and you can keep your editorial and your and your sponsored talking points separate um but it it's always going to be there it's always going to be there and it's always going to mean that you're going to be dependent um there's a hand that feeds you and
there's there's going to it's at least going to occur to you whether or not you should bite it and you might be an absolute wild man like me and go out of your way to bite it just for lws like I mean the the framework secret shopper one I'd say is probably the best recent example of that we didn't have to do that narv has not even emailed me about it he has not so much as acknowledged that video to me which I think is really funny um what about when it's your own hand what about when you reviewed LT store
yeah I don't know we're we're idiots honestly like we're we're kind of crazy um and you know what there's a lot of Integrity like in the tech YouTube space there's a lot of people that I think would do the same thing if they had the privilege but but this is something that they are not dependent on they don't depend on me for anything if anything I'm like a competitor or whatever right not not that I really see it that way but I'm more I'm more if they make matter whatever like what drama drama
builds audiences drama gets views I mean there's certainly plenty of examples of that in the tech space right so it's it's one of those things where like they have absolutely nothing to lose by like burning a sponsor relationship with me or whatever right and it makes them less dependent on Tech sponsors that actually exist within the vertical that they cover so that's something that's really cool to me I think that's probably if I had to nail it down I think that's the coolest thing
is that we are enabling the same diversification that we have sought to achieve for ourselves and and that's a really that's a really healthy thing for the space to have sponsors that you don't um cover as well that's that's that's the ideal uh anyway sorry what what are we what are we supposed to be talking about yeah so yeah this is cool oh our other discussion question actually maybe you can speak to this cuz I I think you're like you're doing a paid gig thing right now like that's what you're in France
for right so the discussion question is can you talk about brand Creator relationships and how sponsorships even work does the brand Reach Out does the Creator reach out how does it wake uh I mean it can work in both ways in regards to reaching out um I I think generally how we do it is you you have you have your pre the business te might kill me here because I might say something wrong so I don't know don't take this at my word but you have some partners that you've been working with
for a long time and it's more like you talk to them near the beginning of the year near the beginning of the quarter whatever and you try to figure out like okay what is our approach going to be this time um like how can we best work together this time there's some amount of assumption that you're going to work together there's some like cold calling where you're reaching out to people seeing if you can work with them and then there's cold calling in our Direction where people are reaching out
to us seeing if they can work with us um in this particular case I don't necessarily know what happened I think being a review company having uh relationships with companies that make products has always been kind of interesting um like what I'm in France for is ovh ovh we use as a company and have been using as a company for like genuinely close to a decade I think a decade because the for I think so yeah yeah wow that's cool 10 years of partnership let's go yeah we've also
used almost every one of their products which is like kind of of crazy like we even at one point in time we used one of their products which is called so you start which is like basically semi recycled like very old discount servers because that's I mean at one point in time that made sense for us right um so like that that that one's pretty easy because like when I when I'm here hosting with them it's I just get to talk about like I don't know the reason why I've been using them for basically a
decade which makes it pretty simple there has been times where you know I'll be pretty friendly with representatives from a certain company and then uh we do a review and then suddenly I mean I was still down to be friendly and then it becomes not very friendly anymore um but that's just part of the playing field right like you can't um you you can't let whatever you have going on affect a review it doesn't matter like it it's completely irrelevant at that point the second
you're reviewing something you have to be completely impartial so I mean I've I've lost people that I was friendly with um but it's it's part of the game um and there's also been people like you just mentioned the framework thing right like some people get it yeah and they're just like okay well I'll take from this what I can and we keep moving forward right it doesn't matter but there's as personally who never spoke to me again  review yeah uh yeah it's part of the it's part of the game it is what it is
is I don't know yep but you got to be yeah you got to you got to be uh you got to be willing to just kind of move forward like I think as much as I dog on them which is part of the point of what I'm saying about to say um Nvidia has grown up a lot over the last little bit we dog on them we talk about the things that they do that we don't like you know we we tease their leather jacket kitchen enjoying CEO you know we we like we talk about the the negative aspects I I I think I've made it very clear I think
they're an extremely difficult company to work with I think they've got an arrogance about them a chip on their shoulder that makes its way straight from the top um but you know I think we also acknowledge the good that they do we acknowledge the extremely strong track record they have for product support for example nvidia's software support for their aging and Legacy products stands out in an industry where many companies will just arbitrarily drop support for things um even that are
quite new um when they when they commit to something they they they follow through on it I mean even when it's obviously failing look at how long they stuck by 3D Vision in spite of the fact that it was clearly dead but that ecosystem they' built they supported it for a long time so we talk about the things they do bad we talk about the things that they do well and after a couple of years and someone who did take things personally ultimately leaving the company under some circumstances that I I I genuinely
don't know what they were but they're not there anymore they have come back to the table I think we're probably going to be working with them this coming year we've done some stuff with them in 2024 um and and that's good like that's a healthy thing for them to be able to be criticized on the one hand editorially and be able to work with us to um on like a in a sponsored or Advertiser capacity to get their side of the messaging out if that's if that's what they want you got to have you got
to have both of those things and if you want to reach our audience you're just going to have to accept that that's how it works uh Colton today I think I think this might end up in a behind the scenes that Sammy was shooting Colton today brought up the time he had to get on a call with Intel right after I did that intro with like me as like a like a hostage like a terrorist hostage yeah do you remember this no um acknowledging it but I don't I don't remember yeah here it is here it
is so we did this we did this bit where I I pretended that uh here we go that intel was holding me at gunpoint and I had to read a statement saying that their that their stuff was really good or whatever he had to get he had to get on a call with them like the day after  oh man I can't believe the kind of stuff  years like this is crazy this is absolutely crazy it's also really funny to me that I that I I that anyone even remotely acknowledges people who are like yeah lonus would never say anything
negative about a sponsor whatever like  I was I was explaining the the concept of uh I'm gonna I I don't have a swear button so I'm G manually bleep it but um I was explaining the concept of stuff manufacturers say the other day to somebody and they're like wait you guys actually did this and I like showed them a few of the videos they're like what oh yeah dude um I I think Cooler Master works with us again so I guess I can say this but Cooler Master like didn't talk to us for I think like a
solid two or three years after that one on there their supposedly mechanical keyboard one from from the ship manufacturer say series I remember that's hilarious yeah I don't know man but like I don't know it is what it is doesn't matter you gota be the thing is the thing is look if you do your job well enough and I'm talking to my fellow content creators right now okay if you do the job well enough it's not going to matter who likes you or who doesn't like you because at the
end of the day people come they go in this industry they move around jobs they move around positions if you're good enough you'll still be there doesn't matter there's always there's always another there's always another chance to restart the relationship that doesn't mean that you should be malicious you should never be malicious never do anything out of malice That's not healthy either but you've got to speak your mind you've got to you've got to be honest you've to you've got to bring the the best
knowledge that you have to your audience and as long as you do that the audience is going to be there for it and as long as the audience is going to be there for it the brands will always come crawling back every yeah and I an important part of this is well they were never there in the first place I think uhu I think an important part of this equation is that we need to come back too basically like if if someone scorns us but then there's there's a change in the future that we
need to do it as well which we do we screwed something up if we screwed something up then we should do what it takes to to heal the relationship as well yeah totally for sure debrand is most healthy sponsor relationship yeah I don't know about that but uh definitely it works it works in its own toxic way um all right what do you want what what do you want to talk about next what do you want to talk about next oh actually on this okay no go ahead I was going to say the Australia ban
social media for kids under 16 let's do it do me do it I don't know how the latency is is working it's like a two second delay but uh you go ahead all  it stop it you're allow to do that on purpose um sorry about that [Laughter] Australia has passed its controversial social media ban for children under 16 into law only a week after being released that's genuinely kind of nuts uh rather than punishing children who manag to get around it which many are already promising to do the law compels
platforms like Tik Tok Facebook Snapchat Instagram X and even Reddit to find some way to block access by miners which doesn't involve requiring government ID  that would uh that would probably work um until you get an AI that can like I mean it wouldn't even need to be an AI just like a a font system anyways uh social media sites possibly any website that allows uh interaction between users so any any like yeah social media site ugc site stuff like that um could face fines of up to 33 million
Us doll for systemic failures to prevent  oh crap wait what are we a social media platform by this definition we have multiple of them what do you mean multiple what other than float plane The Forum oh oh no Forum no forum's not social I really hope there's some amount of like it only comes into account once you're a certain size because if not we're gonna have to figure something out uh CU  anyways the government says that the law uh 33 million USD Australian that's not how that works oh it's 33 million
Australian dollars okay okay so like 20 bucks not too bad not too bad or or like million Canadian yeah cost of doing business the government says that the law supports parents concerned about online harms to their children while opponents are concerned the ban could negatively impact mental health by cutting vulnerable young people off from support networks oh wow interesting wow there's a lot to unpack there cuz like yeah social media does allow us to connect with each other but the problem is
that each other are sh a lot of the time so like man it's like oh man are you pretty strongly of the opinion that it it does a lot more harm than it prevents this is tough okay go ahead I'm sure I'm sure it will hurt for certain people though I don't know anyways um privacy Advocates warned that um it's moving around sorry one sec privacy Advocates warned the law would lead to increased collection of personal information while the Australian Human Rights Commission said the law May
infringe human rights of young people by interfering with their ability to participate in society man these are some wild arguments but like hold on hold on is that true like are you able to participate in modern society and remember remember remember for every like people's Society is defined by their way of interacting with it if if your way of interacting with people is through social media if that's your cohort is there a valid argument there I I think there might be no well I don't I don't think so I I
think my reasoning for that is because you're not going to stop interacting with your peers so if they ban social media you will find some other way to interact with your peers you're not you're not stopped from interacting with Society you're being stopped from interacting with Society uh with the Society of specifically adults and in one specific way you can still observe because you could still like go on YouTube I'm sure um because it's talking about making accounts it's not talking about using
the platform so you could still look at Reddit you could still look at YouTube you just can't interact with it which I think is fine and then in regards to participating in society you can still talk to other people you can you can I'm I'm you can call your friend you can talk to your friend in person um I I think that's a a massive uh overreach of what's actually happening to say that they're being like cutting cut off from interacting with Society that's not fair um and I I think in some ways
honestly especially when you have developing brains and whatnot you don't necessarily want uh all forms of society being shoved into your head all at the same time I I think there's arguments that that's bad for for currently evolved humans of all ages to a certain degree let me play devil's advocate here a second I would say that probably 95% of my eldest's social interaction um when he's at home is on Discord Discord is obviously social media it's not on the list here but I would I would assume
that it would be someone's going to figure out at some point that it's social media so it'll probably be added to the list and the problem with that is that the infrastructure that existed before Discord doesn't exist anymore like there is oh it's still there no no no no no hold on hold on still around no no no no no hold on hold on I'm I'm going even farther back than that even farther back than that because team speak would still be a social platform potentially uh so
we got to go farther back than that the landline is not part of the family home anymore like there is no way even if I'm like here son or daughter borrow my cellular telephone there's no one for them to call it's weird like it it is it's it's it's not taboo but it's not normal for you know one of my kids friends to call my phone that would be not normal that would be weird like we have these boundaries that exist around cell phones that sort of come from the time when the cell phone was separate
from the landline home phone but those landline home phones went away there is no pH number for my kids to call to talk to their friends so if they don't interact online how do they talk to them when they aren't at school together when they aren't already in the same physical room and I'm not saying there is that this is insurmountable I'm just I'm playing Devil's Advocate a little bit here on purpose because yeah because For Better or For Worse this is the communication
Lifeline that they have to each other that they're used to and cold  in in I I've got a few opinions on this I think if you look at the list of things that they mentioned I don't necessarily know that Discord would be on there I think it would be um but I'm not certain because Tik Tok Facebook Snapchat Instagram X Reddit all of these are Big feeds of information you jump on it's forcing content into your face something like teams speak especially but also Discord you are more
joining things if when you set up Discord by default there's nothing and then you join a server right there there's some there's some action that you have to take on X or whatever there's there's like a there's a home feed on Reddit there's a home feed Facebook home feed Tik Tok home feed all these things have a feed of information that is given to you no matter what um I I think it's different I don't know how this law would view Discord maybe it is included maybe it's not um but something
that I would really push is that I guarantee you day Zero people are going to figure out how to interact with each other in some way um I think the the comment that you made and one of the comments in here talking about how they can't participate in society are both assuming that humans somehow for some reason for the first time in however many years you believe in uh decided to stop in ating which just makes no actual sense um like people are going to communicate there
there's going to be a way um so I'm not I'm not personally super concerned about that um yeah I don't know I think there'll be growing pains for sure I think you underestimate the the inertia of being used to something I I completely no I completely believe I think there will be growing paints 100% what what my whole day Zero thing wasn't like it'll be good day Zero my point was that people will be trying things working on things Day Zero it might take a pretty considerable
amount of time um but I also think that that's okay I I don't think that we should not do things because there is any amount of downside um I think we should recognize that there is a immense and extremely deep deeply rooted negative impact of having um kids on social media um I I think it's I I think social media of all kinds is is genuinely like a negative thing for for a lot of society I think there are positives to it but I I I do think for the most part it it negatively weighs on
a lot of people Doom scrolling um you know if you have a there's this whole concept that like relaxation and rest is actually very important and there's there's been some studies I'm looking into this recently that people aren't receiving the amount of relaxation and rest that they should have have because you're you're going to work and stressing and then you're coming home and your your rest time is content Etc which is Extreme stimulation and extreme stress because the stuff that's working really well in
those platforms is is negativity it's really bad news it's all these it's it's fighting it's you know when you when you work and you have a stressful day and then you go home and you fight people on Twitter you're not resting uh here AED here's a pitch from chat um from Alon what if they baned algorithmic social media rather than just social media in general because if you strip away the algorithm element of it um I mean it's basically just you could draw a lot of parallels to something like a Discord or
an iMessage group chat or a forum I mean is Twitter really that different from a forum at that point right you've got you've got a parent post and then you've got a thread of replies fundamentally you can you can DM other people in their replies you know like I actually do think it is I I do I do think it's quite different and that that's why I was saying like I don't technically know when looking at this if um things like Discord count because um there there's a so okay algorithmic sure but on stuff
like X or Twitter or whatever there's a global feed um on stuff like Facebook there's there's Global Information if there was a way to use Facebook where it only ever well that's what I'm talking about that's what I'm talking about your  feeding yeah okay um I think that would be a lot better to be clear I'm not saying that any of these platforms are going to agree to build that version of their product for Australia like I don't I don't think that's going to happen I mean this this mostly is just the
reality of it is and I don't live in Australia I don't have any kids who live in Australia so to me this is just kind of an academic conversation and I'm sorry that this is actually impacting people how whichever side of the fence you you sit on on this issue um but for me this is just kind of an opportunity to to to talk about you know because it just whichever whatever position you're in whichever your stance is I think what we could probably all agree on is that this seems like it got rushed
um this seems like it got pushed through without necessarily full consideration of the ramifications and that's really been my main point this whole time I'm not saying that I disagree that kids should not be on social media um I'm just saying that it seems like there's a lot we haven't considered here um meanwhile in 13 European countries Tik Tok is blocking users under 18 from using its beauty filters defined as effects designed to alter your appearance particularly effects that users may
mistake for unaltered video and effects which are designed to be obvious and funny which will not be blocked so so the specifically the beauty filters are the ones that are designed to um look like an unaltered video uh Tik Tok which already doesn't allow accounts for users under 13 also said they're developing machine learning technology to help detect and prevent people under 13 from being on platform I don't know how effective that's going to be uh probably about as effective as it
is right now which is zero I mean I definitely have young relatives who are on Tik Tok more than I would allow my young relatives to uh be on Tik Tok but um I I can't tell other people how to parent I think the thing that I would I would add before we go on is that I I think much more Silo experiences like Discord I think I'm wildly more okay with h Discord can be a Discord can be pretty wild west man like you can you can find some pretty some some pretty unhinged stuff on Discord pretty easily
oh 100% if you join if you join the certain servers that have that but I think it's in my opinion it's a lot easier to as a as not a parent I have to assume as a parent that it would be easier to watch Discord usage I'm gonna blow your mind I'm G blow your mind right now the parent generation the parent generation never had a shot dude like I I attended this thing our YouTube rep asked me to go to this like technology and parenting thing to to connect with um oh shoot what what
what was her name basically she runs this not for-profit that's um that's really focused on media literacy um especially in children um Med media smarts uh so they're a Canadian not for-profit um so she really wanted me to connect with her and they were I mean the presentation was totally um pointless for me it was like very basic it was like very thousand foot view of like you know the importance of of talking to kids and you know uh what does managing screen time mean and you
know stuff like that right um but one thing that I thought was really interesting about the conversation oh shoot how did I get kicked on to this ah where were we NOP now I've forgotten frud controls I was talking about Discord using Discord ah yes Discord okay so one of the things that that I thought about and that was part of my conversation when I was chatting with her was that you know we're having this conversation where we we talk about you know best practices for you know guiding our
children's online interactions and you know supervising screen time rather than than limiting it or using Parental Control software like actually like it it was good it was a good chat it was like you know healthy healthy parenting guidance actually it was really good but I basically told her I was like look you got to something that I think is kind of missing in this sort of an academic discussion is that the average parent is not equipped to do the things that you're asking them to do the vast
majority of the parents that I talk to and these are these are parents like myish age like I'm a relatively young parent in my son's cohort but I'm not that young anymore by the time we make it to my second daughter's cohort um just cuz like Ivon and I had kids pretty young relative to other Millennials so you got to get to like our third kid by the time I'm sort of the same age as people whose first kid is the same age as my youngest um so I'm so I'm running into people like my age people who grew
up on MSN Messenger and habo hotel and the majority the majority have no idea what the Discord even is let alone how to tell what servers their kids are on and how to go look through their history or figure out who they're friends with or even know what that cute little Ghost Face icon even means they don't know they don't understand and you can you can kind of like you could like crap on them be like they should know sure but they don't and that's the reality yeah yeah getting mad is not gonna actually
change anything yeah I think I I agree I I think it's just like some amount of anything like no matter what detection that they do I'm just trying to think like you know if you put me at 13 I'd get around it I don't I don't care what they do I'd find some way if I actually wanted to um but leaving some form of barrier in place to try to dissuade using these platforms um is probably a good idea because they I I I know people personally that I think honestly usage of these types of platforms has
introduced more brain rot than like Weed and Alcohol um like I I I think it's really bad I think it has a huge potential for negative in people's lives so holding off until people are a little bit older and hopefully a little bit more aware um of the impact that can come from these things um can be good um if if they really want it find a way and it's not like you're completely  um and yeah and things like team speak and Discord I think are are less of a negative impact than than other things although
anything ever is going to have downsides right like even Social Clubs you could have predators there oh for sure like like you have no idea right like there's there's always every single thing you ever do is going to have some form of downside so anywhere where children congregate intentional choice of words Predators will will find a way to infiltrate um totally yeah so shout out yeah shout out Medias smarts. CA by the way so uh one of the things that you can do is you can share resources like this
um they I I only met the yeah so flashing back yeah they talk about um media literacy in particular like how to recognize fake news how to fact check uh how to do your own research a lot of people say do your own research but a lot of people um who try to do their own research are giant idiots and probably shouldn't do their own research they should just find someone who did the research for them and they should listen to them uh unfortunately because they have no idea how to do their own research they have
no idea how to choose someone to do research for them so they're hopeless  ah and yeah so strawberry in floatplane chat says media safety should be mandatory in education IMO that's a big part of what media smarts is actually pushing for and one of their big frustrations and I uh I I we're very much like our Southern neighbors this way is that our our educational curriculum is handled at a provincial level rather than at a federal level so instead of them with their very limited
resources and money lobbying being one body right at at a federal level they have to go around and they have to lobby at a provincial level to try to get this stuff integrated into the platform to try to build these resources so it's a it's an important Mission it's extremely challenging it's an extremely challenging thing to tackle especially when there seem to be much better funded organizations that have uh a lot more interest in keeping people media illiterate um which is a which is an
unfortunate fact of our time yeah any who uh merch messages I guess we're supposed to talk about those I guess we'll also do like announcements and stuff hey that's right LTT store Black Friday deals are live and oh we have something special going on um blah blah blah okay I'll get to it I'll get to this in a second we just dropped our Black Friday deals this morning you can save up to 50% oh are we down b b are we down I um can't tell Black Friday is live unlike the WAN show okay apparently it's just uh

you'll see a little box when we're live and it'll allow you to fill a thing out it'll either go to produc well it'll all go to producer Dan who will reply to it pop it up down there do both of those things or he will curate it he will send it to someone internally or send it to me and Luke to answer so why don't we do a couple of merch messages want to show us how it works Dan sure what is the best worst deal LT store has ever done I think the mystery screwdriver deal is probably right up there with our
best deals um I think the I think the Willy Wonka deal on the 3D down jacket was pretty cool I think it was a one in 10 chance to win or something like that it was either 1 in 10 or one in five it was like a uh no no no sorry it was either 10 in 100 or 5 in 100 it was either 10% or 5% um and people won a trip here like literally like a couple dozen people won and came and got tours just for buying a 3D down jacket that was a pretty cool one um in comple says $15 hoodies on Lime day that was crazy
that was like way below cost Jerin says $5 desk pad uh yeah that was stupid we shouldn't have done that um yeah there's there's some stuff we really just like straight up shouldn't have done um yeah $29 for the Dropout was great says Crystal as for the worst deals we've done I don't know if we've ever done like a bad deal I can tell you what our worst performing product is though do you guys want to know all time I it might be of all time it's it's really bad it doesn't sell at
all like nobody cares I I love it I think it's super cool but it's uh oh yeah you can see um well it's a better deal right now I'm pretty sure this is below our cost I I would have asked for this to be priced a little bit higher than this but our GPU crash Tower game um it costs what it costs because that's what it costs to get detailed laser engraving uh across you know that many little pieces of wood but this thing did not sell at all like at all um I'm going to actually message them to save one for
me I don't have one yet but I I want one uh by the way Nick messaged to say that it's just unfortunate timing that our Precision screw driver sponsor spots came out first we have lots of other ones going for other products that are in stock it was just yeah just really unfortunate timing hey can you guys hold on to a GPU crash Tower game for me period I don't have one yet and I would really like to  idea actually don't think it was my idea but it was uh I I I was very supportive
of this project in spite of the fact that it was like obviously made no sense like I think you can get first party D Jenga for like $12 or something like that but first party D Jenga is not Lazer engraved I don't even know if that's engraving whatever it's not lasered it doesn't have lasers I mean it has a little bit of lasering just way less oh all right hit me Dan sure I've got one for Luke here Mr Luke if Canada banned chicken would you move chicken banned chicken uh I would I would start
uh man what did they what did they call it was it bootlegging when you never  it that's a good point I might have to I have to do remote W shows forever um what what was it called when people would run alcohol during the pro lagging bootlegging yeah okay I thought so um I feel like I would end up like bootlegging chicken breast bootleg chicken I feel like if you put a chicken in your bootleg it would probably be not safe for consumption by the time you get to anywhere to cook it I see I need LT
store like active cooling boots um yeah I don't know uh I don't know in all serious like no I can't just like move away from work regardless of what weird actions Canadian government takes but it is what it is I mean yeah I'm they might do some weird stuff so we'll see we'll see how it goes oh yeah oh yeah I suspect the next four years for the whole world is going to be weird d it's it's have have you oh man this is maybe not a topic for wano but it's it's C the the consistency
at which every single ruling party in every single country in the entire world is being voted out is nuts yeah ours is next oh yeah oh for sure yeah there's no way he holds on yeah and it's it's almost like it's almost like there were Global events that took place that contributed to the challenging environment that they were all dealing with I'm not saying that I'm not saying that all or any of them or whatever I'm not saying any of them were doing a great job given the
circumstances I'm just saying I'm just saying it's almost like there was a whole thing you know that was going on on a global scale almost like that yeah  next up Dan uh yeah do you want to hit us with one more Dan I know there's a there's a lot now that we've highlighted the Black Friday deals they seem to be coming in at a pretty ridiculous rate I've only got four curated most people are just like awesome thanks for the deals oh that's nice shout out those people rip my wallet Etc oh wait no before you do
that before you do that there was a a chat uh a chat that I wanted to respond to that wasn't a merch message Ash 69 said at Linus xqc needs help building PC again why doesn't he just buy one at this point did he learn nothing like honestly I I I don't think he should build a PC I um I think that he should buy a computer that's what I think just add that to his Amazon list got a Mac Mini from Amazon uh JC says my partner just picked up nearly $300 worth of underwear from you guys she's texture sensitive
and your underwear is the most comfortable she's ever found thank you for making great products um make sure she gets as much as she'll ever need I don't think we're going to stock it again because it hasn't been a big mover so no no that's what that's what happens with our that's I think no we're bringing back the men's stuff but we've had some trouble with suppliers for the men's stuff so it's um thought you're getting rid of the men's yeah it's kind of in uh might have just
implied that I wear women's underwear um yeah I met a I met a guy from AMD here while I was on my trip and he was showing off all his his AMD drip um and he had like branded socks and he had actually very sharp looking AMD branded dress shirt that had the AMD logo on the collar it looks actually very good um and then I pointed out like yeah you can't always tell these days but I'm also dripped out and LTT stuff because like you at the time I was wearing the the tall black long sleeve yeah so like
you can't tell that it's LTT merch but it is uh and then I I commented on about how even even my underwear was was company brand um did he have underwear did he have AMD underwear no I didn't then we win yeah yeah yeah and I have good news for you Luke we may be close on socks really that is actually genuinely very exciting yeah um oh man okay Tatiana the one and only Tatiana may have found something it's not the same as the darn tffs that I like but what it is is very competitive in the ways that
um I care about and maybe maybe even a little bit better in some ways I didn't know I cared about so we'll um we're going to see we're going to see we'll see yeah she she leaked like she leaked like three projects when she came on the 16 the sweet double sweet 16 stream it was it was crazy it was crazy I was like I was I was this close to filing a union grievance  job you can't you can't take my job um yeah we just we just need Footwear now and then then I'll be able to be 100% LT
products just duct tape the plastic bags to your feet all right sorry Dan I totally interrupted oh my God we're up to 17 merch messages per minute it has doubled in the last like 2 minutes yeah hello my Paras you get for for saying you have it under control I got it under control sorry Dan it's the delay sorry Dan it's the delay I didn't mean to interrupt I got it hello there's no actual delay between me and Dan I'm just doing this to mess with them all right I'm going to screw
with lus I know how to do that try and talk now I was going to say you can just m him no oh you put an echo on me dude that will not stop me at all you wouldn't believe oh my gosh you are super capable of doing that dude that's not that's I ran W show I remember I used to be the producer of w show so I ran W show while hosting W show with delayed audio in my ears for years dude you cannot do anything to me I can sing in harmony I can barely let's go I can barely talk with any sort of like delay around 15
anyway here is a merch message for you yeah uh this one is hello my parasocial friends in quotations hello Dan Ramses all today Lenny face also Luke how's the food at this side of the pond any other funny or nice things happening in the  baguette uh no food's amazing um funny things happening I don't think there's been a lot of particularly funny things  um I went snowboarding the that was fun sick it's been it's been a great trip so far um so you went all the way to France so that you could go to
Switzerland Wow way to betray way to betray your French lineage way to betray your French lineage Mr oh dude I've been roasted so hard for that the whole time I've been here anytime anyone figures out my last name after I've already made it clear that I can't speak French they're like what are you doing especially especially at that point in time they assume I'm American then I'm like no I'm from Canada and they're like  worse so I don't know I mean that's fair but I mean if you are 
understand terrible canadi I mean the consistency of which I've been roasted for that is wild I was at a Christmas Market technically tonight I guess I don't know whatever um and and I was shopping and and the the lady was like oh where are you from and I was like Canada um and she started roasting me before she even knew what my last name was then I went to go pay and she saw my name on my card and she was like [Laughter] what yeah my bad yeah get good scrub um all right what are what are we supposed
to be doing right now more topics sure let's do topic oh dude dude wait can you can you okay okay oh dude this is amazing in a first ofit kind lawsuit Sydney Nicole gford is suing fellow Amazon influencer Alysa shial for copyright infringement and misappropriation of likeness both create content in the clean girl aesthetic characterized by neutral colors minimalist decor and a focus on self-care but gford alleges that Sheil has harmed her earnings by copying her content including featuring
the same types of products posting similar poses and outfits matching specific frames of her videos and even getting a similar flower tattoo on her left bicep just like gford Shield denies copying gford and claims that the similar ities in their content are due to the nature of the Amazon influencer program and the prevalence of the clean girl aesthetic she argues that many influencers feature the same products and that gford style is not Unique Kind of own goaling with that one IMO says
Riley sorry that's he added that to our notes legal experts suggest that gord's case faces challenges because copyright law offers limited protection for the type of content she creates um given the generic nature of many of the images and lack of exact exact replication the similarities may not be sufficient to prove infringing our discussion question is what are the boundaries of intellectual property in the influencer industry where repeating Trends is kind of part of the culture like like memes um could
we sue another YouTuber for making junkyard Wars for example wait oops that's the US version of the UK show scrap Heap challenge um which we actually did realize when we named our things scrapyard Wars but hey at least it's not quite the same thing now everything that I said everything that I said just now is is sort of um hard to wrap your brain around until you actually look at the content so I'm going to I'm going to pull these guys up hold on uh here we go I'm going to pull up
the one and then I'm going to pull up the other one and it is I know that people have some thoughts on the verge or whatever um it is worth firing up The Verge I'm going to uh Dan can you share the article with people it's worth firing up The Verge and reading this article it's a long read but just look put your put your Subway Surfers aside for a little bit and read it because it is sort of mindblowing it's it's an outstanding piece of Journalism and hold on I'm just trying to contr F
crying out Sydney here we go it's an outstanding piece of Journalism because it manages to tell both sides of the story in a way that I think is shockingly unbiased because if you're anything like me you're going to look at these two and you're just going to kind of go okay oh crying out loud just find the stupid thing here okay here we go you're going to look at these two and you're just going to go yeah how could anyone be more generic than this and how could one painfully generic
person um accuse another painfully generic person of like stealing their Vibe when when this is it I mean I oh man I told myself that when we covered this I was going to try to stay neutral but like my God you didn't create the products like their color palette yeah you didn't you didn't create any of these products do you understand do you understand where that took me way too long sorry do you understand where products come from okay because it wasn't from you it wasn't from your Instagram page it was
from a company somewhere that engaged a manufacturer some somewhere built a spec for a product and created it and if it exists on Amazon there are literally I promise you the minimum order quantity for them is thousands of units there are literally thousands of them that exist before you ever touched it how can you possibly how can you possibly say that someone is like that someone is infringing On You by featuring the same like purse or whatever I I am I am beyond I am beyond words on this whole
vibe um any man is telling us to check examples from The Verge article but I would recommend people just go look at the Verge article themselves the the main thing that stands out to me is is probably the um the arm tattoo if those are actually super similar that could be getting kind of weird they're in the same spot but let's be realistic there are are not that many um there are not that many spots that like people put tattoos uh I will show just the tattoo tattoo though I'll show just the tattoo 
really a rose it's definitely similar Dand lons yeah it's in like kind of a similar spot but like and it's a similar style like look if I got a stamp would one of them accuse me of copying them like well one I'm not saying like an enlarged one second like I'm not I'm not saying that either of them has one I I I doubt that stamp is part of the clean girl aesthetic if anything the opposite but like my point is just that there's a finite number of like trendy places that people put tattoos and I don't think
that you can lay claim to putting a mark on a particular spot on your body like there's only so many of them yeah moo says tattoo fads are definitely a thing and it's like I don't I don't know man like I just even and and you know what there's like I said the article's really good and it does a good job of allowing them to kind of lay out what they think is should be protected about their business but I got to say as someone who's in the influencer game uh even though you know
a lot of what we do is more akin to vlogging or reviewing as someone who definitely participates in um programs um honey what you do ain't unique um and if someone's copying your stoil then that's good and keep innovating I've been doing this for one of them one of them is 24 okay I have been doing this since more than half the time they've been alive I have been doing this since since the one of them was seven years  and let me tell you what you did when you first started it's not going to work
today and what you're doing today is not going to work tomorrow platforms come and go content formats come and go visual Styles come and go uh you probably shouldn't have gotten that tattoo because you know now you've marked yourself as like you know gen Z or whatever no in all seriousness get whatever tattoos you want the point is just that everything is impermanent and if you expect like your signature tattoo to be like a thing and stay fresh and hip forever you got another thing coming  
yeah next topic yeah let's do it anyway read the article it's really good it's probably the best piece that I've read on the verge in years yeah we don't want to cannibalize other people's stuff so just go go check it out yourself um okay do you want to talk about the hold hold on there's no there's one thing I'm gonna read off of it first this is really funny it's like the the the what is it the by line the sub headline I don't know I don't come from print um one Amazon influencer makes a living posting
content from her beige home but after she noticed another account Hawking the same minimal aesthetic a rivalry spiraled into a first of its kind lawsuit can the legal system protect the vibe of a Creator and what if that Vibe is [Laughter] basic oh she called her a basic without saying it I love it that's actually pretty good anyway it's it's great it's great because there's this undertone of like okay this is all ridiculous right like Emperor's Emperor's New Clothes Like We all we all know this is
ridiculous right but she tackles the subject matter with such um energy and and and like almost like doey innocence like I like I don't know that this is ridiculous that you you have to admire it it's it's a really stylish article it's really good okay all right sorry Luke go ahead speaking of really good articles oh okay good that's a good intro so lonus lonus just dropped this in the uh in the topic suggestion chat with no context and I had no idea like okay is he gonna try to is he is gonna
try to roast us or what's the what's the plan here um the intro at the beginning of this show seemed positive so that's cool but yeah I thought this was a great uh this was not my idea I thought this was a great idea um Luke cenon did a fantastic job U but yeah what what what do you what do you want to discuss in particular I just want to talk about how the lab is quietly doing some really cool stuff and massive shout out on and Lucas and this is pretty cool on LTT labs.com I came across this completely
organically someone actually linked it to me on social media I did not I did not go to like my own website I own and see it I like someone sent it to me um and it's really cool when we tested the Corsair SF 850l power supply we noticed that both the box and corsair's website said it was 80 plus gold certified however when we checked clear results database it was actually rated as Platinum how interesting of a thing is that why on this Green Earth would Corsair a company that allegedly likes
to sell you products rate their product gold when the certifying body that tested it said it's Platinum a higher efficiency standard this is such an interesting question and it's exactly this is exactly what the point of theing lab is this is this is the this is the whole point this is why this is why we needed to test it okay so this is super cool um anyway naturally we reached out  but before we dive into okay so we we do a little explanation of uh gold silver and bronze we talk about what efficiency
means it's a really nice little primer you know like used to exist back in the day of like written you know articles and stuff um coming back to it boom blue  it yeah it's we we did some tuning um we're still trying to learn about white writing for web right like it's different like and and also the lab site is a little bit different like something that I've been kind of trained on almost is when I'm reading articles if I see a link in an article I'm going to expect that it's probably
not linking to me what I actually want I don't know if you've experienced this but I've experienced a lot of whenever there's a link in an article they find some way to shoehorn it into linking to their own site no matter what even if it makes no sense and ours are just like the link that you would expect it to be so like when you open opened the I think it was the the clear like it actually went to clear's website instead of just like a back link to our own website um
so we're trying to be legit in that way there is actually no functional way for us to profit off of the blogs right now um nice there's no ads on them there's not there's nothing like that so um we're just genuinely actually trying to make them really good um super cool I I think they're good yeah check it out yeah and I would like to point out that the whole like power supply circuit thing kind of working check this out okay recent video from 4 days ago 880 views 880 people watch that that's that's I I
know that's not a w but relax hold on a second let's go back a little bit this is why this exists let's look at everything from around a month ago oh "2,000 2,000 2,000 2 and a half thousand" "2,000 views okay let's go back a little" bit further let's go back a little bit farther 4 and a half thousand 2 and half "thousand 3,000 1 and a half" "47,000" "62,000 that's what these videos are for" they're meant to be a resource and we're building we're building a library and

personal boundaries uh we have signs up outside uh we've talked about it on the WAN show um there have been a couple of notable exceptions where people think that because they're here they are entitled to you know an audience of some sort and the reality of it is that in our business that's a safety issue um and that's just not something that we can entertain we have processes for these kinds of things don't show up here you won't get a tour you won't get you won't get a selfie like it it doesn't
work like that um and no it's it's a really good question but overall people have been super super respectful and actually we have found that there has been a reduction in interest in our location and interest in uh in infringing on our privacy ever since we he almost dropped it Dan sorry um infringing on our privacy wait you I thought you were taking it away what are you doing what did you do it had what in it he says it had animals in it what is what is happening am I missing something
sorry it had the the bug there was crawling around all over it oh okay now what no it is it somewhere else ah cool what was I talking about right sorry to interrupt yeah so actually people have been better about it ever since we just published our address on Google Maps like it's it's one of those things where it takes a ton of the Intrigue out of it like I like it actually kind of sucked back in the house people people were trying to come by like we we were a way smaller Channel back then and people
would try to come by more often uh yeah I spoofed him says regarding the security issue if I travel from New Zealand can I inquire about looking around the studios and pre-arranging a time for this unfortunately the answer is no we do meetups and we do tours sometimes uh we've done it as part of LTX for example but other than that the answer has to be no because no disrespect but I don't know who you are right and when we're not set up for it we're not set up for it and we
can't be set up for that kind of thing every day this is an office this is a it's a Production Studio we're we're working right we um we we do have fun I think we genuinely have fun sometimes but we have a job to do and we can't have random disruptions like that uh Tony B 486 says the White House gives tours well good for them um I hear if you go in January it's  free only you got the the okay uh Noki 1119 says lonus I'm curious you mentioned earlier in the show about conflicting with sponsors
does this also apply to framework and laptop sponsor spots I got to tell you I am surprised at how few our laptop Partners have given about the framework investment I think in about the like two to six weeks after I announced the investment I had a couple laptop sponsors kind of go like is this going to affect your coverage of us and our ability to work with you in a sponsored capacity in any way and I don't think a single deal was so much as delayed by it like literally no offense to
framework I love framework I love their mission I am invested personally in framework and the success of their mission the rest of the industry does not even acknowledge the existence of framework zero zero like whatever um I I don't think they see framework as a competitor I don't think framework has competitors framework has a product that is very unique and very framework which is a really cool thing that they've managed to do in such a commodity space as as as laptops right like that that's
incredible to build a laptop in this day and age that actually has a unique identity and and value and story that's I and I mean story without getting into some cheesy thing about how every one of them is made out of some rock that you found on a mountain or something right like like a real story I think that's really incredible um but it's a really small Niche and I just I just don't think that the main manufacturers acknowledge it um I hope that that that changes someday but I I
don't know if I see a path to that right now I mean I hope I hope yeah that's all I have to say about that and I don't think that um and I don't think that as much speculation as there might be about my biases or whatever else I don't think that I've shown any bias in favor of framework I go out of my in fact if anything I treat them very much like the coach's son um I go out of my way to be to to scrutinize them so that I will not be perceived as having a bias which is actually a bias of sorts
but it's not the kind that anyone gets mad at me about so I guess it's fine yeah yeah if you're going to have one that's probably the the better one to have oh that's the safer one to have because it's so much easier for us to uh it's so much easier for us to just kind of put on our like well if anything I go hard at them Shield right and it's like well yeah what do you get like you can be you can be like mad about your perceived conflict or whatever else but the reality of it is I'm still gonna promote 
still going to daily my Snapdragon machine from HP like there we go whatever oh did you think my audio cut out oh apparently he's fixing something with Dan in the background all right cool no I just I just stopped I just stopped talking mid SEC mid sentence I ain't doing nothing um what is beeping though I don't know man another merch message um okay hello everyone been a long time enjoyer of the show question for lonus working with Engineers what have you learned or became interested in I'm
hoping to study outside of school to become one oh man almost every talking to someone who is knowledgeable and passionate about just about anything is super interesting I never thought that I would care and I'm talking about Tatiana's spot on the sweet double sweet 16 stream again I never thought that I would care about fabric weights and composition but you talk to somebody like that about it and you're like dang this is cool you know and it's and it's the same you know you talk to you talk
to someone like tinan uh and I'll use a non-work example you know Tan's uh I'm not okay I don't want to give away any personal information but tinan knows a lot about um rehabilitation equipment and like workplace ergonomic equipment he knows a lot about that I'm not going to explain why and talking to him about that stuff it's just like it's cool there's there's there's so much more to like like rehab than just you know taking it easy or whatever else um I'm trying I'm trying to think
of like oh man I they they never let me talk to Nate in merch meeting because the project that he's working on is a very long-term project and the reality of it is that I don't really need to I don't really need to talk to him for him to keep working on it but um but I love talking to Nate about it because he I think believes extremely strongly in the product that he's building for LTT store right now and is genuinely excited about telling me about the the roadblocks that
he's able to overcome and and some of the exciting features that we might be able to have and just I don't everything everything is cool when you dig deep enough into it um or maybe it isn't but if it isn't for you then I think you know you got to learn to be curious I think you I think you genuinely have to learn to be  naturally has the uh the the instinct or the impulse to ask a follow-up question and uh because if they if they did then everyone would have you know the same
coverage say for example of a of a new news story but if someone else's is deeper it's because they they had the Curiosity to to ask another question and I think that's something that you have to practice do you think do you think that's a modern thing do you think that's because of the internet no no I don't think so I think that if anything  curious if anything and I think that historically our our capacity for exploration and and and digging deeper into things was was lower
I think we were I think as a species we accepted easy answers um without the same critical thought that largely people at least attempt to give it today yeah yeah fair enough um all right sorry what are we supposed to be doing Dan one more merch message and then we're moving on to more topics neat okay sure thanks for the way show I love listening every week I teach it a digital art High School what tips could you give for throwing a small land party maybe 20 to 50 students and maybe some
specific games that would work well well first things first I can tell you that 20 to 50 is a big range 20 is a reasonable size land party I would say that's a mediumsized land party 50 is big so you are yeah 50 is a freaking lot to coordinate because as soon as it's bigger than a Lobby right as soon as it's bigger than one lobby all of a sudden it's either like freefor all and people are just playing World of Warcraft on their computers over in that corner and they're doing whatever over
there or you are like managing multiple events right because almost there's almost nothing where you're going to have 50 people playing concurrently at the same time um so what I would say is I would say limit your seat count to some decide on your games and then limit your seat count to something that you can actually manage and if you can I would publish the games and schedule that you're planning to play ahead of time people will hate it they'll be mad about it that you're just like this is the game
we're playing from this time to this time and this is the next game we're playing and this is the next game we're playing but when the event is done they will have had way more fun and they like won't know why um the other good thing about doing like a like a 16 seat or something like that like 8 to 12 to 16 is that managing power is going to be a lot easier like you can probably do about three computers per circuit if you're in North America maybe four or five if you're if you're over in Europe
um when you have like 50 people now you're talking like you you have to drag extension cords from every corner of the house or the facility in order to power all these computers uh when you when you just have like 12 people you're dragging like three or four circuits over and you're going to have a lot fewer like blown circuit breakers that was going to be my biggest point is when you start getting to numbers like 50 you're now like investing in infrastructure instead of
just yeah having some buddies over and maybe buying like a genuinely very cheap switch when you're at 50 you're you're you know tables chair is power delivery networking um I mean they work at a school so presumably they have tables and chairs but okay yeah yeah that helps they asked for specific games Luke  games um I mentioned Savage if it's it's incredibly old at this point U but if you can if you can somehow acquire isos um because I don't know if there's any other way to get it genuinely um it's a
great game for when you have very large groups of people and you want everyone to play the same game especially if you have separate rooms of people and you want people to play game same game especially if you're at a school and one of the desks has like a projector screen so you can have your like Commander player with the projector screen and then everyone else's individual units it's like actually Sensational for that specific use case um outside of that I don't know all the classic things I Halo
C is just genuinely a really good land game um I think Counterstrike if you limit it to people that don't actively play is a really good land game jumping in a giant TF2 Lobby can be a lot of fun that's very fun yeah you can you can spark servers that way um so if you don't necessarily have enough people to uh make a game like tf2 fun just with your land if you have enough people to make the server look active you can jump into a a a type that you want so you want like um
247 uh Gold Rush or whatever it's called you could like jump in there and then you have enough people in there that other people will join the server as well which is cool um we've got to play that first game Savage we got to play that at the first wh land because you've told me about it so many times and I've never played it it's it was old when I used to play it and I used to play it when I was in university so it's like it's pretty old at this point um but it's it's yeah if you if you have
two like Commander projector screen type people because basically one player on each team plays an RTS and everyone else on those teams plays essentially uh an FPS who whoa whoa there's Savage Resurrection what's that from from eight year coverage from eight years  know here what is this so this video is from the war owl has a quarter million views uh that Creator yeah this video is a paid promotion by S2 games for Savage Resurrection so it must be a cult classic from the tail end of the second
golden age of gaming returns with Savage Resurrection was ahead of its time in 2003 well today is today Savage has returned so here it is yeah there apparently  Luke interest no idea yeah we're gonna have to try it I I don't know if it's any good but we'll definitely have to try it I'm going to here I'll click I'll click I'll go to the seam store o reviews mixed don't death sentence don't be misguided by the positive reviews this game is Dead there's no one online and no single player content Dev made it
pretty clear they won't be supporting this game anymore do not buy this is from September of 2016 mean that makes sense that Mak surprised by that at all uh yeah so yeah uh like the first Savage even I I remember when when someone was talking to me about it I was like how does this make any sense like this this almost isn't viable outside of land parties at SCH TOS like how is this game how is this game possibly viable at all notice at the request of the publisher Savage
Resurrection is unlisted on Steam and will not appear in search so this game is actually dead can you buy can you buy a game that's unlisted though I actually don't know and I'm not uh I'm not logged into steam on this computer so I'm I'm kind of curious now we're we're going have try right now on the website it doesn't you can't buy it man this is man this is sad the fact that games just are removed from storefronts and and and that's it so sad apparently there's also Savage
XR so it's a 16 V6 game with human Commander so I I think that means I don't think that means 15 versus 15 and then commanders either way that's pretty cool yeah apparently Sav XR is something as well what's that Savage XR download the RTS and FPS game uh okay uh well this is a website um the First the free realtime strategy shooter for Windows Linux and Mac play for free be a commander or a warrior Savage XR the successor of the 2003 the battle for new Earth takes the yeah interesting
okay well um cool that's probably that's probably worth checking out at some point maybe I don't know nice website though yeah I don't know if their Publishers or their developer is still doing anything or not I do know that um when there was that big rush for like DOTA style games they I'm pretty sure they were the ones that made Heroes of new Earth because I think Savage was yeah Savage the battle for new Earth  there.com let's see why don't we do our next topic gaming in the USA is about to get
terriable yeah I know um on November 25th president-elect Trump promised a flat 25% tariff on Goods coming into America from both Canada and Mexico as well as a 10% tariff on goods from China uh some examples of things the US imports from these countries are about 60% of their uh crude import uh crude oil imports those come from Canada almost a billion dollars worth of sugar from Mexico but probably more relevant to our audience a lot of tech products from China uh for example the Xbox
series X is almost entirely manufactured in China as well as a ton of PC components discussion question here is would manufacturing move back to the USA to help circumvent these tariffs and we are probably aren't going to get into a ton of detail on this on wano because we have a full video coming about this over the next little bit um I think it's oh actually it's coming out on Sunday we basically kind of dive into the politics aside math is math um why this is going to affect prices at
the till and uh why now may be a good time to kind of jump on a new PC or some some new electronics um our other discussion question though is do you see any side effects from this either positive or negative other than just higher priced electronics and one of the examples is Riley had an interesting take where or he saw an interesting take where maybe subscription based gaming Services could boom because people don't want to buy the hardware but wouldn't be paying a tariff tax on something like
GeForce now could we see like an unexpected benefactor or not benefactor a beneficiary of this could could do you think things like GeForce now might go up in price though as they have to pay more for their Hardware um no because uh my understanding is NVIDIA does a lot of their manufacturing with um uh with foxcon in Taiwan don't quote me on it being in Taiwan but I'm pretty sure that nvidia's first party cards are not manufactured in China which is why Founders additions were so cheap last
time around ah yeah yeah yeah okay yeah so just because nvidia's saving on tariffs on their cards doesn't mean that their retail price will necessarily be reasonable but what it does mean is that their costs are fine so they'd be happy to lease you those cards yeah if they see the competition going more expensive because of tariffs they'll just go with them probably well we talk about that in the video how even if you you've moved your manufacturing out if the competitive landscape shifts and I don't know
everyone's paying this price anyway you just hey thanks for the margin uh so we we kind of get into the the corporate logic that accompanies the decision-making process that leads to things like shrink flation and just generally High you talk about did you guys talk about the whole like um I don't know the proper terminology for it but when there's effectively a shell company in a country that's not being tariffed and you like s to them ship it to them and then then they sell it to
the states yeah we we didn't talk about that um we basically just focused on the very very very simple dumbed down version of just like hey when cost go up price go up because as much as that may be common sense um to a lot of people uh it seems like there are some people who don't that I mean there's a lot of people that didn't even know what tariffs are so yeah it was really uh have you have you looked at the Google Trends no oh this is really funny um   it check check this out you're going to
love this uh let's look at let's look at the past 90 days for no particular reason um interest over time for search term tariffs spiked on you guessed it November 26th I wonder why huh I what what what's that Spike before it what's that one uh I don't remember November the 8th uh it reached its uh 61% of its November 26 High uh  funny very interesant yep so or wait sorry sorry sorry sorry point of clarification um the the the rise sorry sorry sorry I do know the answer to that
uh the rise after the after this is really funny after the election was people being like wait what and then this was the recent announcement ah gotcha okay yeah yeah it's pretty uh pretty good pretty good um yeah so there was like a big peak in the leadup to the election and then like uh a bunch of people figuring out after the election  were all right so that's uh that's something so uh yeah good luck everybody should be good um yep cool uh anyway yeah so we have a video coming on that uh what what what
else we oh here's a big topic xos has entered Early Access beta so Luke uh ashte this is the nas software company this is this is my second my second investment uh and this one was at a very different stage this was like like Angel level like like first money into the company that is not from the devs directly um ashtech the nas software company that I've personally invested in announced yesterday Thursday the 28th that hexos is going into Early Access beta we actually have a full video coming
tomorrow that is the first time that I saw it I gave them the money two years ago can you believe it's been two years two years ago and in that two years I literally didn't see it other than a couple little like mockups of what the vibe was going to be like I hadn't gotten to try it at all Jake got to try it before I got to try it he got in a call with John John got him all set up with the beta and he like set it up and got some demos ready for us to do this video so that video the video
coming tomorrow is me fresh eyes hadn't seen it before getting to experience hexos and have some idea if they have a shot at all um pretty exciting to celebrate the launch ashte is offering their lifetime license I talked to them about lifetime license I was like look I understand subscriptions are the way of the future they're they support developers they actually genuinely do not every company is all about just like ringing as much blood from their customer Stone as possible
through subscriptions sometimes it's just about having a sustainable business model I get that but I told them it was very important to me that a lifetime license would exist they have taken that extremely seriously a lifetime license will exist it will be $300 per machine later right now it is $99 it's $100 um which is kind of nuts well remember people are taking a risked that people are taking a risk thoughte is a brand new compy literally brand new company they just went out of
hiding and maybe they don't exist in the future right we acknowledge that in the video and we talk about you know what the mitigations would be for that right um $100 is is a lot to give something that is Early Access and something that we've talked about a lot on this channel pre-ordering right but there are mitigations so one is that it's built on top of traz so even if they were to disappear you would still have a traz Nas that's still traz and number two is that they're offering a 30-day trial
period where they will offer a refund if you're not happy with the product so that helped a lot um so yeah $99 for Black Friday uh that will be available until December the 2nd after that early access to the lifetime license will be $200 uh so yeah the video is going to go into a lot more detail but the goal of hexos is to focus on creating a userfriendly and simple interface so anyone who could set up who anyone who can install Windows XP should be able to install configure and use hexos is is
basically where we're at actually maybe a little better than Windows XP is is what we would strive for and that doesn't just include like file sharing uh that should include things like buddy backup which we'll talk about in the video uh that should include things like setting up um apps uh whether it's like plaqu or image some of those just are like needlessly obtuse to set up and get working just to to have the the basic functionality that you want going and there's been kind of two takes there's
been two takes on this uh one of the takes I've seen is this is stupid right like what it's just a skin for trunz like I already have trunz like they sorry they want how many hundreds of dollars and then the other take from people who don't post on Reddit has been to throw money at FTE to say that they've had a pretty good initial launch would be a gross understatement because as it turns out the number of people that want the the reliability and the trustworthiness of trunz but don't want to faf about with
Arcane permissions and processes on trunz is actually pretty big um so it's it's been an exciting couple of days for those guys and uh yeah I'm I'm extremely proud of them really happy for them it's it's it's pretty exciting Elijah actually has a comment in here he says won't lie kind of bummed out seeing how many people missed the point of this software and just immediately complained about the price personally I think 300 bucks is totally fine for a lifetime license to software especially because I
spent over an hour trying to figure out Plex on my trz setup LOL uh and then highlighted a comment that in particular made him upset but I'm not even going to bother reading the comment because uh it it's okay I'll read one part of the comment it said just get a qap for a little bit more it's like right but that qap you can't upgrade that's that's how they get you that the subscription is if you ever want more Bays or if you ever want a decent amount of processing power you're going to have to buy a new
one software baby software so yeah pretty exciting um people have a lot of pretty good questions robot Robotech asks can hex run offline without any connection to their deck login that was something that they bunged up in their initial messaging for the product right now you have to connect to the cloud dashboard but at launch they will have a local only dashboard and the reason for necessarily buy things on a promise of features yes yes yes that um but I believe that they have heard the
community and understand the importance of local management I mean I told them the same thing I actually found out about the lack of local management from that interview um and I was like yo I wouldn't use it if it couldn't be accessed without an internet connection and they're like okay fix that for sure yeah um R asks does the lifetime membership include all future updates to my knowledge it does the best thing to do though would be to go to the hexos uh website so it's hex os.com hos.com uh
some things that are still a little bit hard to like uh in the text right above the deal it says get early access to hexos Beta and limited access to hexos and all its core features asterisk so they will add new features that may be paid features because some of the features that they add are going to have costs on their side so they're doing some um like kind okay uh yeah you don't use home assistant but for any of you out there who use home assistant for instance you can set up home assistant
for unpaid remote access or you can pay them a subscription and they make it way simpler they streamline the remote access process and the reason that you have to pay a very very reasonable subscription fee for that is that there are infrastructure costs on their end to maintain it um so I think the reason for the asterisk is that they will introduce features in the future that will be paid features because there's ongoing costs you will not get anything that has an ongoing cost for example if they were to
have a yeah go ahead I I completely agree with what you're saying the pro the problem in my opinion is the the wording doesn't sound like that uh the as says some features will not immediately be available in hexos beta but a lifetime license grants you access to all features of hexos forever including conbase backup premium support services and other metered Services which makes it sound um you know considering it says all features including other metered Services it sounds like quite literally everything
is included forever to any degree um which doesn't seem legit because that  um sounds like that I'm trying to find their Forum it's hub. hexosomes that's by far the best place to post it because like I said the first time I saw hexos was like a week ago when we filmed that video so take everything that I'm saying for what it is everything that I'm saying for what it is did I just  oh oh yes yeah I did okay that makes a lot more sense my bad freaking me out of here because that
really did sound pretty bad I was like that makes no sense and that makes sense because it didn't make any sense because I read it wrong excluding all the things that wouldn't make sense like cloudbased backup premium support services and other meded services okay good cravy um anyway the last thing that I wanted to say about hexos is that the cool the coolest part of this project is that the other investor is I systems um and if you don't know who I systems is here's a hint they make
tres oh wow no way yeah that's kind of cool actually yeah so this is one of those things where I feel like a lot of people have gone why would I want hexos I have TR Well yeah if you know how to admin tras then by all means no one's telling you that you like if you don't need the handholding then that that's fine but what I suspect is that for every one vocal person um for every one vocal person who is uh saying like this is stupid I I'll just roll trunz there's probably a hundred
people who have no interest in learning traz traz is an Enterprise tool traz is not designed for home users and it it never as far as I can tell based on that I've given them a lot of the feedback that I gave to the hexos team about what hexos should look like and they haven't implemented it tras is never going to be a consumer tool and the fact that they invested in hexos seems to be acknowledgement of that they know they have a great product stable product a good product but it isn't this product
and they were like okay well we could just invest in this product and then we have a piece of it and then they can make it that's cool by the way John from John from ashte is texting me he's like oh my God Luke  it oh my goodness sorry yeah he's like what the blowing up my phone well if it's any consolation I'm just like buying it right now so I'm paying for my mistake all right okay I think he'll get over it then um anyway cool so I'm I'm really excited about it uh really proud of what the team has
done you guys are going to see it in way more detail tomorrow um it's it's the product that only exists because uh John and Eric the founders and I share this belief that a DIY NZ shouldn't be hard you shouldn't have to understand like like uh what What's the what is it ACL like the the access control permissions thing I still don't understand LCL yeah you you shouldn't it's so hard you shouldn't have to understand ACL to set up a Plex container you shouldn't have to you
should just like the funny thing is is a lot of these a lot of these Nas plat platforms like they have an app store but they have fundamentally failed to understand what makes the App Store and when I say the App Store I mean Apple's app store they have fundamentally misunderstood what makes the App Store the app store one click that's what makes something an app store that's the as that's the aspiration and you know what there's going to be stuff that's going to still be challenging on Hex because
you can't do anything about you know how an open source developer of a particular app or container implements it you can't you can't you can't be in charge of that but what you can do is you can create tutorials what you can do is you can simplify as many things as possible I mean even Jake he was telling me about this just like off camera before we even started this project he's like yeah dude I looked at image like on a weekend and I was like nope and he he went back and he
figured it out later because he he likes a challenge but he's the kind of person who literally does this stuff for fun and he's like what are all these parameters why do I need all of this I just I want my pictures from here to there that's that's all I care about understanding what an average user actually cares about is something that I just I feel like a lot of folks don't and uh and that's something that that the ashtech team is really passionate about I I would again yeah I'm very excited about this
um if it if it if it's any consolation to John uh because I screwed up reading their site I just bought it so hopefully that helps um but he wants a pound of Flesh too do remember it's it's software and a beta right he says buy two he says buy two right now don't don't listen don't listen to him don't listen one's enough pay my Penance um I'm only buy one but uh I'm gonna I'm going to probably use lonus as my as my buddy back up um yeah man I told you I I told Jake I wanted to
do it as like an employee perk cuz we could like we could make a video about it and and like we could yeah we could make a video about building like the cheapest paby or something like that I think we'd have to cap certain people like Jake um but but if we had like a buddy backup Target at the office that would be an off-site backup that wouldn't have an ongoing monthly cost and that's like that's the idea that's the Nirvana that I would I would think that making Nas more accessible could
achieve and in the long term I could see them monetizing it I could see them building their own like hex cloud or like hex token like and and I know as soon as you talk about tokens or coins or whatever everything gets real cringe but hold on a second that's an actual like like valid there are legitimate uses for it yeah super cool yeah I think uh I think their payment portal might be having some trouble uh yeah it's probably it's not the first time I asked John how much I was allowed to share
about the success that they've enjoyed over the last little bit and he said you can say that our mail servers went down from The Surge when we launched uh and we've been blown away by the initial response and the first beta invites went out tonight yeah very very Co yeah great job also it took a long time but it did process it went through so like their stuff is working good job Riley's comment is so funny okay I'm going to read that comment that made Elijah mad it said with this $300 you
can buy yourself a Linux course or book and it will be infinitely more useful throughout your life it will teach you how containers work and you'll be able to install any Linux distribution of your choice install Docker plus compose or podman plus quad or kubernetes and set up your own Nas as a bonus you'll have a marketable skill Riley's comment on this is I ain't doing all that [Laughter] yeah Riley's got it I know like based Riley that's just true Elijah says I made the exact same face luk Elijah
doesn't get it dude it's so painful I like I don't know I I deeply respect the whole home lab idea especially for for it people uh but some people don't want to do that and like even people that want to you know do professional development in their own free time um you know maybe they don't want to do professional development on that in particular um it's a crazy idea to some people that just because someone fixes their motorcycle doesn't mean they want to fix their washing machine just because
someone fixes their washing machine and their motorcycle doesn't mean they want to fix their computer there are things that I DIY like Dan loves this story about how I DIY putting new rubbers into my windshield wipers it's so B because I didn't want to cuz I didn't want to like throw away the entire apparatus and I read somewhere that you could just replace the Rubber and it was it was a whole it was a whole ordeal he loves that um but the reality of it is when my here I'm trying to think of something
um when my garburator dies I'll probably just hire a plumber to come put it in I don't do everything myself because there are things that I'm passionate about or want to learn about or that I'm interested in or that I have some requisite knowledge for um I I'll usually spend a little bit of time figuring it out myself like when I installed my lewig bedet I did that myself I'm not going to hire a PL plumber to do something stupid like that like there's you know everyone's got
their limits and everyone's got their passion projects but nobody has time to learn everything and some people just want to pick their battles and for some people that battle is not a Nas it ain't true Ness and that's okay and that's okay like if you you know make enough money you know riding surfboards anding beautiful women or whatever that you can afford to hire someone else to fix your computer then like that's great and if and if you make enough money fixing computers that you can afford to buy a
surfboard and wait okay hold on this this breaks down a little bit the point is just that some people some people do sure  some if you okay uh the FTC the FTC is warning that a failure to commit to software support could be illegal a new FTC report warns companies that failing to disclose how long they they'll offer official support for their products may be illegal under the Magnuson Moss Warranty Act the report has been praised by public interest groups concerned about software
tethering which makes devices reliant on software updates from the manufacturer and companies randomly deciding to Brick devices like the Spotify car thing the FTC examined 184 smart products and found that nearly 89% of Manufacturers did not disclose this information on their product web pages and if they do include it some manufacturers bury this information in Spec support Pages or footnotes and some use ambiguous language like lifetime technical support failing to disclose software support information
could violate the Magnus and Moss Warranty Act which requires warranties to include a clear description of what is covered so hey ashte John I know you're watching right now yeah make sure you're doing this cool thanks that's my investor advice uh okay it could also violate the FTC act if the omissions or misrepresentations about software support are likely to mislead consumers I don't know what to say other than Lina con based and I'm going to be so sad to see her go and I really hope
that all these balls that she's started rolling don't just immediately get destroyed um lenina con we want you here in Canada if you're tired of um yeah if you're tired of what's going to happen to all the great work that you and your organization have done over the last little while that'd be sweet you could come run it if you want yeah honestly I'd vote you I'd vote I'd vote immediately do we have the same do do we have the same rules as the US where you like can't be
prime minister if you're not a natural naturally born Canadian like like you can't be president if you're not born in America can you be prime minister if not born in Canada I look that auto completed uh 23 people have served as prime minister since the office came into existence in 186 really only 23 people wow okay uh 19 have been born in Canada four have been born outside of Canada including Johnny McDonald is kind of a like big deal prime minister or whatever he's on our money I don't
actually know what he did pretty important um I don't know I think they should just take him off and put Terry Fox on the money but that's just me yeah Dan wasn't talking into his mic but he agrees no that came through actually yeah that's why I sit over here sometimes that's why I sometimes yell really loud while I'm over here so it just comes through your mics it's a effect you need to be able to speak French I don't know Lina Khan's based enough that she could probably learn
French I think she'd figure it out yeah I would like her more if she didn't yeah but you're British I mean your biases are your biases everyone is who isn't British is foreign that's how it works someone posted on the subreddit is again British and I was like yeah but we like him anyway that's where the dry wit comes from one of those Canadians are the good ones so don't push your luck Intel's battle mage leaks Intel's latest GPU known as battle mage Arc may be launching soon according to to leaks
uh Amazon leaks that's a sentence fragment anyway um leaks of pricing seem to fall in the $250 to $260 range with one leaker implying that there will only be desktop gpus not discrete laptop gpus this time around discussion question do you think with Intel having a rough year so far that this could be enough to get people excited for them again I I would be willing to get excited if the performance is really good in the $250 to $260 Range man we need a valid affordable GPU option I need a valid
option guys and and talking about software support they have taken Arc Alchemist first gen Arc from basically unusable garbage to actually working in the vast majority of games Hardware onbox found that it worked in what what was it 94 97% of games he tested like over 250 games that's pretty good and the ones that didn't work a lot of them were like old random stuff where he was basically trying to find stuff that it wouldn't work with and and often it was overcomable because the game wouldn't
work properly because it would not detect an Intel GPU as a discret GPU and it would think you had onboard because back when that game was made Intel discreet GPU wasn't even a twinkle in Pat Ginger's eye so I and I really I really hope it's any good I really hope it's any good um that's it I I hope it's any good um finally idium is developing a risk 5based Universal processor they're a semiconductor startup and have announced the development of a universal processor based on the risk 5 architecture it's
designed to handle a wide range of computing tasks including CPU GPU DSP and fpga functionalities now hold on just to gosh darn minute because this sounds like complete Hokum to me because to be both a CPU and an fpga you would have to have like the efficiency and cost effectiveness of a CPU and also like the field programmability of an fpga because an fpga the opposite of that for the other one can be a CPU just fine it's just like not a viable one it's not a cost effective one and they
say they would do this all on a single chip the universal processor is based on a workload agnostic microarchitecture that allows the same transistors to be reused for different processing tasks eliminating the need for multiple  cores okay the company has built a proof of concept emulation that shows its Universal processor Works allowing it to secure $3.7 million in seed funding to produce a working prototype in 2025 it was found founded by veterans from Nvidia Intel and Texas Instruments
including CTO Martin vorbach CEO hyan Shin Cho and chairman Peter Weber vorbach spent 15 years developing the technology behind the universal processor they plan to launch their first chips in 2026 eventually developing a complete portfolio of chips from small embedded devices to high performance Computing systems with their goal being to establish its Universal processor as the new standard in the industry I find this very hard to believe but I was excited enough reading what seems like
nonsense gobbley to me that I was like I  this neat good chat yeah yeah yeah um rest assured asks I don't know why server chips from Intel didn't have fpga sections years ago for specifically functions and the answer is because they are so expensive and inefficient they're so expensive uh those okay here's a great example uh those little USB ex fiber extender docks that I have from iicon okay you would think like what I don't know USB right USB over like a cat 6 or a fiber cable or
whatever like that shouldn't be that complicated right like the data rates aren't even that high you can do 10 gig over a over a cat 6A cable surely you could do five gig it's like well yeah but it's completely different protocol so uh are they expensive yes they are why because everything in them is handled via fpga and they have to be high performance fpgas because of all the translation in Tom Foolery that's taking place this is a super cool product very industrial product it's meant for like if you need
to run a bunch of like USB based cameras for Machine Vision or something over fiber or cat 6 uh cat 6 distances very cool product I use them for workstations at home because um they sent them like I I don't think I would pay that much to have USB bolt exists why does an fpga make them so much more expensive less because in order to be field programmable they have to be much much lower density and they have to be non-specialized and they have to be changeable so the way that they're
architected is just completely different from an Asic um but what they allow is they allow low volume products like this like if this was an Asic this thing would probably cost a third or a quarter as much but the reason that you can't do it with an Asic is because you would have to you would have to do the R&amp;D that's involved in taping out an Asic and that cost you would never recoup from the number of these that you could possibly sell so certain low volume products just never make it
to the non fpga stage like fpga are used for things like um R&amp;D for something that will become an Asic another example of an Asic based product was um Red digital Cinemas red rocket cards I don't know for a fact that it's an fpga I don't think I ever popped the heat sink off of one but I can tell you because it "was like a $2,000 card it's almost" certainly an fpga and be and because red would have never done the volume of business that would have Justified spinning like taping out a chip it just
doesn't work that way yeah fpgs are super cool they're just really really expensive uh ban says you can also send firmware updates that update the hardware yes you can update the hardware of the chip it's super cool it's super cool I love them so much yeah but you better be ready for like you know a couple hundred fpga so that you can play like like Genesis games it's like the power of an Arduino but costs two grand a CPU they're they're great they're great oh Sammy says remember the g-sync
chips yeah those were fpga weren't they uh if I recall correctly they were and that was a big part of why they were so expensive yep yeah if something seems unreasonably expensive for like how much processing power in it is in it it's almost certainly because it's an fpga and not a volume manufactured Asic like what's the name of those those retro consoles um super super premium retro consoles they they have Game Boy um oh analog they have old yeah analog their stuff is
largely very expensive because they have fpga chips yep and also because they just build premium products I mean look at them yeah fair enough but still but also because fpgas are expensive yeah yeah retro tank is another example also rather premium but yep yeah she be she'd be costly yep yep yep yep yep yep all right that's it for topics for today so I think it's time for when after dark very after dark for Luke oh yeah it's uh I it might be getting light soon it's yeah it's 5:40 in the morning
here dude did I show you the gym oh wait I did I sent you a picture yeah I'm excited smash Champs gym is based I uh I went on the the StairMaster yesterday and the bike just doing doing some of my cardio and it dude it's nice it's nice I generally one of the first things I do when I get home is go to to that gym I want to see it I the the the picture looks good little man chose a good machine oh he was just posing yeah still for now if he wants you know if he wants to train in the gym
in a way that will help him with badminton that is a machine that would make sense to use so I don't know all right nice any lucky all right d you want some merch messages I mean or do you want to self-direct whether I whether I want them or not I feel like um I mean there's a bunch of curated ones if you want to go down the list and read them while I just pop through the rest of these oh shoot do we still have incomings oh they're no longer coming in as fast I'm just working through the
backlog that was about 170 so okay uh yeah I mean it's been I yeah you know what before we get started before we get started now is probably a good time to tell you guys hey thank you so much for your support we are having an absolutely um Wild Black Friday um and the show has changed the numbers more than I expected I just brought up the report just now um yeah we're having a we're having a ridiculous um Black Friday so thank you guys all for being part of the part of the team's success
here appreciate you all I have been doing for a minute for the last 2 and 1/ half hours nice let's go Dan so uh you you dropped a gentle hint that you'd like me to just read them myself if you click on uh the incoming merch messages at the top it'll collapse that yeah I'm already there okay cool yeah thanks for the tech tips yeah uh okay Nick C didn't ask this but I'm curious uh  trip uh oh are you not able to yeah no no no I'm I'm I'm just thinking what what is all even happened um well you
almost got you almost got stuck like sleeping at a train station maybe I can wait to hear that  back uh no I think it's fine all right let's it's not near me so like it doesn't matter um yeah so I was I was planning on um I have this habit of traveling without much of a plan and I I actually really enjoy the outcome I don't recommend it to anyone but I I tend to enjoy the outcome I've had some fantastic experiences that would have never happened if I had much of a plan um but I had an inkling of idea of
something that I wanted to do before I came here which was go snowboarding in the Alps I knew I was going to be somewhat close so I brought some of my gear um obviously not my like board and Boots because that's kind of a lot to haul around but I brought a lot of my other stuff um and I had planned to go now I left a little bit late one day but there was still trains going like it was fine um I also ended up being late to one of my so I I left a little bit late but there was multiple trains that I
could have caught afterwards so it was going to be fine and then Google Maps was all messed up because there's a ton of construction going on so I ended up missing one of my trains and the next train wasn't coming for an hour so then I was even later and I was now on the this is the last set of trains that will get you to your destination yeah stage which is never good to be in especially when you're in a a country that you're not used to being in um and then I get I get most of the way there I'm now many
hours away from from Paris which is where um I was situated for the obh event um and there's there's I I wouldn't say a bunch because I mean it's the last train of the night there's really not that many of us um but there was probably about like 20 or so people waiting at the station for a train uh and then the train just didn't show up  training um there was a there was an announcement that went over the PA something to do with the train not showing up and then most people just
left immediately and there was probably about like five to seven of us left afterwards um hanging around the station trying to figure out what's going on um the station itself was actually like stunningly nice oddly enough like there was there was a climbing wall in the train station that as far as I could tell you didn't even have to pay to like you just had to bring your own equipment like ropes and belts because it had like the the things to to Loop into while you're going up
and it like free access climbing wall plants inside super super nice train station so I was like okay well I guess this is going to be the first time I'm like homeless for a night when traveling I kind of because I travel with no plan I kind of thought this would happen eventually but because I travel with no plan I always thought it would be my fault not a train just not showing up um so I'm I'm like legit I'm texting lonus lonus and Emma to be fair I was also texting Emma um but talking about like
the situation that I'm in and genuinely settling in to just like sleep on a bench for the night um because train he was super not thrilled he was like he was like very cranky about this Prospect it was pretty funny now that it's now now that it's yeah any care the main thing that was concerning me about it was that like you know I had my like laptop and stuff with me so okay I'm a pretty deep sleeper too so like okay I'll strap it to me and whatever but someone could just open the
bag um so I was I was not stoked about that um but then I mean realistically the French are more likely to surrender than like take anything from you so they'll drape a big white blanket over you oh my goodness shut up um so okay so they had one worldlord Emperor ever and they never forgot about it they're just going to slip a orange jacket over him  fight you got to stop or else you're going to start another war between the British and the French  one um well at this point I think it
would be the EU versus people that made bad decisions but I don't know um like like leaving the EU the best decision I'm not upset I could have worked anywhere in the EU I'm not upset now he's stuck here we have you forever Dan got him uh um okay so yeah one of the first things I did was like check you know hotels in the area um and I went to two different ones and neither of them had any vacancy so I was like okay I guess I'm screwed I started to settle in and then a a the the the
people that administrated wasn't police officers but like the people that administrate the train station came up and went to go kick everybody out I don't think lonus knows this part of the story um because I was trying to figure out what was going on because I I I was informed I might have just been dumb turns out I wasn't but I was still trying to figure it out but yeah they go to kick us out of the train station I can't understand French so I'm just kind of like standing there watching some of
the guys I was with get in a heated argument with the people that are trying to kick us out because they're like well it's the the Train's fault that we're stuck here so like you shouldn't kick us out the next Train's technically coming in like four hours because the first one in the morning is super early so like just let us sit here for four hours who cares um ultimately they kick us out I tell one of the security guards like okay how do I like contact the train station because I had to buy
another ticket so like how do I get a refund for my one for today and he's like oh it wasn't a train it was a bus I was like what so like I was just stupid standing inside and the bus left behind me or something oh no oh man um and and I'm like well okay all these other people thought it was a train and I thought it was a train like did they just were we all just wrong and he was like yeah I'm like okay well all right so and I'm now being kicked out so I'm like okay it's raining really bad
outside I don't really want to sleep in the rain so I keep trying to find hotels I walk up they're all close but I walk up to one of them and I just stand outside the door for like a while and then eventually somebody comes by and just like opens the door um they had No Vacancy I go do that to another hotel and they had one room left and it was super cheap and actually it was very cheap and it had one of the best like free breakfasts I've ever had anywhere it was super good that checks
out that's for you man um I I was stunned at how good the breakfast was um so I I crashed there for like a few hours and then uh got back to the train station and no the dude that kicked me it was wrong it was a train um so refund which which no I haven't figured that out yet I'll still try to figure it out but that that was actually worse because I spent so long running around trying to find this bus oh oh dude it wasn't a bus so I I was literally like especially as the the
time until departure kept getting closer and closer and closer I was legitimately like sprinting around trying to figure out like where the hell this bus stop is but Google Maps kept insisting like if I looked on Google Maps the line was on the train track yeah so I was like it's got to be the freaking train well it's  bus um but yeah I ended up figuring it out I got on the train and it was fine asks a question that I know the answer to but I feel should be acknowledged uh Uber not a thing over
there uh Uber to the destination that I would have gone to what if I remember correctly was legitimately like $400 yeah so I'm not paying that yeah no chance I know he can afford it but I know he won't pay it yeah that's ridiculous which Emma was was mad at me about she she didn't want me sleeping in the train station when I could have just got that Uber but I was like dude there's no way things are about to get really spicy for a second things are about to get super spicy
because think I think there's going to  relationship you're not even GNA let me finish you mock her you mock her you mock her for not wanting you to sleep in the train station but if she was going to sleep in a train station you 100% would be like no I won't allow it 100% 100% if she didn't want to book it I would have booked it to her location instantaneously there's no chance yeah yeah oh man oh man yeah I know I know I knew the answer before I even started talking I was like there is no way he 
station yeah I mean there's there yeah and there's to be clear this is not just Luke being some kind of manover toxic whatever the f or whatever there's legitimate a far lower chance of Luke being assaulted in you know overnight in some you know remote area with no supervision or whatever it's like actually it is actually like a numbers game that is a very different numbers game for him versus a you know what like 120 soaking wet lady you know yeah I'm sorry Emma if I got that wrong one way or the other
I'm so sorry I have no idea how much you weigh and if I did no because I'd looked that closely I wouldn't admit it in  at uh the only reason why I had no reaction to that is I don't either um so all right perfect then we're good  no I think the question is why does Dan have her number there boom deflected oh oh you both know why should we do some merch messages yeah we should oh man Luke she better not call I hope she's not watching I'm getting texts uh Luke what is a memory that will
always make you laugh from the hacker conference uh the hacker conference that  while you think uh I have a little uh I have a little message from robot at dbrand uh read all 1500 of these comments might be the highlight of the Year everyone in the org super proud uh that was a it was a great video I really enjoy they they really did like roll out the the red carpet or the lights completely off glow-in-the-dark carpet um the the tour really was very self-guided even though obviously like I
wasn't alone in the building like let's have some common sense about it but it was a lot of fun uh it was really cool genuinely really cool to see their operation they really do make actual Goods here in Canada which is a thing that not a lot of companies do um and they run a really clean operation um they've had a few challenges lately which they have acknowledged and have been working really hard to overcome um and they promised us that by the time this launch went up they would have
things smoothed out and it seems like things are are ticking quite a bit better over there in terms of like communication it's been slow communication due to some internal systems changings over and I didn't fully understand what it was because there was a bunch of jargon to do with like crms and management systems that I don't deal with on our side like it's all run by the Creator Warehouse team but I was like I nodded and I was like okay but like it's going to be solved
and they're like yeah we got you I'm like okay um but yeah really fun um they didn't say anything about the ruined vinyl they actually yeah never never brought it up to me I'm sure they think it's funny though um my favorite comment on the video they actually linked me my own comment which is funny uh was to whoever at LTT might actually read this whoever had the idea to film a desk pad product placement in front of D Brand's unreleased stuff and have it be painstakingly blurred by the editor
needs a raise and I'm only partly joking that level of thinking outside the box and being able to look at another company's confidential unreleased stuff and think this is where we film our marketing spot it's perfect is a level of creativity or whatever you call it that can't be taught or trained that was shockingly fantastic 11 out of 10 will watch again in Li of a raise please pass on my admiration if you don't mind Big Mad props and I responded thanks I'll give myself a
raise I've actually I've actually gotten to write a little bit more than usual lately and it's been really fun um I got to do the um uh the uh equinex equinex excuse me I got to do the equinex tour I got to do the dbrand tour um that one's that one wasn't really written the equinix tour was actually written like I did the tour and then I wrote it um and like I never get to do that anymore um and then the dbrand one was mostly just kind of AD libbed and they actually provided a lot
of sort of guidance for what the flow would be but I was just kind of doing my thing um yeah lot of fun and uh I thank you thank you for noticing I also thought it was very funny and thank you to poor editor who had to deal with that thank you all right Luke conference I do have I do have an answer to that so in general it was it was an absolutely amazing conference I plan to go next year it was super fun the people I was with was absolutely amazing um I hope I get to hang out with
the same group next time um but I I don't think it was like particularly noticeably high on humor um so what I'll give my answer as was the loop the the funniest thing to me the whole time I was there I think was the the Tesla Loop thing um we did that I don't think I've talked to lonus about this at all but you know the the tunnel yeah and they had it's just a car on a road right like is it's so stupid it's so dumb it's really cheap which is nice but you know because of how cheap it is they
are absolutely unquestionably losing money on it hand over fist constantly because not only is it just a car on a road uh there's drivers it's not even like automated you actually get in a car with someone else and they drive you through this stupid tiny little Loop thing it's just it's so dumb it could have been you know those like uh I don't actually know what you call them because escalator would would imply you're going up um but those like those flat conveyor built kind of things that they have in
airports that just make you like move faster when you're walking or you can stand on it yeah whatever moving walkway sure they could just have like huge moving walk travelators they're called travelators that is such a cool name I love it that is actually if it's not the real name I don't care that's that's my head Cannon now so they they could have just had a travelator and honestly it would have been fine because you have to wait for your stupid manually driven Tesla to
show up and then you have to like quite legitimately deal with traffic and you have to buy this annoying ticket thing you have to do it through the app I couldn't even buy it because like something something I don't know Canadian so like Theo had to buy my access for me which felt so stupid but thank you Theo um if if there was just like a huge travelator it it would have been fine um it it was actually just like mind-blowingly dumb um to the point where it was fun so I I'll give that as
my answer all right Dan hey lldd thanks for the free shipping making the most of it yeah you are if you had the ability to remaster a product released justifying the additional research and development time what product would you work on ooh remastered product see the thing is I have the resources to remaster something if I  to remastered product man I can't even remember all the products anymore I kind of wish we had a product archive I've seen some customers ask us for it
before and I I I could I could actually really use it whenever people ask me stuff like this um man something that we didn't H rogness says the Christmas album absolutely not people are saying that good try good try good try oh is that what is that why you curated that stupid thing absolutely not that oh yeah for sure for sure for once in my life being honest with you I don't know if I believe you I don't know if I believe you at all um yeah what if what if a remastered
version of the Christmas album existed would you uh I would never acknowledge  son I have started getting my my yearly emails again I get emailed every time a purchase is done on the Forum and that's still the only way we distribute the Christmas album so every every winter I get random like a purchase was made on the form because it was uploaded by my account and how the purchasing system on the Forum works is there's a commission system built in so I get 0% commission every time but
because because it's still technically a commission system even though it's 0 and0 C it emails me every time letting me know congratulations you just made $0 and0 cents oh it's like I gonna get my paycheck come on after all these taxes self-employed was like radicalizing compact disc called you out Luke with the not so subtle telling people how to buy it hey man I'm trying to make you money come on I don't want that money I want people to spend their money on stuff that's good the Christmas 
good um Neds a life says the potato sack hoodie okay sure a remastered potato sack hoodie would be kind of cool like a like sick potato sack hoodie not at all like a like a hint at an upcoming product if you redid the screwdriver you could call it the two driver all right so anyway I need my own Bell I'm gonna need my own Bell ding the Bell that's an order Soldier you you've made nearly five grand on the Christmas album you'll probably pass five grand on the Christmas album this year what do that
uh what does that make me uh so so if if what what what was Platinum is how many records Dan you I think it's like a million okay so then gold would be how "many I don't know 100,000 okay so then" we how far do we have to go down we got silver we got bronze we got wood uh we've got those ex is there like silver "and bronze for of course Gold's 500,000" I'm making jokes Luke for crying out loud I know could I get a cardboard for selling "$5,000 worth of Christmas" album that would be pretty funny
"actually if you did 5,000 then oh hold" on there's there's some other ones say Oro platino uh I think we sold we would have had to sell a thousand units to make "$5,000 so what do you get for a thousand" albums Dan sawdust album deepend sticker album three bucks each it's three bucks each oh okay so we sold like 1300 albums oh so it's it's $3 American though I didn't think about that oh my God it doesn't matter I mean it's the ra anyway  made3 $3 from Spotify plays wow that's
something these sound like participation Awards says smallish potato yes that's the point I don't I don't think that even counts as participating that's just like misclicks it's a it's a margin of error yeah all right okay all right um remastered product I'm going with potato sack hoodie there fine that sounds nice that's a good hoodie uh halfway through a PhD and started watching in seventh grade PhD is on wireless ic's for implantables lonus as a previous user of the Ura ring would
you implant something of the sort what risks affect that choice uh for me the big obstacle to using something like a smart band is dealing with taking it on and off and charging it so if it was something that I could just implant and it could like charge itself off my body heat or something I yeah yeah I think I would I mean as long as it's made out of like you know medical grade steel or you know something glass or something inert I assume glass is kind of inert I I'd be I
yeah i' I'd be pretty into it I mean we were before the co lockdown thing happened we were planning a road trip down to somewhere in Seattle to get um RFID things in our fingers like we were all going to do it we were going to make a video about it I'm I'm I'm into it I don't know that I do like serious augmentation you know assuming that like a you know bionic eye that could come out and see behind me was available tomorrow I don't know that I would do that but I think that something like an
implantable health monitor or something seems pretty innocuous like hot glue a mirror to your shoulder there you go implantables rauw asks do we have your permission to Pirate the Christmas album oh my God absolutely not because you shouldn't be listening to it it's not about the money or not money why would you even say its name it's about the fact that nobody should listen to it it's terrible all right it's it's that that nobody should listen to it thing it's true because it's it's actually so
Angelic that it's it's not made for human con too it's too good uh Nick says uh we're going to build a product archive when the new site comes online so that's cool and he also says don't oversell the socks before they're actually for sure you numpty I was talking about the socks earlier whatever I think they're promising they're promising I'm excited okay hello wanted to slowly buy a new computer and buy used over the next year what do I need to know and what sorry what
do I do to know how and what I'm buying is working is it worth it for a higher nend PC builds no you should never buy a part that you don't have something to plug it into because that part will only depreciate well I mean okay there's the Tariff thing but um in general not not technically always true but it's a pretty good general rule yeah but what you should do is should take your loonies that's what we call a dollar here in Canada because whatever you should take your loonies and you should
put them somewhere where they are safe and will not be spent and then when you have enough loonies you should buy it in one Fell Swoop that's the way to do it what about Rising inflation um Dan fine you take your loonies you put them in an appreciating asset class and then you hope that it appreciat it's at the same rate as I don't know the point is just that I am pretty sure that the inflationary devaluation of your Looney is going to be less of an issue than the um the march of progress
devaluing the parts that you buy give it six months but the whole naming behind a looney is pretty straightforward it's not that hard to grasp yes I know it's a loon on it it's got a bird on it I know why it's called a looney put a bird on it all right enough bird bird up lonus who is the most famous person you've ever met sincerely an Aussie who is now broke but at least not due to shipping that's a big amount say yourself do it um do it no no well okay I don't I don't know if I met Paris Hilton but I
complained about her and she was there in person being mean to somebody across the room does not count as meeting them I don't know I I that could account right what is that even well look I was no I  there because because because I was at a BMW event they literally sponsored me to be there and make a video about their event and when I asked to go in the concept car they were like no nobody's allowed in the concept car and I'm like Paris Hilton is in it right now while you're telling me that nobody's
allowed to be in it if she can go in it then I can go in it I'm literally paid to be here by you help help me help you so like she was she was right there that I don't think I don't think that counts as met though that counts as scen I don't think it counts as well I saw her yeah that's what I'm saying you saw her I interacted by proxy with her you are by proxy not as important as her you didn't get to sit in the car okay I uh I attended a seminar given by Chris Jenner did you meet them or did you
witness them uh there was only a couple hundred of us there small seminar shake hands did you did you talk to her though like did you did you no what I'm saying is is there got no I got an answer I got an answer I know I'm just messing with I obviously know I didn't meet those people uh probably the most famous person that I have met is NVIDIA CEO Jensen Hong and he might not be famous in the way that we think of like Fame famous uh but he is very famous um especially now that Nvidia has become
the world's most valuable company and like Jim Kramer's talking about him and everyone's talking about him he's very four five years ago but I fully agree now yeah yeah I don't think I I don't man see this is embarrassing because I always forget like I think I have met a handful of like real celebrities um I have met Mr Beast I guess that's valid but I kind of don't count YouTubers um so I've met lots of famous YouTubers I met Mark Rober you know he's real famous but like when I say when you
say Fame I mean outside of a niche when you are literally the the CEO of the world's most valuable company that's a different kind of Fame that's household name Fame the best word I guarantee you more people know Mr Beast name than Jensen Hong somebody in the Zeitgeist but but but I would say a wider variety of people and actually I don't even know if that's true Luke because Jensen hang's Fame is international I suspect most Chinese people don't give two sh about Mr Beast I suspect most there's a very vast
amount of people that don't give two shits about Jensen Hong or Nvidia or even stocks that know who Mr Beast is and I'm not just saying because they're kids um I'm saying like income situations where that's just honestly irrelevant to you um would still know who Mr Beast is that's fair people are saying Dead Mouse I don't think dead mouse is more famous than any of the people we talking about but I've definitely met  yeah I can't think of uh I can't think of shortcut I think you're underselling
YouTube shortcut says Mr Beast isn't a niche but also kind of is like the thing is most of the people I interact with in my daily life do not know who Mr Beast  adults yeah I mean the the Mr Beast squid game thing got over 300 million views didn't it yeah I know but there's a lot of people in the world there's definitely a lot more than 300 million people that have a GPU I'll promise you that like there's there's levels of mainstream I would say Paris Hilton is a  Jens like I I guarantee you I know
people that are into Tech that despite nvidia's recent Su success don't know who Jensen Wong is I just to be clear I'm not arguing Jensen is more famous than Mr Beast I'm just saying I don't really count YouTube Fame because I see it as I see it as like uh like big fish small pond and it's a pretty damn big small pond at this point it's a huge small pond so I was wrong the squid game video doesn't have 300 million views it has uh 672 million views it's absolutely huge absolutely huge but you can watch
that video without knowing or caring who   did yeah that's probably true so it's but I think way more people use Nvidia products without knowing who the CEO is than watch a Mr Beast video that is hosted by Mr Beast and don't know who Mr Beast is yeah that's yeah that's totally fair I'm just saying there's different kinds of Fame I consider YouTube Fame a little less famous than than a like a barrier breaking Fame right like for sure no I agree I agree Mr Beast has a lot more
views on YouTube than Paris Hilton but I would say that she is more from a conventional standpoint famous than Mr Beast because it's just a name that everyone knows whether they watch simple life or not you just know who she is the daughter of the Hilton Fortune because everyone knows what a Hilton hotel is like there's just there's different kinds of Fame is that a generational thing though because like we know her but I don't think she's talked about in any circles very much
anymore is she still a DJ she's she comes up every once in a while she comes up once in a while um and but you're right she definitely had uh she definitely had a moment but she's more in the background now and so yeah no you're right she was big for Our Generation for sure I just don't think she is anymore that's fair enough uh Porto asks is Seth Curry more famous than Jensen Mr Beast absolutely not um no anyone who is like other than other than I would say football um and by
football I mean soccer other than soccer I'd say if you're in an American sport League you absolutely cannot be like worldwide famous not really there will be Pockets where that Sport's really popular like they might know a famous baseball player in Japan for example uh but it's American the fact that America calls their Sports championships World Series and stuff is like an actual joke outside of America like we think you guys are really funny for doing that because most people elsewhere do not
give a like India's watching Cricket not um actually I think basketball might be pretty big there but the point is just that they they don't have the kind of penetration outside of the US that you might think my wife loves all the women's products she wants to know how uh she wants to know thoughts on Great Gatsby on Broadway you saw a few months ago it is so good she's followed it very closely it's so good oh my God it's so good it's like what maybe the best play I've ever seen maybe the best it's so 
good gripping performances beautiful music I love it when purchasing a mystery screwdriver do you actually try to mix the colors when possible or just grab whatever um when are we getting ratchet at fidget toys uh I don't know if the fidget toys is ever going to happen at this point but um as for mixing colors these are not mystery in the sense that they have all the like different random colors of the rainbow it's mystery in that it's one of our screwdriver SKS like it could
be retro or noctua or a regular one and you get what you get longtime listener firsttime caller I'm a foreign medical graduate but haven't taken my exams because reasons what are some tips you have for staying the course and finishing what you you started well as someone who never finished my degree you are definitely  question that's someone who also never finished third degree uh but I think lonus and I can both talk about this outside of just education stuff um I think you have to forget about
motivation motivation is only good to start doing something um it will not keep you doing something you have to use other systems whatever that is determination will whatever you want to use sure um but but motivation isn't isn't going to keep you doing something forever you have to find a different thing find new motivation yeah I think that's really good advice learn to love the work hey lldd do you think industrial design the field still has its influence in one mobile tech two hom Tech and like
it did a decade ago sort of like the LG Wing sliding and folding phones I mean yeah industrial design absolutely still has some fun influence I mean um just because Apple ships the kind of the same brick shaped phone every year doesn't mean that other uh other companies are doing that I mean that that hway trifold for all of the disastrous launch it might have had um is definitely a new thought an exciting thought um and it came from a from a designer's pen at some point you know someone had to
someone had to go okay was someone had to have a reason to engineer that you know um as for as for Home Tech absolutely I think if anything our home Tech um and I think a category that exemplifies this really well is speakers our homech looks so much better today than it did a decade ago like you can have a really nice speaker setup in a room that is like stealthy like it Blends right in I I love it I'm super  that Sebastian in the chat in float plane says uh as an industrial designer
yes um so he he works for Creator Warehouse if you guys didn't see his AMD ultimate Tech upgrade uh it's really good it's really good the table the table he made is beautiful all those pens you're buying is him he also helped me design the table for my uh MCM upgrade thing too sick hey dlll big howdy from Japan that is in Congress uh with so much talk online lately about Microsoft strategy with the Xbox brand I'm curious about your opinions on it and what would you do differently man it
really just seems like they're in a transition phase right now you know on the one hand they're a traditional game console maker on the other hand they're a software company like a multi-platform software company on the other hand they're like a cloud streaming gaming service provider on the other hand they're a like a a non-streaming games as a service provider I and it just kind of feels like they have they have a finger in every one of these pots all at once whereas you know companies like Nintendo
have maintained their laser focus on one thing and it seems to be pretty helpful I think Xbox as a brand is in kind of a rough place right now like it used to be Playstation Xbox was one of the the Fanboy fights of the for the ages and I just don't see a lot of fight in the Xbox side right now there doesn't seem to be a compelling reason to be a fan of Xbox um yeah they just seem really confused about the direction yeah I am Campbell just they will always be very confused about the direction yeah I I I
would like to see them commit I'd like them I'd like to see them figure out what the heck they are like is every Windows PC and Xbox and if that's the case then you need to make the Xbox gaming experience way better on the Windows PC like why why are handheld such a clunky experience today when you guys have all of this deep deep knowledge and experience building great user interfaces the Xbox has a really intuitive user interface it's pretty darn good um let's see you guys you know
take that take that power and bring it to the PC and I understand all the reasons it won't happen it's it comes down to piracy right it comes down to anti-cheating piracy but um I don't know I'm rooting for them I hope to see them solve it as a as a PC Gamer turn 360 degrees and turn away hey lldd love the show and love the free shipping deal as an Australian fan I have a cutie OLED TV like lonus has what's the best or recommended way to clean your TV screen without causing
damage a little bit of water and a microfiber cloth and if there's any like grease on it or whatever from fingerprints then a little bit of water  patience hello DLo I teach math and I'm flabbergasted when my students don't know how to submit their work as a PDF our or kiddo's lack of computer Basics is worrisome what do you recommend I do to remedy this oh dude I don't even know I um that that article recently um what was it on was it on the Atlantic I can't remember um about how kids are arriving
in college having never read an entire novel a book um there was a follow-up article that I was I was in the middle of reading today and then I got distracted so I'm glad we're close to the end of w show so I can remember I can go read it but basically I don't I don't know what we're supposed to do about this like yeah people don't know how to troubleshoot they don't have basic computer skills they don't know how to it's not that they don't know how to read they know how to read but they don't know how to
sit and read and um I don't know maybe maybe books are outdated but like I can't  more man how do I say this I can't video's great but nothing works as a reference material the way that reading does um and not having that skill not having that ability to parse written word is scary this is this is a very large part of I we were talking earlier about the social media ban in Australia this is a very large part of why I'm so supportive of it um is I think you know the world being super connected and
information being at our fingertips and all that kind of stuff is generally a good I think I think there's a lot of good content on the internet I would like to think that we make good stuff but yeah it's also built to be the platforms are generally built to be all consuming um and the level of I know it's a it's a just a term right now but it's real the level of brain rot that you can get from just sitting and losing your entire day your entire week your entire year just pouring into Tik Tok or
whatever else it is having absorbed nothing because you're your brain is just mildly observing um the most brain rot quick garbage content it possibly can um and then moving on is is not good for people learning the ability to to get absorbed into a particular piece of content like being able to sit and read and enjoy that is actually a good thing because it's I don't know the the second you're stuck in scenario where you don't have your phone um having people like genuinely fall into some amount of a
panic because their brain is so used to this constant insanely high level of stimulation is just bad like there's there's no way around that that is terrible you are setting yourself up to be absolutely controlled by whatever corporate interest feels like controlling you at any particular point in time and that's just a bad idea um and exposing kids to that super early on I don't think is good but anyways gwi says if you're a teacher and your students don't know how to do a thing
that you need them to do then teach them how but you missed the part where they're a math teacher like there's only so much that so much power we have as individuals and you can't control what kids are doing at home um I think that I think that simultaneously teachers are given less and less resources and more and more expected job  right I'm sorry f fasel fisel um I got nothing for you and I have uh I have the same concerns that you do hey dll with the coming Advent of
smart glasses with cameras how will they be handled on the Privacy side bringing them into bathrooms locker rooms recording with phones is obvious glasses is not it's going to be a big problem it's going to be a huge problem recording with phones is also not obvious um and this is already a huge issue um and I think this is the same type of problem that we had I'm going to relate this in a really weird way but like um when when people become no I'm actually going to skip that because it's
not very good but when people become complacent about something it becomes a security issue um if someone's like waiting for a stall in a bathroom and they just have their phone out and they're just you know scrolling through news articles or whatever you're not going to be concerned about it when phones were first a Thing If you pulled it out of your pocket at all in a bathroom people would freak out maybe I'm old fashioned noer thing still makes me uncomfortable I never take out my
phone in the bathroom and I expect other people not to yeah but they do I would avoid them most people are chill with it sorry I would avoid them if they do like I I yeah I mean that's fair that's fair and if it's kind ofed at me I would I would ask them not to but I don't know maybe that's just me totally I just I think culturally I'm not saying it's a good thing or that people should have I'm just overall culturally I think most people have moved on from that um and I
mean you can have it in your pocket with like the top slightly sticking out like I think people have become less concerned about the backs of phones pointing at them um and there's no indication that a phone is recording yeah yeah that's a good point a lot of other devices we talk about it but the phone no  just going to be a thing um I think in general the world is moving towards um stalls with more proper doors as as an interesting side effect so this might be less of a problem yeah
I'd like to see that more change rooms with private changing spaces I don't really understand why that wasn't a thing in the first place I've never been super into just like seeing a bunch of like guy bums yeah like it's it's as much not wanting to look at anyone else as it is uh not being particularly stoked on just like dropping trout with a bunch of strangers but I never did team sports so  it yeah um having done team sports doesn't bother me but I absolutely understand why it would bother people um
and I have never understood why I in some situations I understand is a cost-saving measure um yeah but in a lot of places it's like no you definitely have the money for this it shouldn't have been a big deal  know l l and D are right we need more tall stuff yes yes yes you're going to carry one of these every week uh no yeah oh all right this is it's not related to that uh what's your favorite part of the dbrand torque did you see anything cool or have a takeaway that could be used to improve Creator
Warehouse workflows I mean I leave it to the Creator Warehouse team to figure out the workflow stuff but uh I think the coolest thing was probably the art stations so um the the the pickers and Packers have a designated time every day certain amount of the day that they art they do arts and crafts um I don't know I thought that was I thought that was pretty cool stop reading into every merch message that I curate they don't I'll have an agenda you I noticed you didn't say that
a lot of them don't have an agenda but sure carry on well the people who are submitting them probably have an agenda uh Hey last one I got for you here fine hey ldt I'm glad to finally get a scribe driver question for lonus do you find the steam deck or Ally to hurt your right hand wrist when using the right stick mine get so sore no but I also didn't have trouble with the switch so maybe I just have robust wrists um ah yeah no team back an ally no I can't I can't say that it's been an
issue for me um you could try a case there are some cases that alter the ergonomics a little bit that's an option and I think an option that we have now is to call it thank you guys so much for tuning in to the W show we'll see you again next week same terrible timing same bad channel oh one second Luke's computer froze we we can't say there you go yeah we can hear you okay hear me oh it's it's still frozen on my end but I guess you can hear me so good timing see you guys bye
