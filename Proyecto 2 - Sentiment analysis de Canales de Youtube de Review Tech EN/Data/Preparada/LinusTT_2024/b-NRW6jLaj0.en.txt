have you seen this ad before a CO2 detector shaped like a bird well we wanted to check it out so we bought it let's see what's inside birdie comes with a USBC to a cable where's the wall wart the screw and the wall mount and of course the star of the show the birdie itself that USBC cable is for charging the birdie because it can last up to 6 months on a single battery charge so once you have it set up if it detects low air quality like in a closed room for example it'll drop de oh hey look at
that it happened right on Q letting you know that you might need to open up a "window it needs to be above 1,000 PPM" for about 10 minutes before it'll fall over but why a bird have you ever heard of the phrase Canary and a coal mine since canaries would show distress in high CO environments they would either faint or signaling miners that they needed to evacuate now this is a CO2 detector which is not nearly as damaging as carbon monoxide but opening a window and getting fresh air is still important at
$190 at least it's cute
