go  Welcome Friends to to fast topc did I say too fast I meant two random to PC inspired by roll for sandwich from Adventures in ardia I am once again building a PC with absolutely no idea what will be inside it these agents of fate or dice as I like to call them are the real bosses today and because I am contractually obligated to sell this machine for  video I hope they're feeling kind thankfully for my weak heart there are a couple of ways that I can Veer this bus back onto the road first I can earn
rolling with Advantage which means that I roll two dice and pick the better outcome but this comes at the cost of spinning the the wheel of pain which includes giving away discount codes for half off anything at LT store.com uh okay oh my God what are all these things wet socks uh okay or oh God I'm allowed one rroll but I have to eat a dried Carolina Reaper what is your problem I don't want to do that um I might need to though because the  "$20,000 ha but it could also cost you"
less than $500 oh I like that well one way or another there is one thing that can take a little bit of the sting off our sponsor grammarly at lonus Media Group we're committed to getting these videos out to all of you which involves communication coordination and a lot of writing that's where grammarly comes in they're an AI writing partner that works where we work which is great because we use a ton of different platforms and upgrading to grammarly premium has saved our business team even more time thanks
to useful features like tone suggestions this ensures that the tone of your writing is never too formal or too friendly it's not what you say but how you say it tone matters now we can tell Linus to stop dropping things so often without being rude plus with grammarly premium's app actions feature the business team team can easily get all of their work done in one sitting without needing to constantly switch tabs to get things done sign up and upgrade to  lt05 and I guess the first thing I'm
doing is our case yeah I do not understand the game yet so we're going to have to count on games master David to guide me through this a little bit I can see a few things from myself we have a variety of cases including our Star Trek Picard Borg cubes s White Edition with a value of $600 the Aza overdrive which looks like something between a space ship and like a weird VL aircraft an AAC cast 808 that has a gowing top panel the dark where the devil did you find this that's from that ancient candy
shop themed uh uh Tech Showdown episode that is absolutely fantastic we've got EVGA DGA are we allowed to give it are we're allowed to give it away I thought EVGA needed it back nope oh that oh you want that one this case is so cool it has built-in like front VR HDMI stuff and all kinds of cool stuff like that we've got the height y70 touch we have the very dirty CM Stormtrooper from the PS5 killer video and finally the game km cylinder case for two there's two there oh my my God if you roll a natural one
you get the mining rig SL shelf from the tech shop wow it's very shelfy there's wait wait there's one more case over there there's another case and that's the 10 "no oh no did your 10 did your $20,000" worst case scenario include this yes okay this is a really really special piece this is the Le and Lee pc6 yacht case and according to our Logistics Department uh we shouldn't get rid of this because it is one of only 500 made and the last one that sold on eBay was a couple of years ago and went for over
"$10,000 uh it's also Mini ITX so if we" get this one um we have a different path of stuff oh we have a completely different path for the hardware that's going to have to go in it oh I really don't want to lose the Odyssey all right so I need a 10-sided die for this one then right correct and what do I have to do if I want to roll with Advantage spin the wheel I have to spin the wheel and there's some challenges there's some punishments okay all kinds of stuff well  what we are not going to spin the wheel
I am going to trust the Fate to be kind to me today Glenn if you're trying to capture this role I'm going to aim for here there's your there's your okay all right here we go eight I wasn't paying attention to oh that's the oh well that's a fun one yeah good this will be a sick build we are going to be building in the oh God that's heavy in the Aza overdrive with a value of $600 which is pretty good for you actually because some of these cases were missing a lot of their hardware and
probably weren't really that practical whereas this I don't even know if we ever built in this thing I think this was just featured in that weird cases video okay there's a couple of other things that we're going to do kind of quickfire here we need to figure out exactly what kind of a platform we're building so I guess our next role is going to be CPU games master David wandered away though so I guess I'm kind of on my own here I'm going to go with an advantage role using the wheel of
pain and we're going to find out what that's going to cost me David did you make these up I made them up this has a very David flavor to it oh it does doesn't it if it's a challenge and you lose you get disadvantage what which means you roll two dice and we pick the worst result you didn't even tell me that I'm telling  now okay uh Mental Math okay Mental Math you have 30 seconds would you do this to  okay two questions okay I well if it's mental do I get to do I get to look at
it no that looks like really big numbers no no it's fine the biggest number is three digits uh okay let me start all right I'm ready I get 30 seconds okay hold on let me put on my uh I need a thinking cap we got an LTT store.com hat anyone any uh I don't see any all right fine no I'm over I'm over it okay you ready oh Chase has got one yeah you got one of the old dad it's okay nice okay okay thinking cap this is so appropriate too we've got the automagically cap and I just want to remind everyone if he
fails it's rolling with disadvantage okay's trying to capture this so try not to leave it around okay I got this three two one oh I do get to see it oh yeah you get to see it uh okay uh uh uh okay so in Brackets we ignore the order of operations thing with the the thing so so 900 + 9 is 99 / 9 which is1 nice next one oh no I have to do more than one yep go go go go go come on hell you get another 10s are there in what in 11 12 of a day in in 2 hours 120 10 seconds F this shouldn't count okay
there isn't the last one oh you got it oh yeah you did it good job l sorry I was looking at the clock oh my goodness hey you get Advantage you guys are stressing me out here okay we don't have two dice actually we do uh all right cool a we're doing uh motherboard stuff all right I've got yeah so no uh CPU CPU or CPU and motherboard are together oh they're together because oh wow well let's talk about some of the options that we might have here on the lower end we've got oh wow an Athlon 200
g with some gigabyte microatx board total value of 160 bucks you're getting two whole processing cores wow sorry Dan did I peek there I was I was too excited I got really excited oh uh here you can have your hat back Chase um sorry Colin all right okay number two you get a Crosshair five formula and amd's highest clocked processor I think ever the f X 9590 that bad boy hit 5 GHz and the performance still sucked truly remarkable remarkable piece of engineering uh if you roll a three you
get a prime X 299 Deluxe and an Intel 6950x 10 cores not particularly fast cores by today's standards but you do get 10 of them we step up to an 8700k in number fourth place you get a five you get an what is this oh weird this is is a an matx board but it's the skinny chicken matx board that I've ever seen and it looks like it has a mobile chip soldered to it with their own designed heat spreader on it or something what the what the devil is going on with this thing that is wild
the pull star this ain't your this ain't your Rich uncle's pull star 0 to 60 ain't going to be quite what his is uh number six is a 12 600k oh my goodness so if we end up anywhere in the top half you are getting a sick gaming rig number seven is an 11 900k number eight is it so once we get to the last three then you can still once you choose a motherboard there's three CPUs you can roll oh so you could get an msib 550 board but you could end up with anywhere from a quad core ryen 3 to a 12 core
ryzen 9 all right and in the last two man you get either a top-of-the-line AMD system ryzen 7000 or a top-of-the-line Intel system with a 12 13th or 14th Gen processor all right I'm ready so I get to roll two 10-sided dice uh Glenn where do you want it you want it right here  go okay seven and six so you get six huh well hold now hold on a second with seven I've got the higher end board here so that's going to cost me 160 bucks and I've got the higher-end but but older generation
CPU oh that's a tough choice in terms of what I'd rather give away I might actually rather the older chip rather than the newer but supposedly lesser platform yeah this is this is only an eight core CPU and okay four of these are e cores but that's that's a that's a 10 core CPU you know what you are getting an 11 900k and an NZXT N7 N7 z590 actually not a bad little combo not a bad little combo okay we're going to put this next to our case and I guess now we get to roll for our Ram is that right yes so
that's a DDR five platform or four uh ooh depends what this board is I guess I didn't ask ddr4 ddr4 so we're rolling our ddr4 stack which is four-sided dice those are your four options all right do I want to do I should I do another challenge yeah let the chat decide yeah yeah yeah do punishments you're not the one who gets to decide that the chat gets to decide that all right let me get let me get my float plane chat up here what do you guys think hope you guys are enjoying
the stream so far by the way if you're just tuning in now it's roll for PC the sequel so far we have rolled the Aza overdrive a $600 case and an 11900 k and a z590 motherboard from NZXT so we are up in the neighborhood of around "$11,000 cost for a system that I have to" sell for two things can still get they can't really get better can they because we can only go higher above what I'm selling it for but they could get a lot worse they say do it do it do it do it do it do it yeah
chat H all right you know float plane chat I thought we were cool I thought we were chill I thought you were my friends my my my paid or my paying friends uh you know all of my relationships seem to revolve around money um I need friends oh discount hey oh a discount so we have so I get a I get a discount on the items that I have to pick no we're giving a discount on LTT store.com and the first one we're giving a discount on LTT store yeah so if you're watching the stream you can go on LTT
store.com you can buy any screwdriver and get one bit set for free you have to add the screwdriver in the bits of the cart then apply code uh please ensure this is communicated I'm communicating it now and there's unlimited uses for the duration of the stream okay that's that's not too bad there's three and they get much worse or better for you oh yeah cuz that seemed like just like a promo like I'm fine with that you guys want to get a screwdriver go for it oh yeah yeah wa wait wait the code oh might
need that is uh random bits random bits all one word all one words capital R and B but I don't know if that matters probably not all right okay that's not so bad oh no discount is on here a lot there's three I see okay so you get anywhere from a single 8 gig stick no dual channel for you to a dual 8 gig 3600 kit to a 4X 8 gig but slightly lower higher latency okay you 32 gigs wow or if you get a four you get a Vengeance RGB 64 gig kit that's like super fast and low latency and all that
good stuff or actually no decent speed not super high speed that's is this ddr4 this must be the ddr4 that's fine we'll find that's the one R you want to roll right there all right let's go ahead and roll it now a a a clarifying point for oh three wait hold hold on don't you want to do a challenge yeah I I I I I I did do it oh yeah so I we only have one force out of die so just roll it twice  one oh I feel kind of bad but like that's the rule man this cost me only 20 bucks and I I I I did technically do the
challenge you know what though you know what I'm not going to I'm not going to cheese it I'm not going to cheese it a free bit set on a screwdriver I'm not going to cheap out on you I want you to get a decent system we're going to take the 4X 8 gig kit however however with a caveat if we have any trouble getting this quad stick kit to boot then I am immediately going to bail on it and we're going back to the single stick of Viper 3200 all right deal deal deal yeah I mean I don't know
if you're talking to me with the chat yeah no I I I I I here I'm going to take my dice here yeah please all right is there anything else that we need to do now you had wanted us to do a cooler Co we should do cooler because we might end up with something incompatible and if that's the case then it could be trouble you know what I don't mind this wheel that much I'm actually kind of liking the wheel but there is one of the rules that I wanted to clarify a little bit David okay for the pepper roll yeah do I
have to decide ahead of time if I want to be allowed to roll it and I have to eat a Pepper or do I get to roll a die and go no I need to roll this I you get you get to roll it and then eat the pepper and I will eat the pepper with you so you don't feel sock quite soone wow what a guy I did it yesterday to make sure that I wasn't going to kill you I still might kill you I see uh excellent okay well let's have a look at our options here we get anything from a stock cooler not much to
say about this other than hey at least you can turn the computer on I mean given we ended up with what was it an 119 100K you might be able to turn the computer on so uh good luck with that uh to a Cooler Master hyper 212 Evo yeah should be should be should be uh we've got an assassin x120 uh yeah this is I mean this is a great cooler actually really good for the price the fact that it's only 20 bucks is kind of mindblowing we've got a noctua uh oh yeah nhu12s dck also a really nice cooler a little
pricier but you know hey I guess the not to a brand name carries some a bit of a premium we've got a dark rockite uh for a 100 bucks from be quiet and we've got an NHD 15 also for $100 so I am going to be selling this computer for $2 and for the cooler itself I will be spending anywhere from $0 which we lied before David I can end up not going up in terms of the cost anywhere from zero dollar to a 100 and I'm Gonna Roll the wheel of pain which so far hasn't hurt me that badly but uh discount okay
oh you didn't wait this did you no are you sure I don't want just discounts I wanted to Pepper them up throughout yeah that's fair second discount code is free shipping worldwide any quantity of items it's limited to the first 100 uses though any quantity any quantity of item one per person one per person I'm not how sure that works you can only make one order one order I didn't make these okay that one's really expensive that's like costing way more than the computer only 100 uses do you have any
idea how much shipping to like freaking Europe costs we're about to find out aren't we the code for that get ready only only 100 uses of this random free ship again random free ship all one word okay uh first letter is  punishment you get Advantage now uh oh man I've got the thing where I actually have kind of a headache that one that one was really expensive normally even if we do a crazy free shipping promo we uh we limit it to like orders over a certain value so we
have some hope whatsoever of making back um some of the shipping cost on the on the product margin all right I got a four and a two I mean honestly those are both pretty good coolers you get a hyper 212 for 20 bucks or you get a um a noctua noctua version uh for 50 bucks I'm not feeling particularly charitable so I guess you get the hyper 212 Evo uh realistically this is going to be this is going to be fine for an 11 900k and that should have no compatibility shouldn't have any
compatibility issues should work fine all right do I get to build computer for a little bit here or I think you should answer some merch messages or I have a feeling there's going to be some merch messages given that we just gave away  orders really are we not doing merch messages today we are we just don't have any to curate everybody's just like free shipping wo free bits set thank you get wck lonus Long Live David that's it thanks for the free shipping thanks lus that's fair enough
be good to give away Linus's money I got to say this reminds me of that old show on Comedy Central WI Ben Stein's Money oh yeah where the host would actually have his own money at stake is at least the premise of the show I don't know if I ever actually confirmed that he legitimately had his own money on the line it's certainly a really cool idea for a for a uh for a bit for the show but uh it seems kind of hard to believe maybe if you guys know if anyone in chat knows if benstein actually had his own money
on the line for the show that would be uh that' be pretty cool to know I'm going to go get my laptop so I've got chat I mean I guess this is kind of a regular PC Building stream as well we've got our motherboard here which uh I haven't played around with NZXT boards much to be perfectly honest with you but it looks really nice this is going to be a sick looking machine and act oh no David we may actually run into a comp compatibility issue oh the cooler uh I don't know if there's enough height
clearance we can we in this the NAA will fit what you can't just you can't just take away my advantage I should get to take away your discount code then I'll take hot sauce no it's not my discount code it's our discount code thank you comrade David I'll do I'll do hot sauce I think the deal I was going to make no this isn't going to fit either oh that's not the small one I have a smaller one it's a height issue but we have 11 900k oh no we're going to put we're going to put we're going to uh uh oh man
uh we we may need to put an aiio in it I think that might be the only option okay uh I can go get one hold on hold on hold on I mean it's the random PC We Can't Break The Rules true I think we might just  uh you know what want get the angle grinder from 105 I don't make the rules I don't make the R I literally I'm not making the rules today so I think I think the hyper 212 has to go in there uh let's get the CPU in the socket first and then things are about to get extremely interesting uh let's make sure
there's no bent pins in here or anything like that no that all looks good to me make sure our pads on this chip are clean man this is going to be a really weird machine so you're going to have a great CPU you're going to have a motherboard that at least looks good I don't know anything about the performance of the N7 z590 from NZ XT it's going to have this sick looking armor on it it's going to have a really janky cooling solution and it's going to have anywhere from I think it was uh 32
gigs of ram in this kit whoops I put these in backwards uh 32 gigs of ram in this kit to just8 gigs if this kit  how you guys doing float plane chat how you doing YouTube chat you guys enjoying the stream so far today I fix it yeah I fix it is not going to be the kinds of tools that we need in order to uh make that thing fit so good luck everybody I think my float plane chat actually isn't updating now I think that was from before the stream even started oh interesting no no I
figured out my problem I'm not on the live tab there we go all right I've got live float plane chat now oh oh and I've got live audio all right CPU motherboard and RAM installed let's go ahead and pop this over to I don't know um Chase do you mind making a a pile of that or something there hey there we go all right let's map this out and figure out exactly what our options are for making this cooler fit in this case so it looks like our motherboard orientation is going to be oh what
Oh weird see I was kind of expecting just based on the dimensions of the motherboard tray it was going to kind of go in this way and then I was like no wait what about the io no the io is going to be at the back and it's going to go in a little something like this meaning our cooler is like right under here oh boy now I see some thumb screws I see some uh oh I don't actually have my screwdriver on me how embarrassing uh may I please have my tech saac it's just in the main pouch there yay thank you I
see some thumb screws here but they're all so tight from the factory that I can't undo any of them but I don't know if the frame itself is going to interfere with us putting a cooler there what's kind of neat about this case though is it looks like pretty much everything is assembled with screws I don't think I see a single rivet on this thing so conceivably we could excuse me we could kind of rip off a bunch of pieces from this side of the case and we could just make it fit
oh or you could just never close the door I mean that's an option right will that help though that they look oh I see you're going to take that part of the frame off oh yeah oh yeah bud no you know what I'm actually feeling pretty good about this I think we're in good shape so you're just going to have like a like a a one-sided drop top PC the the convertible PC except I don't know who David here's a tough question do we ship them the rest of the hardware or do they just get what they
get I think we should ship them the rest cuz if we keep it it's literally waste all right We Will We Will We Will Ship the rest of the hardware to whoever buys the PC do we have uh any Allen keys because I may need some Allen keys in order to take this apart enough to get that cooler on there did he say how to be eligible to buy the computer I I don't think we have yet but it's going to be up on LTT store.com and uh you know what I don't want to say anything because I might say the wrong
thing we've definitely had some ways of handling limited quantity item purchases in the past uh when we did uh the verified actual gamer program for example we had people play a game and the first one to complete the game was able to purchase it uh we've had ones where we just kind of put it up at a random time on the store and the only way to get it is to just kind of be lucky enough to be on the store at that time so it's really going to depend I sincerely doubt that these are going to
be Imperial I suspect these are going to be metric do I have a oh I have a uh I do have a metric set as well y I've got it uh well it's definitely metric but this Imperial hex definitely fits so mission accomplished no I'm I'm going to I'm going to grab the proper metric one uh Dan do you have any merch messages for me yet I do I have a couple here let's see what we have uh thank you Linus for sacrificing your wallet and Sanity for entertainment uh these are all curated they're not supposed to be where are
they there we go would you ever consider having an LTX in the UK for the British audience let me put it this way uh LTX is on Perma temporary Perma Hiatus right now because the economics of it among other reasons the economics of it just couldn't be made to make sense that was when we were doing it locally um doing something like that in the UK I think would be extremely challenging we have plans we hope to run a series of like um like land SL orts SL gaming events here in Vancouver at the hopefully at the
Badminton Center but depending on how our negotiations go with the city of Suri that may or may not happen so if you happen to be a Sur resident and you happen to want to see gaming events uh here in our in our fine City then uh now is as good a time as any to express that in some way that makes sense to you if things get dire and you know like we do have some meetings lined up with them and I'm I'm still hopeful that as long as you know everyone's approaching this in good faith and you know trying to
together that we can get something done um and if things get more dire though I'll definitely get more specific about what you can do to support our efforts uh this is extremely janky so in order to get this one off I have to undo this which undoes the front fan like this is all one piece so here's what we're going to do we're going to try we're we're going to try and keep this piece in David how the devil do they expect you to put a GPU in this thing does it come with a riser I have a
riser cable what is this case I can look in the the box I brought it back so that we oh yeah no it comes with one yeah it's got a riser so we just got to figure out where that GPU goes and we've also got to figure out where the devil our Hardware is are we supposed to have any hardware for it ah it's probably in the Box wow what a unique case let's see if we're going to be able  here sure I'm glad I picked the lower profile of the two I think the hyper 212 is ever so slightly um smaller no I think it's
actually about the same size as the nhu whatever whatever it was that we were looking at okay oh oh oh this is close brother this is this is some borderline stuff right here are you guys seeing this okay here's what I'm going to do here's what I'm going to do I'm going to put uh can you take this one off yeah I'm going to put this thumb screw back in here here we go here we go yeah no no no we're going to make it David we're GNA make it we're going to make it till we break it we're going to
break yeah breakage is definitely a guarantee for the system uh let's see if I can get this lined up uh David I might need to lean on you to help get this screw back in because I think my angle is not great and I think uh watching me try to struggle with it is not going to be that entertaining for the people so uh good luck with that all right cool let's get oh wow uh it's a used cooler I I don't know if we had mentioned that but the cooler is in fact um quite having been definitely
used before uh Glenn are you on the closeup generally oh yeah there we go there you go Dan give a give it back to Glenn uh we got some compound on here hey hey David I didn't actually see thermal compound uh on their list of items that they're allowed to have so do I just reuse what's on there or what uh I brought thermal compound that's not part of the challenge but if you want to reuse it not going to stop I I'll put some thermal compound on you didn't happen to find any um any mounting
hardware in that box you uh it's all here oh wonderful okay I'm going to need some motherboard standoffs first and foremost and oh wow what is all this stuff we've got like man these are heavy we've got like big metal panels let's have a look at this man this is entertaining I I mean at least for me I don't know you guys might be like oh this is boring go back to painting pl's car I I have no idea but I'm having fun all right here we go man okay you know how I've talked about
how uh I will Dole out Shadow bands for any take that is just so bad that you couldn't possibly ever say anything worth listening to ever again anyone who commented on the plof car upgrade video that what we should have done is buy him a new car while he's on vacation you're Shadow banned that is such a stupid take like man I saw man like oh it's just unbelievable the number of people it was it was less than 10 but it was a lot more than one that were like man what a cheap you know
I don't have my swear bleeper button but you know what a cheap thing you know lonus doing whatever if he had any respect for his team he'd have bought the guy a new car I'm like did people really say that that's not how that works that's not how anything works the not it's not how life works that's and and that's not a video I can't I can't make a video of me just going to a car dealership like that what is wrong with you he's right he can make a video about giving poof a car but he definitely
could make a video about giving me a car yeah that would be great content you have a nice car yeah but could you wouldn't even need the upgrade as badly as he did no he's actually he's got a really nice car like his car me too uh all right let's go ahead and get a couple standoffs in here this case uh really cool definitely a bit of a pain in the butt to work with um how on Earth am I supposed to get these standoffs in the the the H the the tapping is not uh it's not clean enough for me to put them
in by hand and I don't think I have enough clearance like I'm one of the few people on Earth who actually carries around who daily drives a little standoff driver but I don't think I have enough clearance to get it in here lonus there may be metric standoffs instead of the standard Imperial uh no no that's not the issue okay uh it's just that they uh that they just are not going in very easily H um oh man these are oh buddy oh come on okay give me a merch message yeah sure uh hey lonus would you ever
play against me in beats saber I would like to play against the man himself oh I mean I'd be happy to assuming we can get those gaming events going uh I played against people in the crowd uh when we did wh land at LTX and I would love to do something like that again I got beaten I got beaten by one person um everyone else you know you try you played hard but uh was not that close but one person got me they played a really really solid game by the way I saw quite a few comments that I am not
that good at beat saer because I did not complete fitbeat on Expert Plus I will have you know that it was cut from the edited version of the video but lwig setup was scuffed uh the base stations were too close for one thing and I don't know if that even explains the uh the hitching in the animations in the game you couldn't tell from the capture but it was it was stuttering a lot so there were tracking issues and maybe also rendering uh like frame time smoothness issues that made it
extremely difficult the only reason I was able to get as far on the level as I did is because that's one that I'm quite familiar with so I have a fair bit of muscle memory for it but guys lwig is a fit dude a coordinated dude I don't think he hit one block that should give you some idea of how broken it was um so I I stand I stand behind um I stand behind my victory and I uh I say you know what forget it haters I I'm I'm decent I'm decent I'm not super good like as soon as I get into like weeb
music I can't play it at all it's just well it's one of those things right where Rhythm games with Community Maps I suspect definitely beat saber but probably others as well there's a bit of a tendency you know like if you are if you're playing Community m apps for like ACDC you're going to be like cuz realistically all the people playing those maps are boomers whereas you start getting into like U hatsun Miku or something and it's going to be like oh and I failed level I like I
can't even hope to keep up uh all right let's see if we can figure out the I always forget how the mounting mechanism for this bloody cooler works cuz it  warranty information oh good the instructions didn't make their way back into the package that's fine we will figure it out here's my nut driver so I've got a nut driver perfect uh I'll get there in the meantime Dan want to hit me with a merch message sure sure sure sure yeah we got some here about the clear screwdriver what materials did
you try for it and which ones do you want to try next ideally one that does not shatter also please don't kill the project uh that is a wonderful question and if my name was Kyle uh from the Creator Warehouse team I would be thrilled to answer it for you but there is an extremely high risk if I try to answer that question right now that I will say something that is not quite right um so yeah Kyle or tinan would know I mean Robert would probably actually any any of the any of the
engineering folks on the Creator Warehouse team would probably know but I'm sorry I do not remember oh wow okay right yeah I remember this okay but how does this little plastic piece figure into it oh this is AMD I think oh sorry no Intel instructions H oh wait that's it and then that wait what why is that why is that an AMD CPU you animals you can't do that also it doesn't include this it doesn't include this little black thing you know what I'm going to assume so I'm about to
make an ass of you and me but I'm going to assume that it goes there protect the motherboard PCB from getting scratched up while you tighten it down or something there we go I'm going to go with that and we're going to hope for the best yeah there you go Glenn you got that sir perfect yep that's a wonderful solution we all hope all right Dan hit me with another one sure sure sure oh we're almost ready for another role aren't we almost recently got into keyboard building do
you have a strong preference on keyboard switches linear tactile silent Etc this question is also for plof if he's around uh I don't think he is around today I saw them all at uh at like a whole team like lunch meeting thing right before I came over here so I suspect he's not kicking around right now um the reality of it is um I like I like Cherry MX Browns cuz I'm um a pleb and you can you can judge that I don't care um I like them because I'm used to them and for me keyboard switches are less about the
feel and more about just like how comfortable is it for me to type on them and so for that reason familiarity is a is a is a benefit so I use cherrymx Browns on my g710 Plus at home or at work and you know what like look guys I'm not going to apologize for it because from my point of view a big part of the reason for using mechanical switches is those 50 million 60 million in some cases I think they're rated to like a 100 million but I'm not sure if I believe that but these but these many
tens of millions of cycles of of durability and so if you're going to say yeah I'm a mechanical keyboard Enthusiast so I change my mechanical keyboard every you know 3 months I'm kind of sitting here going yeah but that wasn't the point was it um and it might be the point to you you know some people really like the sound right some people are really into the sound and the feel and for them it's it's about you know different it's about different flavors you know varieties of spice of life and
that's totally valid but my way is also valid I buy this keyboard one time I use it for many many many years I'm very used to it I type extremely quickly and accurately on it and that's what it's  I this may be my hottest of takes uh oh I do not use a mechanical keyboard in the like Enthusiast sense I have a g915 tkl I basically am using a laptop keyboard whoa but you know what I love it for gaming I absolutely love it for gaming I don't type that much at home and when I do type you know what it's
not that bad I CH is very upset I don't mind typing on it I like the keyboard I have experienced some of the reliability issues that the community has observed with that keyboard uh I went through one that developed an issue with one of the keys I went through no no no no no no both of them failed the same way actually I take that back uh both of mine that have failed failed the same way so the LEDs seem to have issues for me but Logitech warranty is what it is and I was able to get the one that was a
purchased one replaced very easily under warranty and then for the other one uh samples don't really have warranty so I think we just uh I asked procurement to just buy me a new one um and that's when I was using that on my desk at work and then you know what happened was while it wasn't working while I was waiting for the new one I switched back to my 710 plus and then I just never put the 915 back once I got the new one in so I just kind of gave up on it and went back to
my reliable old 710 with the like crappy old school gasket and the MX Browns I'm sorry but for me a keyboard is something that's very um it's it's it's comfortable I'm also the same kind of person that uh almost never replaces my pillow and yeah I'm sure I'm sure that's like really wrong and really bad for any number of reasons but I just man I like I like an old pillow man it's it's it's deformed and misshapen and ugly and uh you know probably full of like sweat bacteria but
you know what look my pillow is alpaca wool so it's naturally hypoallergenic it's uh it's uh it's my understanding is it should be relatively uh relatively hygienic as well to use for a very long period of time and uh it was quite expensive so I expect to get many many years of uh I expect to get many years of use out of it and I'm not going to apologize for that nope not going to apologize for it there's a certain things that for me are more about familiarity and less about trying something
new speaking of trying something new hey if you ever have trouble you know reaching into a a tough space might I recommend the stubby screwdriver although I feel like uh that sales pitch is going to fall apart when I try and put this one right here because I was able to I was able to make my way to this one this one yeah this could this could be this could be a problem I don't I don't think it's going to get in there NZXT what the devil were you guys thinking and Aza what is up with this case how
the heck is anyone supposed to build a computer in it do you oh man no the screw doesn't fit through the the screw doesn't fit through the shield here Glenn I can get you I can get you a better look if you're my closeup if you're my close-up hero uh yeah that screw just doesn't go in there so I think you're not getting a motherboard screw there folks whoever's buying this computer you'll have to figure out how to put that screw in yourself uh there is at least a couple more that I can put
in okay Dan do you want to hit me with another one something less controversial please less controversial don't anger the keyboard warriors uh what is wrong with you I'm unsubscribed no okay I got do you think really what do you think what did you think of the tandem OLED display on the new M4 iPad Pro also any new mark bench updates I am going to confess to you I um was in script review with Emily this morning uh we've got a really cool video coming on De Googling your life uh so that's what I was up to
when Apple was doing their their keynote announcing the new iPad Pro uh truthfully all I really know about it so far is that it's super thin uh it has an OLED display it's available in two sizes and artists are super mad about the ad that they put out for it where they basically took a bunch of musical instruments and and paint and um and and Artistry tools and put them in a hydraulic press and then showed the whole thing getting crushed and being replaced by an iPad uh that seems to be
that seems to be creating some controversy which I'm glad that I'm not at the center of feels good feels really good um to have it be someone else's problem however Dan I asked for one thing I asked for one that wasn't going to result in any hot takes and you give me that I've got one I'm actually with apple on this jeez Apple didn't Crush artists that's not their point their point and I think that there's a high degree of sensitivity right now in the in the creative Community uh very broadly
um toward technology especially with the way that AI is poised to and and let's not mince words here right is poised to steal their work and then resell it basically repackage it and resell it with zero compensation whatsoever to the original artist and that sensitivity makes a lot of sense they're angry they're justifiably angry um but I where I don't follow is um being angry at the iPad um that's not what Apple's Apple's not Apple may be a company that is actively participating
in that movement but I don't think it has anything to do with what they were saying about the iPad um I don't think it has anything to do with the point of that ad the point was that the iPad is a tool like all of those other tools and that can take on the Ro of all of those other tools but I don't think anyone anywhere at Apple or otherwise is making the argument that an iPad is um is a replacement for the artist like you can draw on an iPad right like they had the the paint um the paint cans that were
being crushed and stuff like that you know you could paint on an iPad um but that doesn't mean you don't still need a painter right like a lot of Apple's um a lot of Apple's mark marketing is really focused on the aspirations that people have to to be artists especially in their pro products right so the whole like oh this whole commercial was shot on on iPhone or whatever doesn't mean you're going to shoot commercial on iPhone doesn't mean that you have a creative bone in your
body but that's not their point their point is that they're selling a a mindset they're selling a lifestyle they're selling a um they're selling a a feeling right of of creativity and art that I'm an Apple user I'm an artist and that's how marketing works right and so I think that's what they were going for and I think for us to to turn that into oh Apple's trying to say that artists are replaceable and that you know art is dead and everything is digital now I think it's really disingenuous and I
think it's I think it's a it's a half-baked attempt to be outraged I don't think it's I don't think it's real I don't think it's um I shouldn't say I don't think it's real I think some of the people who are angry are actually angry but I think that they're missing the point so there's my there's my hot take and you can point at that anytime you hear someone say that I hate Apple because I don't hate Apple I just usually disagree with them um that doesn't mean I always disagree with them
and anyone who always disagrees with someone should not be trusted this is interesting uh The Shield comes off before you get to that too far into that do you want to remind the audience what they're watching yeah this is roll for PC 2 where I will be building a computer with the luck of the dice and then selling it for $2 so it is in my interest for the parts that we use to be as inexpensive as possible um right now I am struggling with some of the very random esoteric Hardware
choices that we have well I shouldn't say choices because none of this has been by choice but some of the esoteric Hardware that we've ended up with because it doesn't assemble very easily this screw is stuck in this hole do we have like an iFixit kit handy or something like that I need tweezers uh that would be that would be terrific thank you so much I think I'm only realistically getting like five screws in this motherboard so my apologies for whoever ends up with this
system uh screw two screws per dollars more than two screws per dollars okay I only have the reverse ones which I've never quite been able to figure out um I'm I'm I'm 100% certain there's a reason and they're very important but I've never quite been able to figure out why I want those instead of the ones that go the other way but I did manage to get the screw out with it so I'm pretty happy about that all right I'm calling that it on the number of screws that I'm putting in this motherboard so
you get five now it's time to put the cooler on and then we get to roll for SSD which mercifully is still accessible here cuz I didn't think of it before uh do we have a paper towel or something like that yeah no we've got a whole crew people how many lmers does it take to obtain a paper towel let's see uh there's usually one here oh and we might have some alcohol here water water water um water wow this is going to be some stale stanky water okay there's no alcohol realistically you don't really
need alcohol to clean up oh that's wow that is so much paper towel uh I will take one half of one of those thank you  kindly you want to move me yeah you want to move me over here yeah sure are we just getting tired of that view moving to the left people don't like that side of me I mean I assumed I had a good side but I just didn't know which one it was I guess now I know showing yeah thanks what a guy what a guy I'm not like I can't hear me oh right he said it's not the one we're showing there you're
outed okay I mean realistically that's that's clean enough oh wow a lot came  please ah good enough all right cool uh did I end oh what there's still thermal goop on the CPU did we not even clean the CPU before Oh no that's right I did a quick test fit and I must have accidentally put it all the way down on it that's fine that'll clean off really easy all right there we go yeah there's going to be some fibers in there here there everyone's always carrying a cloth with them and this one from LTT store you
know very high quality okay here we go all right let's put some thermal compound on we're using nth1 is anyone getting close up no you know what don't worry about it there we go cool and perfect Moment of Truth time guys I just need this bracket Oh Lordy how am I going to get a screwdriver in here okay I just need this bracket uhhuh and I need to go like this and then I need to hope pray  love thanks David anytime set me up so I can knock it down really appreciate you and uh wow okay that is
sideways a little bit crooked but but I  you there we go we're going to start by tightening down this screw then oh wow oh wow then we're going to tighten down this one oh yeah just a little you know just a little get that get that threaded in there yeah there we go okay yeah so that's in there a little bit okay then we're going to tighten down this one is it very obviously crooked or are we gonna get away with this Andrew you're probably okay okay I'm probably okay because these are
definitely threading in a little funny which makes it seem like it might be oh wow what are you talking about that's definitely crooked was now I know I can never trust you again uh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah no no no I got I got a plan I got a plan okay so for God I can't I can't get a screwdriver in there stubby is Too Short The Tall one's Too Tall oh okay I promise you I promise you that wasn't a setup that was not a setup for a sales pitch but we actually do have a
solution for this the stubby driver with the shaft extension no it's still too tall you know what that's fine uh no it's not Precision you got a Precision oh I do I do I have I have prototype of the new Precision it's in my bag I think now it's a sales pit I hope it was in there it still wasn't planned oh oh lordy oh no you can just dig through my bag I don't have anything private in here uh okay there it is is four Linus sample of our new Precision driver look at that oh
detachable magnetic Parts tray that you can put the thing on to cover it up and it's all it's all magnetic and stuff and oh look super super awesome bearing so you can spin it as a fidget toy while you look for the bit that you need and then it can keep spinning uh while you get it in position and it can keep spinning while you screw things in and it's still spinning look we know our audience okay we know that for you guys it's half tool half fidget toy it's still spinning can I 
spinning okay hold on this side I can use a right regular size driver for no it hasn't stopped oh I just barely lost that's okay there we go it's in oh no um I mean you know that's fine right no it seems fine what does chat think we love it yeah thanks thanks chat uh Eternal Griefer says yeesh uh what does that uh that's not fine that's fine it's fine Elijah get back to work no it's broken God fine leaning tower of artsy okay a lot of them do say it's not fine I am seeing those comments I'm just not
reading them out loud I'm doing that H H that's what I'm doing it's fine it's fine it's fine let the dice decide oh okay okay we we let the dice decide do we have a coin David did you uh coin did you prepare for that does anybody does anybody have a coin I feel like that's getting harder and harder as we reach insert year plus we could also do a 20-sided Dice and then everything above 10 is a seriously not one of the half a dozen of us has a coin Colin do they have coin in whatever country
you're from oh they do look at that wow that's awesome no I know I know I've got it no no yes I I'm gonna give it back jeez this guy he's you know what  question okay uh David you get to call it okay wait wait heads you have to or am I calling what you're going to change no I want you to leave it so what ever I call that's what we're going with okay so you want me to leave it I I love this this is well and like this case is heat dissipating so you're just transferring the heat from this to the
case dispersing it everywhere this is science heads it's a good thing he works for the writing Department in the creative role not for the lab okay so you're call you're calling heads Heads okay here we go here we go and then Tails I fix it tails you fix it it's heads yeah we leave it that's it thanks Queen Elizabeth Mah still the best monarch of this  fairness all right let's go ahead and get the fat on here uh H yeah yeah we could go this way we could blow this way sure yeah we're
going to we're going to blow through the cooler rather than sucking air out of the cooler man this is this is not going to go all the way down but I guess it doesn't really matter okay so I'm just going to do my trademark little thing here and then the next thing we're going to roll for is for SSD let's find out what kind of storage you're getting uh I mean I couldn't I couldn't possibly be eating it that badly on the SSD because realistically what like a you know 4 tbte what about a 30 terab kokia Sor
what now it's on there the most expensive is only "$1,500 what where'd you find a $1,500" SSD 8 terab Cy dice uh okay hold on what are we looking at here oh my goodness there's a lot of different options for drives we've got everything from an ancient 256 gig a data SATA drive to a oh wow this is one of the drives from the old wanic server a 750 series 1.2 tbte oh that's unfortunate you can end up with a hard drive drive very slow eBay refurbished read the sticker LOL
still works but do not use for important things uh okay well that's something that you might terab though oh no way what is this Star Wars Seagate fire Cuda lightsaber collection 2 tbte swappable face plates for Luke Obi-Wan or Darth Vader that is so cool uh okay apparently you can't buy this anymore here's a fake 2 tab drive from AliExpress and not as advertised what was the most expensive one then none of these look that bad the 8 terabyte 8 terabytes of pcie Gen 4 storage uh okay yeah rocket okay so what
you're saying is I don't want to 12 and you probably want to roll with Advantage  um no oh okay we are going to trust we're going to trust fate here 12 12 12 12 oh four uhoh what's a four this one I  no oh no uh well oh my gosh if nothing else dy over here you are going to end up with a piece of interesting LT history what is that this where did we get that yeah this right here is a 12 micro or 12 10 yeah 10 Micro SD card to SATA adapter and the idea is that you fill it up with
SD cards right and then yeah there you go so you're apparently getting a 64 gig micro SD card uh here we'll put it in slot number one um like that I think I that Clips up and yeah there we go there we go so you put it in like that there you go and then that goes there and then that allows you to run an actual computer off of this which is not a good idea and you should not do that for today we have like a Windows drive that we can play off of but this won't be going with the computer that's going
with the computer um we did a video about this a number of years ago so yeah consider yourself the proud owner of a piece of uh Curious LT memorabilia other  whatsoever tell you what we'll get the we'll get the live streaming team today to sign it at least so that you don't feel completely hosed I can't um yeah Dan really likes well where do we how the hell do I even install this do we have any double-sided tape oh I see some doublesided tape no no no we got it David we got it we got some
VHB it's permanent this will be your actual install Drive okay this will be our boot drive for today perfect okay  boy Andrew it's a Leatherman moment you lucky guy thanks boss he he's he's always oh oh oh we prob yeah there we go he's always got the Leatherman on him uh he's always just oh man he's insufferable he's so desperate for us to use it and it always it hurts me every time I have to be like okay all right Andrew it's a Leatherman it's a Leatherman moment and your scissors are
oh my scissors are so dull they're so dull no you're not user error that's there's there's no way that's user error skill issue it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't snip yeah okay it's bad okay no no no no tell you what tell you what here Glenn you want to switch switch to Glenn for a second here okay here here Dan oh yeah there which one is it oh there we go yeah it's working okay okay all right all right here Mr Mr user error look look look look you cut it you  okay you're blocking the view you're
blocking the view he's so desperate for to work that did not count yeah whatever that was not scissors that was two knives it's cook isn't it that was that was that was the two knife technique two knife two furious um which I mean it's kind of on brand for today honestly speaking all right let's throw that on there and then we'll uh oh God okay you know what if we're gonna if we're going to be stuck with the knife then we might as well just use the knife okay how do I man how
do I do that how do I put that thing back I'm just going to yeah I'm trying to I'm trying to close it now how the H how the hell do you close  there no no no no I no I'll figure it out I'll figure it out there oh there it is there you go there we go there we go all right no no no no I got this i got this um there we go all right we got the knife have to use that's fair that's fair but you know what no I have no comeback for that you're right if LT store had one we wouldn't have to deal with with
these clear insufficiencies in the Leatherman product all right what's our next role David it's up to you we can do power supply or GPU let's do power supply let's do power supply it's a 11900 or a 10900 in here uh it's an 11900 let's see how much power that thing needs all right I guess we're going to eliminate any power supplies that don't meet the standard David um David uh Dan do you want to give me a merch message while David figures out our power supplies yeah sure I don't think we should eliminate I
think we should basically if we low low roll we try it if it boots that's good enough if it games if it games okay okay I wasn't going to eliminate anything I just want to know all right I'm down lus lonus whatever happened to to cat tips um yeah I'll be I'll be real with you guys I um it never really felt quite right after uh after the boys made their daring Escape um and you know I don't I don't need another video channel project so between those two things I just haven't really I haven't really felt the
need to resurrect it um yeah I that's about all I have to say about that all right we're going to go ahead and put this drive right here all right Dan hit me again sure thing hi lonus and crew longtime Watcher first live caught as I just moved to Canada from the UK I was sad about no LTX 2024 but happy I can catch Live Now what's your current thoughts on projectors versus TVs oh oh there goes the SD card uh sorry I was just trying to figure out how these stupid things lock into place
because I think you slide them down and then you and then you lock them but I can't remember if they slide if they slide back or forward or something yeah they okay they slide that way all right I understand it now now I man wow this really this really made it a lot harder uh having to install this while it's in there okay and then oh my God uh excuse me all right uh yeah no I think I got it there we go okay that's in and I just want to lock the rest of them so they don't they're not Flappy doodling around
in shipping I mean what's the worst that can happen though it's get damaged like what ever uh oh we didn't sign it oh balls well we'll do that after the fact okay cool this m.2 is going in now I forget what the question was projectors versus TVs ah okay if you want to go bigger than 100 in and change there's no question you will need a projector and the same is true if you want anything other than like a standard 16x9 aspect ratio like if you want to have like a really cinematic aspect ratio display
the way to do it is with a projector and if you want to build a you know a home theater let's say you're a mega baller you want to build a home theater that seats 20 30 people you're going to need a big screen and you are going to need a projector for basically every single other application though man I I just feel like now that the pricing has come down to what it is on these large format TVs I just feel like projectors are dead man they are dead like JBC launched some
new projectors recently that look like they've got some great features they've got improved Dynamic tone mapping um they've got like better contrast than ever before I think they can outright turn off some of the pixels or something like that or they can achieve a very similar effect blah blah blah blah blah who cares cuz these things are like I think they go up to like "$20,000 or they're in like the the 50" "$1,000 range or something like that" you're not going to get close to what
you can do with a direct view display not even close and I can tell you right now like whether it's family movie night or whether you got friends over and you're playing games or whatever it is that you're doing not having to sit in a pitch black room even if jvc's image quality could be could be on par with that TV having to have the entire room light controlled sucks like you okay you can see the snack you're eating or whatever but like barely right it's yeah it's it's just
not as good and so you know now that now that that TCL TV exists now that that high sense one either exists or is coming soon I just don't see projectors competing in the in the hundred to 120 in range basically ever again we don't know what tcl's price pricing in North America is going to be like though so that could be a bit of a um that could be a bit of a I don't know a prolonging of the inevitable for the big projector guys but for for home for home viewing I just I just think they're you see that
Samsung TV so expensive they're giving "you an $8,000 free TV okay so I" intentionally left off micro LED okay and the reason for that is that for the time being the pricing is just it's not reasonable like what was the size of that TV 114 and it cost "$132,000 yeah something like that I" think it's South Korea only right now so it's not even a skew that exists elsewhere in the world um and at that price no I would obviously you would buy a projector because you're talking about
for a nice projector setup you're talking about spending on light control treating your room on a projector on a screen you're talking about spending a tenth of what that or or a 20th or or excuse me a 10th or a fifth for like a really like really nice setup those aren't price competitive they're not in the same range they're not in the same conversation um and TCL has a microed wall like competitor that is I think slightly more reasonably priced but theirs is a multi-panel one and when I
saw it at CES like Andrew you were there with me yeah like okay out of 10 how visible were the seams oh uh like pretty I don't know eight maybe you got if you got reasonably close he he gave it an eight and the thing is that as they age they can age differently and so as they age differently those scenes are going to start to really pop out and it's one of those things where even if under most circumstances they're not that noticeable there's a sudden there's a hard cut right and the scene change and
you're sitting there you're going like movie movie movie scene yeah I don't know I I I I see I see G I don't want to be quoted on this but I actually see rollable being long-term the better solution compared to multi- panel and this is coming from someone who saw multi panel as the future back when Samsung first showed off this the modular display thing and and what I liked about it so much was at CES that year I don't think you were with us yet at CES that year they had this really
cool demo where they like shifted around and like turned on and off so they would be in all of these it was like portrait for a second and then it shifted to 16 by9 and then it iged to like 21 by9 and it that's and it really sold me on this idea that oh I don't buy a TV anymore I buy a driving box like a commercial display and I buy panels and then I configure it and potentially you know when I need a a brand new HDMI my standard input or something I'm just replacing my control box or if I want to
enlarge and I want to take this that was in you know the recck room or something let's I have money for microed so presumably I have lots of rooms I want to take it from the recck room I want to put it in the theater I just buy a bunch more panels and right like I make it bigger right so I was kind of I was kind of sold on that idea but having seen all the work that's gone into seam reduction and having seen how we're still not there yet guys like come on and and foldable and rollable is like
getting dangerously close and then having dealt with uh oh you weren't there for that shoot um but having dealt with the logistics of moving around a large TVH I just I feel like we're at a limit now where unless you can roll it up or fold it up or something it's it's just not realistic for people to move uh sorry I I've been stalling for a long time what are we I thought we were doing power supply power supply right oh we were okay so let's have a look at what we've got here man we've got everything
from oh no the Scythe rolls out what is rolls out okay a core power a 300 wat power supply with no PCI Express power connectors uh features probably won't blow up question mark um we've got an EVGA 400 watt that you say was in a bin in the dumpster that I didn't write all of these little thingies I see so I actually don't know 100% on this one it has more power but still might not blow up uh we've got an fsp 350 watt at least it comes with a PCI Express power cable here I'm just
going to switch over to this side we've got oh we're getting up into pretty good stuff now cic Focus gx550 EVGA 650 gold the lean Lee oh we ended up with another sfx power supply so another small form factor one sure uh we've got an inwin P series 850 850 watt and zxt 1000 oh wow a cic 12200 watt silver excuse me Silverstone 1200 watt and an EVGA 1600 watt with an 80 plus titanium rating very long so hopefully it fits in the case man modular if Case compatibility ends up being a problem again I'm not
going to be happy about it all right let's find our 10-sided die Advantage  pain should I trust the fates what does chat want what do you guys want right now I have to sell the machine for a dollar dude and they want to spin they just want the discounts the spins are fine they already used up all of the free shipping discounts they are apparently  left this doesn't feel like rolling with an Advantage this [Laughter] feel okay I don't know who is responsible for these discount codes but um you know
what no no no no I was going to say I was going to say I might need to have a chat with them after the stream about maybe getting approval for these things but I think it will be Taran who has a chat with them after the Stream So This is the biggest one yet is very limited quantities so get your uh fingies ready it's 50% off any product no minimum quantity but it's only limited to 10 uses oh okay that's  no um 10 uses I think 10 were probably being a little bit too cheap I think you
want me to call just someone not too not  look if you guys I'll be back in a second if you guys are going to hurt me you might as well hurt me um I just feel like if it was only 10 the people would probably use it basically immediately um and people wouldn't even get a chance to enjoy yeah it's a write off it's the write off sale okay right I didn't even roll I got distracted uh okay time to roll Glenn you ready okay here I'm going to roll in this roll so you can roll
while you roll um and you can be focused on the oh fail hey but look at that you got a pretty decent power supply I think I have no idea if inwin P series is good but it has a 5year warranty and Lord only knows how old this thing is and how much of that warranty is used up also it might be a sample it might have no warranty whatsoever but this is what you're getting uh what was the cost of this bad boy I don't have a cost for it but if I had to Ballpark it it's probably about a hundred bucks which if
anyone is keeping track at home puts us at I think in the neighborhood of this is not too bad I think we're up to "around 122 $1,300 oh actually oh this is" fully modular this looks pretty nice here we get this little peel done for you Dan want to hit me with a merch message yeah sure I got a few here for you uh Hey Linus gang just joined the soaked airpods Club because wife didn't check the airpod pocket before throwing my sweatpants and the washing machine okay I'm going to
stop you right there I'm going to stop you right there if you have someone in your life who does your laundry for you this is how you behave yes thank you thank you and that's it there's no blame there's Mula I am sorry I have caused add additional stress for you my lady by potentially making you feel any guilt whatsoever that you might have felt when you discovered the airpods that I carelessly left in mine laundry but please go on what about a waterresistant pocket 
two love oh so now you want me to fix it this is your problem now do you take accountability for anything in your life no no okay I'm actually kidding now that's actually a really good idea I I I legitimately kind of like it like if I had a because realistically in the washing machine it doesn't go full submersion the whole time or anything like that so if we had one of those uh one of those YKK waterproof and nothing is waterproof right but if we had one of those YKK water resistant zippers on a
pocket that was lined with some kind of a membrane or something like that I don't think that for liability purposes we'd be willing to guarantee anything but I think if we called it like a like a like a water pocket and then just didn't like say waterproof or didn't say you can wash your clothes or whatever what we could say is maybe we tested it you know we did 10 washes and our airpods survived every time or something like that like we could you could call the moist pocket the moist pocket yeah
yeah yeah just hope it doesn't take a critical hit oh I don't know that's a bad joke don't don't acknowledge that joke that's not funny um any who yeah that's actually a really good idea maybe we could log that for the uh for the fashion team Chaser Den do you mind sending that over to them that's legitimately a pretty good idea dear fashion team pocket go right now go right now and thank your wife for taking care of your laundry um for for you in general and uh yes do do the thing do
the thing I said uh before we progress we have now updated the amount of these codes there's 69 of them still not very many for all of you people out there wanting 50% off anything on the store I don't think we've ever done that before first time for anything baby uh the code  Linus cute also uh I was told to let you know that the codes were approved by more than one person okay so you don't have to worry all right so I don't have to worry ah sure  Works hey no it was it was a whole mob
so uh that torched the car so you don't have to worry uh oh oh wait what is that oh no never mind oh man we got a lot of we got a lot of front panel connectors in here that I they're coming in hot uh yeah that's oh my gosh that doesn't surprise me poor Dan's fies are burning how's your fies Dan I got a touch screen so it's just my thumb uh man LED RGB switch what is what is even this labeling okay yeah reset switch Qs hard drive LED Qs and they're all gone or so I'm told that fast
yeah people probably had carts loaded up I have 30 incoming right now that in like five crazy 5 Seconds uh wow you're poor all right well congrats to those of you who got the code I can't promise that we will ever do anything like that again um I mean never say never I'm a kind of a try anything twice kind of character but um certainly no promises on trying that twice I guess it all depends on what management decides I'm just a talent now I just stand here and try and look pretty some days it goes
great some days it goes a little less great but hey you guys are here with me for it right hey thanks y'all I am told that the moist pocket idea has been passed on to the fashion team okay thank you Chase that is tremendous news thank you very much the moist pocket you have to call it something else that is disgusting soggy pocket yes soggy pocket soggy pocket actually that's pretty good soggy moist pocket now for your sweatpants lgd store.com it's a new meaning to the word like to
sweatpants captures all sweat in your pants not in your pocket how get it what is it about the word moist that makes people so uncomfortable I don't know keep saying it though it's just a meme though is it yeah it's not actually I don't think most people feel uncomfortable I don't genuinely feel uncomfortable it's a powerful word it is it is it's definitely it evokes oce I  word moist e i I wish I had Echo I could just moist we have a we have we have a no gross out policy on camera I think I
just broke it it was instituted after that channel super fun where we we ate like pasta off of a off of a piece of glass with the camera pointing at it from underneath and um people were just like yeah this was this was unwatchable um so what we realized was at a certain point it doesn't matter how entertaining the concept is or how you know well storyboarded it is or whatever and I'm not saying that one was particularly well thought out I'm just saying we what we realized is that if
something is just unpleasant to look at nothing else matters you you simply cannot upload it uh so so we have a no gross out policy see and I am just about done all these front panel connectors this is a really awful case to work in for those of you who were wondering you know for the $600 are you getting ease of use are you getting style like what are you getting um I don't know if I could say either of those things with a straight face I mean it's something it's a it's a vibe there 
Vibe I me rotate it and show the missing half that's that's the vibe yeah okay yeah that's that's definitely that's definitely the vibe that right there  getting I think I think you're going to have to pay them $2 to take this computer I'm a little confused actually why are we not able to attach this one maybe we can where at that pie go yeah give maybe it can go on no I got it I got it over here oh no maybe not yep oh yeah are I wonder if we could put any of the screws in I mean we got tools in 105
we could just hack that off what about this what are these what if we just no oh wait how does it yeah how does it work it kind of I don't remember how this went you know what I'm over it sorry buddy see you later all right let's get some modular cables want to hit me with a merch message in the meantime I suspect you've got a couple I do have a couple couple yes uh looking to set up a home lab for Linux in Linus's poor past with Linux what's his recommended distribution oh man I don't want to
recommended distribution you guys the um Arch you casual the uh that that uu Linux that we checked out recently actually looked really cool uh it was wuntu that that's what it was so it's based on Ubuntu but it just kind of has a lot of the stuff that most people would want to install anyway on it already and it's kind of cute it's inviting it's friendly I I'm I have never daily driven it so don't take this as a as an educated endorsement of any sort but I mean being Ubuntu based is
just automatically an advantage in my mind just because it's been around for so long and one of the biggest struggles you're going to have if you try to daily drive Linux for the first time if you've never done it before I guarantee you one of the biggest struggles that you're going to have is the lack of documentation in general for many of the distributions out there and Ubuntu is a bit of an exception to that because it has been around for so long and there are so many people using it and in
general it takes a bit more of a userfriendly approach compared to something that's you know popular and has a large user based but is philosophically different like Arch by the way you know so there that's my that's my off the top of my head take and that's the best you're going to get from me on a day like today because I'm having a bit of a stress day um it's it's it's it's it's that kind of day today uh PCI right did we ever figure out where the heck the GPU goes in this thing no
we did not huh so there's oh these are probably going to inform us right that's PCI those are slots maybe they go I think it you take that well it's a good thing that we kept one of the sides then cuz we're definitely going to need one of them yeah so this probably pops off sorry these are so tight from the factory I can't can't remove them without the screwdriver oh yeah okay and there it goes okay okay easy peasy so we should be able to fit just about any GPU we want but I just wanted to
kind of plan for where my oh should we figure out which GPU so you know which cables is there a 16 pin in here I don't see one probably not okay that's fine there's always adapters yeah um oh oh you know what yeah sure let's Ru for GPU um but okay we're doing it I feel good about this I feel good about this one where's the wheel I don't know if I like that wheel I think I might on the ground yeah I was in shock might be kind of over the wheel D there's no more discounts to give out
oh other than the computer itself okay so we can so we can cross out the discounts then y okay fine I'm good then uh where's the uh do we have a pen oh I put it away I guess we don't have to formally cross it out my goodness is this ever a lot of options for GPU good Lord you can get this is amazing you can get this expert oriented GeForce gt1030 worth its we to it's got gold crossed out here worth its  mold wow but hey 10 series is the last Nvidia family to support interlaced outputs for you Retro Gaming
enthusiasts what a sales pitch uh number two is an RX 550 which is worth less than 50 bucks used on eBay pcie gen 3 has never known love not even from Crypt Bros for $90 we've got a gunar A380 which I believe we obtained no this one came later so we obtained one of these uh low-end Intel Arc cards just to have an excuse to talk about av1 encoding in a video about that we couldn't find any other use for it um we've got a Manaj JY GeForce GTX 1660 this is worth about a hundred bucks use
could be pretty fine enough an RX 6500 XT okay now we're getting into expensive territory uh Glenn we're on you so I think you're pretty far away oh there we go I'll move the wheel to uh 6500 XT we've got okay 4 gigs in minute we've got a 5700 XT we're up to around 150 bucks used we've got a 3050 we've got oh wow old school a Titan XP which is apparently still worth about 200 bucks used all right Titan X Pascal oh man so many options o Intel Arc a770 wow so if I roll anything above above a 10 you guys
are getting something pretty decent it's used about worth about 300 bucks uh 3060 for 305 we've got a sapphire pulse 6750 XT for around 300 a 4060 TI for 385 oh my goodness there's so many options oh things are getting real here currently "about 1,000 Bucks new what is going on" but used about $400 an RTX 3080 uh we've got uh oh sick a hydro dipped Nvidia 2080 TI Founders this is worth about 320 bucks but this is one of a kind just like you audience member and it probably works this was in a video all those
years ago go uh what else we got uh XFX 7700 XT that's worth about 460 Bucks new a$ 470 for $550 we've got a 7900 XTX for around "$1,000 we've got an RTX 480 for" $1200 we've got a 490 for "$2,000 real ones don't need me to make a" write up for this product cuz they know it's hard writing things about 200 products okay I'm doing my best here that one was me thank you David uh We've also got an RTX 370 master that is worth 360 bucks used with 8 gigs of dddr 6 memory and is over
"$1,000 new because pricing is broken uh" all right so I've got a 20-sided die here and it's time to find out who whoa whoa Advantage no Advantage sure do it all right there's some pretty cruel punishments I need I don't know if I like this wheel that much uh so far it has not treated me particularly well okay one more one more no no there's no more discounts how does it land on discount   broken beer pong okay beer pong so so I guess that's a challenge it's a challenge okay what and what happens if
I fail the challenge again you get disadvantage oh wait why did I roll it  to I see uh okay so I think you'll go over there okay here well let's get low and you're going to basically have to bounce what do you think three or one I don't know I don't know how good are you at it be here a long time all right I'll do I'll do whatever you guys want wait that's all the cups I get oh yeah you get three chances though oh okay where ball where I put the I see the balls no those are golf balls oh but the
box is also there and I help all right Dan want to hit me with the merch  up yeah I got some here for you thanks Mr besser you're very welcome we're just moving some cables out of the way sorry about that thanks how does it feel practice oh hold on I got a I got another one here first these aren't even real pingpong balls these are so cheap look I just touch it like that and it permanently dents I think your be behind the line what line the line and the I think if my torso's behind the line I'm okay you're
right I'm what a jerk what a jerk okay sorry Dan what was my merch message uh do you know that the flowers are blooming in Antarctica right now that's kind of terrifying um okay so I got to practice one yeah practice one so even it goes in it doesn't count okay but now you have three chances you get one in you get Advantage you get none in you get disadvantage dude these don't even bounce oh that sounds like excuses oh I I'll fix that I'll fix that that was really close man that was really close Okay second
attempt oh oh come on they don't bounce they don't  disadvantage they have no weight to them they have no weight to them no here let me show the I'm going to show the people here go to go to the wide go to the wide go to the wide watch this thing I'mma Huck it as hard as I can it's going to be like nerd throw meme it there the wind resist the air resistance is too high look fine to me looks fine to me come on beating it at me what what's the line do it you coward n terrible no okay all right where's my 
dieye sure J never been made before here's another I got it oh wait oh it's disadvantaged so I take the worst of the two yeah the higher roll oh balls okay we you ready don't forget you have a roll but it costs you a Carolina Reaper I see on your hand okay so we're "up to only like 13 12 $1,300 so far that" I have to sell for $2 so I'm doing pretty good so 12 12 oh that four would have been nice okay what's 12 hey oh oh H you don't want to give it away huh I'm not going to lie there's actually a
little bit of sentimental value for this one I I personally hydro dipped this um it's also not even that great of a GPU um oh dude though okay can I smell them oh those are really big you don't have to eat an entire one if you eat an entire one you'll get sick oh I caught a whiff yeah you'll take I'll cut you a little piece and just to participate because I like being part of things uh I'll eat with you but uh I don't think I need to save this that badly this is a really cool card cuz
even though it's RTX 20 Series so it doesn't RTX as well as the cards that came after it the performance is still pretty de in rasterized games you can use Nvidia AI features like their background noise removal and stuff like that and this was the one generation of Nvidia cards that had this really cool VR Port so it has a USBC connector that carries DP alt mode which um if you were to do a really random project like you wanted to have a gaming system in your minivan say for example I was actually
kind of planning to use something like this for that um long story MSI repoed my laptops um so if you were to put a gaming system in your minivan you wanted to run like a long USBC cable to a portable monitor this works awesome for that so it'll do power um uh it'll do power and it'll do um display port alt mode over it which is really cool really unique you have the option you can keep that or you can swap out the 490 [Laughter] it's your choice I think I'll let it go I think I can uh I think I'll I'll go
full Elsa on this one thank you uh Dan want to hit me sure let's see what we have here how does it feel to make free shipping for [Laughter] us I'm happy for you don't lie I'm happy for them Dan I'm happy for them yeah that makes sense I'm a little stressed today um that's okay it's not like you're giving away thousands of dollars in PC parts wow really helpful team have I ever mentioned how World Class my team is give them some Welches world class trolls jeez all right want to hit me
with one more yeah sure though what else got some power connectors to put in here jeez hey guys sinus here what can I do with my e-w alarm panel now that my free smart home package expired on my house and add won't give me the master password also ETA on the LT store desk that is really unfortunate um and it's uh it's a it's a harsh reality of the Disposable uh you know locked in anti- right to repair um world that we live in and there is no real solution for it because nobody is going to be harvesting
pretty much anything usable from that even down to the materials um it's pretty much going to end up in a landfill and that's really sad especially in the context of that other merch message we got very recently about how flowers are blooming in Antarctica right now uh but all you can really do is consume less um and then never have to deal with that but that's not a real solution right like what I'm going to tell you to not have a security system on your home no right like yeah it's cuz
I Moonlight as a as a burglar right so I can break into your house more easily like it's yeah sorry to be a downer but I don't have good news for you it's gonna end up in a landfill uh want to hit me with a less depressing merch message Dan uh let me see oh he's struggling uh the world's horrible and everything is pain oh Dan you're not allowed to send merch messages we've been through this oh I should probably okay well I don't have any that no um uh of all the computers you have ever built which one
was the most memorable hopefully this isn't also depressing oh I mean if I didn't say the mineral oil PC I don't you know what nope I I take it back I'd say the most memorable was probably seven Gamers one CPU there was at least one maybe two sleepless nights in that project and the moment when it worked is something that I will never forget again because it shouldn't have it had absolutely no right whatsoever to work and not only did it work it worked shocking ly well and if it wasn't for the current
anti-che landscape it would still be a viable way to share resources from a very powerful computer for playing light games um across you know multiple sets of of user inputs it's a really really cool technology and it's just too bad that you know modern anti Che just doesn't really allow it to function the way that it could I understand why they do everything that they do they're in this they're in this horrible arms race against people who are financially incentivized to break the gaming
experience for their paying customers I understand why game developers do it but I don't have to like it all right let's get this GPU installed now is that it David we don't need to roll for anything else we're done we're good or how you see the rest of this space Oh got keyboards got mice you got headsets we got random category cuz we wanted to include this really okay you could win a red rocket X weit not win bye uh okay red rocket has multiple meanings by the way you're definitely not winning that
uh let's go ahead and put this PCI on here and then apparently we're rolling oh we're doing a full oh monitors yeah oh wow there's some really interesting stuff over in the monitor you could be "selling a $44,000 monitor L is uh and" that's all included in the $2 yeah that's why we had to raise it from $1 to $2 was to include the monitor it makes sense yeah the PC cost twice as much as last time this is it's a big build yeah I know honestly we're getting greedy yeah yeah we really fell off um jeez is
there a support for this or does this just like chill here because this doesn't seem right it certainly looks like there is no support I mean you got the you got the G tape or whatever seriously so why would there be two that does not seem like a real solution why don't I look it up what a weird case yeah sure how you guys doing chat you guys enjoying the stream what a random computer for those of you who are tuning in now the concept is roll for PC I have to build this system with whatever parts
we roll and at the end of it I sell it for $2 so the higher the value of the system the better deal our lucky buyer on LT store is going to be getting so far we've got an 11 900k so a pretty nice 11th gen gaming CPU from Intel we've got 32 gigs of ddr4 memory we've got an NZXT z590 motherboard we've got an RTX 2080 TI an 850 W power supply and all housed in this case uh truly delightful truly delightful case from inwin that has been a real chore to built in and made the whole thing take a lot longer than it
otherwise would have but hey at least you're going to get this really unique aesthetic in the finished system that um you know you might want to take some of these components out like the SSD in order to properly enjoy but you're you're going to you're going to use this case I I pretty much promise you that oh yeah I forgot our SSD uh it's h for those of you tuning in now it's a Micro SD to SATA adapter so you can put up to 10 uh we should switch to Andrew get the closeup um you should or gler someone uh
you can put up to 10 Micro SD cards on this thing it's like a it's like a carrier a carrier board fo nice there's sorry their solution is foam blocks that's what it says in the manual install the included foam seriously my brothers um I'm not a huge fan of this solution I mean it's no worse than what we did to mount that SSD so that's fair and valid but uh all right that's it yep the foam block is spaced perfectly wow wow that is huh we might be taking that GPU out to ship it I think we
will because as much as it saddens me to say goodbye to it it would sadden me even more if it just died okay well that's something uh what do we roll next oh I didn't put the Power connector in oh yeah sorry I'm going to do that really quick and then we can do the next thing uh oh hopefully there's a spot oh yeah there's a spot we got this how many connectors do you want though you want 1 18 pin one 16 pin I got this easy peasy no well easy but maybe not peasy hold on I'm just going to go like this
there we go all right David what's our next category we're going to do  next all right total damage around "$1,500 so far then you know what that's"  uh I am going to get this connector in at some point there it goes and then we are  on all right nice nice Perfect all right keyboards here we go got 12 I keep leaving the dice plate oh wow so prepared sometimes okay what all we got here we got the tech Theory gaming pack Priceless as seen in our autoshop peripherals video I would rather have
nothing beautiful we've got the singlehanded keyboard um the bad news is it's just half a keyboard the good news is um your other hand is free for other  like using the mouse really really you guys a masturbation joke I thought we're  no uh number three the vog tech transparent keyboard featured in 10 weird keyboards from AliExpress it's worth $38 not great uh we've got an aula mechanical keyboard for 40 bucks we've got the unknown Hot Wheels blue keyboard oh this is one of those old gskill ones
I painted that did you Dan yeah for the shank mods video adequate job yeah don't show the other side oh I I had like five minutes to do it nice uh we've got a stoga magic refiner for 50 bucks if you like round keys because you're an animal uh we've got whoa a Dell model 101 PS2 keyboard is this buckling spring oh that sounds nice  chest nice got a bit of that twang to it it kind of sounds like it it's pretty nice yeah that one's not bad uh it's only worth $70 but we've got an oh this thing looks
amazing an 8bit dough kind of noctua is looking more famicom oh famicom sure yeah you know it's funny North American kid I can never get used to the whole like oh yeah the buttons are rainbow or whatever on the on the super fom like all that kind of stuff excuse me sorry we've got a mountain Everest 60 compact 10 keyless this is worth about a hundred bucks and then rounding things up oh that's our that's our 12 oh oh oh oh oh this oh no I remember this video this was the like $100 versus
"$1,000 wooden keyboard video so this is" like an artisen wooden keyboard This is the Thousand wooden keyboard it legitimately kind of sucks to use like it's not great it's got this little tiny space bar but you can switch between Roman and Kaa characters with a hotkey here it's beautiful I mean the craftsmanship is immaculate it has no Dan paint job on the back why do they use such a cheap cable though um I don't know but it's stylish you can't fault the style so that's our number 12 and
then we've got an azeron classic with funky color this is worth $375 that colorway no but you can get the like that for around that amount wow forget everything you know about typing it's like holding a hand great for  D you could use it with that other half keyboard I wrote the keyboard jokes I  in we've got whatever the crap this is I don't see a label on it it's a it's not fully part of it it was going to be uh if we needed to swap something in we could swap it in for anything you want no that's
fine uh and then we've got the work louder Creator board modular keyboard knobs dials for days modular but you only get what's here and it's ortholinear so you're going to have to relearn your typing a little bit I I don't know if I could do orthol linear it would certainly take me a while so for those of you not familiar uh that's where instead of having the rows slightly offset from each other they are in a perfect square grid all right um you know what David I'll play your silly
yes but no duplicates though right no yeah if we if we've done something we   count beer PK I think this thing is kind of weighted yeah I asked you that I didn't mean to  get out of  the it's a really good thing that we capped discount truth or D because if we had to do like another 50 you know 50% offs for every time we rolled that I'd  dying so this okay what is what is truth or dab oh this is the whole thing it's hot uh so I didn't get this on purpose I just wanted this hot sauce for this uh
so this is the last stab which is their endgame hot sauce it's very spicy uh it's actually not as bad as the bomb so do you want the bomb instead what no Should we do the bomb instead Chad no we should do we should play the game The Last dab okay fine so you said D bomb okay I did not say the bomb I said the LA he said D bomb I didn't say the bomb I said everybody heard the bomb right said it twice now the bomb the bomb the bomb dab I said the last dab you won't necessar have to do it I think the I
think the way this works is basically uh I read you it's truth or dab uh I read you a question and if you don't want to answer it you have to take hot sauce so there's no way for me to win this nope I see oh this is a good one this is a good one but I can just refuse and then roll a disadvantage you could do that oh oh games master David didn't think of that   okay that's a bad sign the room is on fire and you can rescue everyone but one  behind cameras can you show everyone  room oh Colin [Laughter]
so you don't have to do the hot sauce all right and you get Advantage perfect I'll tell you what though I'll keep them if I do the hot sauce will you also do the hot sauce just for LS just yeah easy easy peasy all right he agreed to that way too easily I kind of hope that that would be more of a I I kind of hope that that would be more of a haha gotu moment um that really wow did not everyone wants to see you do hot sauce that did not work out the way that I had the bomb what I'm not
doing the bomb again this is the hotter version of the bomb I'm not doing the bomb again I did the bomb last time okay mix them okay what's a dab uh this is stuff's not that bad okay so what's a dab then do double that I promise I promise it's actually not that bad okay give me quadruple that quadruple yeah yeah yeah yeah I ain't no W well I'm not going to let you upstage me here there you go that's why that's  predictable am I am I really that predictable David yes 100% hold on a second oh no
okay dink it w hold on I mean now I've got more okay okay dink it and sink it okay I got on my lips that was a mistake M I got it all over my tongue okay remember we don't have milk I have ice cream I do have ice cream oh good choice damn it I got spicier I got the hiccups     um I was pretty hot  I  cold well I tried all of them plus the Carolina Reaper yesterday to make sure I wouldn't kill you so I've had a little bit of this ice cream but where' my spoon go all right all right from that side that wasn't
that bad I got this it's not nearly as  you know everyone says you want milk after hot sauce and like not to drink water I've actually always found that the milk product doesn't really do any better for me really and the water is like fine like I keep getting it's one of those comments that kind of drives me crazy to eat cuz people like did you not even know no I do I do know yep the cold is nice yeah but like hot sauce is still just like hot sauce sauce uh ice cream doesn't make it magically not hot
sauce but then you have ice cream that's true I wonder if that's why you feel better the hiccuping is so great [Laughter] okay you poor people I wish my water was cold that would have been nice someone got to the dispenser before I filled this today I guess oh no I filled it over on this side I'll grab you some I  okay all right I'm  does that count if it's high yeah oh it's a  getting worth it the tech Theory gaming pack because I rolled a 12 on my primary die and I would have had to do the "$1,000 wooden"
keyboard was it worth it okay hold on no yes yes it was worth it okay Tech Theory gaming pack among the very worst gaming peripherals we have  tested okay uh hey Colin if you're not too mad at me uh do you mind starting to clear this table so we can start getting our our setup for our for our endgame gaming going oh he's mad huh he's mad he's mad at me look it was a it was a joke for the entertainment I was like I was throwing him under the bus a little bit and like that's why I ate the hot sauce
because I lied I could never choose between my work children okay he doesn't understand any of this so like he only knows simple words like would would let you burn in a fire um but like don't worry we're like we're good we're good it's fine we'll be fine um okay uh what are we doing next then is monitor the last thing left then we got to let's say monitor we got a safe monitor then oh I'm feeling a little lightheaded okay wow we got some doozies oh no no we can't give away this

$50 uh we've got a uh a glorious Model D we don't know how much that's worth apparently something oh we're getting into some really interesting stuff here though we've got this uh 3D connection CAD Mouse which my understanding is like it has another movement Dimension or something I think I I can't remember it has like a gyro in it or something can't remember but it I think it's cool uh we've got a fanatic flick 2 for about 60 bucks the Microsoft easy ball this retailed for $80 but I get in on that
face I want to see that I think these go for quite a bit more um on eBay now we've got a pulsar X2 worth about a hundred bucks it's a clear one ooh I don't want to get that razor Viper ultimate for $150 oh this would be a win the Razer "boom slang first edition okay only 5,000" exist of this first edition we made a video about it on the main Channel we've got the pointer instrument full grain French leather what is this thing it's am I even familiar with this I did a short c on it

well anywh who let's go ahead and roll I get to roll with advantage and we're finding out what mouse will be included  ready all right now with the way the micer laid out six is not necessarily uh worse for me than four so my options are the wireless I have no idea how much this is worth pink bunny mouse or oh a Cooler Master mm520 you know what you know  one oh man wow this setup though um okay uh hey Colin this is why I would have left him in the fire um okay here here here here
okay so here I got to here I got to I got to I got to explain I got to explain something calling okay so this is the  computer okay it's not plugged in yet right no I know that'll that that'll spin when we plug it in so when you're setting up you have to put the computer  here okay thank you thank you Colin no no I need that thank you Colin um he's been making really good progress and um you know like I said I wouldn't actually let him perish in a fire uh I do I do find that sometimes it doesn't
add efficiency to assign things to Colin but he um he's really kind uh he's a kind person I uh think we're actually missing the dongle for this oh there it is never mind we are missing batteries though trip right I'm going to need a pair of aaa's yes sir uh before you progress you probably want to partake in the challenge oh basically you just walk step in that really you have to put you had to put ice in it yeah what a dick SC such a dick yeah just uh put get  stream it's one of those things that
isn't that bad to start mhm but the longer you're doing it the longer your feet are wet the worse it's gonna be uhuh thank you David for that helpful commentary um anytime okay there you go have fun where's the mouse uh anyone want to drink some drinking water gross all right sell that on LTT store.com water bottle do not water bottle full of uh nothing's funny anymore now that we live on this timeline where you can't take for granted that that is a joke it's not even a joke yeah um all right
I'm going to help out Colin here actually here Chase can can you help complete what Colin was trying to do and uh we just need the headphones and the uh  right oh boy that was not a good throw okay in the meantime I can walk you sorry Chase you're gonna have to do that somewhere else you pick that you picked the one place oh wait David random or keyboard or uh monitor rather random or monitor these are kind of like heads or tails use them or not heads or tails do we need a coin again yeah hey oh wait no
how many do we have four we got four we could we could do a foursided dice do a foursided dice okay let's go all right what challenges are left here what do we got the mini putts we've got flip cup mini golf that's kind of it and then there's like a one that's just if you land on you get disadvantage oh okay wow we went through more than I thought okay you know what yeah sure I'll play your  game this is a really poor quality wheel I know we have to build a bigger one hey perfect mini golf wow that
was so if I win at mini golf I get an advantage yeah if I lose I roll two dice and I take the worst option well you let's have a look at what's let's have a look at what we've got here there's some really random stuff here you guys definitely achieved that we've got the Piko quote unquote zero latency wireless HDMI transmitter this will do up to 4K 30 HZ or 1080p oh this will do 1080p 12 HZ that is pretty cool we've tested these These are 60 GHz they'll do up to 25 M but
they do rely on being pretty well line of sight um and we did find that the latency is in fact very low on them this is this is pretty cool this would be a nice thing to have included we've also got a red Digital Cinema red rocket X this was the subject of one of our first holy s uh series videos where we basically got this thing with the intention of testing its functionality for improving the performance of red highresolution footage on the timeline and ultimately determined that it wasn't really a
useful part of our work flow and then I wanted to sell it and we apparently never got around to it so now we just have this worthless piece of e-w fpga card it's worth a they don't go for "$1,000 on eBay it's about a th000 bucks" "oh well you paid about 8,000 remember" well that would suck uh we've got a whe kids edition I definitely want you to have this because it would take up less room in our warehouse if you had it and finally oh this is a cool piece of water cooling
history the 3D Galaxy 2 from gigabyte we did a full video on this bad boy and apparently we packed it all back up perfectly nicely for you it's support Intel Core i7 processor so you can enjoy that all right so uh I would say we go what in order of value yeah I think so so the red rocket X would be on the high end what's this peak dough thing worth the peo not worth not not too much I thought it was like 100 bucks okay so how about we go like that one to four yeah I like it okay and so I'm playing
mini golf now mini golf is that right yeah I think you get three chances to get it in either hole I get oh I get to  okay you can move that thing it's just that it kind of un it rolls I mean did you at least manag to get real golf B I don't know slightly better than what you  okay they call me happy oh crap okay um I I say it was unfair cuz there's a bump here that's probably why it went off and that all of a sudden while you after you shot that was my practice one right sure yeah you
know what you're not going to get it [Laughter] anyway what a jerk all right okay no no that's fine that's fine no no I got this okay here  okay well that was closer yeah he's sweating now okay some of the hot sauce oh come  hole last attempt oh one more you got one more you got one more one more one more I don't even want it I don't want your pity attempt all right he just a crap okay two rolls here we go uh Glenn are you my roll cam oh no and uh is it Andrew I've got a technical issue but
I'm all good all right Glenn Glenn's coming in okay so I roll twice and then I take whatever the less favorable one is the Yeah the more expensive one is okay hey well I don't think we need I don't think we need to roll that again uh critical fail okay I guess you're getting a red rock ET X I didn't know these were still "worth $1,000 yeah they're not they're" not worthless huh okay well I guess um the world's most expensive hood ornament let's get the uh let's get the VHB out
again here we go oh this one's uh this one's almost out I guess is this thing even going to work we'll find out like do we know uh we did not test every single part no there a lot of parts of dust sick oh right we still need to do the monitor yep we're not even done yet good Lord all right if you guys are tuning in now I have to sell this computer for a dollar no matter what it is so far man I can't believe how much the value went up from this stupid card so far it's worth
somewhere in the neighborhood of around "$1,500 for the actual guts of the" computer including that $600 case and "then we just added $1,000 to our total" with this red rocket X like processing card surely nobody is paying that kind of money for these things these days you're so much better off just using a GPU unless I'm missing something here I mean they only got a 20 Series so they kind of Might maybe need it yeah that's fair enough no seriously though even like dude even like nine series is
probably better than this you really is it that old yeah it's really old like these were I don't even know if these were relevant anymore when we were in like the Langley house wow or no maybe it was postl no it was post Lely house I lied I lied okay yep there yeah oh that looks good there you go we just increase the value of this system by about 60% enjoy it I'm seeing them on eBay for $200 says we've got a riser so we do have another Riser cable if you do want to plug it in
it needs to live there it doesn't do anything useful all right let's do the monitor there are some really weird options here we've got the HP compact compact compact what la2205wg pric is bruh it's 22 in um with you know 16 by1 aspect ratio which is kind of nice oh this is from the tech shop yeah okay so it's a piece of LTT video history we've got the nylocks all wish gaming setup monitor uh enjoy we've got what's number three here uh so it's what is number three what is
number oh it's the zoi down here oh oh that seems pretty good oh yeah we jump up pretty quick oh oh wow you're getting a oh you're probably getting a pretty decent monitor 240 HZ TN a good Esports monitor even if it's a few years old number four we've got the gis OLED personal Cinema um uses Batman v Superman images on their website so you know it's good not actually an 800 in screen yeah that's probably an important disclaimer to have on there I haven't actually tried this thing I've tried things like
it oh wow it has a 2d to 3D switch so  content you can use it with your one-handed keyboard uh sorry sorry I the look everyone was thinking it uh number five uh I think is the oh the EJ interview oh that is a pretty cool little piece of History so this uh for the all EVGA PC we had to buy uh cuz I don't think even EVGA had any of this disastrous product kicking around but pretty much what it is is it's a dual monitor monitor where each one can flip around so you can like collaborate or
like whatever it's I don't know it's pretty cool it's terrible for gaming and it requires dual DVI inputs so enjoy that uh number six is an anchor nebula project for 700 bucks probably a terrible computer monitor uh number eight is wait we've got six seven is the aegon pro 1440p OLED oh wow we're getting into some really nice stuff 240 HZ g-sync uh number oh my God so what what are we getting to now eight is a ",000 MSI 315 in cuti OLED ploof said he" made a mistake buying the alien wear
over this that is a strong endorsement number nine is the one that I am personally using at home right now the Rog Swift pg42 uq 138 Herz with overclocking OLED this thing is absolutely sick it's 4K and then what well what how does it go up from there the Dell oh my gosh up is subjetive the Dell 8K Ultra sharp it's Ultra sharp what else do you need to know do you how many times I have asked to for this to be sold while it's still "worth something it is not worth $3,800"
that thing sucks uh I would be happy to roll a 10 okay where's my 10-sided die here you want to roll and if you get a 10 you can give it  uhse what else is left on your stupid wheel the it's not even I cup I don't even think there's anything that bad no I don't all there is is flip cup so you want to play yeah I'll play flip cup sure sure I'll play flip cup for an advantage how you guys doing out there in chat you got a merch message to hit me up while we're setting up uh or hit
me up with Dan while we're setting up yeah yeah yeah I got one here um are you doing a computer sleeve oh whoops as a 12 sided die I grabbed the wrong one oh no am I doing I a sleeve yeah cuz you done MCM those are such a they're such a commodity item you can get them for like $4 on Amazon I don't want to compete with that you know shell uh you have 30 seconds to flip two of them and they have to land on their butt like land on this I've never played flip I thought it was like a bottle flip
I I'm I'm pretty okay at that um wow did they really put in the work to make different molds for the different numbers on the bottoms of these so that they could be in order in the box or like what was the point of this they might just be hot stamp uh Dan are you getting close up D there he is trying to oh yeah he's got this like really and yeah this one's 12 like they're all they're all different that's a really weird thing to spend extra money on for your for your mold okay you ready like
it's probably an interchangeable piece you don't have to do an entirely new mold for that oh no I know what it is it's probably a single mold that shoots a whole bunch of cups at the same time and then they just like numbered what spot it was in so that way if they have a quality issue then they can go back and they can find which one they should gate off okay I figured it out three two one go does that count yeah so did I get two get you have to get three what no you
can't just change the rules to I have to get three I can't I'm the game master well that's stupid that's what they called me in high [Laughter] school 10 seconds but I got the first two so well I did such a good job hey all right I roll with advantage let's go   go oh do we have two 10-sided die dice here I'm going to roll it here got that high contrast know a  me sorry I think you hit me right in the  all right we got five and seven so I get to pick dealer's Choice wow that's a
that seven is a really nice monitor oh  oh uh how are we even going to ship that I'm okay with the Dell like do we have packaging for it no it's not the Dell it's the no I'm saying you if you want to upgrade to the Dell uh no no no no no it's got to be the dice the dice you're right I've lost track of the The Narrative the night the dice control the narrative oh man what do you guys even want the the seven guys I don't think I don't think that's how it works you can't just be like this is my advantage
not your advantage they all want this you know what okay sure all right all right aegon pro aegon pro monitor uh let's get this on here let's try this thing let's see if this is an actual usable setup or not ow my foot my wet foot uncomfortable um they've been better but as someone who regularly wears sandals when it rains um I've had to deal with this before and not knowing ahead of time that we were doing this I actually put on wool socks this morning huh so I have the wicking power of wool helping
me out at least a little little bit it mostly works when your feet are moist not wet and uh I had to dunk my feet all the way into the water so they're they're pretty wet but I'm still I'm still not suffering as much as I all right this feels like an unnecessarily complicated assembly process I kind of wish I had picked the EVGA at this point but that's fine that's fine that's how the cookie crumbles that's how the dice roll uh David do you want to get us uh powered up here yes
all right let's do this thing I've got your other power thing I've got display port I don't need that but what I'm really looking for yes this is these screws excellent wait no I need display port or you know what no let's just leave that package we'll grab our own cable all right uh Dan do you want to hit me with a merch message yeah sure I got a few here now thankfully let's see hi guys I was recently on a trip 12:00 a.m. 9 hours before my return flight I broke my phone luckily I had my backup
note Sim Swap and good to go any stories of when past Tech you had um got your back oh I mean obviously my uh I what the heck oh interesting see I assumed there was going to be a vase amount on the back of this Monitor and that like just you know when I quickly looked at it I assumed this interfaced with that but that is in fact not the case um this is if you want to vase amount the monitor so I don't need it and this just goes on the back here okay I mean you know what um I'll allow it sure okay
that's a pretty painless setup process actually I take back what I said before um past T saving my bacon I mean I got to imagine there's been some situations where cameras have been dragged out of the moth balls like oh yeah we did a shoot once uh this was years ago where we pulled one of the Old Black Magic Cinema cameras off the shelf and we're like okay thank goodness we have something usable to capture this angle because otherwise we were absolutely doomed cuz there was no time
to rent something um but realistically most of that stuff for me is going to be work related because uh for many many many years now I've had as you can probably imagine pretty solid access to um a stable of tech stuff that I can use if I if I need to in a pinch I oh why is there cable hanging off of this you know what it doesn't matter the point is let's fire it up and see if she works uh Dan you want to hit me with another merch message sure sure sure sure um sup Daniel and not Luke if
you're reading this thanks for taking away $50 for Stuff heading to New Zealand more the groan uh more seriously do any one of you have stories about past australasia Tech Adventures I have never been to Australia or New Zealand have never been down under um I'm not even sure if I have ever been south of the Equator um oh hey whoa it works I no I mean which is what I was expecting obviously um man I I would have love to do I I had uh I had some I forget like a chat or there's a comment on something
at some point that was saying hey you should you should come down for PAX Australia Pax south or whatever they called it back in the day um and I was I was like super super down and really interested in doing that but ultimately never made it work and I've just I've just not managed to I've not managed to make it happen so someday I would really love to but not yet we will need probably to upgrade the GPU drivers is my guess oh yeah yeah that's fine I also want to turn on XMP oh yeah yeah I'm
going for bonus points here we got this uh Dan hit me again sure lonus what is your favorite Star Wars movie or TV series no no do it I got to tell you I'm so over Star Wars at this point um David and I could probably de debate this for the entire rest of the stream uh he is well actually okay we're not I don't think we're as far I don't think we're as far off each other as we used to be because we've reached a bit of a middle ground where I can agree with him that the Last Jedi has some valid some
validity as a film and he can agree with me that it's a terrible Star Wars movie Yes um so we've managed to find some commonality there but I do feel quite strongly that the entire sequel Trilogy um the right thing to do would be to just throw it in the garbage declare it non-canon and start over Andor I haven't seen Andor you got to watch Andor I haven't seen Andor yet which is I understand probably a mistake so I I would like to I would like to check out Andor but if I had to
pick a favorite I almost have to go back to when I loved Star Wars because now I'm so just over it that I I kind of I kind of just can't care very much anymore um and when I was a kid this is going to be super unpopular but Jedi was my favorite um I loved Return of the Jedi um it's got of the origin Trilogy it's got by far the best lightsaber fight I mean I don't think that's controversial like yeah that l i I don't know what it is but like Luke's green saber uh looked awesome like the special
effects had improved so much and obviously there's more to a film than special effects and you can make arguments all day about there being you know better films and better Star Wars films and uh you know Empire is obviously the one that everyone kind of goes to as the the best of the original trilogy and it it's it's awesome but I feel like I wasn't there in that moment I didn't experience the Cliffhanger of the end of Empire and the like six-year weight or whatever it
was for Jedi um like I just watched them back to back to back to back or back to back to back as a kid and you know Jedi is the big payoff like when you're a kid you know good versus evil is is you know that's what you want to see you're just like green saber and he's like he's got his own saber now and he's like so powerful and he kicks Darth Vader but you know it's it's it's it's awesome right and again I was a kid right so Ewoks never bothered me in the slightest and whereas I was much older I mean by
the time Jar Jar Binks showed up it was 1999 so I was 13 um Jar Jar Binks was not cool whereas my little siblings didn't have a problem with with him um I like Revenge of the Sith as well yeah I actually really like Revenge of the Sith I'd say I'd say those are my two favorites and I will not out of the first two trilogies I will not pick a favorite out of the third Trilogy because it's garbage is jar jar a Sith Lord jarar I love that theory what do you mean is jar jar a
Sith Lord have you heard that theory no that's not even a question yes jarjar is  I in all seriousness though I don't know if I buy that he's a Sith Lord but I love the conspiracy theory and I just it's it's so compelling a read that I want to believe it but no jar jar is not a Sith Lord I'm sorry oh I'll take that thanks I could actually use a little bit more water all right Dan you got anything else for me well we wait for drivers to install you need more water uh let's see here we go hello de and not
here I always listen to the W show on Spotify because I have work on Friday nights and I'm glad to catch this live any updates on the fail pen or laser I'm uh excited to check it out colon the number three oh the fail pen I think is very soon I mean I've seen packaging I've seen final production so that's got to be like not soon TM that's got to be very soon fail laser is probably quite a way out I've seen functioning prototypes that are really close but I haven't seen final Machining for the housing I
haven't seen a final PCB I haven't I don't think we've selected a lens yet cuz like it's me we set out to just turn garbage into you know a novelty item and like what we're going to make a laser pointer that has like bad spread this is what I always do it's what I always do so that one's going to take a while but the fail the fail pen is going to be awesome um even without factoring in that a lot of it was liability material uh the costs on those that we've seen like for competitive products
don't make sense to us I think we're going to be very competitively priced uh like it's funny because we take a lot of flack for the the the prices of things on the store but our margins are not actually unreasonable and I think that as we get into some of the new categories that we're planning to get into over the coming years uh you guys are going to discover that you know sometimes uh we were actually very reasonable and uh there's just certain things that people would just I don't
know are are used to paying a lot more for I don't know what to tell you are you looking for drivers I am looking D only drivers I saw were Intel ones and they should all be already be installed on that cop windows but oh okay cuz I'm definitely missing base system device PCI device definitely then download it maybe it's just okay uh maybe I can get that directly from Intel z590 D all right Dan hit me sure what is your  time see I tend I tend to be relatively non sentimental when it comes to
technology I I definitely look back on things that I used that especially things that were unique and were never really replaced like I um like I I like I look back on the era when PC desktop audio was a much bigger thing and it was a was oh a newer version is already installed you know what we're just going to try and launch a game and see what happens then without the base system device and all that we we'll deal with it later um because the chipset driver was not needed uh so so yeah like
desktop audio I look back you know when creative gigaworks uh had these or creative had these like gigaworks 7.1 desktop audio setups that sounded really solid and uh gave you like great positional audio um like the oh man the clips prom media Ultra 5.1 we obtained one of those for some video recently and I tomorrow I saw it in the warehouse I'm like yeah I want that on my desk Just for Old Time sake when we're done I'm putting it I'm putting it on my system I'm so excited for that because they
just don't they don't make them like they used to when it comes to desktop audio I also okay Doom maternal did not launch so we'll try that again in a sec here uh we also have one more category of random things oh do we now headphones oh oh okay I guess we'll have to do that let's let's let this try and launch in for a second um trying to think like  nostalgia oh this monitor has built-in speakers I am going to mute them one moment oh thanks do maternal that's really helpful why does it do that I don't know
why it does that favorite GPU generation I I think it's more just what life stage you were at when you when you had it like I loved my all-in Wonder 9600 Pro that was my first real like gaming GPU and what was really cool about it was it had a built-in TV tuner cart so I could game and then I could plug it into a cable jack and I could record TV shows like I I had like too on my computer with my GPU which is wild right um and it's really too bad that that all died uh and it basically came
down to the US cable companies not being willing to support cable cart which was really unfortunate because that would have been sick if we could just DVR everything on our computers but um they wanted to sell set top boxes that had that functionality that you paid a subscription for right and it's funny to me because all they had to do is just charge you the subscription fee for the cable card I would have rather used my computer for it and had the flexibility of all those different outputs and you
know powerful Community software or or even like Windows Media Center Edition man I loved Windows Media Center Edition uh but it just yeah didn't take off it's just really unfortunate in my mind most people  care most people probably Pro probably over it all right want to hit me again while we wait for the loading screen sure good evening lisent team have gloves been discussed before behind the scenes Apple leather cloth some stretchy material open finger perhaps I would grab a pair for chil gaming or
workouts we did plan on doing an entire video on it was either a video on weird gaming accessories or it was a video on gaming gloves and we had a whole bunch of them and I think it kind of ended up in in video Purgatory where we sourced everything that we needed for it but then it was never the best video we could work on that week and then I think we were considering moving it to a short circuit but then I think it's still in a on the LT shelf so maybe Belle never got
it that that is something that I would like to do and we intended to do and you know what we'll do there we'll do it but we haven't done it yet personally I get so warm in general that I don't really need gloves when I'm gaming but hey everyone's uh everyone's a little different and however different you may or may not be you are going to enjoy the heck out of this sick system I mean look I I don't have this cranked but we're at 1440p actually this is this is pretty cranked uh static resolution scaling
Ultra nightmare for the most part this looks awesome we have Ray tracing on okay we are using dlss but we're using quality dlss and we're getting I don't know casual 140 frames per second yeah it's not the most demanding game in the world or anything like that but it is absolutely a modern game and it looks fantastic how does it sound how does it s oh oh we have one more roll that's right do we have a die how many sides eight-sided die I gotta I gotcha that's 10 where's my eight-sided
die come here you oh do we only have one eight-sided die yeah okay one ided die that's fine we got this and I've already made my way through the entire wheel so whatever we get is what we get this entire setup will sell for $2 and you can end up with the L surprise kid safe head set featuring a volume limiter for developing ears you could end up with a g435 wireless or Bluetooth is this even a headset or is this just headphones yeah it's a headset okay sure yeah why not uh 30 bucks you
can end up with Kraken Kitty Edition oh wow has that meow Factor um headphones from Razer cool good job Razer uh there's the Alienware 720 h's not good for the price of $160 but pretty solid for $2 we've got the Logitech Pro for the Quest 2 does the Quest 2 version work with the regular one isn't it just headph I it's I don't know I find out or maybe not guess we'll find out oh these are really nice you could get some AKG k7x X's this is mass drop's first collab with AKG uh those are those are great
they're comfy they sound awesome oh my God we're getting into some really expensive stuff odsy Mobius 400 OD odsy Mobius is for $400 very special means nothing more like odds nuts  David low hanging fruit these I legit do not want to say goodbye to these are the Mast dropex focal Alex and they are worth about what was  $600 these are super comfy they sound absolutely flipping incredible uh they're open backed so the H The Sound Stage is amazing like they're oh this is this is as
close I okay I won't say that but this is one of those pairs of headphones where it's basically like listening to really nice speakers in the room with you that's a really really nice pair of headphones I would I would rather not sell them for $2 I would strongly prefer not to but I guess uh yeah I don't know about that my stomach's already six okay okay all right I'll allow it that's a really really nice pair of headphones k7xx is worth about 250 bucks uh but I don't have to give up the
Alex this is a very solid setup yeah it's funny how we didn't end up with okay we ended up with some garbage tier stuff the keyboard and mouse are pretty bad for the SD cards that run the whole oh yeah cuz they don't get to keep the SSD they they get the micro SD yeah okay no never mind there's some this computer with a red rocket glued to the top of it okay Dan and the side missing okay Dan you're not helping I know this is great job shush it's a pretty there's some good
things about it how about that can we all agree on that yep it has redeeming qualities do you mind plugging this in absolutely I'm yeah oh sorry not you're good all right oh yeah these are some nice headphones all right let's uh let's try another game want to hit me with a merch message Dan sure oh let's see here I opened the wrong tab hey guys what's  brackets this oh CPU like like anti- boing like I guess so anti-bending brackets I mean I'm not sure exactly what product you're referring to uh
anti-bending CPU bracket oh you L contact frames okay so like any product that potentially voids your warranty I would just say uh proceed with care um it's probable that your motherboard manufacturer wouldn't even know if you took off the stock retention Hardware so realistically you don't have to tell them if an related thing goes wrong with your board however if you bust something so if you're going to install this thing and you bend some pins or you're going to install this
thing you accidentally uh you know scratch the top of the motherboard and you and you scratch a trace um the ethical thing to do is to is to that's that's not covered under warranty that's not warranty that's that's user error um so would be to to not try to claim any kind of warranty coverage but you know warranty support aside hey if you can get a little bit better performance if you can get a little bit better contact between your cooler and your CPU especially these
days where that really is the bottleneck it's not whether we can dissipate the 250 watts of heat or well 400 watts of heat that you might get out of uh out of a top tier Intel chip it's how small the dye is and how efficiently we can move the heat away from that Dy into your cooling solution so with that in mind anything that we can do to improve that bottleneck is absolutely something that I would be supportive of I don't know that I would put one of the am5 ones on I haven't really seen any difference in
performance as long as you've got a decent cooler whereas on the Intel side yeah they they can actually Turbo higher right out of the box if you've got a top tier chip um the ones that are really sketchy are the ones where you deld and then you've got a frame um if I was not an advanced user I would only really consider one of those in a pre-built system what's cool though is you can actually get pre-built systems that have those delited CPUs in them from select system integrators you
can get them with warranty which is kind  me all right Dan hit me sure I'm apparently downloading content wow also at some point we'll want to explain how people can buy this computer oh yeah I don't know how people buy the computer why don't we do that instead of a merge message sure I don't know exactly but that's part of the fun uh on the LTT store.com website I believe if you click the banner after we make it go live it's not live yet there'll be a little scavenger hunt you
got to find 10 pieces uh and if you find the 10 pieces you're going to get a code where you can check out this computer for $2 10 pieces of what okay all right well apparently more will be evident once the banner goes live yeah all right rock on good job everyone all right Dan hit me hey lonus what is is a big passion project you really want to do but everyone at LTT  fools David tried to talk me out of the crazy concept we did for April fools this week uh or uh this year uh I'm oh
man I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure the team was close to Mutiny when we did whole room water cooling it the problem was that the swifttech fittings and tubing were not quite properly sized for each other even though they were both from swifttech so tightening them like I might have done permanent damage to my left hand trying to trying to tighten those things on it it was really it was really awful trying to think can you think of anything that was like everyone tried to 
of I mean my whole thing is I end up being right more often than not like even when we do really crazy stuff I you're right like screwdriver was crazy the amount of money we put into that that's been a huge success um I mean the company itself seemed like a like a crazy bet in the first place like I uh I don't I don't know like I we we definitely need more structure to our decision- making which is why we're we're bringing experienced leadership in from outside of the company to to help
us as we grow but when it comes to you know here's a here's a wild pitch uh gut feeling um yeah I'm bad pretty good I have some but I can't say them on stream really I'm not going to say that one stream oh all right all right you have to tell me after do you want me to M the audio I'm I'm mostly playing oh um okay no I'm legitimately curious cuz like I'll mute you anything we can  no can we dose we have fun we have a lot of fun we have fun here red flag red flag red flag red
we have kind of a family run Vibe red  flag all right let's wait a thousand years for why did I even launch Halo infin I don't know why you did I should I'm over it cyber Punk let's go perfect oh starting download oh what are you downloading all right Dan hit me with another sure hi lonus uh have you ever visited the Netherlands longtime fan I have not unfortunately thank you for asking thank you for watching presumably from the Netherlands but I wait hold on where's where's
Amsterdam the Netherlands is that in Netherlands oh yes I have visited the Netherlands I totally forgot about that it it like dawned on me I was like wait no I stayed for um I st it wasn't quite a layover I I passed through the Netherlands on my way to Paris for my high school graduation trip how long um I was there for one night that doesn't count one night is better than like a playover no no I was I saw the bicycles okay I got to experience bicycle parades which I have never seen before and never
seen since no seriously multi-level bicycle parad it's a thing it's wild it blew my mind so there yes I have nothing else to see that's it there's way more fun there oh I'm sure there's way more fun stuff to do there I was there with my mother though ah yes so that should tell you everything you need your mom sounds lame about how much of the Amsterdam fun I would have been having  yeah and look you know what okay cool yep anyway yes I have been to the Netherlands can confirm oh my God cyber
Punk is updating nothing nothing is ever nothing is ever easy welcome to welcome to streaming you know what though it's coming down at a pretty good speed and oh no up can we kill seven minutes how many merch messages you got Dan I got another seven all right I'll try and get through them in one minute each then we'll play some cyber Punk see how the performance is and that'll be it sounds good hit me thanks for your sacrifices to your finances Linkus uh what's the oldest generation
of Intel processor you would recommend  ooh it depends what you're doing you know if you're running some kind of mission critical infrastructure and we're talking Zeon then all of a sudden you know Spectre and meltdown mitigations and and and the latest firmware updates all of that's going to matter to me if we're not talking about  quadcore for a gamer these days I don't know if I can recommend it so I don't think I can go all the way back to seventh gen but I think I could I think
I could go back to eighth gen without too much question as long as I get a six core chip from eighth gen I would rather have ninth gen for sure but I would I would be willing to go eth Gen hello game master future Dan and L Sebastian have you found a daily driver phone laptop combo uh how was the water cooled $1 million server going and have you ever thought about upgrading the gaming minivan to an RV that is three questions um which is fine so my combo right now I am in between framework
laptops I think I'm going to be doing a short circuit soon where I build myself an AMD framework laptop because that's what I've been kind of waiting to switch to I'm very excited about that uh but right now I'm Still rocking the note 9 I'll treat myself to a new phone at some point I really man see the thing is I understand why fairphone was upset about the review because I evaluated it as a phone um compared to other phones that I could buy for that amount of money as a consumer instead of
evaluating it as a as a as a movement um and you know I tried to I tried to make it clear in the video that I was supportive of what they're trying to do but that that's not a phone that I could recommend for that price they were they were pretty mad um and and I get it but honestly I was I was also very disappointed that I wasn't able to daily drive that because I was really looking for a device that I could kind of like my note 9 lock in on set up all my stuff which for me is
particularly tedious um with some of the things that as a business owner I have set up on my phone um and I was hoping like that was going to be the one for a lot of years and I could review another phone here and there but I would always have that in my back pocket but the battery life was so bad U the the ringer was unusable like there were just enough deal-breaking bugs that I just couldn't do it um so I'm I don't know I just I don't I don't find phones very emotional
right now if that kind of makes sense like apple keeps launching another iPhone and I really I mean that it's another iPhone what is Apple launching this year another iPhone what's what's emotional about it for me nothing um I would love to see I'd love to try daily driving a Sony but I need them to fix their back button placement um allowing it to be moved before I can do that uh I like that they haven't completely abandoned the headphone jack like that's something I could have an
emotional connection to it's like yeah I can I can use my wired headphones with convenience again I'm not going to carry an MP3 player with me like that's not realistic for me I'm a I already I have enough things in my pockets I I don't want another heavy thing in my pocket right um yeah so so realistically I'm just still using my note 9 that's it it's it's broken it's it's actually like kind of painful now cuz I I'll like have it on my bed next to me when I'm charging and
it'll like uh It'll like come down to my arm when I'm sleeping and like a little like GL sharp glass piece will like kind of hit my arm I'll be like ow it's legitimately really bad but uh yeah I'm I'm using that and then I'm also using the RG flow x13 this is with "the 7,000 series and I believe it has" what does it have in it like a 4060 or something like that this is a really sick laptop so sick for the form factor yeah I know remember remember that's going to be that's going to be TDP
limited yeah it's a 4070 in here which is like okay sure in video okay uh but it has that XG mobile connection which I would never recommend anyone actually spend the money for an XG mobile egpu but I've seen people do it um it's really cool and and since they sent over one as part of our like reviewers kit for this I do use it from time to time if I need extra GPU horsepower and it really convenient so it's a really cool machine even if it's not one that I would necessarily want to personally
spend all the money on but like man it's convertible it's powerful enough to game especially this this newest one that I don't even really need the XG mobile like you could you could just play games on it and uh the io is solid it's got a usba a two USB C's HDMI like I I don't know man it's headphone jack I I kind of really love this thing um but I will go back to daily driving a framework if for no reason other than that I I take my role as an investor seriously enough that I want to daily
drive it so that I can provide feedback on it anything that uh is going well anything that's not going well to do whatever I can to kind of keep them on course cuz you know money changes everything right they just went through another funding round and you know every time they do another funding round and new money and new investment comes in they're expecting something and the thing they're expecting is not good vibes and changing the industry for the better so if nothing else I can just be a voice
in the in the leadership's ear going right right right right right but remember remember the original goal and I'm not saying that they've needed it they haven't they haven't deviated from it in the slightest I've been really um really proud of them I guess for uh for just being laser focused on that upgradeability that modularity on reducing waste uh but I I want to make sure that I'm still in the ecosystem so that if I get really frustrated with their lack of touchscreen options for
example I can share that genuine response as a longtime user of the product instead of just it being a a meeting note for them to talk about you know I don't know maybe that doesn't make sense but yeah I I really do want them to get touchcreen figured out so got about five more here all right hit me Dan sure uh how we how we doing on the end we kind of nearing telling people how to buy seconds remaining to launch it go live basically as we end the stream oh the system's going live
right as we end y man we'll play a little bit and then we'll we'll go live and sure okay I got one here answer this and I'll sub to float plane for a year says Sam W okay Sam what on Wan show you said to call out hypocrisy so here it is you always bash on Twitter SLX but it's required for almost all of your giveaways why because it's really convenient and note that I bash on it sure it's a dumpster fire absolutely but I'm on it and I've talked about the benefits of it even
though I don't keep the app on my phone anymore because I found it was taking up far too much of my time and I don't have the discipline to not use it um I do still use it on desktop and it is still very useful in the same way that Facebook is very useful I don't have a Facebook account because I think it's cool I have a Facebook account because Facebook is kind of the the modern phone book like if I wanted to get in touch with somebody from an earlier part of my life what I'm going to pick up the white
pages are you kidding me no I'm going to go on Facebook and I'm going to I'm going to Ping them and I'm going to be like hey can can we connect can we DM right so Twitter is the same thing but for kind of different subsets of people if I wanted to get in touch with the developer of some open source project the odds of them being on Twitter really high the odds of them having an email that's easy to find more like moderate you get what I mean so Twitter is a useful tool uh Twitter has a lot of
infrastructure around it for doing things like running giveaways dumpster fire  absolutely see you on float plane Sam on Flo plane uh uh I started to look into more advanced home automations during the last few months and and I'm just curious are there any updates on your smart home  video no it kind of sucks I'm still waiting on those new switches from inavi I I I think they're making progress I hope they're making progress uh they they're going to use millimeter wave for
presence detection instead of motion which is really really exciting to me because they should basically be able to tell if a human is in the room instead of being able to tell if someone moved it's still not going to work for everything for example in my garage I have a paint booth that I'm using for my motorcycle painting project I actually showed it a little bit in the recent video where we decorated pl's car um and I don't I doubt that millimeter wave is going to be able to
see through that and see me because it shouldn't be able to pass through pretty much any object so it won't work for everything but it'll work way better for rooms like the family room of sitting and and and watching a movie for example so I'm excited about that I have put off fixing all of my blinds Integrations because we don't really need to change them that much and I kind of want to do it the same time that we do all the lights so I suspect sometime hopefully this summer or this Autumn uh Jake and I
are going to sync up and like get it actually smart because right now it has a lot of smarts in it but it's kind of like a it's it's kind of like a like a like a you know a a heavyweight boxer's brain you know there's a lot of brain cells in it but they don't really work together very  know all right let's see cyberp Punk time to check this out let's go gonna head over to you Mr Andrew those one more one sec get in there nice all right now it's big uh any advice for an upand cominging Creator who are strong
diversify oh man that's tough because I gota I gotta confess to you I don't I don't know Tik Tok I don't I don't get Tik Tock um like I I see I I kind of understand I think fundamentally how the how the monetization works on it um I kind of I kind of get that what you want to Target is very high Loop ability for retention um but I haven't I haven't lived and breathed the Tik Tok algorithm I haven't extensively created content for Tik Tok it's not something that I have deep familiarity with but what I do
know is that a lot of Tik Tok creators have had a ton of success moving their audiences over to YouTube they just have to figure out you know what that audience wants to see that also fits in well with the YouTube platform because you can't just upload what your Tik Tok audience wants to see to YouTube and  success uh okay here I need this car can I have this car hey thanks a she's okay oh my God she has a gun well I mean yeah that's wow am I gonna kick that guy out of the
car or what oh no he's he's going to leave he's going to leave he's leaving so this is not bad is it running it perfect Ray tracing medium with the LSS looking pretty fly no we're seeing 1% lows in the neighborhood of around 20 but it's reasonably smooth remember our display does support gsync which is pretty cool so that 20 FPS doesn't look like 20 FPS it probably looks a little bit more like 35 classic you know without uh uhoh oh look tops are here like classic 35 without variable refresh rate okay here
we go here we go here we go no I'm out of here I'm out of here I'm out of here see you later oh oh sorry buddy sorry buddy oh man what what these are we got like a gang here oh oh I hit a barricade uh Dan do you have any more that I should hit before we're done sure I got two more here umy this a 1440p too so we're not even running at 1080p yeah what kind of frames a second are we getting we're averaging about 55 we're just seeing some some lower dips I would probably turn off R tracing if I
was actually playing this game looks from from Ireland I have three kids that are massive fans me personally I've been following LTT since 2010 only question I have to ask is what is your favorite DC animated movie much love oh I haven't watched many DC animated movies I only recently saw mask of the fantasm I watched the Animated Series occasionally as a kid but I didn't have my my family didn't have TV when I was that age and when Batman the Animated Series was on TV so I didn't really have an
opportunity to watch it a lot like I would see it once in a while when I went over to my friend's house and we were both being babysitted after school right um so I only watched mask of the fantasm like a couple of months ago and that's probably the only one I've seen so I guess I'll go with that since it's the only one I've seen oh wow what the heck is this buddy calm down and I'm dead all right Dan you got any more I got one last one here for you and then the PC is for sale what we have an 119 10900k was
it 10th gen 11 11 11 11900 K we've got 32 gigs of RAM we've got an RTX there we go 2080 TI custom color whoops I don't know what that is is we've got a Micro SD um SSD that uh basically you'll have to BYO storage we've got an 850 watt inwind power supply NZXT motherboard hyper 212 Evo CPU we we were getting over 1 130 FPS and do maternal uh rate tracing medium 1440p we were getting around 6 55 FPS dipping down to the 20s at the very lowest we've got a 1440p OLED gaming monitor that'll do up to 240 HZ these
terrible terrible peripherals but wonderful headphones and all this can be yours for2 us on LTT store.com is plus shipping uh $50 flat rate shipping plus $50 flat rate shipping and it will be going live with a scavenger hunt so you'll have to click the banner and complete the scavenger hunt as soon as we do this last merch message sure all right hit me Dan thank you for all the years of entertainment watch your videos every time I come home the only question I have do you have anything that you do
daily just for yourself um badminton I mean yeah I don't do that daily I uh crying in the bathroom yeah hiding in the bathroom I definitely do that on an almost daily basis just like hiding on my phone that's uh wow that's sad um okay
