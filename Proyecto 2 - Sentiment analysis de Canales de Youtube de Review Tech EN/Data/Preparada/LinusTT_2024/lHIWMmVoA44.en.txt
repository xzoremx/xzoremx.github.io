ah I have been doing this for a long time and I still do not know how to make the perfect thumbnail do I add some big red arrow maybe a big smile maybe like this perhaps a touch of Z wait no of course I'll use YouTube's ABC thumbnail tester I mean sure it's twice as much work for our thumbnail artist Maria but hey uh you don't mind right um actually L know some great while you get that going I'm going to explain to the good people what exactly it is that we're up to with our little
experiment late last year we were given access to a tool that allows us to upload multiple thumbnails for the same video and then keep only the one that performs the best and we've spent many hours experimenting with some sometimes confusing results I mean times the winner is painfully obvious but other times it is impossible to decipher just what the heck you guys liked about the thumbnail of choice just like it's impossible to determine when I'm going to segue to our sponsor see I gotta that 
MSI does your gaming prowess need some divine intervention msi's Meg z790 Godlike Max motherboard might not actually make you a gaming deity but we'd like to imagine that if there was such a thing they'd be using one go check it out in the description below let's kick things off with a result that still has us flum mixed Belle's AMD Tech upgrade features him either on the left or on the right and the people have spoken and Bell on the right is our big winner with 56 points .9% of the shared
total watch time that means that those of you who watched it were served either of these two thumbnails during our test and the ones who clicked on this one stuck around for significantly longer or wait hold on a second stuck around longer yeah well here's the thing if YouTube gave creators a tool that just chose a winning thumbnail based on the clickthrough rate we would be straight back to the Dark Ages within a matter of hours so instead they built an incentive for this tool that aligns with their
agenda which is of course to keep you watching YouTube for as long as possible so the best thumbnail is the one that best sells the content that you're about to enjoy coming back to Bell then he thinks it's obviously because his left side is his better side who could blame him he's right but we think that it could have more to do with how the viewer's eye gets directed most of our audience speaks English which means that they probably read from left to right on the page so a thumbnail that
communicates in order there there is a strong correlation between the title and concept this is almost certainly a Linus Tech tips video and he's going to do an upgrade that makes a member of his team happy might outperform one that communicates here's a guy who's happy and doesn't look very stealthy oh by the way I think that's line is standing in an empty room maybe I don't know for this one your guess is as good as mine and I would love to hear your theories down below hey you yeah you if you want
to hear more of our theories Maria and I will be filming a closer look about the thumbnails we don't talk about in this video get subscribed to on float plane so you don't miss it and check out some of our other content while you wait let's change gears though and look at an easier one the Scorpion chair we pitted a pallet of unopened boxes against the chair in all of its Glory now conventional clickbait wisdom might be to give away as little information as possible in hopes of enticing you with
curiosity but as you can see the chair thumbnail won by a landslide with 69 nice. 2% of the shared watch time and in this case it's kind of obvious if you think about it you see the chair you click the chair you stay for the chair you see a pallet of boxes you click a pallet of boxes you get a weird chair well see you later it is entirely possible that the mystery boxes may have driven more clicks maybe a lot more clicks and they could have even resulted in more counted views but the cold hard
truth is that YouTube doesn't want to build tools that help an individual Creator get lots of views they want to build tools to increase viewer satisfaction on the platform as a whole which is a good thing it's just that it's really hard to do as it turned out the vast majority of our tests were much more evenly split even in cases where we uploaded dramatically different images check out this one I didn't even realize that we had started this test until I saw this thumbnail on my feed for
reacting to our best PC builds ever thumbnail one is the big open mouth that I saw while thumbnail 2 is a more relaxed natural smile I thought for sure that this one would help us end the cringe versus natural debate once and for all but as it turns out y'all mostly just kind of don't care the LT audience seems to slightly prefer a closed mouth or a natural smile versus a big wide oace one like this but typically by just 1 or 2% more watch time emoting in different ways does see some disparity
but it seems like it's less about lots of emotion and more about ensuring that the emotion or the mood suits the video when we replaced our office PCS with Dell oplex the neutral face ended up outperforming the disgusted face so maybe negativity is bad but then for the "$150,000 server video or frustrated or" upset thumbnail did way better than the one in which I'm smiling in some ways we've actually ended up with more questions than we had when we started what we think is happening though is
that some Expressions help us tell a better story and there's a lot more to it than just changing a face every element of the thumbnail helps paint a picture that informs and entices maybe this background color was just too aggro for a chill video like this one about Cable Management where I'm relaxing at my desk in a bathrobe people did not like the razor Green version and strongly prefer a more calming dark blue if we choose to use text or icons in our thumbnails we've got to ask oursel do we
need that big question mark could we label things more clearly is text even necessary or is the title of the video enough another big part of our experiment has been adding red arrows pointing at the subject of the video that it turns out though seems like a big no no when the subject or the item in question is super obvious like okay the building behind you clearly smash Champs and yeah that meta Quest 3 on your face you're obviously going to be talking about that we don't need a red
arrow to know that you can get this super comfy dip diey hoodie from LTT store.com do you Clarity is hugely important but no one wants to be beaten over the head with it with that said arrows pointing out small objects that aren't instantly recognizable those are 100% fair game and yeah most of this is kind of just graphic design 2011 the thumbnail is there to entice you draw the eye but not mislead or add anything unnecessary just never hurts to have a refresher course so the tldd are for our
whole experiment boils down to a few key points number one our core audience doesn't seem to care that much about the thumbnail in our first round of tests the watchtime share was pretty close to 50/50 so either we're so good at thumbnails that we can't make a bad one if we try or more likely our loyal subscribers know they want to watch LTT and if they click the video they're going to watch a decent amount of it whether my mouth is open or closed or I'm happy or sad or deranged or whatever
Point number two for those outside of our Cor audience like the people being served our video on the YouTube homepage thanks to the almighty algorithm Alm Alor for those folks Clarity is King they don't want to gamble on whether they're going to like what they're about to watch and if they can't tell what's going to happen or if they get 10 20 seconds into the video and they feel misled the odds of them sticking around are pretty low Point number three at the end of the day it's all just packaging
it's important but it's not that important you can think of the thumbnail and title of a video kind of like a candy wrapper I mean it's one thing to get somebody to buy your chocolate bar because it has shiny packaging but it is something else entirely to keep them coming back for more or recommending your candy to their friends and of course all of this needs to be taken as preliminary results while this ABC thumbnail tester is good and we are going to continue to use it it could be
better because currently it doesn't tell tell us some pretty important stuff like it doesn't tell us if anyone was served either thumbnail and didn't click at all it doesn't break the numbers down by subscriber versus new viewer and it's limited to just three images I mean imagine how much more we could learn if we could upload say 10 thumbnails at a time or if we could manually choose a specific thumbnail or set of thumbnails for the core audience and then something totally different for new viewers all of
this is almost certainly in YouTube's best interest and I fully expect them to continue to develop this tool and I also fully expect that as creators continue to experiment the small details are going to change even if the overall findings prove to be a constant kind of like I constantly segue to our sponsor Squarespace it's 2024 and your brand or business needs online presence listen I don't make the rules we just play by them building your own website may seem daunting but Squarespace is there to
