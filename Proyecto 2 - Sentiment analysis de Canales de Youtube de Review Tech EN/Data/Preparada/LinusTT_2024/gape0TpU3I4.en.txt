one of our top videos of all time is explaining what the heck i7 i5 and I3 mean so Intel fixed it by making it worse what exactly is a core Ultra 755h I can't blame you for having no idea because even Intel doesn't seem to know how this is going to work when the entry level mobile and the desktop chips launch I mean how can one be ultra but also mid and what is this just two high performance cores what is ultra about that the good news is that Intel's new meteor Lake chips are legitimately
exciting and naming aside if they are an indication of where Pat Ginger's Intel is headed I think we are seeing the first signs of a reestablishment of Intel's old dominance exhibit a the Asus Zenbook 14 OLED it packs a core Ultra 7 155h which means means something um here's a quick message from our sponsor first the ridge looking for a stylish and practical wallet well look at this they it's the ridge wallet it's got a minimalist design allows you to carry all your essential cards in cash without

playable at 30 FPS average instead of just 16 not only that it's nipping at amd's heels rocket League that is almost 69% nicer than last year's model and wait a minute what's this a clear win over AMD well not quite if we look closely at the all important one% lows the gains aren't quite as impressive especially in rocket League where we can't even hear amd's victory speech because they already dropped their mic so many times they broke it but with that said I love the trajectory that I'm seeing here in
one generation guys we are still on first generation Intel Arc Intel has gone from basically unusable to hey this thing's kind of viable let's bolt it onto our CPUs so all of a sudden they can AAA game Dota 2 running on Direct X11 big win for Arc Shadow the Tomb Raider another one Total War Pharaoh another one grid Legends not so much but Intel as adamant that they are seeing better results on their system for this one so hopefully that's just a bug that needs to be squashed now you may have
noticed Apple's M3 MacBook Pro sneak leak in into our gaming slides there and if you consider Apple's push toward the gaming crowd with their metal API it makes sense we thought it would only be fair to choose the most price appropriate model and see what it can do in comparison as it turns out even though we're going through a rosetta or Vulcan translation layer on both Tomb Raider and DOTA the answer is surprisingly well take a look at Dota 2 using Vulcan okay yes running all the systems
on Vulcan does harm our Windows machines results a little bit but apple is beating amd's results both on Vulcan and on dx11 like Intel apple is still struggling with frame time consistency and you can see that in the 1% low results but again this is all about trajectory and Apple has also gone from gaming loser to gaming Varsity jock practically overnight speaking of postsecondary H the Dropout sweater LTT store.com anyway there's still a giant blue elephant in the room and that is non-gaming performance
for core Ultra it's a kind of a mixed bag let's start with handbreak encoding Big Buck Bunny at 1080p with h264 in performance mode we get almost 63 frames per second that keeps up with both apple and AMD while beating our framework with the last gen 1370 P all right but we step that up to our 4K footage of Red Dead Redemption 2 and Intel's core Ultra looks more like a core somehow it even fell behind the last gen 1370 P I mean it's okay it's not like they lose by a lot but
regression from one generation to the next and look what happens when we encode with av1 yikes Apple Rockets into its own performance class entirely in our Big Buck Bunny 1080p test with coral CH falling into last place again and 4K Red Dead is a similar story with apple in the lead and Intel's latest in dead last one notable X Factor here though is that AMD pulls off a clear win not in speed but in file size so they might be going slower than Apple but you're going to end up with
near identical quality in files that are up to 15% smaller than the competition encoding isn't our core Ultra 7's only weak point either in our Chrome Benchmark which is admittedly not the best Showcase of Apple's typical browser capabilities sorry Safari Intel's new hotness loses again in jet stream 2 and in motion mark it does beat AMD in speedometer but it loses handily to both its own predecessor and to Apple oh speaking of Jetstream we've also got lwigs Beday in stock on LTT store.com
the swipe and swipe plus that that stream is sure to leave you nice and clean every time you do your business do your business can we just say poop we'll say poop moving on to cinebench multicore looking pretty good thanks to those two extra low power efficiency cores more on those and the npu later but the reduced clock speed really seems to hurt our single core performance and Puget bench's Photoshop Benchmark reveals a similar story where the new chip is actually slower than last chip inel
what have you done in search of better onboard gaming performance you've given us so much but at what cost not as much as you might think it's not all doom and gloom on the productivity side when it comes to szip compression for example wow the 155h smokes the competition in both standard and performance mode and while Photoshop wasn't great in the Premier Pro Benchmark it manages a very confident looking win but wait a second what happened with Apple well here's the thing you can find all of these laptops
at the links down below but to save you a bit of trouble the Asus cost about "$1,300 with 32 gigs of RAM the Acer also" "$1,300 with 16 gigs of RAM and our price" competitive MacBook Pro well it's only sort of price competitive to start with at "$1,600 but more importantly comes with" only 8 GB of memory which was not enough to complete this test without the program crashing now we could spend yet another $200 and have 16 gigs of ram in it but then we'd be pitting our Windows machines
against something that costs over 30% more money which seemed a little silly when the rest of the results do a pretty good job of showcasing the M3s potential and this allows me to make a point to Apple guys you've done this to yourself please stop selling 8 gig professional machines you saved like $15 to $20 on your bill of materials but on any workload that goes to a file you are embarrassing yourselves you're not the only one Intel didn't do too well in blender either and you know overall
mediocre improvements or even worse performance can be super disappointing when you're testing the new hotness but it's kind of hard to stay mad because while one window might have narrowed it's like an entirely new door has been flung open because aside from gaming performance meteor lake has another really cool trick up its sleeve let's talk about the the new neural Processing Unit or npu your current CPU and GPU combo can already handle AI workloads like stable diffusion or using
generative fill in Adobe Photoshop so I don't blame me for asking why exactly do we need an npu well let me tell you an npu is an integrated AI accelerator designed to enable new and enhanced experiences with the power efficiency required for mobile platforms we're going to do a full explainer over on techwiki but in a nutshell what this corporate marketing jargon means is that it helps to alleviate the strain on your CPU and GPU using processors that are more optimized for these loads it's kind
of like when ppus or physics processing units came out almost 20 years ago except that this time we just skipped the part where it's a dedicated card and went straight to adding a tile to the CPU that lights up when you're doing speech to text or background audio removal or whatever okay wait tile ah this is where meteor Lake gives us an exciting glimpse into Intel's future it's their first tile-based CPU packaging together several pieces of silicon on one chip rather than using a
traditional monolithic die you've got your main CPU tile which is built on the Intel 4 process with redwood Cove peores and Crestmont ecores an IO tile for con activity features like Thunderbolt and additional pcie Lanes a tsmc manufactured GPU tile for your arc graphics and then there's the really interesting tsmc manufactured s so tile this bad boy has actually got two LP or low power Island ecores that'll handle light tasks allowing the main p and course to be powered off completely to
extend battery life it's got Wi-Fi 6E which is supposedly upgradeable to Wi-Fi 7 later and Bluetooth 5.4 a knock or network on chip to interconnect all the different parts of the S so and they've even managed to pack the XE media and display engine here rather than using the GPU tile for your display out and simple video decoding tasks it's got some other stuff like USB 3 and ethernet audio security Etc and it's got that shiny new npu block the reason that I'm so excited about this is that suddenly
Intel can take a more modular approach to CPU design I mean look at how AMD can turn a single core complex die design and then repack pack it into anything from a basic desktop processor to a beastly server or workstation chip well that is similar to what we're looking at here new Wi-Fi plunk new CPU core architecture plun that in new arc battle mage Graphics plun that too tsmc's got a new node that you haven't figured out yet go ahead and plon that as well I see this modular design approach making
Intel far more agile and improving their competitiveness in a big way come back to the npu we don't really have a great Benchmark for testing these things yet and we don't even have another npu to drag race it against but in the proon machine learning inference Benchmark we got 241 points which is heads and tails above everything except for the arc graphics that Intel included on the very same chip however that doesn't mean it's a dud what's impressive about this result is that our power consumption
drops considerably when we push these workloads onto the npu so it might not be long before this is the part of your computer that's doing the lifting instead of your graphics cards at least when it comes to light everyday machine learning tasks which leads us finally into our discussion about the new naming conventions because I'm starting to think they used machine learning to come up with these all we've got right now is high in Mobile and the first thing is that after 15 years of begging Apple
finally convinced Intel to stop calling things I something instead we're going to have Intel Core and Intel Core Ultra followed by what Intel calls the Brand level these are somewhat familiar and denote what sort of power level you can expect three five and seven for the more mainstream core processors and then five seven and nine for the more premium core Ultra chips and yes that's a lot of overlap bigger numbers will generally indicate more cores faster ones and bigger caches
though with smaller ones being the opposite you guys still with me great next we've got the processor number which is broken down into series skew number and suffix you can think of it almost like a hard reset of the product stack so meteor Lake that's what we've got now that's the first in the series hence the one in our core Ultra 7 155h converting back to the old system for a moment this is 15th gen and a 16th gen replacement of this should be a core Ultra 72 55h and then so on and so forth
until they change it because who knows model numbers are arbitrary anyway the skew number is where it gets a bit more complicated I know right more complicated anyway this is where the numbers get a little more different from what we're used to the big curveball is that the skew number can be reused across different chips within the same generation more on that later anyway these denote multiple tiers within a stack so for example Le the Intel Core Ultra 5 135h and the 125h are similar
but the 135h has a 100 MHz clock bump finally there's the suffix I assume that k and t will be back on the desktop to denote overclockable and low power chips but so far we only have mobile and we only have two letters H or u h chips are typically more power hungry while U chips are meant for ultra slim devices that use less power this also has some precedent but the problem with this is that combined with the possibility for skew number reuse which I mentioned before it means that you can have no
idea how performant a processor is until you get to the suffix so Intel claims that they were trying to simplify things but in my opinion they have just made them more confusing okay no Mom sorry but that core Ultra 7 165 U sucks I need the core Ultra 7 165h cuz not only does it have more GPU course it has three times the performance course and double the cash there's a lot to like about meteor Lake and I love Intel's push to reinvest in process node leadership and build out a
competitive Foundry business I am not an analyst and this is not Financial advice but I'm excited about where they're going what I'm not excited about is explaining this new naming scheme to friends and family that are looking to purchase a new laptop over the next few years I also excited though to tell you about our sponsor thanks to grammarly for sponsoring this video here at lonus Media Group we're committed to constantly improving our writing that's where grammarly steps in grammarly
