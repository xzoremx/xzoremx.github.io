usually it's my kids who break stuff and I'm the one who gets to fix it but when corrosion in my DIY pool water cooling setup caused a catastrophic leak on his gaming PC it seemed like a perfect opportunity to flip the script I mean sure it's my fault it broke but what could are kids if you can't put them to work and besides what a great opportunity for some learning yay learning but Dad my laptop's barely working I want to upgrade to cyborg 14 for from our sponsor MSI it's perfect
for balancing class work and gaming they're having a back to school sale now check out the link in the description just because you have a spill on your computer doesn't necessarily mean that it's dead if you can unplug it clean it dry it off and fire it back up it might work just like the PC that we intentionally spilled cocon but that's not what happened here this system sat for hours in a puddle of water and its own corroded Gunk it should be dead but somehow miraculously it survived so then
no problem all I've got to do is have my son put his water cooling back in right wrong because if we do that it's probably going to corrode again so we've got to figure out the root cause the best theory we have is that this was caused by a ground Loop between the pump and the computers which causes a slight voltage differential which can drastically accelerate corrosion Jake is actually working right now on the video that maybe you guys have seen where we added an isolation transform to the
pumps and grounded the rack which means hey come on boy it's time to learn how to clean a really crusty water block when am I ever going to do this again hopefully never if Jake does all of this right probably soon but if it happens again we're going to be in relatively okay shape because one of the other things we're going to be installing in the boy's computer is a leak sensor well what are you waiting for let's go luckily the only things that got eaten away were the fittings so all we've got
to do now is remove all of the gunk that was deposited from the fittings onto these blocks now the bad news for you is I accidentally left my Grasso at the office so you get to try this Mother's Meg in aluminum polish which I don't know if it's going to work or goof off which I really think is not going to work here's a toothbrush you'll need water okay that's not doing much let's try some Meg polish that's probably not what that's supposed to look like oh it smells so bad
okay let's see very similar to how it did before it really does doesn't it I wonder if pick action is a better bet that does actually seem to be a lot better do I really want to get a dental pick into all these little bins well you're not doing it oh yeah I'll go get you a dental pick I changed my mind while I thought I had dental picks it turns out I actually don't but what I do have is is a lot of xacto knife blades oh wow yeah this comes off real good don't cut toward your finger like that
cuz if you put that into your thumb we will have to go to the ER room and you'll need a tetnus shot like me I got attacked by a cat so fun I wouldn't rather be doing anything else I'll tell you what boy I'm nothing if not fair you clean that piece I'll clean these three pieces okay good deal maybe what I didn't tell my son is there is another way I brought an ultrasonic cleaner home I can clean so much water block with this bad boy got some general purpose Ultrasonic Cleaner lemon
scented there they go I hope I have enough for this I only have the one jug Extra Strength formula this product is a concentrate one part product with 10 parts water I  myself I don't even know what color the back is supposed to be just salvage some of that back um oh   water why don't we kick things off with the top of the CPU block all of this stuff was pretty easy to get the gunk out of I actually did that before but what's hard to get at is these threads in here this should help help with that
in a big way let's heat it up right I forgot what a horrible noise it makes okay let's throw this bad boy in there dude ultrasonic cleaners are freaking  Cleaner sure when were you going to tell me about the Ultrasonic Cleaner it wasn't these are great they use ultrasonic vibrations to create these little scrubby micro bubbles that will remove any debris and crud from the surface of uh like a water block or a piece of jewelry or whatever the case may be wow not that we necessarily need
it you made really good progress yay the boy can do work when he wants to check this out oh my God yeah sorry that is awful yeah I know whoa look at it rip off this corrosion on this bad boy you can actually see big flags coming off this guy check that out now it's time to pull the system so go around to the back uh get it turned off and unplugged we're going to be doing two things we're going to un Jerry rig it so you can see I threw a replacement aircooled graphics card in here that's going to have to go
and we're going to add a leak sensor now Jake is working on the parts that'll do the actual monitoring and handle automations to turn the systems off in the event of a leak meanwhile we will be installing this leak sensor this appears to be too are we expecting there to be two leak sensors they just came in packs of two how's that supposed to sense when there's a leak these are powered by 5V DC power and basically what happens is if the two probes come into contact with water at the same time the water is
going to act as a wire which is going to connect our powered probe to our sense probe I mean here's the thing like realistically the water is going to pour out and then probably just dump down to the next server so these sensors inside the computers they might not do that much um so we're also going to add sensors to the floor and that'll probably be what saves us hey we just got new cats yay do you want to come the cats come on let's come meet the cats they have fleas so they have to hang out
in here for a few more weeks until they're old enough for flea treatment and then um that might actually be a good thing anyway cuz it'll give the other cat some time to acclimate the idea that something doesn't smell right anyway here they are this might end up being a side Adventure lm. g/f flat plane now that the new Cat Adventure is over let's get some stuff mounted nice okay now we got to strip it wouldn't something like this have a strip it does then use this yeah but it
only works on this part so then you figure out what gauge your wire is you can look it up or you can just not bother okay and then squeeze as hard as I can squeeze as hard as you can ow who's my hands maybe squeeze harder than you can next time it like hurts you know you're going to get me made fun of on the inter internet for having a boy with soft hands I don't even like put product on or anything my hands are just already soft I am shamed just tell them to not shame you yeah
they listen to me why do they watch your   question that's great that's not going to short out on  shamed here's what we're going to do we're going to slide a little thing in there like that then we're going to put this down on it here we go then we slide this out and theoretically we are exactly one paper width off the bottom now you got your screwdriver right yeah okay we need to remove this power supply man we have a lot to do I should go check on the  oh you're going to put those in there
yeah why not you can just drain it out of here outside yeah but I don't want to drain it I want to maybe use it for some more stuff maybe I could clean your mom's jewelry would you ever even know how scuffed this was ow ow ow okay wow that looks like freaking not quite new but certainly a lot better this is great check this out Jake huh huh huh that looks pretty gross still what no that's that's copper no I meant all this can I see please yeah yeah she said please that's a magic word no
respect what the there's still some Sho in here so we might have to do another Quick Pass uh while this is all still really soft and easy to get out and then uh maybe we'll throw it in the Ultrasonic Cleaner again now is a perfect time to put our GPU back together I did have to scrape some of this man ually but after the Ultrasonic Cleaner man does it ever come off easily since my GPU block is now clean I'm ready to start putting my graphics card back together and the good news is all
of my thermal pads survived what are thermal pads well here I can show you there's stuff that makes heat and we want to move that heat away from it so that it doesn't get too hot and die but because they might be mounted a little bit higher or a little bit lower we can't just put a piece of metal right against it because our piece of metal is going to be perfectly flat and it might not make contact with all of them so a thermal pad it's like a little pad that is thermally conductive so it can carry
the heat through the pad and into our metal you know how your computer runs games really fast mhm without thermal pads he no working we got to make sure that this o-ring doesn't get crushed if this gets crushed it has anything in the  you guys I asked for pipe cleaners I mean that's a pipe cleaner I know but this is an arts and crafts pipe cleaner what pipe cleaners do I use I'm trying to clean the threads so the inside here and they bring me the fuz the fuzzy kind I'll show you this one yes this but a  
guy oh no boy way oh he let the he let the O-rings fall down they're everywhere now there were five when I put them in well where's the fifth one oh I think it went down the  hole yes it's there okay good okay well no don't put them there put them in here let's get this thing assembled let's go I didn't take this one apart so I don't know where they go they go where they go it occurs to me as I'm s sitting here thermal pasting this GPU for reassembly that we don't actually know that it
still works while nothing else in the system failed I don't think we ever actually tried booting it with the  so now I would never recommend running a water cooled GPU without any water in it but hey it's the do as I say not as I do show right let's see if this GPU works if we get an output I'm just going to throw it in the system and call it good hey look at that we got an output let's go ahead and throw the system together oh this exciting might be a good time to get some of these tubes out of the way
how bad are these some of them don't even look dirty inside should I just replace all of them I feel like I should I feel like I should just replace all of them actually before I do that I should test our new power supply bracket and make sure that it works uh oh so perfect uh-oh did we leave enough clearance for the barrel Jack oh no oh it's perfect it's Flawless look at that professional so our 5vt leak sensor is going to go in there like that and our fiber optics go in like that and the
whole thing goes in here like that wait no there's not enough clearance for the  supply new solution no nut to secure the DC Barrel Jack thing because I mean I don't know does it really need one it's kind of in there right and it fits yay you know what this is kind of crazy but because of the friction with the power supply it's actually really secure in there even without the nut like I cannot move it all right we're back on track let's get the league sensor back hooked  there I spared you guys a lot of the
boring details but she's completely replumbed and everything is ready to close up I'm afraid I'm not optimistic enough to close up the top panel and slide it into its spot in the rack so we're just going to Huck it on the top where it was before hook up the water pipes at the back and see what happens boop boop I don't have to power on the system in order to get liquid to flow through it so this is a perfect time to see if anything's leaking everything seems fine I mean it should
you know we removed the corroded fittings but when you disassemble and reassemble water blocks you know you can make mistakes right dude I'm stressed I don't remember the last time I was this  computer let's go see if she fires up this is the monitor that's supposed to be lit up give it a sec she's memory training memories trained oh thank God woohoo let's see how the temps are all right well I should have repasted the CPU block you didn't repaste the CPU block it was paste on there oh my God I'm
going to repaste it I even brought PTM 7950 from LT store.com for you oh I didn't see it in fairness to me there was a solid chance that none of this was going to work at all and any time we spent on it was a complete waste so now that I know that the thing actually works I can just pop this off throw some more paste on yeah yeah that's uh not enough paste I'll throw some more paste on there and we'll call it a date Thal pad time H temps are exactly the same I bet the flow rate is lower from adding
the filter it's still going 10 L per minute that's that's a lot divided by seven systems I think this might be a flow rate thing was it like that before I don't think so I mean I can also check one of the other systems yeah this one's the same realistically they aren't 3D rendering on these systems but in the long term it might be nice to solve the flow rate issue maybe a second in line pump the more important one is the GPU anyway so let's get that started this one I'm expecting to be okay oh well
that's great this GPU is under 40° though and it's pulling 220 WTS all right gaming systems for gamers do they game casual 175 frames per second in Halo infinite on medium 1440p oh no oh no don't kill me please oh no no oh no no got him oh double kill oh dang it well it's a lot easier playing on my kid's account his MMR not as high all right cool well that's enough of that time to throw this thing back in the rack I may have made a slight mistake what did you do I buttoned everything up
before we actually tested the leak sensor that's in there I can unbutton it yeah all right this going to hold yeah seems like it'll hold okay leak test time what if something catastrophic happens theoretically all we've got to do now is take the other end of that Barrel Jack lead hook it into this league sensor which you guys would have seen in the last video and now I just pour some water in the computer basically because it failed here last time I put the league sensor right there
so if this tube just comes flying off again she's right there bud she's right there oh my God are you actually oh is it off yeah yeah yeah computer's off God okay all clear on sensor 8 which is the leak sensor so in theory when you bridge these connections with water leak detected okay that's a lot of water paper towel please oh okay I mean it's not that much water yeah I mean it works it just is a lot of water for what I would like to put into a computer computer that has other computers
running beneath it still registering still registering oh wow well that's that's really good actually I can see how it's working it's you don't need water between them just enough surface tension on both tips and then it registers so that means we got the distance just right on these we don't actually need a ton of water right because the chassis is metal it's using the chassis as a circuit which is usually a really great thing to do with your computer well look it's only 5 
it's working 0.6 come on Blow harder 0.4 0.3 keep going I'm going to pass out that would be funny oh man laded oh okay it's clear now if this registers a leak in the future just come in here and start blowing on it I mean I was going to say well no I got to come in here and start you know ripping power out of things but I kind of don't well the UPS's I do but everything else is going to be sh down I did bring you brackets to move your UPS if you want to do that at some point I probably should in a
perfect world we'll put in some concrete anchors or something like that and we'll just Mount them to the wall over there and then what's nice is that'll actually give me another six rack units of space in the rack not that I need more machines but you never know I guess now's a good time for us to change out the coolant in these systems to just in case everything else wasn't enough make real good insure that she doesn't corrode again why is he so giddy about this coolant this is G11 antifreeze which
conveniently is the same stuff you put in BMWs why does it always have to come back to BMWs with you like are you on their payroll I just looked at the forums and everyone was like yeah just get G11 that's the stuff that works good for this so This is the real stuff then yeah I mean most antifreeze protects most metals this is just like a high quality made in Germany good one is this concentrate it is concentrate that's a 10g tank let's throw both of these in it's blue wow look at that good
stuff one thing to note is that antifreeze does technically reduced the cooling performance a bit yeah it's not catastrophic though a couple percent realistically and we're not going like a 5050 concentration which is where you would really notice it what we won't have protection against though is the non-conductive nature of pure water this is probably going to contribute to the conductivity yeah you didn't have pure water anyways well it was pure enough that that system survived no more
corrosion corrosion be gone oh hey look at the down there oh it's so pretty I think we need to flush out the existing stuff though I'm kind of thinking we stick the freshwater hose in there and leave the drain open for a while oh okay flushing this Loop about as interesting as watching paint dry so you guys are just going to have to take my word for it that I swapped it out for the other coolant and take my word for trusting Dennis is saving tips by Dennis as like to Co St number one start by collecting
sauce packet or little shampoo bottles from hotels but what would even be better is using our sponsor rocket money you might be throwing money away on subscription Services you have long forgotten with rocket money canceling subscriptions is easy no annoying survey number two don't force yourself to poop at work just to save on toilet paper rocket money tracks your spending so you're always in control no need to fear running out okay okay I have enough rocket money has helped save its
customers up to $740 a year when they use all their features number three just check out rocket money at the link in the description and start saving money properly if you guys enjoyed this video maybe check out the last part where we looked at the aftermath of the leak and discovered all the corroded components
