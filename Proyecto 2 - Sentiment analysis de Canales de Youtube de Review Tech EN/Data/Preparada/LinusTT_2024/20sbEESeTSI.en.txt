finally the last part arrived for my brand new gaming PC Elijah Elijah Elijah wasting money again when you could have just used your old case or better yet this one that someone was just throwing away those things are older than I am there's no way it's going to fit all my Modern Hardware  accepted see too easy and with the money I saved I upgraded your CPU your SSD and even your memory wow but there must be a downside right otherwise why would companies continue to make cases okay
there are some downsides your old case is not going to have the latest USB standards it's not going to have a fancy glass panel or nice Cable Management it'll also probably make your rig look kind of worthless but I see that as an absolute win this kind of thriftiness can save you hundreds of dollars over time so I'll tell you what Elijah you come up with some fany feature your new case has and I'm going to make it happen on this one at a fraction of the price deal but only if I can tell them about our
sponsor gskill their Trident Z5 CK ddr5 CU dim memory is designed for core Ultra 200 series CPUs and features a built-in clock driver for support for up to 9600 megat transfers per second learn more at the link in the video description step one of saving money on a case is to get creative and get your hands on the cheapest possible possible canvas for your modding Masterpiece local electronics recyclers can be a great bet but if that fails there's always Facebook Marketplace and sorting from
low to high we're going to start there after the usual runaround from jerks who label things free that aren't free we were lucky enough to find not just one but a handful of cases that would work but do note that not all cases are made equal for starters you'll want to make note of the size so you can make sure that whatever Parts you plan to use are going to fit also materials if you're going to have to modify your case well you'll want a material that your tools can work with speaking of modifying my
power supply is going to be suffocating up top most cases have vents now for it and so does this one it just doesn't know it  yet look at that who says shirro from the business team's the only one with a grill his looks much nicer no I haven't goldplated it yet okay now obviously most people are not going to have the tools at home to do something like this but many Hardware shops do allow rentals and some cities even have maker spaces and Tool libraries that you can use to help get
the job done now I just need to cut these plastic strips off here and clean things up a little   by the way I fully acknowledge that we could have just had the intake fan on the bottom but Elijah asked for a grill and now he has one I'm almost afraid to ask what you're going to do for my CPU and GPU but here it goes the case is sealed off at the front Linus how are  Elijah does have a point there's nowhere to mount case fans here we'll talk more about that later but for now one trick
that is very popular on r/ tech support mcgyver is just ripping the side panel off and then pointing a regular old household fan at the system it's going to be just as effective now we're just about ready to start our build but before we do let's do a quick history lesson on why I expect all of my brand new parts to work in a case that's 20 years old Adam the computer guy I'm so glad you asked the ATX standard for motherboards  holes and IO locations of the three most common sizes ATX microatx and Mini ITX
have remained unchanged since 1995 but don't let the secret get out there have been other changes like the motherboard power connectors and internal slots and headers but none of them affect the shape of the board so any board as long as it follows the standard should fit in any old case and it does as you can see the io Shield goes here or doesn't for boards that have them built in and nine quick screws later we are G2G actually uh does it require a back plate for the CPU Cooler yes it does ah
another feature we're going to need to add older cases didn't have a cutout to install a CPU back plate once you already had the motherboard in but don't    okay isn't that fantastic yeah it looks pretty good and if we wanted to avoid all that extra work all we would have had to do was install this on the motherboard before we put it in the case like the old days so we installed it took it out cut the hole just to put it  now you have this feature and look it almost won't slice your hand open this
point in the video I can't tell if I'm on Team new case or team an old case we're having fun though yeah yeah maybe the cases the friends are made along the way probably the wildest thing that hasn't changed is the PIN outs for these front panel connectors this HD audio connector boom still HD let's go same goes for my USB 2 as well as my front power switch reset switch and LEDs but what about USBC I want to charge my phone poor innocent Elijah you weren't there for the good old days of PC
Building when cases used to come with these bad boys 5 and 1/4 in Bays which for some inexplicable reason manufacturers still make accessories for as tempted as I was by the fan controller the hard drive caddy and the literal drawer I felt that this iio would better address Elijah's concerns type-c USB 3.2 two USB 3A ports two USB 2 ports and even front panel audio now it's a fair criticism that buying one of these can cost as much as a case some of them are pretty fancy boasting features
like premium audio decks but in the spirit of buying into form factors that you can carry forward with you I would recommend an external deck anyway rather than a fancy one of these so you could move it around and use it on your laptop as well all right so I'm at $20 what else do you need well I bought RGB RAM and that Secura GPU I would like to be able to see them and this side panel you know don't just leave it off  cats okay if you must have a side panel window Home Depot sells sheets of
acrylic and pretty much any size you need all we got to do is cut it up more cutting oh great and there it is there's multiple options for cutting acrylic you can score it and break it you can use a laser or probably the best option if you want to keep things simple is to just buy the right size in the first place so we've got our side panel window but I'm going to do you one better okay with nothing but a whole saw a pair of old panty hose and a can do attitude we can throw some
filtered side intakes on this mama jama feeding fresh air directly to our hungriest components cool let's do it you got the pany right no but I have something else that is not going to work yes it  terrible I'm kind of thinking intake fan here intake fan here for our GPU and I don't know oh I thought that's how about another one here this cutout was going to be for the I know we're going to put an intake fan on the acrylic on the acrylic yeah oh that's not what I had in
mind but okay can do at get it together please don't break the acrylic this is our one sheet well that's a pretty  situation get [Applause] cutting I'm a little worried about doing this on the acrylic by the way are we going to like shatter it to bits do we want to just not take the risk so that way I can see all my pretty components without shattering it okay that tell Elijah but I'm pretty concerned about this ripping up the acrylic too let's see how this  nothing see it's working perfectly just
like I told you cool I have an idea oh my oh my God I just need more  weight oh yeah it's so cooked what do you mean it's cooked that's plastic like right there you cracked it all along there no all right I guess we're only going to   person that's a Vibe that's this video Let's see if lus actually did crack it or not wow I for sure thought this thing was destroyed underneath that is why you fail it's a movie reference you wouldn't get it oh okay what movie The Empire Strikes Back oh okay
from the Boomer Star Wars you can cut that you can cut you can cut cut please cut please cut please this window is going to stay on it's "like 9,000 lb of VHB holding strength" that's that's good I wanted a side panel window so you will have one forever I want the best one damn it Elijah those lines are really not straight that's okay no it's really not well we can't can't go back now no we really can't okay you know what from the outside it's probably it's actually not that bad oh yeah that's fine I mean
compared to everything else about this side panel it really doesn't stand out look at that side intakes front IO ah mother board tray cut out the only question now is is our power supply going to fit Professor Adam Adam the computer guy believe it or not the width and the height of standard PC power supplies have stayed the same since 1995 and dimensionally only the length has changed over the years as systems have gotten more power hungry again there have been other changes some of them
controversial but even the mounting hole locations remain unchanged now there is one thing the original spec had the PSU as close to the CPU as possible why the belief was the fan could pull double duty pulling air over the passive CPU heat sink and also cooling the PSU before exhausting it in completely from the system but that obviously won't work because processors noway like 250 wats it's freaking stupid why would you need that much power there that resolves the last major
hurdle but here's the thing not everyone's going to be building a mid-range system so why don't we take our case and take it to the next level  machine to do this again I'd probably make sure that there's no little metal filing bits left in here that could fall into the power supply that could be catastrophic but I'm not doing it again I'm doing it now and inside here is about $3600 worth of modern power hungry Hardware including a 16 4 CPU and a 4090 GPU as you can see everything fits let's
game before we fire up a game I think we should test our cooling it's not the quietest thing in the world and we appear to have a bit of a problem here oh our temperatures immediately spiked to 81° and we are using 63% of our power also I couldn't help noticing that one of our fans is actually getting spun backwards do you think there's too much back pressure in there I do okay see here's the thing though Elijah I thought the front panel was staying open I mean we can open it I designed it
for maximum intake there's too much pressure in the computer okay she cannot take it open the front panel then here we go let's see what happens when we do that they are staying the same it's not even hot in here oh Liah that 12pin power connector is not plugged in all the way no it was I had an issue where it wasn't plugged in so I plugged it in more look at it oh my God turn it off nope you said turn it off oh the clip is broken oh okay that man that's weird cuz yeah I opened it up and I was like
expecting it to be an inferno down here in the bottom of the case um cuz that would explain 61% power usage you know what none of this even adds up because why was the GPU at 80° then if it was only using 60% power and theral issue weren't plugged in has this GPU been disassembled and reassembled I don't know I grabbed it from the Shelf I didn't I just didn't check I just grabbed it from inventory the good news is that on LTT store.com we can find PTM 7950 thermal pads that we can use to repaste this GPU
and get great temperatures guess who just volunteered dude I nope I'm just going to go find a different 490 from inventory nope I'm GL really glad my one day shoot turned into a three-day shoot my side quest is complete and as you can see the 490 is in my hand because I actually had to put a different one in the computer this is the one that Alex like tore apart for some water cooling and that sh mod where "it can draw 1,000 Watts this cooler" cannot cool it so goodbye this 490 and
welcome in the AME 490 we're going to try rerunning firmar and see if we run into the same issues we did before I'm pretty confident we won't so let's just hit the 4K one let's see what happens happens here oh yeah already our temperature is much much better than the 80° yesterday and our power seems to be recording correctly we're drawing like 440 Watts on the GPU right now I may be acting surprised that Linus's Jank work did do well but I'm not as dumb as the character I play on TV I do know that
buying a new case every single time when you're upgrading your computer is a mistake especially if you're on a tight budget but I also know that it's not the worst idea either if you're already planning on shoving an entire small nation's power consumption worth of Parts into your computer you might not be in a position where you need to pinch Pennies on a case and even if you aren't worried about pinching pennies it might not be a bad idea to pick up something that's not this because if you get a
nice case now you can still carry it forward for future builds which again will save you the money before you do jump the gun on buying a premium case "let's go back to our original $1,000" budget and we'll show you what we were able to upgrade you can choose to double the ram double the storage and go from a six core to an eight core CPU that is faster and I could honestly give you an infinite number of systems to use with the extra 10% of your budget we gave up our time but it was worth it in the end
because we were able to get a much more powerful system and while lonus isn't here to share an our Glory of it working we did have fun along the way I got to learn how to use some power tools and you know maybe touching our tools is actually more fun than you know touching grass did he script that he really scripped that okay and it's almost as much fun as our our sponsor ground news their mission is to give you the tools to understand where your news is coming from so you can get as close to the
