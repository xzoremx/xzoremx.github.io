when Mark Zuckerberg told us the future is living in a one-bedroom apartment experiencing the world through my plastic VR accessory understandably we mocked him but then when Tim Apple did it we were excited beyond all reason why what is it about the Vision Pro that caused this sudden shift and can the world of spatial Computing be accessed by us PC folk it turns out the answer is yes so let's talk about about why the Vision Pro is the most exciting piece of technology
that I've used in years and why I can't  away Odo their all-in-one software will let you focus on running and improving your business rather than playing hot potato with a bunch of mismatching apps click the link below or watch till the the end of this video to learn more first contact with the Vision Pro is something you won't soon forget the material choices and the build quality are exceptional to the point where I would say they are the best we have ever seen on a VR headset from the aluminum
frame to the curved glass front to the fabric headband it is on a whole different level which should result in a very comfortable headset but there is one small problem these hinges do not rotate the hinge where it attaches is no hinge at all it doesn't swivel which from my experience means choosing between either extra pressure on your forehead or wearing it higher and having extra pressure on your cheekbones and in my case particularly the bridge of my nose now Apple acknowledges this with the
inclusion of their dual Loop band but this has the exact same problem of inflexibility meaning that say for example you like to wear a back ponytail you better learn to wear a top one or a low one and it makes mounting the device more annoying and still resulted in subpar comfort for me the good news is that it's easy to forget at least for a while the second the screen turns on believe every single word you heard from the Apple evangelists in your life because Holy balls does this thing ever
look incredible at just under 4K per eye with nearly three times the pixel count of the meta Quest 3 not to mention no discernable screen door effect whatsoever it is unlike anything that I have ever experienced the 12 cameras on the front and bottom of the device create a three-dimensional live view of the world around you that again crushes Mr Zuckerberg's best efforts and this is all thanks to Apple's latest homegrown silicon the R1 which handles the video stitching and pass through as well as
eye tracking hand tracking and head movements in a way that I just didn't think would be possible for quite a long time now one thing to be careful of is getting fingerprints on the cameras as it's very easy to do accidentally while putting the headset on and it will make things look a little fuzzy when it's working its best though my goodness is it ever incredible you look around you resize you reposition objects in Virtual space and it's shockingly smooth and natural as long as you don't want to do
something Apple says you're not allowed to do like oh I don't know Zoom something in more than you're allowed to another Apple thing is that they tend to be selective about publishing their specs and they opted not to publish a field of view number for this headset now that could be because it varies depending on your exact face shape and how you wear it the thicker cushion for example will shrink it a little bit but the more likely reason is that it kind of sucks let's find out using what Alex
calls oh thank you the fov finder "5,000 uh for context the valve index is" around 110° and the leading headset from pimax is about 160 with the original Oculus Rift being 88 I am going to go ahead and move this until I can no longer see the edges which occurs that's 79° oh well that's not very good is it that test actually wasn't 100% accurate because we measured the fov of the cameras not Linus's actual fov which would be a little bit larger because apple is distorting stuff so look if I
put this on right here and look at this grid on the wall when I look at it straight on everything seems to be pretty straight in the middle and then on the sides it'll be curved but if I look at the corner it is actively compensating for those distortions in my eyes what's even more surprising is that if I go in here take off the light guard and put it on like this my expectation was that the camera fov would stay the same but it actually gets much larger so before I could only see about the edges
of this now I can see all the way out to here which is why you can get between like 90 up all the way to 110 on this and it's using the eye tracking to actively compensate for those differences of course Apple has made it abundantly clear that the Vision Pro is not a VR headset it is a spatial Computing device for professional work it's meant for serious things so naturally the first thing we wanted to do was game on it because on paper it should be very good $7 for an apple arcade subscription later
and we're in the headliner game for the Apple Vision Pro appears to be super fruit ninja and I can't think of a better game to illustrate both its incredible strengths and its complete and utter failings so let's go ahead and fire it up look at this you guys everything around me in spite of the high resolution of these displays is rendered in crystal clear image quality with no discernable frame rate drops it is Far and Away the best that I have ever seen on a headset and that is thanks to the
same M2 Chip as the current MacBooks and this too Apple's environmental mapping and the solidity of the placement of virtual objects in the real world makes everything else I've ever seen look like a cheap toy in comparison unfortunately the whole thing falls apart the second you try to interact with the game remember when I said no frame rate drops in a traditional Inside Out headset like the quest 3 or the psvr2 not only are there cameras tracking where your hands are there are gyros
thank you and accelerometers in inside the controllers that will handle quick movements fine movements or fill in the gaps during any times when your hands are not visible or the cameras temporarily lose tracking for some reason without that accelerometer input The Vision Pro simply doesn't have the tracking Fidelity for a game like fruit ninja with every single loss that I experienced on the device feeling like the Apple Vision Pro was to blame not my skills hey hey hey hey and honestly
playing anything but the slowest paste of iPad apps made me feel pretty much the same way I just immediately wanted my stupid slab of glass back of course we went into this knowing the Vision Pro isn't a VR gaming headset so why don't we move on to one of its greatest strengths putting an enormous High Fidelity display anywhere you want and then using that to play real games now I went into this assuming that getting Windows working on this headset would be a chore and a half or at least 1.3
chores I mean Apple doesn't even let you buy the vision Pro if you don't already have a reasonably current iPhone but as it turns out the process is incredibly simple if you only want to play games all you've got to do is download the steamlink iPad app from the App Store choose what computer you want to stream from and it figures out the rest I mean is that something or what what kind of absolute mad lad would have   laggy would I find it easier to play just looking at the laptop screen with
the 12 milliseconds or so have passed through dude with all the just like compression blocking and everything and the fact that this is only at 1080p The Experience like  similar of course the key difference is that I can't put that display anywhere that I want and as much as I might complain about the latency it's good enough for most gamers in most games for example in Forza assuming you're a halfway decent driver you'll probably find that frame pacing is more important
than a little bit of leg here or there but if you were to play other games competitive games even driving ones like say rocket League the latency is too high to for example counter a last second fake out from your opponent steamlink also has some big limitations regardless of which headset you're using the highest resolution that you can stream is 1080P and you can only play games but that my friends is where sunshine and Moonlight come in and no I'm not telling you to go outside
Sunshine available on the lizard bite GitHub page allows you to easily easily convert your PC or laptop into a streaming server then the Moonlight iPad app on your Vision Pro will give you full access to your Windows machine at up to 4K 120 frames per second though it should be noted you're going to need one heck of a wireless access point in order to hit that consistently 4K here we go I'm not even going to try 120 right now our Wi-Fi in this part of the office is uh not
great the spatiality of the audio is incredible like that TV is behind me now no question unfortunately with our Wi-Fi on the sets not being as good as we'd like sunshine and Moonlight didn't perform that great in gaming but the big killer app is not really games it's the ability to just use a Windows PC with a virtual desktop in The Vision Pro and for that it works freaking great like look at this honestly Alex I gotta say the latency feels very very similar to the native connection to the MacBook I'll
try it this is going to be the thing that finally breaks apple and makes them integrate touch into Mac OS the fact that people are going to be sitting there in their Vision Pro and just want to click on things and then they're going to introduce it and everyone's going to be like wow it's so obvious sometimes it's nice to be able to tap on things and then they're going to put touch screens on Max this is it mark my words and if it doesn't happen then it is only because of Apple's
complete and utter stubbornness there's no other reason wow it is struggling a lot more in this environment but over at the lab I did not have the same problem it was a little laggy it was fine yeah once again I've got serious latency issues which underscores that you are going to need a really nice modern access point for the best possible experience on this I'll show you a little bit of contrasting footage here to give you some idea of what this is  like yeah unfortunately that's not the
kind we have here on the set so using Windows on a big old virtual spatial display incredible the latency is very similar to using it on the MacBook which means there is some regardless of your access point but it's very very usable and worth the tradeoff of the giant display the only thing that I'd say is different is that it doesn't have that really cool augmented reality connect thing that is such a it just works moment now if you do have some weirdness part of that comes
down to the way that Apple made their Wireless chipset and apparently setting your router to use Channel 149 can help Solve IT bottom line incredible for non-competitive games with a powerful GPU in the streaming system I'd say this is pretty much the definitive way to experience balers Gate 3 or something from The Witcher series but if you're a competitive game gamer you could get nearly the same field of view while having much lower latency for a lot less money so gaming perspective aside then
let's take a look at the Vision Pro more in the ways that Apple intended which is where the device starts to get in some ways cooler but in other ways a bit more complicated I've already stated that this is the best video pass through that I've encountered by a metric mile but pass through has never been a core function of a headset to quite the same degree before on a psvr or most PC headsets it's a convenience feature so you can find your water bottle in between rounds but on the Vision Pro the
expectation is that you're doing work probably in an office with other humans while in pass through mode for extended periods of time which can get rather strange because it literally warps your perception of reality oh yeah that's really disor orientating they won't be seeing it in 3D so they won't realize how this tree like you see the camera distorts your perception of objects particularly ones that are too close and while the pass through is shockingly low latency 
object the perception of depth of really everything around you is going to be a bit off the good news is that your brain is really good at compensating for this so when you hear people say yeah the first 30 minutes was kind of weird but then it just clicked you can expect to have a pretty similar experience the weird one though is that your brain also clicks the other way so when you take the headset off it's typical to have a minute or two of whoa hold on a second before things click
back into Place speaking of things clicking into place a big pet peeve of mine with this product is the complete inability to grab something in the virtual world and pin it in your peripheral vision while you go about the rest of your life In fairness to Apple the accuracy of the way that it takes an object and keeps it exactly where you left it is incredible it's just that I don't always want to have to carry things around with me when I want to refer back to them like this script
another thing that bummed me out anytime I spent an extended period in pass through was the video Fidelity and look I don't want to take anything away from what Apple has achieved here but I could never forget that I was looking at a video feed of the world through phone cameras compounding this issue is the fact that virtual content rendered by The Vision Pro is so high fidelity and so vibrant that the real world ends up looking drab and dull by comparison here I can demonstrate this that right there
is a color cheer Classic on what is a by all accounts beautiful and color accurate screen this is a color Checker classic in the real world see the difference another major issue is motion blur while the pixel response times of this micro OLED display allow objects to look extremely crisp even when in motion As you move your head it's normal for the whole world to end up looking and feeling a little bit jelly also apple is regularly forced to use weird shutter angles in order to compensate for the
flickering of lights around you which can in some cases cause them to have to crank the iso adding a bunch of noise to the image even in well-lit rooms while we spent a lot of time so far talking about things you can do with the Vision Pro I actually spent most of my time with the device doing what you are supposed to do which is professional work in my own virtual space and it can be really sweet I love being able to take private notes in a meeting or work on sensitive material in a group setting
but the problem is that it cuts both ways one of the first things that I wanted to do was share a document with someone and Mark it up together and yeah because there's no obvious way to mirror my macbook's display I had to use a bizarre workaround that involved screen sharing from inside the Vision Pro to a video conference with someone who was sitting there on a laptop next to me in the same room also even if all you want to do is work privately the whole setup can be a bit of a chore I mean the
Vision Pro Sounds like having your own personal colon holding a TV for for you and then allowing it to be repositioned and Float effortlessly wherever you want but in practice I just don't really often need to do that and neither do a lot of people for example Nicole here's a real person doing real work for a fraction of the cost of a Vision Pro she has multiple 4K displays all within her field of view at once and this is how much she has to move her head in order to look between
them wow again I appreciate this thing for the technological Marvel that it is a 4K display in a single Square in but for optimal text Clarity you need to use most of those pixels meaning that the virtual monitor needs to be absolutely massive for the Vision Pro to really shine making your workspace feel less like this and more like  obviously this demo is meant to be illustrative more than literal for one thing the Vision Pro does not currently support more than one MacBook display
and we have five also it's more like having a much larger TV that is quite a bit farther away and that is a good thing in the sense that you'll be focusing more than a few feet in front of you but I still found that in spite of this that iin was a big problem for me if I spent more than an hour or so in spatial Computing land making this productivity problem worse is the fact that at this time the Vision Pro doesn't allow you to save your layouts so every time you want to get back into it you've
got to put it on authenticate connect to your MacBook resize that display open a safari window put that over there where you want it maybe your emails go over here it's a lot of friction that our editors for example don't go through every time they want to sit down and get a couple hours of work done before their eyes and face hurt too much to continue but none of that was my biggest disappointment that actually came on day one when I took home my shiny Vision Pro super excited to play with what is
arguably the most revolutionary device to hit the market in years and quickly realized there's nothing to do you can experience things you can watch TV look at 3D models uh you can play iPad apps with kind of janky controls but I realized really quickly I wasn't having any fun I know app support is going to expand rapidly and in the near future there will almost certainly be some really cool stuff to do but at the moment what's available ranges from boring to outright dystopian so what is
it good for if you don't need it for work I'd say watching stuff in your own private movie theater is the the killer app you can really appreciate the higher streaming quality of extras at lmg g/f floatplane and watching 3D movies in this thing is second to none I think it's even safe to say that watching Encanto on the Vision Pro in 3D is the absolute best way to experience that movie by myself it's just that for the price of a Vision Pro I could get a flagship LGC 3 I could get a coffee table and a couch
and then I could experience it with my friends I mean sure it might not be as immersive but I know which one I'd rather have I'll be back in a minute guys first I just got to finish up this review honestly I felt the same way about spatial photos and videos reliving them absolutely amazing and it feels like you're there again so if you have a spatial capture capable iPhone now is the time to start using that feature so that when a Vision Pro that's worth buying appears you're going to be ready
to look back on those memories with a level of depth that is unmatched even if it is a little janky still so for all my criticisms I don't hate The Vision Pro and I don't even think that it's bad it's an incredible feat of engineering and it delivers on its promise of enabling new ways of interacting with each other and with the world around us it's just not for me and not right now I just can't think of a single thing that I would do with the Vision Pro that I wouldn't rather do on a device that I
already own and think about it for $3500 almost 4 grand with a decent amount of storage I could read on my Kindle work on my laptop watch shows on my TV and game on my PS5 and I can practically hear you guys saying well yeah everything that you just said is true of the smartphone as well this is your Balmer moment line is this is never going to take off but guys I'm not saying it's not going to take off it will it's just that there's a major hurdle that Apple needs to overcome and
that's convenience my smartphone guess what is also a worse version of everything else that I already own the difference is that it's already in my pocket The Vision Pro on the other hand well at least this version of it with its unwieldy shape and giant battery bank is very very not in my pocket it's also not in this Segway to our sponsor Odo Imagine This you're running a business but it's being held together by a bunch of different software kind of like electronic bandages it's not ideal
