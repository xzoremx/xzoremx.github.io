the GPR superlite is one of the best gaming mice ever and it comes from Logitech one of the most trusted names in computer peripherals which got us thinking what if you bought everything from Logitech it might look a little something like this so we're going to find out where brand loyalty gets you to the ultimate gaming setup or to a pile of overpriced trendy plastic starting with their g715 wireless gaming keyboard it's got the works Wireless connectivity via Bluetooth or with their included 2.4
GHz dongle that docks in the back your choice of Logitech which apparently means long haa clicky linear or tactile switches full RGB backlighting and macro Keys which if you press them they can do anything like Segway to our sponsor the ridge upgrade your everyday carry with the ridge wallet it's RFID blocking technology protects your cars from digital theft while it's durable materials ensure it lasts for years to come click on the link below and use code Linus to save 10% off your purchase
and get free shipping one other cool thing I didn't notice before the sponsor break was that you can customize it with these interchangeable face plates love to see it now let's make some room on this desk and check out their mous pad really we're going to take an LTT desk pad off the desk to replace it with fine  it wow what' you drop nothing see you later quality LT merchandise say hello to Logitech merchandise it's a great color how much is this thing it's more expensive than
ours it's $40 huh this is expensive metallic ink probably natural rubber backing material though it's not going anywhere all they're really missing is the stitched Edge you can't deny our setup so far looks good I forgot to mention the included Cloud wrist rest but man is this expensive we spent $240 so far and that does not include the Monitor and they aren't about to get cheaper the Logitech power play is a mous pad SL wireless charging system that costs $120 though in spite of that I am a huge
fan of this thing this is what Apple Air power wishes it could have grown up to be you plug in this little module at the top it comes with either a cloth surface or a hard surface or you can just EO and stick it under your existing desk pad or as we've done in the past embed the flipping thing in your desk then you take this little puck install it in your recent Logitech mouse and your mouse just continuously charges while you're gaming never charge never plug in again I flip and love these things of course
we're going to need a mouse to put it in and we're going to need so many dongles one fewer than you think the power play actually has a receiver in it oh so I will not need that dongle cool except I will oh to get the mouse working at all and then I'll pair it to the power play later oh little Logitech Pro super light two I haven't actually tried this one yet wait this can you tell much of A's the two that is the two that's the two it just says Pro super L they didn't
even bother redoing the mold no they did redo the mold it now goes in the other direction but they didn't put a two on it yeah I don't know it says on the Box in all seriousness though there are improvements over the original it now "goes to 32,000 DPI and is just 60 G" instead of 63 a savings that will almost certainly be negated by the extra weight of the charging puck but somehow they still increase the battery life to 90 hours wow yeah about a 33% increase that's great cuz I'm going to spend 33%
of my time looking for this mouse on this mouse pad how will I find it is a strange fate that we should pay so dear a price for something so small and light $160 which puts our total so far up to 510 wow we haven't even turned on the computer yet we don't have a computer yet oh that okay sure I mean let's clarify Logitech doesn't make computers yeah Logitech doesn't make computers so that's not their fault what they do make is chairs which I don't have yet but I do have this headset this is the pro X2 light
speed is this chair in the shot is edit or blur that edit or blur the chair there's a lot to like here though they use their graphine technology 50 mm drivers they have a steel headband and they have aluminum where's the aluminum somewhere I have one of the older ones and I do like the on ear cup controls you've got a power button a volume wheel with a little block so you don't accidentally hit it too often mic mute USBC for charging and a Bluetooth pairing button in case you want to
switch over to Bluetooth from the default dongle mode which oh that's cool has a 3 and2 mm Jack on it mine's black so it's possible it has it and I never noticed I actually don't know the boom mic is detachable and replaceable they have upgraded ones and the Blue Audio One actually sounds quite nice this is an audio test on the pro X2 light speed oh and in addition to the leatherette ear cups they include these fabric ones that they call Valour but I think that's being very generous about as generous as
you'll be being to Logitech when you buy these because they cost I believe $250 correct yeah yeah they do maybe you could give me something more affordable here for the people  gaming in case that one you have on is too boring is this a real product yeah it's $9.99 us I mean it's the right price I mean I also wash dishes with this type of fabric there you go oh that looks way better I just spent $10 on a piece of purple foam well no you got all the colors but what if you don't want to
listen to headphones oh did you just put that on the keyboard it's fine I put it gently on the keyboard sheesh Logitech used to be the king when it came to PC speaker setups after Clips pulled out of the market and so did creative nowadays now that there's no competition yeah this feels noticeably less robust than their older stuff but it's something what the heck is this look at this oh good proprietary interfaces wait a second the left and the right are different are you kidding
me logic Tech don't do that just use speaker wire guys that way I can sub it out with any length I want where am I going to find a this extension oh yeah and the controls are all on the right speaker it's got your power button a headphone out bluetooth pairing as well as volume up and down and then a mystery button G oh that's probably for the RGB  lights wow woo that explains the custom cable totally justified yeah there's no there's no port in the world that can send both an audio and RGB signal at all
it's it's impossible I mean there's this one oh yeah Logitech finally made that's why these are so expensive what are they worth well about $200 twoos cheaper than "your headset we're at almost $1,000 yeah" and we're not even started of course most people don't want to be tied to their desk for audio and that's where the ultimate ears hyper boom comes in Logitech acquired these guys a number of years back and this is their Flagship Bluetooth speaker which is rated at plus
plus plus plus plus plus plus plus plus plus sound intensity and a range of 45 M with ipx4 water resistance wow and if one isn't enough you can pair two of them to the same device and play the audio through both of them they call it party mode I think that has a name already it's called stereo no party mode  volume what did you do I'm pressing volume up and it's doing this oh it's   speakers they get pretty loud but for 4 $150 each yeah that's tough do we have anything really cool to Pivot to yes these Meo
cameras are absolutely stunning they're crazy what they are is they're a bunch of wireless cameras yeah that can stream independently to a single source so you can have multi- Cam streams they're all battery powered oh super cool yeah 1080p 30 FPS USBC charging and uh we have the iPad and stuff Colin was showing me these to me yesterday and I was absolutely Blown Away by them wow that's pretty cool boop boop yeah you don't want to point them into the light though boop boop boop boop boop boop boop and
the third one is uh the battery and the lights on the front will show you who's recording light super cool so when you're doing a multicam stream or something you'll be able to like know that you've switched camera angles yeah so my twitch stream could be called the red light district yeah there are some caveats while they do have native support for OBS it supports only One camera so if you want to do the whole switching thing you have to use the iPad app and they're "well they're $1,000 next up before we"
move on oh those cameras can actually run off of these devices as well ethernet power adapter okay this kind of makes sense if you have a Poe network switch then you can just uh use the USB port here to power your camera yeah then you don't need to run off Wi-Fi yeah yeah they're 200 US each huh can can you use another USBC dongle and just do pass through Power and ethernet that way if you don't need Poe I don't know I didn't test that but this was what was on the device as an
essential kit for these cameras they are a kind of unique product USBC to the camera right that's straightforward enough then it can take a Poe power input also handle networking over this Jack or take a non Poe input and then also plug in a USBC power source to power the camera I don't see any reason why you couldn't use a regular dongle for this though I think we should try it right now I will go find a dongle I have one in my background I have one oh perfect okay let's see who can get their
dongle first the alliance is already there it is immediately charging so that's good why is this on here what is this whose iPad is this this is my personal iPad no thank you it's uh there's stream overlays oh I see well that's very useful well that's a weird spot for you to come out of unfortunately there's no obvious way to disconnect from Wi-Fi once you're connected so we're not sure what we're on but the good news is there's a help article we found that talks all about
using ethernet only adapters or ethernet adapters with USB power delivery so it seems like it's supported but there are some caveats let's talk about these mics I call them the microphone and the co ball cuz they acquired blue rest in peace blue you du D Duba died this is an audio test on the yeti orb this is an audio test on the yeti GX I'm kind of feeling the orb I like this nice little trip stand and it kind of sits exactly where I need it that's good it's $90 cheaper than this one this one is 60 and
this one is150 but before you make a decision could I interest you in third microphone oh this feels very expensive  aluminum XLR input base cut and presents this is an audio test on the blue SAA wa look at this thing this has got to be at least $300 bang on baby 300 us yeah nice then you need an arm for it and an XLR interface better sound really good hey an arm it's coming out of a not normal arm place but good job we're going to go with the Sona but in an unfortunate turn of events
Logitech has no XLR interface fortunately they we have this accessory for the Sona which shows you how I feel about that built-in Cable Management jobbies this is kind of nice it retails for 100 US normally I've seen it as low as 40 US when Best Buy is just trying to clear them out that's something to note about all of this stuff by the way is Logitech is one of those Brands where there's the MSRP and then there's the P you pay what the P the price you pay price you pay oh gosh okay this is really
coming together what's our total Eli our "total is actually 3,8 60 us right now" wait is that with all the microphones no that is just with our select microphone right now we did double up with like $900 of speaker though right plus this "as well so like $1,100 of speaker I" "would say they're not really $1,100" worth of speaker but that's how much the MSRP is uh apparently Logitech actually makes a lot of different key lights they have three different ones on their store with the smallest one here all USB
powered it's actually got all the buttons on the back including the power the brightness and the temperature of the light and it just has a little monitor mount turn it on Boom we got another key light that's the same thing but uh wide it's a wide boy all righty Logitech ah Logitech racing s ow oh that's like solid metal right on my toe yeah it's cool this thing's like a stow and go racing Sim so if you hit  here you can just fold her up and then put her away for convenient store
oh that's really cool actually High wife approval Factor this arm here where the wheel sits on you can actually just have this little lock here so you can get in and out yo yeah that's pretty  go honestly I think it's pretty comfortable I would hope so it's 300 us it's kind of expensive B really I think that's expensive for like Fabric and some steel tubes yeah but it's also specially shaped steel tubes I guess it seems reasonable in the grand scheme of sim raising stuff especially if you look
at how much the other stuff costs that's  huge oh God and then here are the foot pedals how are the foot pedals lighter than the uh you think the foot pedals would be a little bit heavier cuz you want to have a weight on them well this is going to have like the feedback force motor and stuff right that's going to be in there so you got a triple pedal setup you got your brake you got your gas and you got your clutch you have an adjustable load on the brake as well as swappable Springs if you want a little
bit more push or a little bit less for your pedals I am loving the lighting  cost this one was 50 us this one is 100 us this one is 150 us and this is the RGB one correct it's got an RGB backing to it so you can you know cast it on the wall get the Ambiance oh come on undecided what does that put our total at and when are we going to take it to the next level with the Logitech GX Herman Miller chair uh well our current total without the chair is go atam you're just you're crouching there I'm
not taking it I got you no I don't want it I got it's really expensive please don't break it you got it you got it yeah okay okay good Lord okay good you're doing great that was like the worst way do I'll come help you I'll I'll help I got you I got you oh Jesus here have a seat have a seat buddy thank "you so much how kind so we were at 4,800" "already 4,100 you didn't let me finish" my sentence ah and this is going to add another 2600 Canadian dollars yeah these things are nuts does
your butt feel like an oil prince right now honestly I prefer their thousand uh chair their airon chairs but wow it's pretty good they do sell a cheaper Herman Miller chair like with with with hitech if it's a really good chair I sit I sit it one on my desk and that's lovely the reviews are great yeah oh yeah four and a half Stars uh there is one key thing missing from our setup here first of all how much did I spend on this admittedly pretty upgraded wheel since I bought my
G27 back in the day just the wheel is "1,000 us what pedals are just 350 now" "mean just $ 350 you have to pay $1,000" for the wheel I mean on their own they're 350 wow yeah it's gone up a lot and the play seat $300 that's pretty reasonable I think I think it's pretty reasonable for what you're getting I think it's insanely overpriced I mean yeah compared to like a you know plastic picnic chair sure but it it's I don't know there's you sell a million lawn chairs you sell like 20 of
these there's molding costs and stuff you know okay yeah and this full up nicely so you can tuck it away there are more affordable ones to be very clear but it doesn't seem outlandish like "this, wheel so just what you're sitting" "in is, 1650 so the lights just don't" work when I'm in game it just turn off yeah like watch I'll I'll tab this is probably a feature that we probably need to configure or something and credit where credits do everything's in their software and all easily
accessible and controllable I just don't know why the lights turn off okay okay oh wow wow I really feel like I'm driving the wheel feels stronger and smoother than the old ones I think Alex may not have given them quite enough credit for the upgrades that they've made to this over the years I think there's just that a lot of competitors just destroy them on price like the otes racing stuff is pretty good and much cheaper I think feels more premium well we've seen that pattern a lot today yeah
oh ow oh that that looks really aggressive pretty strong very strong compared to my old one so credit where it's due it's better than it used to be "but the price is just $1,000 is a lot" not competitive with some of the really cool stuff out there from smaller brands that focus on this stuff oh good job oh yeah and what if you don't want to sit at your desk oh yeah the Logitech g-cloud okay in all seriousness I thought this thing was stupid when I first heard about it I did a full review
it was it's great it's actually really cool this is a totally valid alternative to something like a PS portal because you can use the Sony app to totally stream your PlayStation games anywhere where you've got Wi-Fi and you can also stream PC games or you can just play Android games the only thing I really didn't like in my review of this thing was that you have to agree to 10 cents terms of service in order to use it because it was done in collaboration with them I don't know if that's the
case anymore but uh H total damage with everything that you have set up in front of you yes $611 not including the computer or the monitor or the desk $611 it's not like anything is bad nope it's just expensive it's also surprisingly cohesive that's true the software does really work really well with games and integration with the lights and all the other things so you do have that going for you easy recommend when it's on promo gets a little tougher when it's at full price yeah reasonable conclusion I
think that's pretty fair I think so also "$3,000 in chairs and racing Sim stuff so" "and $3,000 in segue to our sponsor" rocket money you and I both know that you're not using every streaming service you're subscribed to yet they are still leeching money from your bank account rocket money wants to help they make cancelling unwanted subscriptions easy so there's no need to go digging around in a bank statement to solve the mystery of who or what is taking your money every month one click and just like that
