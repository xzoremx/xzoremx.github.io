this apparently is a 150 in TV or tablet I don't know what it is what it isn't is 150 in at least according to my tape measure maybe they got some new way of measuring these things over in China they do what it's called the Chinese inch what what Chinese inch we sto using that like hundreds of years ago oh my God wait there is a Chinese inch like every dentisty have like their own inches their own measurement unit Jokes Aside the seller actually told us there is a little difference
between Chinese inches and foreign ones this is the size in centimeters but um there's a slight problem with that the last time I checked even 150 CM would be nowhere near the 100 in that this TV actually is and they have centimeters listed alongside their inch measurements so we have a few problems here first there is no difference between an inch in the US and an inch in China right Andy oh according to like the article that I'm currently reading the Chinese inch it's
longer okay so it should be bigger that means we've been scammed so I need to unbox these TVs to find out what the heck we got how big they really are and even if they work also where's our segue to today's sponsor aonis for a limited time you can get 20% off aonis cyber protect for comprehensive cyber threat defense and a chonis snap deploy they're all-in-one server deployment and provisioning solution use our link today to learn more I am far more interested to understand why there's an Android and
Windows logo as the only visible markings on the outside of this box Jamie has a theory he thinks that it might actually be a Smartboard oh that'd be a great value at that price then I don't think it is is it touchscreen maybe I don't know I think it's just a TV what whatever is or isn't inside of these boxes I owe you guys some background first a few months ago PL found this listing on Ali Express for a 150 in TV for $2500 and a 100 in set for $640 now that listing is still up but
now that we've actually ordered the TVs it's pretty clear that they are not those sizes based on some quick measurements it looks like the 100 in is what you've got and this is more like a 65 which should have cost us 640 and $442 so they overcharged Us by two grand funny to you yeah it's not my money these don't even look like they came from the same manufacturer so yeah that's true the boxes are totally different High dynamic range 2160p every time I buy something like
this I wonder I can't be the only one who are the other people right like there wouldn't be a listing for it if nobody ever bought one all right oh yeah oh buddy okay hold on hold on y ready 1 I'm going to have to go just a little bit at of time though cuz my arm's going to get stuck yeah and 1 2   honestly I can tell he's okay that's why I'm fine I'm fine my my palm hurts a little bit but it's okay okay I don't know why I thought there might be more information on the other
side cuz there really isn't there's not wait I get it the Android is cuz it uses an Android derived operating system and the window is because the image Clarity no it's cuz is like looking through a window it's PC gaming ready that's why okay there's no way make a comment now don't cheat don't watch the rest of the video who's right is this not sealed not really no what what the hell we're supposed to lift it up why would they have the top open oh man this is it's got to the thing's got to this thing is
going to tip over no no it's we got this no brother we got this we got this you say this don't even worry dog oh that she goes it's got handles oh yeah she she's got handles for sure you know what's funny handles actually better than the handles on that high sense TV Dude I don't think it's loose I think it's just a plastic handle my God oh my God ohow my hands oh my God that was terrible they do feel ster they feel significantly better and they're not sharp on the inside oh my God yeah that hurts oh the
feet oh all right and the remote or no oh look those feel pretty good I heard metal we got a couple of options oh oh oh interesting it's a two-piece system and then that bad boy goes on there and I got to say compared to some of the other large format displays we've seen recently these Vasa holes actually feel pretty good are they Vasa holes well I mean Vasa is sure oh we got our first spec plof what is it led hey that could be a lot of things based on the thickness though I'm going
to Hazard a guess that it is full array you think so really it would be thinner if it was EDG lit wouldn't it not if it's cheap have you looked at the bezel yet uh oh it's thick damn that's not the wow oh that's interesting it also has like a front glass and a recess display it's way back is this one of the kick prooof TVs I have no idea it looks like it has like a front careful layer we got to turn it on at least first and then you can try kicking it although I think if you kick
it we're not sending it back that's fair if it was one of the kick proof TVs it would explain how it got here in one piece look at how little packing material is left on this side yeah she's right at the edge and there was no front foam or back foam or anything just this flimsy cover she is so front heavy dude look can you see the angle it's tilted at yeah okay watch this I'm going to put  that or is it going like this probably like this got to be like that cuz it's a
recessed here yeah I'm thinking the feet kind of go out yeah so that must be this side also that is curved as  is maybe it's curved to the TV yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah sure sure thing buddy I'm in my lifting position you ready boys I think so I don't even know where this is going in lift it once so I can see where it's going I don't know where it's going  okay where the hell does it go I don't know yeah oh my God okay I got to put it down I got to put it down see these holes right here 1 2 3 four five but it
doesn't even have six holes I know maybe you don't need uh well I don't know that's the only that's the only spot I can find that's even got holes for like mounting stuff and clearly this is there's a structural something here the handles here they're the right thread what the convenient low back force of the ratchet makes starting screws a snap you know how the rubber is kind of cut off I think it's because of this but it's actually a little bit too long still even though you positioned it
perfectly yeah so that's so that is what it is yeah no no no okay never mind never mind okay can I put it down yep y do it well he's finishing that up why don't we take a look at IO we've got an antenna some kind of probably decryption card standard that I'm not familiar with a couple of what look like USB 2 ports two hdmis completely unlabeled so no idea what standard they are another HDMI you've got Lan two coax Jacks and then composite like not with the little breakout thing like fullon composite and
then a c-13 power and nice little power switch my notes say the next thing I'm supposed to do is look for Branding and the script says who the hell is Cen Singh but I don't know where I would have gotten that branding from because it's nowhere on anything it's on their web on the AliExpress store on the marketing materials okay also why are there featured apps YouTube Netflix Disney plus HBO none of that shit's in China congratulations you now own one of the most state-of-the-art and
technologically advanced highdefinition television products available wow who we are we'll never tell also here's a front view of the TV showing you how to use your channel plus Channel minus Volume Plus and volume minus buttons is that even the same TV is the bezel on the bottom really that big there's no way no that's a freaking CRT or something okay the remote's the same at least it didn't come with batteries there's a card here that looks like it's all in Mandarin or simplified Chinese Andy can you read
this I can help all the service and warranty is not like you can't use it like in Hong Kong in maau or Taiwan or other country oh we're other country yeah we're other country so nice no warranty this morning plof asked me like if something it's a well-known brand so in a way yes because the Chinese pronunciation of Samsung is sing so they just picked something that sounds really similar to Samsung exactly oh my God plof what it totally leans back it really does do you know why cuz the legs are backwards no
because it's front heavy I don't know if that's the case I think they I think that's why they're curved I think the legs are wrong that's my theory I don't think the legs are wrong cuz you would want the the bigger leg in the front 100% it's top heavy 100% so it's less dangerous to no man no man that's their compensation mechanism we should get a level let's just not try to lift it too high for now that's a great idea is this console wide enough 88 and 1/2 right 70 something
oh balls so we probably don't have a console big enough to put it on I hit power oh smart TV smart TV this looks like absolute dog look at the black  shirt I think Andy's shirt is more black than the black of the TV interestingly though just like in the instructions it's got YouTube Netflix North American apps on it what is this product Twitter how old is that logo you want to connect it to the network not really thank you for reading the terms of use the terms of use from who yeah
it's usually here somewhere if you have any questions please contact us through the after sale Sur who are you I accept your terms you boys ready for some big peel energy wow wow the image quality is so much better it's so it's very glossy dude their anti-glare coating incredible my aunt  hi oh wait lonus that actually have Bruning oh oh my god what's it say Andy what's it say the first two Chinese character it's like colorful you know it's a TV it's of course it's colorful yeah but like that's TCL it
makes TCL is Wang Pai in in China wait so like so this is TCL it must be why does that make sense because Samsung sold all of their patents and Manufacturing in China to TCL but I don't understand why it's loaded up in English yeah this should have come out in like simplified Chinese right this came out of the box in English yeah how are we supposed to access Apple TV I don't know try it like what is this going to load Apple TV no there's no way Apple TV get free to download is it download
it download it no star ratings download it no screenshots nothing you may also like what am I downloading right now Apple TV 4K enhanced how do you enhance it I don't know yes 100% but it got dimmer yeah maybe it's just like what the just happened oh my God it said the same thing every time I change it it CH okay a lot of TVs have a store setting because it will like go through demo footage and stuff the store setting is to juice the brightness it's like looking into a mirror with the black too
it's like a perfect dude like High camera behind us this thing is unfilmable standard Dynamic mild what's mild well you want spicy or you want let's go standard sure color temperature yeah sure normal DNR do not resuscitate this TV oh Dynamic noise reduction probably that's what I'm thinking okay that looks pretty legit it does uhhuh sign in please be my guest also look how the uniformity is like kind a gray I maybe that's just a weird gray that Apple TV loading screen has I don't know I don't think it
is it looks so bad um it's not TCL what it's a knockoff TCL so they knocked off Sam they knocked off TCL and you would put it past them to knock off Apple someone asked the question is Wai Wai the same Wai as TCL one answer is saying oh like this is like a sub brand blah blah blah but like there are bunch of people be like no that's knockoff no the quality sucks no no no TCL is Wai Wai is not TCL I can confirm the quality sucks I'm logging in though I don't see why this would be wrong what do they have to
gain other than access to your data this is the worst Wi-Fi chip in a TV I've ever seen okay I'm going to put the phone closer I don't know if that's going to help we should plug the shield in oh yeah look how much faster it is when you're close what the hell yeah I just had to go closer I wonder if it's the aluminum in the TV is blocking the signal I don't know man but it's way faster now there's a tech tip for you yeah put phone I think this is the most fun I've had filming a TV video since the kick proof
TV whether this is kick prooof or not I don't even care anymore oh my God you ready to give me your theory about how YouTube also has a gradient in their background now that's really  Rave okay it doesn't it doesn't have a mic wow this is what comes up if you're not signed in Donald Trump on whatever this device profile is up the PPI of 100 in 4k also why did it default to like 480p that's why I wanted to check the PPI cuz I'm like this looks like ass oh we maybe don't have the speed for
it so we are at a uh whopping 44 PPI wait I can get even closer to the antenna oh my God put an Apple box I think that's what the antenna over there was for I thought it was some kind of like TV signal or something yeah it got better as you moved itude it got better as dude try bumping it to 4K now let's see if we can do it your phone's it's probably fine yeah you got Apple Care right no well all right take out the ceramic Shield dude optimal I don't think it's going to
do it very well no it's going to do it it's going to do it okay it's going I'll give it that it's  while how can it be so obno noxiously loud and yet so quiet and impossible to hear at the same time yeah it's real rough it's like they took all the audio and they just like squeeze it into one little picture actually looks kind of okay this is fine yeah all right let's plug in the shield and see how it does with a proper signal sure 4K 6 the option no way this is HDMI 1.4 on a 4K
TV maybe I just picked the worst HDMI of the bunch okay I'm going to try TR yeah that's garbage all right all right looks so bad it's still 4K oh my God what a piece of crap to be fair only one of them has Arc try the middle one it's not going to be better well it has it's the one with Arc The Arc one is never the highs speeded Port ploof ah I know but benefit of the utmost doubt the last  ready yes okay all right okay are I'm glad we tried I wouldn't have wanted to be unfair to rip off TCL ripoff Samsung
here what is happening it's see flickering yeah this is a functional picture only in a dark dark room but it's functional I'm not saying it's good but it's not the worst and it's bright enough that it overpowers the reflections a little is this 60 FPS or is it smoothing no it is 60 it's actually 60 FPS but no HDR is not working it could also be just a YouTube app issue let's try Plex hdr10 so it must have been some kind of app related issue before okay she's trapped she's trapped behind the glass
in the space between the glass and the picture I don't think it has any kind of full array local dimming no no no definitely not this is EDG lit to the max so it's bright but it lacks contrast and it really doesn't help that the blacks that it does manage just turn into whatever's behind you yeah I can see us like perfectly impressively though I don't think the color accuracy is that far off no the Green in her glasses is usually what I kind of go off of and like the white on her on her
blouse and um looks okay I bet you the blacks and Grays and whites are what would really throw it off yeah uh cuz the black is not going to get anywhere close color wise it looks not bad yeah I wonder how it Gaines let's try dude I think that this is like handling Sho yeah it is yeah cuz I wiped it over there and it's not coming off dude you can clearly see it is clearly all over the inside want to hear something crazy yeah input legs not bad what yeah cuz we're in game mode well it's probably
cuz it's not doing any processing it doesn't have any motion compensation or you color smoothing or gradient reduction or whatever right HDR here we go looks awful that's cool but it works yeah it does work that is clearly HDR For Better or For Worse you know sometimes HDR in Windows looks bad this thing is such a piece of crap how much how much did we pay for it like $2500 or something the worst part is you can get a TCL for that now I know well don't forget we paid $ 2500 thinking it
was a 150 in they have offered some kind of compensation we don't know yet because they wouldn't process anything until they basically told us like okay it's shipped but also if you cancel it now it won't come to your door it'll just get to the port and then return so if you want it at all either of the TVs cuz they're bundled you have to not dispute the claim now get them and then dispute it later I don't even know when we dispute this I don't even know what's going to happen oh we need to dispute it
oh 100% it's we're obviously getting frauded to some degree to some degree I think to a pretty significant degree I think so too no no no no eight bit with dithering that's awful oh no that makes sense but look Peak bright Peak brightness 1500 nits I know that Windows doesn't always accurately report the brightness number no cuz that's just from the edid so that's just whatever it thinks that's what it's trying to do I call HDR certification not found yeah that's a right I want to know
if I can do 1080p higher refresh rate no 60 but we got rid of the dithering just 8bit but we got some nasty interpolation look at how bad this text looks yeah also so you can really see the dirty screen effect when I move this around on It In fairness okay even my TCL at home the big 115 in has very significant dirty screen effect but you can mitigate it by turning on the full array local dimming dude I can't believe how much of the glass is dirty oh yeah it's really bad it's like 8 in in in
some spots yeah no like I tried to fix it I tried to clean it cuz I'm like no this can't be like actually just stuck  I was about to say imagine if you paid $2500 for this TV and received it from China and then I realized that you  what okay well I don't I don't know what's going on with this try um I'm  oh looks so bad the pixel response yeah it's just so blurry this looks like motion blurs on I'm well aware that we're way too close to the screen but the PPI is so bad that's not even the
end of the world necessarily but the contrast is so bad because it's a garbage panel that the perceived sharpness is much lower it honestly kind of looks like uh the um intrusive thoughts video where you had the Monitor and the freezer it really does it does right it looks like the pixels are just super slowed down so this is just the most garbage random VA panel that they can manufacture in this size yeah thanks Sans Singh mainland China yeah Sans Singh Sans Singh it's not sunshing it's
not sunshing China Korea Samsung okay well this is not got different legs leg like here Samsung you see that Crystal that is not what we got well there might be a crystal processor in here we don't know it might be made of crystal don't know if it actually processes anything the funny thing is this is the exact same marketing material but it is a slightly different page from the seller that we purchased from because I noticed that uh ours has um some different like questions and and stuff on it oh my God
so it's like the exact same thing but a different seller so how many different sellers are using the same marketing material look at Aver his HDR I mean it technically has it technically has it it's not very good but it has it this has to be just ripped right off of Samsung's actual Marketing in China actually saying like Samsung they must have pulled it off of multiple different TVs because these are not all the same TV Fire questions and answers how many inches no answers no answers just
questions how many inches it has how many inches not 150 it has 150 Chinese inches that's all the different price at the different sizes right they just send you whatever size they feel like I guess I guess so because they clearly sent us the 100 in and the 65 in now the question is is this just the same thing but smaller and it is everything from the weird little antenna to the manufacturing shoo between the glass and the panel is exactly what we just saw I don't think we need to fire it up but we
can give them some credit it's a 75 in maybe 77 maybe 77 not Chinese inches Squarespace building a userfriendly visually captivating website for your business is not particularly easy luckily with Squarespace you're set up with a blueprint for Success their new guided design system aptly named Squarespace blueprint helps you build your own unique online presence from the ground up with professionally curated layouts and styling options then dive into the details with their fluid engine
