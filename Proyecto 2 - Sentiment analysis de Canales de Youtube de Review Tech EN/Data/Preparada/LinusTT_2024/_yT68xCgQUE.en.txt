what is up everyone and welcome to the W show we've got a great show lined up for you guys today I hope Apple launched their M4 processor bringing Ray tracing to the iPad and Microsoft has caught heat for sudden game Studio closures including the maker of surprise hit Hi-Fi Rush uh at risk of spoiling a little bit of this topic the worst part of it is was it just after the studio closure or just before the Studio closure that Microsoft basically came out and said we need more games like
those games they just made I remember which one it was but it was very closely tied we'll get into it what else we got today yeah uh you know Sony I'm I'm going to pull this one out Sony just keeps digging we we thought we thought they were out of it you know they added PSN to Hell divers and then they're like okay we'll take it away and it's not back but the reason why everyone was actually mad is back dude Sony is the classicist example of a company that never learns yeah they never ever learn
yeah and we'll talk about that also uh there there's new handheld news Rog allyx Nintendo switch 2 stuff's coming you picked that what else is there all   the show is brought to you today by ag1 Ridge and back Blaze why don't we jump right into our headline topic which is of course the ad that Apple released for the new iPad uh let's let's get through what the new iPad is Apple officially launched their new M4 chip surprising I mean anyone who doesn't pay attention to leaks uh there was some speculation
earlier this week that uh Twitter's AI uh news summary feature may have access to scheduled tweets because of how accurate its summary of the upcoming Apple event was I don't think that that's been confirmed I don't think that that's necessarily gone anywhere I haven't followed it up so maybe it did but I saw that I thought it was pretty funny anyway the new M4 chip is broadly similar to the M3 but has an additional two efficiency cores and a 20% increase in memory bandwidth um apple is also claiming a
more powerful neural engine and that's where some of the speculation about why we're getting an M4 chip before they've even seemingly finished rolling out the M3 family I mean anyone else noticed that the Max studio still has an M2 series chip in it I mean are Mac users and and by Mac users I don't mean Apple users I mean specifically Mac not MacBook are Mac users feeling like just Apple just straight up doesn't care about you at all every single time every single time they come back and they're
like no no we hear you uh you matter to us here's a new Mac Pro with upgradeable memory and upgradeable GPU by the way we're never going to rev this again and bye-bye oh wait no we haven't forgot about you here's a Mac Pro that uses Apple silicon by the way none of the upgrades and stuff are there and it's like way more expensive for reasons we can't fully explain uh uh also we're just not going to we're just not going to revise it you're going to be on M2 silicon forever and then our other
products literally the iPad is going to get M4 before you guys get M3 it's it's it's kind of it's kind of mind-blowing at this point anyway the more powerful neural engine is fueling speculation that Apple has accelerated their plans for M4 with all this AI in the news and to make sure that their stock price doesn't go down because they don't have enough AI honestly I kind of doubt it realistically Apple's at a level where people do not invest in Apple for AI people invest in Apple because
they have a very very beautiful wonderful balance sheet on a quarterly basis um anywh who uh benchmarks from geekbench show the M4 easily beating untils core i91 14900 K in terms of single core performance of course we've talked about this a fair bit in the past geekbench is not the Beall and endall of performance it's just convenient to run because it happens to be crossplatform and the chip is launching in the first iPad to feature Ray tracing and Hardware accelerated mesh shading man if only
they would let you run Mac OS on it it would be like kind of the best Mac OS machine with a little folio um Apple also announced the new M2 powered iPad Air which is actually slightly thicker than the iPad Pro the iPad Pro is crazy thin and that's where some of the marketing it's weird hubub has come from it is you're going to call it air and have it be the thicker version that is weird I mean look it's cool that the pro is so thin I'm just saying look Luke this is the company what bring you Mac Pro Mac
Pro Mac Pro all of which are completely different products with completely different characteristics they don't the the trash can one doesn't even look the same as the other ones this is also the company what BR you uh oh I'm trying to think a shoot no I was going somewhere  Max Pro Ultra I don't even I don't even remember literally their most important product line has gotten bloated to the point where it's kind of a mess the iPhone used to be simple it used to be here's the new
iPhone oh by the way you can still buy the old iPhone and it's cheaper yeah then we got I'm trying to think of the exact order that things happen then we got the SE oh yeah yeah and the SE kind of made sense it was clearly separated from the rest of the product line it didn't have the same premium feel you know unapologetically plastic uh but but kind of made sense and then things just got completely off the rails because now we've got we've got pros we've got Pro Maxes we've got X is where it really
went off the off the rails for me person sry X iPhone x iPhone 10 oh oh the iPhone 10 right it's just like that was where they they really lost me um yeah I'm excited while we're talking about naming stuff I'm going to allude to something I want to talk about later I don't want to talk about it now though but uh yeah like what the heck are they going to call the the new Switch oh well because a lot of news articles are saying switch too but all they said is successor to the switch
there's no way Nintendo calls it switch 2 well we'll get we'll get into that later all right fine f make a note in the Luke section then uh they also launched the pencil Pro which is only compatible with the 2024 iPad Pro and iPad Air and another notable detail is that upgrading the M4 iPad Pro to the 1 TB model will also get you a more powerful 10 core processor versus the nine core standard one which is uh very MacBook like I thought it was uh I thought it was the 512 as well uh so
don't don't quote me on that but definitely you can get a more powerful processor by upgrading the storage I guess is this apple sort of tacitly acknowledging that people uh that that maybe they shouldn't be charging so much for just storage upgrades so they're going to Nerf the processor in their lower tier model so that you feel like you're getting more value I'm I'm actually not sure anyway there was an ad for the new iPad Pro and I have what I suspect is going to be a pretty unpopular take on it I
wonder if it'll be unpopular with people here here is the commercial we're going to watch it which is still up by the way in spite of the fact actually no let's not watch the whole thing cuz I don't feel like getting you know dmca by Apple but the point is basically there's a whole bunch of stuff uh you know you got a piano you got a metronome you got a whole bunch of what looks like DJ equipment a filming slate whole bunch of stuff uh there's some lenses and some art supplies they crush it under a
gigantic what appears to be a hydraulic press but I don't know might be a prop who knows uh and then they lift it back up to reveal the new I iPad Pro look at it go oh my goodness look okay legitimately looks incredibly which is which is pretty darn cool so this has caused a pretty big stir I'm going to I'm going to read the notes and then I'm going to kind of give you my take sure um the commercial features of blah blah blah blah blah blah okay Apple uh oh no we'll get to
that the ad was particularly unpopular in Japan with some people calling it disgusting and evil uh a few Japanese commentator connected this revulsion to the traditional Shinto belief that tools and household belongings can come to possess their own kind of Soul with the passing of time and therefore deserve to be treated with a level of dignity and respect uh Hugh Grant came out saying uh hold on let me see if I can find uh quote Apple iPad uh Pro hold on let me see if I can find it um he called
it the destruction of The Human  um so just wait till he finds out by AI Apple seems okay this is from my notes to have intended this as a metaphor for how all of the functions of these items are included with the iPad however others particularly artists saw it as a dystopian visual metaphor of an impersonal industrial machine destroying symbols of human creativity all right so here comes the hot take I'm with apple on this one also I think apple is still with apple on this
one they apologized for it and left the ad up and left the ad up because I think the cold hard truth is that Apple recognizes that this is a storm in a teacup and that people generally speaking understood what they were saying and here's the thing I get that art is in the eye of the beholder and the meaning of art can be in the eye of of The Interpreter right and in many cases there there there are many examples of of art where the the writer be it of a song or the or the or the painter be it of uh of a
painting goes out of their way to never completely explain what it meant and and that's that's part of the fun of it right where they're basically like no I want I want you to form your own opinion I want you to find your own meaning in this obviously it had some kind of meaning to me or maybe it didn't who knows obviously it had some kind of meaning to me but I want to know I want to know what it means to you um so people if you guys can I'm examples are escaping me so float plane chat if you
want to hit me with with a couple of famous examples of that that would be great just so that everyone can kind of enjoy that um but that's not what this is Apple has come out and said what they meant by it so for us to go well it meant this other thing I think is what what did they say specifically is this something you already said did I miss it actually you know what no I don't think I don't think they did say it I think probably thought they thought it was obvious sorry I was
going based on our notes they seem to have intended this as a metaphor for how all the functions of these items are included Within thep and to me that is that is pretty obvious um Tarantino in that stupid briefcase says Lucid Lucy okay yes okay so there that's that's a good example um but yeah I would I would have thought that would be pretty obvious and to me to to take what you were watching and say oh well we don't care about the the the human Artistry of anything anymore is sort of
silly because Apple's not saying they didn't put humans in a hydraulic press they put tools in a hydraulic press and all they were saying was here's another tool here's a tool that does so many of the things this this  that I think it's manufactured outrage basically there's a there's a take from someone at Philip chat from a lot earlier in the show um guran mkd that says lonus I heard your point on the iPad ad I think you missed the point of why people are upset it's tone deaf
because the iPad doesn't replace needing a piano or and hold on let me get to the end um it's don't n because uh the iPad doesn't replace anying of piano or paint or TV or the other things the iPad isn't able to do the tactile feel and artistic expression from having objects the iPad is a tool that can support those tasks your take that people are upset because the iPad doesn't replace the artist is  Red Bull doesn't give you wings I don't know it does one thing that's
interesting to me is do we know because I've seen some people say so but I haven't seen any official statements for it do we know if it was CGI or real um I'm not sure cuz it doesn't look real to me at least some parts of it like the uh when it squishes the face of the thing the little toy thing yeah there were things that looked wrong to me um but I don't know yeah I'm not sure so I don't want to uh apparently it's CGI with a lot of video but how do we know that because
I've seen people say that but I've only seen random people on like in in Threads say that I haven't seen any official thing saying that so okay evulsion says lus I see your a point however there's a strong argument that even works with an established intended meaning uh where it can have meaning beyond that which is up to the interpretation of the viewer and and that's fair enough but getting angry about it isn't really helpful if someone's intent was not the thing that
you see in something then we have to be sort of we have to acknowledge that we have to kind of go oh okay well that that that immediate emotional reaction that I had um was not your intention and I think in general and we we've said this when people really like ads and stuff too is like just have your general like balance and happiness and whatnot a lot less connected to Brands like when when Wendy's and other various Brands were running wild on Twitter there for a while and people were like emotionally
invested in like these Brands dunking on people it was like just as cringe because it's like dude it's just marketing it's just Brands just ignore it this isn't like good for you you're losing the game H so in general I uh I think this is much to do about nothing I think their intended uh I think their intended purpose was very clear um I I I I think that we have far more pressing concerns especially because the the iPad has been such an artist's tool and yeah you're right it doesn't replace
a piano in the same way that a synth doesn't replace a piano right but it absolutely is an instrument of artistic  be I I I don't know I I I I think if I use words so is your phone so is so is anything a rock so is a garbage can lid anything can be a tool for artistic expression and all Apple was trying to say was that this tool for artistic expression can combine metaphorically theun of everything you see here they obviously recognize that a Swiss army knife okay is not the world's best knife
it is not the world's best pair of tweezers and it is not the world's best toothpick in fact it is not a toothpick at all because I don't know about you guys but for me the toothpick gets lost immediately okay immediately it's just garbage but that doesn't mean if if if Swiss Victorinox or whatever the the company that makes Swiss Army knives if they made a commercial like that where they took you know a shovel and and a whatever and and they compressed it all they compressed it all into this Swiss
army knife I'd love to see someone dig with a Swiss suck dude we we wouldn't be having the same conversation no probably not I mean there's there's a million other people are linking all these in um in in flow plane chat right now there's a ton of other ads that are like effectively the same thing um like people posted this one from LG where's my thing here it is someone's like uh by your logic a firearm could be used as artistic expression have you ever seen a firearm with a skin on
it no seriously there's there's a I guarantee you someone has tried to draw a picture with a firearm at some point yeah and people used to do uh not used to they still do it like stipple art on on plastic and leathery ones and they used to do wood engraving and look you might not like that form of art you might not like what they're expressing what if what they're expressing is their is their Second Amendment right to bear arms and shoot guns at things that's human expression you you don't get to just
say that's oh where's your violin like no literally anything can be a form of human expression yes even a gun Tri said pain pting Firearms is huge in the industry now painting Firearms has been huge in the industry for well yeah long time do you guys remember the video of the guy playing a Christmas song firing a gun no I haven't actually I haven't actually seen that it isn't it isn't my point though it isn't my point we're not saying it's good or bad artistic expression we're we're seeing it just it
just is and you don't get to you don't get to gatekeep it um so yeah sorry guys I don't I don't care um I actually fully defend Apple in this case okay so in so do you they should leave the ad up do you so you defend them leaving the ad up and not apologizing for it they did Apologize do you but they left it up I'm with them on it do you think it's a good ad if if there was no controversy yeah nobody talked about it because nobody talked about the bunch of other ads that are exactly the same thing yeah
yeah I I no I think I think it's a good ad I think their previous ad was better which one um someone linked this as well but I remember this and I think we even talked about on W show but this one you remember this ad what is this what's a computer yeah this is not a better ad no I don't even I don't even know what the I'm looking at right now what do you mean like okay what I can I could draw on it yeah I think the whole point of this ad was that she can do a lot of the things
you can do on a computer but she can do it on an iPad that's all it was I guess it just it it takes a really long time to get to the point that's fair that is a that is a that that is a 68c ad yeah so I guess okay hold on I should clarify then I don't think that I don't think it's bad I think that it is you think the compression one is better it's struggling to hold my attention and so the percentage of that that I would be likely to watch before clicking skip ad is much lower whereas I think that the
hydraulic press ad is very much designed for now interesting I don't know what the music plan was I watched it on but like basically I'm sure there's some dramatic music but like something exciting is going to happen right and they do a great job of kind of cutting in for for dynamic interesting looking colorful closeups you you you kind of can't look away from it and that that gripping this while without being so explicit that's the other thing like that iPad ad that's something I could have
storyboarded well yeah I don't know let's just have a little girl like do a bunch of stuff with it that it does like that's not it's it it says it explicitly whereas the hydraulic press ad says it implicitly which maybe was their mistake because it allows people to kind of insert their own narrative here about you're destroying AI yeah AI destroying art and not having respect for for you know classical instruments of of  but no I wanted to compare the views on them because I know this iPad ad
actually got you know 2 2.3 million views yeah um but I can't find what's a computer actually posted by Apple that's because Apple pulls down their old marketing collateral instead of just leaving it up uh in fact they they sent if I they sent some kind of legal notice to someone who uh archived all of their old advertising collateral and were B basically like you need to take this down you need to delete it all and it's like sorry what like that's lame cuz they some cool advertising you
guys you should you literally pay money to have people watch this and then you're like no no no don't keep don't keep watching it that's oh that's the old one so to be clear there there's still plenty of things that I think apple is so far up their own asses about that they will never see the light of day ever again oh yeah this commercial just isn't one of them what jump into our next topic here you want to pick it people are also pointing out this is an interesting one trig in uh in flow plane
chat is pointing out that the like original iPhone 1 commercials do try to make effectively the same point that they're like rep not really cuz not musical instruments but they're trying to show that like the iPhone is replacing lots of different objects and if you remember a lot of the marketing around smartphones and they originally came out was like you don't have to have all these things anymore you just have a phone this is is like none of these are new marketing points
yeah I think this is one of those things where it just happened to land at a moment of high sensitivity around this subject um and I think the I think that's actually part of why people were so upset about the recent um gamer food video as well so it was right on the heels of one or two high-profile channels basically leaving YouTube or or pay Walling most most of their content on their own sites our gamer food video okay yeah so so we were try we've been trying to figure out like
what happened there and there were definitely some issues in the way that it was messaged and the way that it was cut I did end up watching it and I do agree yeah there were issues but how mad people were like how incredibly angry they were um didn't seem to really match um the the the the sin that we had committed and we were kind of trying to figure out why it was and it does seem like that was a significant contribution to how upset people were because the wounds were a little raw and I think
that's probably what we're seeing right here we're seeing open wounds in the artistic Community around computers replacing Human Art but that isn't what Apple was trying to say at all obviously yeah the iPad has never even a little bit has never been and it could be with you know third- party software you could do generative AI art stuff on it but that's never been Apple's message Apple has always positioned their professional tools as for creators of Art and the fact that they had it taking the place
of tools for creators of art means that that was the message these tools now this tool and it's so thin those other things couldn't possibly hope to fit in this hydraulic press yeah and like do people in chat like Monty Hawk is saying and copyright is going to be continue to be bypassed by AI with vague and hidden BS with more scraping of data and theft totally the ad had literally 0% to do with that that's that's the this is the thing that we're kind of talking about
is like we think and I agree with lus it makes sense we think there's a lot of rage coming from that area attacking this thing but this thing was saying nothing about AI it isn't what Apple was trying to say obviously but is not toned deaf to say when that open wound of AI replacing artist is ongoing but that's the thing right like if we know what they're trying to say and we know that what they're trying to say is not the thing that we're upset about then what's toned deaf about it like is our response
to them ton deaf is is intentionally if I know what you're trying to say and I know that it's not the thing that's upsetting to me I'm the one being irrational yeah if I go well I'm going to be mad anyway not them that's not on them intentionally misunderstanding someone that's up don't do that yeah why would you do that even for no other reason than it's just a waste of time and energy for yourself yeah just chill why be mad it's just a it's just some freaking ad there's grass man go touch
it go touch it it's okay maybe go touch it with a paintbrush you know there's water there's water restrictions in place you can't water it if you live around outside these days go paint outside get some green paint get it on there paint your lawn you took him a while to figure out what I was talking about oh yeah I thought you were just like fancily telling people to go touch grass I didn't realize you were like there's a dra there's a Dr go paint your grass screen oh sick it's like wow condescending much
okay twitch chat you lost your chat privileges  exactly oh man all right I think it's one of those things where it's getting worse because the global stress levels are so high small perceived slight yeah it's just that's that's what we're kind of saying it's like you get that but just relax oh man there's so many there's so many like legitimately scary things to be mad about yeah we should legitimately be upset about the whole like AI generative like they took our jobs situation there's tons of problems
there that Apple ad just isn't it yeah so why why invest the energy in it save it it's like Hugh Grant look strength no offense but when's the last time you made a movie that I wouldn't just watch on my iPad boom roasted H Grant what does he make he was actually in that Dungeons and Dragons movie that was very good oh yeah I I I I legitimately actually I I do enjoy he very recently oh yeah oh no no I I know I know I know I was just no I was just I was I was I was just
quing grant yeah he's cool you you don't know actors I don't know anybody I know it's sad anyway why don't we move on Microsoft has been catching okay okay back to things that you should be mad about here here is a legitimate here's a legitimate channel for that energy this could take some action Microsoft has suddenly closed three three Studios that it acquired alongside Bethesda including Tango Gameworks the developer of the award-winning and widely praised Hi-Fi Rush Arcane oh sorry uh HiFi Rush
uh oh oh AR how do I pronounce aen uh I think that's supposed to be Austin oh that makes way more sense Arcane Austin developer of prey and redfall was another loss meaning that development of red Arcane studios in Austin Texas is effectively over and its promised DLC has been cancelled uh purchasers of the hero pass that promised access to this future DLC will instead receive a credit of unknown value neat and the studio head at Arcane Austin's sister Studio Arcane Leon
called the closure aing gut stab uh fans meanwhile have been reverse review bombing Hi-Fi Rush with positive reviews in a show of support according to reporting from Bloomberg even more Microsoft studios are likely to close in the near future due to a widespread cost cutting initiative there's other reasons as well maybe we'll get into them here I'm not sure during a Bloomberg event Xbox president Sarah Bond gave a nonan to the question of whether launching a surprise hit game should protect a
developer from being shut down as the camera cut to a wide shot showing a very interesting graph of Xbox's year-over-year growth Here Comes our very interesting graph yeah all right cool are you allowed to call it growth I guess growth could be a negative number that makes sense Xbox game studios head Matt booty also inflamed the controversy when it was reported that he told employees during an internal meeting a day after the closures that Xbox needed smaller games that give us Prestige and awards which
is the the defense that I've heard around that yes um is that Hi-Fi Rush was actually a surprisingly large game in the sense of the like cost of development Studio size and stuff like that but I I would still argue that it out preceded expectation I mean when we talk about big games these days we're talking about you know quadruple a games in my mind Honestly though like I when you when you tell me a big game these days you try to compare budgets of so yeah I'm sitting here
going okay well is it cyber punk you know is it GTA 6 like what what's what's a big game so when you say small layer games he didn't even say small smaller games that give us Prestige and awards yeah I don't know enough about the size of like um what was it was it Arcane a no Tango Gameworks I don't know I don't know anything about the size of of that so I can't really compare it and the whole AAA nomenclature is weird these days anyways cuz like what does it even mean any I heard I don't remember where
I heard this but I heard that the original for that came from like the fin industry and it was supped to essentially Define games that were like a safe investment because they were like leaning on IPS that people knew would sell and stuff like that and that's just not what the AAA industry is anymore here's my question if they're so strapped for cash could they have just not bought Beth bought a bunch of Studios yeah I wonder a bunch of Studios could they have just not bought Bethesda
specifically I wonder how is  Starfield that's an interesting question I I talked about this on the W show I don't know how long ago but I I had a discussion topic I don't know how we got onto this but I talked about how um I I think there were some quotes from the director of publishing from laran or something in there as well but uh I I talked about how one of the big problems with these subscription Services is that the companies running the subscription services are just going to want games
that sell the subscription service yep and they're going to have their own internal metrics which probably have deeply flawed aspects of them like they're not going to be perfect yep so they'll they'll do it databased on whatever not databased as in a database yeah but Based on data dat data driven decision making there we go yeah they'll do that but then what if the data is junk and I suspect a lot of that data is going to lead them to massive titles that bring in all of the people instead
of these small games that like you know someone might subscribe to the service because they're like I want I want to play the new Halo or whatever um but what they actually spend all their time playing because Halo sucks now is stuff like um Hi-Fi rush or or whatever else but if they on their exiting survey and their their the first game they play when they sign up if those aren't these smaller titles it might not bring light to them and if should be to see the Playtime though yeah but if you have a
bunch of playtime yeah I don't know it's it it totally depends on how they're measuring that data it also it also is I'm I I guarantee you look I don't I don't work at Microsoft I don't work within the Xbox team but I guarantee you that there's an element of this that's political as well because anytime you just have a bucket of money someone is going to decide what to do with that money if all of these games were selling on on their own individual Merit generating their own Revenue then it
would be directly attributable right back to the team that worked on it whereas if all of these games are minor contributors to a gigantic bucket of money called Game Pass Revenue that someone or someone's is in charge of divvying up kind of going okay so reinvestment wise uh this is going to go into what we think is a good over here and this is going to go into what we think is a good bet over here just because you made something great last time that contributed uh a whole bunch of
subscribers a whole bunch of playtime doesn't necessarily mean that you will be divvied anything so it's actually the complete and what's funny is cuz what what if they don't believe in your vision for your next proposed project then instead of you just automatically having the money for it anyway because your last project did really well you could just be rug pulled and everything's gone and what's funny about this is I remember us having conversations about how subscription
Services could be uh a savior for smaller game developers they and and and they could have it sort of was for a little bit there and they could have been because this this idea that instead of feast and famine where you launch your game you get a whole bunch of Revenue You Squirrel it away like like a like a squirrel saving nuts okay you squirrel it away and then you kind of ration it out until you can get your next game launched um that wasn't sustainable right and so the idea that
you could just have a little bit of consistent Revenue trickling in on a more regular basis by contributing to this pool of games that people can play you know games Netflix style it all it all seemed like a a pretty happy idea here's here's another part of the problem so I I don't think this was in the notes but and if I click on the fortune.com article to try to actually get the whole thing uh there's a giant ad that I can't get past to pay money of Fortune so I'm just going to read off of the the Google
search result for it but it says uh speaking about the closures more broadly booty said that the company Studios had been spread too thin like peanut butter on bread which I thought was a really weird analogy for spread too thin but sure um and that leaders across the division had felt underst staffed and they decided to close these Studios to free up resources elsewhere so they bought all these things right didn't have the the like highle leadership to to manage all these sub Studios now and 
it what a waste like there there's like embracer group just like bought a bunch of stuff and then closed them and Microsoft just bought a bunch of stuff and closed them like this isn't going to make people get interested in your other garbage games that you're releasing it's just going to create more people buying other stuff unrelated to you like if we if we look at a lot of the really big successes as to late they have not been big Microsoft titles what about Halo infinite it's just not working like the
the the buy them and close the model is not going to be effective pretty much guaranteed and I just I gota I got to kind of Wonder right like Bean counters you know if you if your bean counting calculation goes okay this Bean costs $1 billion okay um so you buy it for a billion dollars nice and then you basically go it's a solid Bean right there okay let's throw away this bean I can fit so much fiber in that bean yeah um what's your plan like how did that how did that make it past how did that
make it past the you know that you know that old meme format where the guy gets like hucked out of the window of the boardroom like how how did it make it past that guy yeah yeah I I I actually don't get it and and to be clear um you know it's not like as a company we've never overextended ourselves and and been in a position where you know having twice as many people is is you know actually less efficient right like it's it's not like we aren't at a size where I get that growth has pains but you
don't have to buy things and they did they closed it so fast didn't buy Bethesda that long ago no like it's very quickly no my goodness oh man but throwing away the bean is a tax write off droptable employees and float plane chat you're banned I'm kidding I'm kidding you're not banned I do Wonder like how much like how much of this is just like  at if if they have all these Studios like is it is it better from a stockh holders perspective or someone potentially purchasing a stock this is
stuff I am not good at don't know a lot about so big warning before people get pissed off um from from that perspective is it better for them to just focus on future Revenue than care about what's in the bank right now and I think yes right so they can spend fairly recklessly to like buy Studios as long as they're sharpening the sword for the future is that is that how the like capitalist St stock market perspective goes so what you want if you are an acquisition company which at a certain point they
are every company is you're essentially just what when's the last time Microsoft invented anything and you can basically say that about any gigantic multi- hundreds of billions of dollars company some of them do they just buy small they do very real research and development but a lot of the time they're just they're out there acquiring they buy open AI they're acquiring they're acquiring they're acquiring so at a certain level pretty much every company is an acquisition company so they take
capital from shareholders from investors and they use that Capital to buy something that has recurring Revenue then they basically just need to maintain whatever their target balance of Revenue to who operational expenses is and if they don't then their share price crashes their creditworthiness tanks and they are in enormous trouble because they have a bunch of debt right because they needed that investment in order to make those Acquisitions yeah so it becomes this it becomes this wheel
that they have to keep running on to constantly show a really high operating in which is that which is that uh operating Revenue minus operational expenses uh calculation and so what they might do is buy something and then if it doesn't immediately spend the money machine fast enough by shedding it well a penny saved is a penny earned yeah and from an investor standpoint the the Minor Details like like the amount of money that they had to spend to to reach that number on a
quarter by quarter by quarter by quarter basis uh doesn't really matter as long as they find some other thing to acquire that like does more better or some other thing that you know does whatever it's it's just effectively cost of doing business there is no human element to any of this and that's why you see decisions like this being made that's why you see this level of recklessness um or or Cal I guess is probably the better word um the example of Tesla just laying off their supercharging change though
because they they bought Bethesda for like around 10% of just the cash on hand that they had so I I don't know I mean it was probably still done as some debt purchase because whatever but um I guess what I'm trying to say is that immediate loss on Bethesda doesn't really matter as long as they maintain that ratio this this is what I was trying this was also point that I was effectively trying to like does spending the money effectively not matter and then they try to sharpen the sword
afterwards so like the purchase of Studios from these large companies means honestly next to nothing yeah like it's um and and and they can play an extremely long game as long as they don't run out of capital like I I think I've talked about this before but when one of my friends um has a has an independently owned Veterinary practice and oh yeah um she was talking to me about the nightmare that it was to be bidding on the veterinary practice that she worked at so she worked there she
started as an employee and is now the owner but her journey there was arduous um and as she was reaching the final stages of her negotiation to purchase the veterinary practice um the the problem was that she was bidding against a large could call them a Veterinary company but remember what I just said any company once it's large enough is just an acquisition company so what they really are are an acquisition and holding company that happens to focus on investments into Veterinary practices
because it's a space that they are deeply invested in which can come with strategic advantages which I'll get to in a second and so the problem that she had was typically you would value a business on some multiple of their earnings before something something I forget whatever it's called eida so you know let's say 3 to to 5x for a business that's not expected to experience any kind of explosive growth and what that essentially means is let's say that number was $10 million um I would expect
to buy uh your your your Veterinary practice that makes um $2 million a year I would expect to buy it for somewhere between 6 and10 million and the idea is that if I continue to run it well I will make back my $6 to10 million in 3 to 5 years and if it's a business that's expected to grow then you would expect a higher multiplier because if I run it competently well it should grow and I should I should make my money back in an even shorter period of time and you can see much much higher eidas in fields
like Tech where they're expecting this company to explosively grow in the next two years to the point where they might get that return in you know 18 months right well a Veterinary practice isn't like that you know they're they're probably going to be pretty consistent yeah you might see you might see steady growth unless everyone buys pets because of covid or something like that that there there's no way you can see it coming but there's only so many there's only so many operating rooms you know
there's only so many dogs you can cut open at a time and um and and so so there's there's kind of limit but true yes there's kind of limits to to how much it can grow and so you know somewhere somewhere in the 3 to four to 5x um ranges is probably reasonable for something like that but what she was up against was a company that was bidding about double that and she's looking at it going this makes no real sense like how the the the cost um like I I I have to have debt in order to I I have that kind of money
sitting in the bank it's it's millions of dollars what even a vet right they they don't have millions of dollars of cash in the bank it doesn't work like that like you have to you have to take on debt in order to make an acquisition like that and um so how does this make any sense the amount of interest I'm going to be paying right so but she's up against a group that is playing such a long long game they just don't even care that they don't care they want effectiv monopolistic ownership of all the
veterinary practices in the the general areas they're operating they're playing such a long game and their shareholders don't care about that big hit to the balance sheet this quarter what they care about is is the money machine what's the path turning out consistent income and then once there's no nothing else to acquire well they still have to have that go up so what they do is well now that they control all the veterinary practices in the Vancouver area they jack up the prices um and that's the end
game it destroys everything and the reality of it is that Regulators are not going to get involved in community Veterinary practices because it's not a monopoly in the in the you know strictest sense of the word it's anticompetitive sure but I mean realistically when there are so much bigger battles to fight like you know the $400 Band-Aid that might end up on your invoice at a at a hospital for example what so so like your your dog's broken leg cost you more because some
company owns all the vet legs I'm sorry I don't have time for this it's something that would be nice if they pursued and I'm happy that these days they do seem to be doing roughly anything um but yeah there might be bigger fish so I um so so basically yeah that's the that's the long and short of it they don't care because they don't care because it just doesn't matter to them um which really sucks oh so the the good news for my friend who who owns the practice is that Dr Smith is a good guy one of those
people who actually puts people above money and uh and took took the took the human offer that's cool yeah that's actually really good to know yeah so if you guys are ever ever need need help with uh don't don't assume most people are going to do that either most most people would take the big offer and and you can tell yourself all day you can tell yourself all day and night I would take it I I would take the human offer and then the offer's on the table and then and then there's literally millions
of millions of dollars at stake it's in front of you the document is there all you have to do is sign it pretty much no one's going to know that you did this most people will sign it y um but it was uh it was pretty cool so Dr Smith super cool and um yeah yeah shout out shout out my friend cind from phaser Heights Animal Hospital um really really good good person um yeah she she's super cool so if you guys I don't think they they don't do birds unfortunately for L um they specialize in dogs and cats but our
our vet is actually they're they're very nice people they're just really far away that's the main annoying part um we're supposed to explain and do two merch messages shall we yeah you want me to do it yeah why don't you do you always do it merch messages are the premier way of sending messages into show into the show there are others and they are inferior this is the way to do it you get stuff could you buy a gift card yes if you really just wanted nothing but you should probably you know
get something for your your your message that you choose to send into the store yeah if you choose to do so you can go onto the store pick an item add it to your cart view your cart and there you go on the cart page you can see the merch message you can check the little box I would like my purchase to appear as a merch message on the LTT stream and then leave whatever message you want to leave you can pick your little color you can do all that type of stuff you can make it Anonymous if you
want Etc and then either uh you'll say bad things that we don't want to show up on the show and we'll hide it and it will never be shown to anyone uh or Dan will read it and go like I can respond to that he'll respond on to it through text and then it will show up on the bottom of the screen where this Banner currently is it'll show your message and then it will show Dan's response or one of the uh or lonus or myself will do a text response or it will be selected as a discussion question for lonus and I
and Dan potentially to discuss live on the show dark 24 on float plane says I hate stuff I just want to buy words hey good news you're subscribed to float plane yeah you did it good job you succeeded you found you found the place where we will take your money to have to have colorful colorful your name and colorful words yeah oh and also you know behind the scenes and all that kind of cool stuff uh we do have some updates on the store so we finally finally brought back some of our Classic t-shirts Ram hard
drive processor and GPU are all back that's right my friends the processor shirt is so sick we even took photos and this is really funny uh Maria sent me this uh earlier today she was like dude I don't know how you did this is it exactly the same but your picture looks exactly the same oh okay this goes to the same one every time okay hold on  this this man has practice Yeah your your hands are in slightly different positions but they're very simar yeah she was like dude wow what the the the
head is like identical this is this is not like photosho these are not two are these are these are two completely different pictures taken like a couple minutes apart where I walked off I walked off the the photo set changed my shirt walked back stood there and absolutely nailed it that's awesome so yeah can oh get over Elijah's a breaking news lonus looks like lonus that's not the point Elijah Xavier exact same Xavier says the wrinkles are different my goodness in the shirt the
shirt people that didn't like the Apple ad the shirt wrinkles are different I know what they meant it wasn't the shirt wrinkles it was the real ones don't make me go get more procedures oh my goodness no I'm done um all right actual merch message time Dan hit us sure sure hey few notes there's a few notes uh these are printed on our old American Apparel blanks apparently oh what uh and the hard drive and RAM shirts are still being printed so shipping for those will be a little bit delayed limited
quantities available oh I see so we're just blowing away some leftover American Apparel shirt stock okay cool I mean the American appar shirts they were good enough for us to sell for many years good shirts I do like our new ones better but yeah but hey but they're good shirts classic designs let's go okay sorry go ahead hey lentil lungs and door I've noticed the last few these are getting really weird I've noticed that the last few handheld PC videos haven't mentioned the steam deck much is that
because it's not a good comparison because of price or performance what it isn't is an Apples to Apples comparison the steam deck is an incredible console but for the same reason that I wouldn't necessarily talk about the Nintendo switch in the same breath as every new handheld PC I also so am beginning to view the steam deck in a bit of a Different Light it excuse me is priced very aggressively which is amazing it offers a very conso like experience where instant wake instant
sleep um are are integral to the experience uh it's a it's a fantastic console um but much like a console its library is a little bit more limited and a lot of that's it's not valve's fault it's due to um you know whether it's the developer of the game or the developer of the antiche it's it's down to developers uh either refusal or or unwillingness to build Linux support into their games um I mean yeah I guess it's I guess it's mostly that uh but it's it's just a different product it's
an amazing product the OLED per verion oh man the screen on it is just incred but I also have a tendency to lean more toward lean on my own experiences when I'm evaluating products and the reality of it is that Rog Ally won I I don't daily drive a steam deck because for me the tradeoffs the the things that I give up for being on windows are not worth what I gain by being on a steam deck of course you know these are devices that you know one of each is sitting in the warehouse so I don't have to necessarily
consider the price I was just going to say if if yeah you're covering it now but the steam deck is significantly cheaper yeah the steam deck is an amazing piece of Hardware it's also not as performant as the latest handheld PCS and that's that's again that's part of the tradeoff when did it launch it's been a minute dude yeah it's been a few years at this point I think CU it was what 20120 2020 I know it when when it was announced we were doing wow remotely um it it it did not launch in 2022 did
it oh my goodness it's 2024 okay yeah oh wow okay so my problem there wasn't that I didn't realize how long ago the steam deck launched I didn't realize what year it was what is time it's current year oh anyway wow that's scary so um Noy asks do you feel proton OS has M matured enough to be competitive as an OS I don't know maybe it's ever actually released the bloody thing we'd be able to have a conversation about that sorry sorry you've just you've touched a bit of a nerve because
I've been putting off the Linux challenge V2 for the release of Steam OS and every time I ask those guys hey how's it going they're like we're on it and I'm like right but that's not what I asked I asked is it can it be on my computer not are you on it um and and it just keeps not appearing and I get it valve's a well I was going to say busy company but they've got some stuff going on no they got stuff going on making lots of money yeah and you know what I'm willing to bet that they have some wild skunk
work stuff probably who knows if they'll ever release it well not yeah I I suspect they're just too busy making tons of money I don't know anything and evaluating the absurd amount more money than they make than all the other companies I don't know anything about the internal workings of valve other than that they make disgusting amounts of money I've never worked there but what I suspect based on everything I've seen out of these guys is that they probably build more products than they
actually release I'm sure they'd be bored they're making all this money they might as well do something by a significant margin mhm I mean did you see the rig that they built for that steam deck OLED commercial where they built that sphere out of steam deck OLED screens no I don't think so yeah it's it's wild it's it is Peak because we can oh yeah for sure 100% they might as well spend all that money on something there was absolutely there was absolutely no reason no reason whatsoever for them to
do that practically like that they could have come up with any other concept for a commercial but they did that because somebody was like that'd be cool that'd be neat can we afford it easily just send it man I really wish those guys would hurry up and get a Flippin get a Flippin index to go here because there have been some advancements in lens technology and in screen technology that I'm sure valve has been doing stuff with they just won't they just won't give me my new they won't give me my new headset
really want it more please um so yeah yeah steam deck super cool it'll definitely be back in the conversation around steam deck 2 um we definitely will you know bring it up I mean the oh the Rog Ally x uh people are talking about that apparently there's a leak or something yeah I think I think that's that's a topic in here actually there OGX um I don't think it's like a huge jump though a little bit more battery life I think it's like a I mean to be fair they're naming it fairly properly
for this but I think it's like kind of like a pro model not a generational leap if that makes sense yeah should we should we jump into that and then we'll do the other merch message we can do that sure RG allyx Asus has teased the RG allyx which they claimed is somewhere between a sequel to the original Ally and a revision of It featuring a new black color the X will support larger battery life allegedly way more than way more way more than 30 to 40% more capacity I doubt it it's probably
something more like that it's probably like 30 to 40% capacity I think this is written as allegedly way more like 30 to 40% more capacity that's what I'm assuming anyways SVP what does that mean senior vice president cool sha Yen hinted at The Verge that the new handheld would give at least 3 hours of battery life playing intensive games however the device will be slightly heavier because of said larger battery aous says the Ally X should have more than the 16 gigs of RAM uh the Ally
non-x currently has and it will apparently be repairable with redesigned joystick modules that are more interchangeable so just the joysticks repairable that sounds pretty cool I mean that's something that's a good thing yeah yeah uh it will feature an m.2 2280 slot rather than the 2230 SD so if you want to throw like an 8 TB SSD because you enjoy having a an SSD that cost three times as much as your computer Asus still won't admit that the Allies SD card reader had any fault but the
Ally X will have a rearranged motherboard layout that will just happen to move the SD card slot away from the vents interesting however the screen will be exactly the same and so will the AMD Z1 or Z1 extreme um Apu the steam deck OLED this is not um so yeah that makes sense more battery life which is fair I understand it a steam deck OLED this is not is that what I said yeah I sure kind yeah anyway but yes so it will it will apparently not be getting an OLED screen okay coming on June 2nd yeah
um our discussion question here is what other upgrades would you have like to see uh I I can't comment on anything other than what's in here I mean I wouldn't have minded seeing more performance but I guess more battery life is also pretty good I would have like to see another USBC Port um there uh I'm honestly surprised they have a revision already on my trip to Japan I had this brilliant idea that on the plane uh my kids could play like multiplayer games with uh with this
portable um I I grabbed one of the one of the screens it's it happens to be an Asus like Rog portable monitor uh so I grabbed one of the ones out of my car and I brought it with me so that they could put it in the middle seat and sit three a breast and then play games together and I could run them off the Ally and I was like man that would be sick and so I brought a USBC cable and I plugged it between the Ally and the Monitor and went oh hold on a second it's not like this monitor supports
power delivery how on Earth am I going to charge this did I bring a micro HDMI to USBC adapt no then I still couldn't charge a so now you need like a dock yeah so yeah exactly exactly and I didn't I didn't think to bring a dock it's completely on me but the Difference Maker Difference Maker would have been if it just had two USBC ports like so many other handhelds do um so I would I would love to see that that's something that has affected me personally but other than that I I don't know I mean
I'd love to see H effect joysticks um uh I guess the repairability might help a little bit no no I'm just no I'm just I was asked what I would like to see I can only comment on what's written here cuz who knows what I Li might not know faster better stronger is cool it's a portable device you could you could hope basically everything would be better I'm just I'm surprised there's a revision already that's all because how long is the alies is quite a bit newer  um no the steam deck is huge no no no no
more recently released oh oh oh oh oh oh oh um so it yeah it was released June 13th 2023 so it's been less than a year and they're revising it already that's pretty fast on in the device realm well I mean that's the that's the IT industry cycle though and that's again something that makes the steam deck feel a lot more console like to me is it's very clearly on a more conso like refresh cycle I mean it's still the steam deck is still rdna 2 isn't it I think or rdna 2 excuse me Zen 2 I think
so yeah yeah yeah even though Zen 3 was coming and we're already on Zen 4 now like they could if they were just you know using a a random Apu off of amd's out of amd's product catalog then they could easily be revising it but it's clear that valve is serious about treating it like a console where they lock in the spec and they kind they they build performance targets for various games they build profiles and it's not just a PC where you're expected to just kind of Tinker around
with your graphics sliders you can because man valve is pretty chill about that kind of stuff like here yeah why don't you play around with your power profile and why don't you why don't you play around with all these settings but but they're they're obviously trying yeah they're trying to create a console like experience okay second mer Mage we technically jumping to a second merch message we're still on time uh let's see hey dll I was recently thrust into a manager position
after the sudden ousting of my boss we have a team of 50 people any tips for dealing with employ employees who make the same mistakes over and over fire them I'm I'm I'm actually I'm actually kidding because it's not that simple I mean people make mistakes I make mistakes like here what what are the what here what are the marriage uh like divorce statistics divorce rates close to 50% um here divorce rates USA um after a lot of that is repeat offenders as far as I know though the overall
trend in the okay yeah no we're not we're not going to be the point is that people make mistakes they make them over and over and over again it is a serious strain on the relationship um so apparently first marriages is around 40 to 50% and second marriages is around 60 to 67% yeah there you go so if your hope is to build a team of people that are not going to make mistakes over and over and over again and the reason that I'm bringing up marriages is that's probably the relationship in our lives that
is most committed um and I'm not talking like like a parent child relationship I'm talking voluntary relationships this is probably the relationship in our lives that is most committed at least on paper and it is one that we clearly um allow the day-to-day issues that we deal with trying to work as a team sorry I keep gesturing at Luke but maybe Ivon is somewhere over there um it's one where where we we clearly allow the day-to-day issues that we encounter when we're trying to work together as a team to
destroy and that rate of Destruction is something like well apparently you know 30 to 65% or something like that so with that in mind if you build a team that is three people odds are you're going to want to divorce one of them in some period of time yeah so you just have to find ways polyamorous people are just in shambles  now I don't know how you guys do it I mean look I I'm not I'm not I'm I'm I'm not judging uh you know like the the the the the the relationship style that you
know works for me might not work for you and what works for you today might not work for you tomorrow what works for me now might not work for me later you know this stuff you know this stuff is it's all it's it's fluid and you know it's all cool no judgment here there's a zero judgment Zone but sounds like a lot I have no idea how you do it I I just I man maintaining one relationship is like and and and to be clear that yvon's great like dude like I'm am extremely lucky
but man relationships take work like if  like things would be so incredibly well planned and organized though that's true but what if one of them planned it one way oh no and the other organized it another way and there was a conflict just got to step back just got to step back you got to retreat no there's no way no there's no way I I mean I don't want them both dead I mean yeah one of them might win but the other would be definitely you know in pieces too yeah like not they
wouldn't be alive for long you know what I mean it's yeah you don't Thunder Unstoppable Force IM movable object um what are we talking what we talking about right how to how to manage a team people make the same mistakes yeah evaluate the mistake see how bad it is if this is yeah if this is a super bad thing work on coaching it if you can't coach it and doesn't stop at a certain point he was not serious when he mentioned it but at a certain point you do have to let people go but there's a
lot of steps on the way I mean uh you can you can you know put together a performance Improvement plan lay out very clear guidelines clear communicate that's that's a big thing it has they have to know way ahead of time yeah that this if not fixed could result in a a firing or whatever else and and give them updates on how well they're doing check in with them on stuff see how if they're implementing things to fix it try to help them Implement things try to come up with ideas for them to implement
solutions to try to help them progress on this problem if they never do maybe this just isn't the right job for them and you good thing you didn't marry them yeah and you know what they might be awesome and they might be super successful in another role somewhere else totally but sometimes sometimes the healthier thing for both people in a relationship and you know what working together is uh a relationship it's not a relationship in the same sense that you know a marriage
is a relationship but it anything a friendship is a relationship being colleagues is a relationship they're at different levels obviously but sometimes a relationship is just not working yeah for both parties and the better thing is to have it not be a to not be in that relationship anymore yeah I don't know but just read some books try try to avoid it that's also very helpful I got lot stuff from reading books and but yeah just just make sure it's not a surprise that's my big thing um work with them try to
really heavily communicate uh don't don't just Blindside them um give them the chance to receive that feedback and improve and like any relationship don't let things build up and then explode at them because that's not helpful for anybody yeah on either side timely feedback is really really important and it can be hard because I'm sorry did you say you have 50 reports that's too many that's way too many that is like three to four times I'm hoping that they are one of the managers of 50 people four to
five times too many actually doing the math here like that is way too many people um so if that's the idea then good luck shf 2K says the idea of any company ever starting a pip in Earnest is laughable as a company that has definitely used Pips with success to rehabilitate uh relationships um you're wrong I think they are often misused oh 100% so so I'm sure may maybe Shariff has had one of the misuse against them before or know someone where that's happened or whatever a pip is a performance
Improvement plan uh which is essentially a extremely direct form of communication of hey this thing is not being done up to standard this is exactly what the standard should look like this is exactly where the shortfalls are and this is the timeline during which there needs to be an improvement yeah so it's just a super super documented and very direct form of that communication which theoretically in my opinion you should have softer forms of communication before getting
there um but it is absolutely a step along the chain and there's people that can get there and then come all the way back and and do well and just move on from it and there's people that will fail the PIP and then it is what it is but there are companies that use Pips to just fire people with documentation which is not how they should be used they should be used to try to solve a problem um so I think they're often misused which is why they have the bad rap that they have yeah no 100 100% they
deserve the bad rap but that doesn't mean that every company is monstrous and just uses them as a paper trail to fire people yeah yeah Elijah's had 12 Pips already that's what he says in chat at least he was at least he was on the ball enough to put a slash S on it this time we've had to have a lot of conversations recently about just like jokes that we kind of can't make anymore because people don't seem to understand that their jokes or at least a percentage of the viewer base doesn't
seem to understand when things are a joke um I actually forget what one from writer meeting was today but had to have just kind of a a downer conversation with everyone where it was like look that's a title that some time ago um I would have said yeah that's hilarious um now people are going to take it seriously and yeah I get talked to the most about jokes no actually you don't um yeah it was and it was like uh like it it was one of those jokes that was like I've made a huge mistake or posted yeah yeah
the title was we made a big mistake and unfortunately we're in an environment now where a significant number of people enough people that it that it seems to affect sentiment towards our company yeah will read that headline and go oh those guys made a mistake again yeah when it's just it's just a title calm the down it's just a title of a video you think that by the time we title the video like we didn't we didn't problem solve the steps like we didn't we didn't you know figure
figure some stuff out like we're it's it's it's a mechanism to to draw people into the video right and like um oh man plof plof committed a a sin today he didn't do anything wrong and uh you know it's it's the same thing where some period of time ago I'd have been like that's hilarious um let's uh let's do that as our intro but a significant number of people just whether it's sort of a lack of social awareness or whether it's um en problem yeah whether it's just a current environment problem where
what's real and what's a joke is just so blurry not really clear anymore Tru anymore um the intro that he had written was for we did um we did another AliExpress shopping spree video where five people were basically told okay it's a competition to buy the weirdest computer component on AliExpress that's fun yeah it is yeah it's totally fun and so he had this intro written for it that was um like something something something and their job is basically to waste my money wait what how much of my money did
you waste you know and plof loves that like he thinks that stuff's hilarious because I mean as the primary shareholder of lonus Media Group that effectively when he when he blows money on like a paint J for his car he's like yeah let's go like like that's his that's his sense of humor right and and Jake tends to be one of the ones that leans pretty hard into that as well cuz he he genuinely just thinks it's funny and then you get these people that are that are like yeah you can tell the way
lonus staff talks about money that he's like such a miser and like that there's a ton of pressure on them and they're like they're trying to read these like psychological cues on people's faces and you're just sitting here going like yeah cuz if that was the case we'd let that go through editing like like if we if we were that if there was that much corruption it just wouldn't show up on the camera and I would and I would and I would sign the I would sign the the the purchase approval yeah like you think
have some game sense but but but there's a significant there's a significant enough portion of the audience that we just like we can't uh like the the L is for narcissist thing yeah hilarious I don't think I don't think it would make it into the edit today but the the problem is that it like it did and then people took it super super  seriously like what do you think happen like once it once it once it gets ingested into the camera it just like must show up on YouTube and then what's
what's really funny what's really funny to me about it is that a a joke like that is allowed in the video and then people still are under the impression that I'm some kind of thin skinn yeah and I'm kind of sitting here going like when did it was funny cuz it was funny it was it was good it was good joke good good joke yeah when what when did humor become such a serious thing I I I had never even seen it and then it like came up some I was talking to Dan or something and it came up when I went
back and watched it and just it immediately got me hard I burst out laughing that was it was hilarious delivery on it was great it was hilarious very funny and then it just yeah people just take it like a billion miles and like the very best sort of um I'd say I appreciate a dry cutting joke and like the very best cutting jokes yeah there's a little bit of Truth in it sure I think to be a YouTuber I think to be a social media personality you don't necessarily have to be to a
disordered level but like anything you know self absorb abon is going to be on a spectrum and you have to obviously reach a point where you make a binary decision some degree of it's all about me to put your face on camera exactly you reach this decision point where you go I should talk about myself on the internet and other people should find it interesting I I can make a career out of this exactly people should people should be suppor of my efforts to talk about my damn self
on the internet right like there has to be a little bit of that there's also the self-awareness of that too but like I don't know I but I don't I don't I don't think people it's funny I don't think people necessarily necessarily see that I think I've talked about this on I think I've talked about this on the W show before where I will often joke about saying do you even know who I am because what's funny to me is that no they don't the vast majority of people do not I am not you're not specifically
into computers it's I am not Mr Beast yeah like I could walk into the average high school and if I happen to be walking past the computer lab when the bell rings I'm going to get a couple of those but that is that is not the level of Fame that I have and if I get a speeding ticket for example no I am not going to be getting out of my speeding ticket because people like my Tech tips that is actually not how this works that's the joke do you even know who I am no and we're both in on
it but but that seems to have become a narrative about me in certain circles and I'm just like all right sure wait what you can't get out of speeding ticket no believe it or not I have never successfully gotten out of a speeding ticket by being me and before you ask no I've never brought up that I am me it'd be really funny cuz it would not matter it be if I was in the pastor seat it would be hilarious like I'm just I'm I'm imagining this right now uh hi yeah hi officer uh I mean
Charle we can come to an understanding here like do what if I what if I put you in the C to the next video yeah do you do you do you know do you know this face do you do you know who I am no no okay but okay you got to text you got to text savy neph you got to text Savvy nephew call him up tell them who you got in the car right here and then tell me you're still going to me I me come on then again then again back to the whole what's real and what's not it's not like we don't see Tik toks and
YouTube videos day in day out of people actually behaving like that Stu yeah but that's so so I don't blame people no no really though it's not unbelievable they don't know me personally they don't observe me in my daily life this is fair I'm still allowed to be annoyed that we can't make jokes oh yeah me too both both sides are fair I think I think we can be annoyed that we can't make jokes and we can understand why sad I like I like I like playing the role of the of the kind of incompetent
ignoramus who is discovering something because at some point I didn't know and at some point it was really exciting to learn it and channeling that is one of the easiest ways for me to get amped up about something and and I've always loved and it's not so much of an act because at one point in time you were EXC exactly and I've always loved putting myself in a position to have something explained to me by my on camera uh you know co-host or or by another member of the tech subject
matter expert of some of the tech YouTube space or or or a subject matter expert I I have intentionally put myself in these positions time and time and time again even though a lot of theing time I wrote the godamn script or at least part of it yeah but people don't seem to understand that the actor is not necessarily exactly who they play on TV and you know what I do make mistakes sometimes and sometimes I make them by accident a lot of the time when I goof is something on camera yeah it's on
purpose I knew it was going to happen or I knew there was a very solid chance that it was going to happen and I thought it was funny or interesting but I do make mistakes and I think that this is one of those things where I I have a family member that often says stuff that is just astronomically stupid and one of the things that he does is he'll do it on purpose just often enough that when he says something really stupid he can say right but I was doing that thing I do where I say something really stupid
and so knowing someone like that I can see how people would would think it's that but no I'm just I'm just a little bit stupid fi troll argument yeah where people are like just uh where even is it uh where people are just actually and they're oh I was just I was just trolling yeah and then they'll like actually troll in like fun ways sometimes yeah then every once in a while they'll go like way too far but then just try to fall back on the excuse and it's like no you're you're just a
loser yeah you're just actually mean and people don't like you no one wants you to be around got him what are we even supposed to be talking about right now I was just going  uh okay let's do a topic switch to what do you guys want to hear about yeah let's I mean is announcing that you're going to have an announcement but you're not going to announce what you're announcing is that even newsworthy fine supplier leaks so okay Nintendo announced that it will be announcing the
successor to the switch so we need to discuss what we think it might be called uh within this fiscal year which means by the end of March 2025 oh fiscal year yeah okay Nintendo has also said that their June Nintendo Direct will focus on titles for their current console set oh set to come out on the second half of the Year paper launch question mark the company president recently told investors that it's not including switch to sales and its forecast for the same period implying the console will launch
sometime after the end of March a recent massive spec leak based on shipping manifests which is usually a pretty solid pretty solid one indicator of what it will actually be uh indicated that the console features 12 gigs of LP ddr5x memory that's pretty aggressive on the memory side yeah 256 gigs of ufs 3.1 storage and an 8 in display the switch OLED for example is 7 in and an Nvidia Tegra 239 same one spotted in many La past switch two leaks which is the slightly sad part for me because some of these
leaks for this processor are old yeah it's Amper based is uh is my understanding of it but Amper is okay Amper and and my understanding again is that it's not pure Ure so I think some of the stuff is newer like it might have newer newer AI stuff so so the upscaling on this thing might be awesome and when you consider in Nintendo's typical uh visual style upscaling should work really well I like skipped 3000 Series do they have dlss specifically yeah yeah 2000 series cuz that's that's like the future of all
the things 000 series was when they introduced all the AI stuff and R tracing stuff got more refined with "3,000 and then 3000 Series was when it" got usable yeah um so you wanted to talk about naming for this yeah why because Nintendo's pulled some weird stuff out in the past oh I see so is it going to be like Wii U or or there's been some like Nest to Super Nest DS stuff where they had like they literally called one of them new yeah that was that was weird dude like they they've really pulled
some stuff out so like is this the new Switch yeah that's funny we make fun of Microsoft a lot for names way worse well I don't know about worse but they're definitely equally bad can we agree they're equally bad yes okay yeah we agree they're equally bad I just the reason why I said way worse is I had flashbacks to n of the Wii U launch like some of it's kind of made sense like the Game Boy Advance is definitely better than a Game Boy and it's like kind of game boy like Game Boy SP was weird yeah
DS Light made sense sort of yeah wasn't it actually like a performance jump as well um I don't remember but it was lighter but it was lit te yeah yeah you know light I wasn't a huge fan of that one cuz I thought it was like actually a 3DS made sense it 3DS was pretty good DS but 3D 3DS was pretty good um too switch Too Furious says nil pointer we could yeah we could just let chat help us out here uh switch Pro would be interesting switch Advance I'd be down for switch
Advance I'd be I would also be down with switch Advance it's a switch but it's with more switch than ever before I'd be I'd be into that switch up I mean you know with the whole like you switch up I'm pretty sure I've seen people say switch up before switch to Electric Baloo I mean these are really good  mean okay I think float plane chat is going to lose their Lo their chatting privileges pretty quick who do you think you are twitch chat some people have been saying super switch Uber switch 
hitter switch HD I mean no no well yeah no nobody would use HD branding today anymore yeah HD branding was like I don't 15 years ago yeah yeah and people are saying switch 4K there's I don't I don't think this is going to be hm it could be a 4K console if doubt well hold on if Nintendo as rumored has backwards compatibility with switch games I see no reason why an ampere based GPU with upscaling couldn't run something like tears of the Kingdom at 4K but with the added expense of a 4K
screen no it won't have a 4K screen oh but it'll be able to do 4K 4K it and go to a TV and there is absolutely no reason it shouldn't support HDMI that be fair enough yeah exactly so I I thought you meant on device 4K no I don't think that makes any absolutely no way they would do that I think it's going to be 1080p on device yeah even that maybe not switch on oh I hope not that would be awful switch up I'm okay with what was the other one that we both liked switch Advance switch Advance is
there's no way to do that Nintendo almost to a fault doesn't look back yeah like they rarely uh like there's there like there is no way they'd be like super switch one thing that's interesting to me is it's almost certainly going to look almost exactly the same as the switch it'll be slightly bigger but it's probably going to be more or less the same thing man if it's more or less the same size but it has an 8 in screen in it that thing's going to be sick I've heard I've heard rumor that the the the
controller is going to be magnetic that' be kind of cool it's interesting but it I this is interesting to me because the jump from the GameCube to the Wii U was like or sorry the wiii was super interesting and then the Wii to the Wii U was more of an interesting jump than people really realized with the like whole fifth controller and controller with the screen all that kind of stuff and then the Wii U to the switch was like crazy yeah and then if this is just like that thing again but with a bigger
screen that's like the first time they've will people be really disappointed really done that remember to though hold on because the switch took a unique approach to motion controls that maybe the kinds of games that you play don't take advantage of but there's no way that you could have done what what were those cardboard things called where you'd like put the motion controllers on and stuff like there's no way that they would have been able to build a gaming experience like
that other than me did anyone care about that I mean I think they sold some okay um gold ball says they should just get rid of the switch name Al together it is awful to search anything about the switch on the internet and that is a really good point lab the searchability of names is a big problem in inert current year I need to run I'll be right back okay I just looked up the video I did on the Nintendo labo um and this was a lot more recent than I thought it just says 5 years ago but YouTube's weird
with dates sometimes yeah this was 2018 look I just got a message in um hey D why does Nintendo consistently keep bringing consoles out but they're almost outdated or many gens behind the current gen they haven't been Hardware pushers in a really long time when is the last console they released that was actually like Hardware competitive it's never really been about hardware for them has it no I think it was a very long time ago well 64 yeah game was GameCube Hardware competitive I don't think so I think
that was pretty underpowered honestly I thought it was I don't really remember  yeah he was pretty strong what directly competed against GameCube was it an Xbox original I think it was Xbox and and PS2 if I remember correctly GameCube release PS1 yeah it was PS2 and Xbox 2001 Xbox original release date 2001 so they're both the same  do you think it'll do the same doc thing maybe they'll go to like uh saying GameCube was impressive because of how small it was like that's not is that
cool it's not the point I'm trying to make um but it's at the very least from the Wii forward it's not it has not been about performance and I know that's only a few console Generations but uh it's been a long time the Wii release date was 2006 seriously there might be people people watching this right now that  depressing risk of TMI I got my diagnosis back it's just a UTI but I definitely have to go pee very suddenly sometimes that's okay on my antibiotics and I'm feeling a fair bit better at
least you're good to go yeah there was there was blood involved so uh never a good sign yeah this was like last week right before W show started so I was a little stressed during the show this is like kind of the best sign of all the bad signs oh yeah no I mean the second you start searching for stuff like that it's like yeah you're GNA die you're done yeah oh jeez yeah so that's cool uh but yeah I don't think they care about performance I think for them it's all it's been all
about experience ever since especially the Wii um and even before then in 64 they cared about performance yeah that's what what what we were trying to debate on was did they what what was the argument on GameCube how was the GameCube performance- wise vers versus PS2 and original Xbox um I thought it was pretty solid I the the looking up that I did was that it was fairly well competing yeah and gained credit because of how small it was yeah which is cool too bad the discs were too
small to put big games on it yeah so maybe they should have made it bigger and put a proper size disc reader in it and then after the GameCube they just like actually stopped caring at all about performance and it was much more about experience and just the game that were on the system and and margin W gardening their and margins on the hardware yeah well while a lot of other consoles were losing money per I wonder if what they realized was that they were selling so many copies of games that
looked like sh for their for their mobile consoles so like realistically is anyone is any is anyone caring about this I think also a lot of a lot of like especially first-party Nintendo games the art style doesn't demand crazy performance um and a lot of times the ones that struggle in performance it's like yeah they probably could have done better um so I don't know does your PC have a handle dude my brother had this if you don't know what case this is let me see if I can find it uh you're
not look for that do our sponsor spots oh I already found it all righty then oh you have a video on it nice let's go my favorite thing about my laptop it has the one your brother has is probably this one it might actually be I'm not sure I don't remember how he got it this is old enough this is old enough that I probably just wanted to get this thing out of our way and what like I'm going to flip it on Craigslist you scared your C like this uh this case would have taken up so much space it would have
been more work to sell on Craigslist then it's probably worth um cuz like the price is so high but people don't cases are are one of the fastest depreciating computer components you can buy like a used case is basically worth half of what it was worth new it was either this one or he like won it I don't think he bought one of these but at at the top there this case was enormous and it weighed a ton especially once you filled it with stuff especially once you filled it with water
cooling absolute clown case and the top here has these metal bars they're actually metal so he had this case and he got a welder friend to weld a crossbar onto those metal bars so that he could just pick it up with one hand cuz he's just this unit that could do that um and he'd bring it to lands this is just enormous computer that would  everything so good I don't know how we got onto the topic of uh cases but we did so basically it's a giant GameCube is that the point you were
trying to make oh right cuz people said you don't have handles on your computers and I was like well sometimes we W them on but did people say we don't have a sponsor cuz they were wrong the show is brought to you today by ag1 if you're already busy juggling your everyday tasks you definitely don't have time to juggle the bottoms of vitamins that you bought but never take why not make your life a bit simpler with ag1 allinone supplement it has 75 different vitamins to fulfill your daily nutritional needs

hurdle into getting into fitness mine was being an overweight smoker have since quit all stimulants # represent Hartford Whalers nice oh hey there we go um Harford Whalers there's a we have a special thing here because Sean from the IT team that's where he got his old screen name from Whalers because of Hartford Whalers because of whatever whatever anyways I thought it was because he murdered Wales nope I'm kidding fortunately no I'm kidding there's an old Canadian old Canadian
hockey team called the Hartford Whalers that's the context for you not all them are necessar going to get the joke which is why I clarified um uh what sorry what was it what was the hardest part yeah what was your biggest hurdle getting into fitness my biggest hurdle uh by Fitness I'm going to take that as like the more recent going to the gym stuff CU I wouldn't call the more recent stuff me getting into fitness CU when I was younger I was significantly more fit because I played
like a billion different sports all at the same time and I was extremely fit um but these days my biggest hurdle was that I was broken in a lot of ways largely from all the sports that I used to play when I was younger so I had rotator cuff problems should have done that he just problems I was I was on a cane for a few weeks years back because I screwed my knee up so bad so that's a recurring still existent problem that I have and I have lower back issues and all this other type of stuff so I had to
and I had gained a ton of weight over covid so those issues were worse because of the weight gain so I had to drop weight and figure out how to deal with those issues which wasn't the most motivating in the world at first but once you start seeing progress in the weight loss and you start seeing progress in the inj the biggest thing for me was progress in the injuries because I had it for a while like I'm going to do this right now I'm going to reach back and grab Linus's chair and
move him around a little bit if I did that a year ago I would have shoulder pain for three days you want to you know you want to you want to grab something because my my rotator uh cuff was so screwed up but as I learned how to do exercises that would help strengthen the rotator cuff and without hurting it which would then make it less prone to injury which would then make it so that I could like reach behind myself and do whatever and not hurt myself like I can do this now at all which is huge
um hartford's in Connecticut I had no idea they moved when I was still a kid and I didn't know geography that much I thought the Hartford Whalers were a Canadian team I have no idea I had no clue at all yeah they uh they moved in 1997 when I was 11 so I uh I did not know geography yet that is hilarious today I learned anyway sorry carry on no it's fine um but yeah I started I started noticing like hey I'm not in pain as much anymore that was a huge thing for me by working out more
often when I woke up my back wouldn't hurt anymore because I'd strengthened my back uh now I wouldn't sleep on my shoulder funny and hurt it or reach behind myself and grab like a piece of paper and then injure myself those I'm more resilient that way I'm I'm not hurt all the time I'm not as tired anymore I just started feeling better and less pain all the time and then now it's just I don't want to stop because those things are very good so I don't know those were the hurdles but those are
also the reasons to do it so good luck I believe in you sorry I was reminded that the Canucks are playing right now Oilers yeah how we doing uh 1 end of the first I'm suddenly more invested in this than normal cuz you just like The Comeback F kids no a buddy of mine is like a super fan of the Oilers so I just want him to lose why do you why do you hate I heard we won the first game and I was like yes oh yeah in an embarrassing fashion we don't have to we don't have to win the
whole thing we don't have to win the cup we just got to beat the oil Elijah says I can't wait for the Canucks to lose in the finals and we have riots again three times the Vancouver kcks have never won a championship three times they have made it to the finals not just made it to the finals they have made it to game seven which is which is the final game of a best of seven series they have made it to game seven of the finals three times they have managed to choke in game seven of the finals but
never never a championship so I'm uh yeah I'm excited for it too Elijah going to be exciting it'll be a lot of fun during a panel on a AI in the legal field it was stated that using AI May soon be required for attorneys for competency do you see professions soon requiring AI use rather than doing things manually well it's not a matter of that I think anyone is going to like I don't think a client is going to come to your law firm and say I need you to use AI or I am not going to work with you like I
don't think it's going to be like that I think it's going to be more along the lines of if you want to stay competitive then you are going to have to take advantage of the efficiencies that machine learning in its various forms to be clear I'm I'm not necessarily saying um you know AI in the way that I think we're thinking about it right now and that a lot of the stigma is around right now where you know you basically just punch in a prompt and then it just like shs out a
response uh there's lots and lots of different ways that you can use machine learning so one way would be if you're looking for precedent which is incredibly important uh when it comes to advising your clients on their their best possible defense if you are not searching using an an AI machine learning assisted model the entire just astronomically huge library of of precedent setting like case law um if you are if you aren't doing that you're not going to be competitive you're not
going to win your cases no human could possibly hope to have read and internalized everything that they would need for every different situation lawyers lose cases all the time they literally lose as many cases as they win think about it right for every win somebody has to lose so if you are not using the most state-of-the-art tools your win rate is is going to go down compared to people who are using the most the art tools un unless they're poorly SL improperly using it which will
happen but which will happen I suspect more often than not especially in competitive Industries it will be used properly but I think the example that I'm using where you're using it to to to look for to look for a pre legal precedent I'd say that's a pretty that's a pretty likely use case where it would be very very useful and less prone to hallucinate and it would be better than just a search like a like a term search if you have a large language model that has been trained on an enormous data set and
you go okay tell me about any situation where a crime of passion was involved but uh there were these extenuating extenuating circumstances right like that's not something that a typical search is necessarily going to be able to handle without spitting you out an enormous number of results that you would have to you have to read through all of them right yeah um and I mean I would say I'm not going to name any names but with all the lawyers that we've worked with over the years yeah some of them probably
probably should have just used AI for some of the work they did I have ran into examples where way after the fact I realized where they lifted the copy that they sent us from because I noticed certain verbage and I was like I actually literally recognize this and then I go to the the wherever that legal copy is and see the line and I'm like there's no way there's actually no way this has to be lifted from here and then I'll look at like the formatting of the document and everything and I'm like
yeah they just clearly like make it so it doesn't look like you copied my work and they just copied it it's like what did I pay you for I could have done this like especially when when you're like oh well at least it's like signed off by a lawyer so if something goes wrong we can go to them no oh yeah man that's all garbage it's funny how you know lawyers you know being lawyers um are pretty they're all pretty knowledgeable when it comes to covering their own asses um and making sure that I
mean I'm I'm just giving advice I'm just G I'm just giving advice I mean you could do whatever you want to do I mean if this goes wrong I well what is the point of you then what is your point why why do you actually exist like if you're if you're not if there's no if there nothing bad happens if you get it wrong what exactly is your incentive why I need to use you yeah I am not a huge fan no I think that good lawyers absolutely like any good professional um are important deeply but
there seem to be a lot of less good a lot of junk less good lawyers that are that are more motivated by just creating litigation so that they can bill ours um but any I'm trying to get a water block for my 6900 XT and I'm Dan why didn't you just ask yeah I bet we could have helped you out with that I mean we probably got some EK stuff we can't  name I bought one recently and crossed all the EK stuff and wrote Alpha cool yeah cuz that's how that works  cool oh my goodness so poor Frasier here
is trying to find a compatible one uh is compatibility something that we should  website I mean yeah but only to a degree right because realistically for something like a water block we're not going to test that we're not going to be able to test every there's going to be a lot of things that we'll actually sort of work on especially with a very minor amount of modification or addition if you like add little heat sinks to cover the spots that it's not covering and whatnot which is something
that people have been doing in water cooling for ever um like we yeah what are we supposed to say if you add a few heat sink pads this is fine like and back to the question of liability right like do I want to be in a situation where I say it worked and then the manufacturer of the GPU does a silent revision that we don't know about and it doesn't doesn't work and like like well LT Labs told me it would work and it's kind of sitting here going like why am I even opening opening myself up to this um I think
that's that's something where we're not really going to get into it like we might have we you know if if we were to ever have like a compatibility Checker of some kind I think we would probably want to find a way to grab data off of the manufacturer website but I don't think that's the kind of thing that we would go through and want to validate like we're not going to we're not going to take a motherboard put every CPU on the CPU support list in it and then maybe other CPUs just to see if they
work like it's not so like literal three people that would care yeah it's not within the scope of of what labs would  yeah they could they just shouldn't one of the problems sorry no no go for it's one of the problems with having a a thing like that is like you could you could the lab could test like practically anything it's like do we do we is that a good use of their time they have so many other really high value things to do and they are currently doing that like adding certain things like that is like
GH I don't know sorry keep going no that's okay we'll get one more in here I think howy lldd I'm back in graduate school after 20 years in a job where priorities were obvious how do you prioritize when the tasks are numerous and deadlines are  school so you're asking didn't you you said you dropped out right well it's a little um you were failing and you just made the conclusion early yeah I mean it it was kind of a you can't fire me I quit um I was on academic probation
already ah and if I hadn't fixed up my grades I would have been kicked out the next semester but I decided that wasn't going to happen why am I paying anymore for this I'll see you later true I kind of just stopped going to class I never actually formally withdrew which probably looks bad if I ever want to go back probably yeah but that would be weird and useless uh so you're talking to him who has that story and then me who dropped out um yeah I don't know task priority is
this specifically for school we're talking no he didn't he say he just got a job yeah no no no was in a job for 20 years and now is in school now was in school with no one to basically go okay here's what you're working on right now do this thing if the way I used to do it was if it's within a certain class um I mean just study everything hard but then if you're if you're like if you if you know rationally looking at the work in front of you that you don't have enough time to study everything
there's a test coming up if it's when one within one specific class I wouldn't pick the thing that you know the least to try to study I would make sure that you can secure a passing grade so like make sure you're confident in at least a passing grade worth of material and then work from there so that you know you can pass the class and keep moving forward so make sure you have a solid base before you go in and then when you get to the actual test find the questions that you know you can
confidently answer and blow through all of those like skipping through parts of the test make sure that you like secure your Sol grade that you know you can get and then go back through and try to refine from there that's what I did I have no idea I wouldn't necessarily listen to me that's just what I did Tomo comoo says I was on academic probation at one point this is in flow plan chat now I am a college professor and a scientist I work on gravitational wave physics sick and I'm smart enough to
subscribe to float plane I added that last bit but but but but they are subscribed they are subscribed to FL plane um that's good I don't think my path would go similarly I don't think I will ever be working on gravitational wave physics I think Luke's seen me try to do math you can do good mental math oh yeah yeah I can do simple math Mental Math you're good at I'm good at approximate yeah don't ask me to do anything exact that's almost all you need though you know when I learned that my first year of
University summer when I started oh yeah estimating painting jobs yeah I I just like like wasn't good at mental math and it's a good skill to have and my regional manager was like well get good because it's realistically the only way that you're going to be able to do this so how' you get good just practice well I had no choice because if I wanted to make money then I had to get good and I needed to make money because I had a bunch of um I had a bunch of bills to pay for school so you got good by sheer
will I I guess fine enough I mean I think in modern day though 10% luck 20% SK sorry U I think in modern day if you have good estimation skills good mental math skills the rest of it can be 15% concentrated power of will supplemented through like 5% pleasure phone calculators and if it's complicated enough pain you can use wol from Alpha  name that was all accurate wasn't it you remembered every lyric why wouldn't I W doesn't everybody know that amazing no not off the top of my head I was able to
recognize that it was correct but I wouldn't be able like even now I don't think I could say it all purposely oh man is that a song LMO Elijah causes me pain so often I know he's painful uh wen't we doing merch messages no we're doing topics okay yeah we're doing topics what topic are we doing I don't know who cares uh stack Overflow users rebel against the site's open AI deal this is hilarious this week week stack Overflow announced that they would be adding an open aai integration feeding
past user contributions to chat GPT as well as using that information to train AI without consulting their user base many users responded by deleting or adding protest messages to their past posts stack Overflow staff have reportedly responded by suspending those users on mass then reverting those protest posts to their previous state oh oh dang wow stack Overflow seemed to have a negative attitude toward generative AI previously Banning answers written by chat GPT just last
year oh I mean they probably still have that stance because we know the whole thing where when AI feeds off of its own data it gets worse so they don't they don't want generative AI answers on their site they just want to sell their site to AI that that makes complete sense to me you should also just consider stopping using it I'm sure there's alternative but dang that sucks what are the Alternatives no no no really do you guys know stock overflow has been like the thing for a super long time but this is
how this is how you spark competition you know so I'm sure somebody will figure it out man uh heroy  um I'm sure someone will figure it out yeah Reddit but that sucks too and they're definitely doing the same thing they're doing the exact same thing bruh I wonder what you do because because we know on-site ads are making effectively nothing these days like MoneyWise yep and this type of crowd is just going to be blocking them anyways we've got a really interesting video coming on deifying your life uh
Emily was working on it and it's pretty cool but it's surprising how many of the alternatives are going to cost you a monthly subscription yep like like there's search engines that you can use that don't track your stuff and they just cost money but are super cool and you can like determine your own page Rank and stuff and like set your own priorities and have no ads in them and I've been thinking about going to a paid uh search for we should watch the video Yeah Emily put a lot of work into
researching it we covered actually pretty cool I'm excited we covered browser we covered search um browser too yeah we talked about DNS uh we talked about oh man what we're trying to think of what all of the degify we talked about email so we because you can you can rage about being the product all you want but if you're getting the thing for  there there there's going to be some value harvested somewhere yeah you don't have a leg to stand on and one one problem the tradeoff one problem is that
you don't completely avoid it by paying for things that's one of the big steps why I haven't done this yet is like okay sure I'm paying for this service and you're claiming these things but what happens from you changing that what happens this company from being sold to somebody else and now they own it like what if Google buys this random browser company and now they have all their data these are hopefully things that I can get some amount of information from the video so we'll we'll see um but like
yeah there's there's it's it's interesting but it does get kind of expensive to replace all the free things with things that cost money and these are ongoing services so it's almost certainly going to be monthly subscriptions yep one% and like in theory you know well you could self-host and we talk a little bit about a Google photos alternative that you can self host which is super cool even that has cost though but there's a lot of things that even if they don't have a cost
don't make sense to self poost like uh email is one that we brought up as as something that you yeah look at look at the look on his face the physical pain as someone who runs services like please the amount of times and I I I've tweeted about this a bunch of times back when it was actually Twitter but the amount of times that I have developer applications especially when it comes to infrastructure stuff and they apply and they use a custom email and I go to respond to give people interviews and
the custom emails just get tossed because deliverability issues whatever else it happens way more than you would think and from people that think they know what they're doing yes the amount of times that people will include a personal s this one sucks because I recommend that people do it seriously though check if it works before you send in your resume please the amount of people that include a personal site on the resume that doesn't work like bro or like the domain expired I've
ran into that like it it would be better for you to not include it on your resume if the domain has expired then to include it and have someone click a dead link on your resume it just looks like you didn't care but people people have gen a non- insignificant amount at least over like we're talking double maybe triple digits of people have lost interviews here because their custom domain email server thing didn't work or  brutal Intel crazy rebukes motherboard makers over fixes for Intel's unstable
CPUs we've also got some AOL Lake leaks and AMD stealing CPU market share I just didn't say steel they earned it but anyway that's my headline here after Intel didn't publicly take action concerning recent widespread reports of 14th gen processors causing game crashes and blue screens of death on around April 20th a SE released a bios update with an Intel Baseline profile which turned down various performance boosting settings this week Intel spoke up to tell users not to use such profiles from
motherboard makers instead Intel wants you to use the Intel default settings profile instead as it involves a combination of thermal and power delivery features with a selection of possible power delivery profiles based on the specific motherboard's capabilities broadly the motherboard maker profiles did seem to help with the stability issues but it came at a performance cost Intel's guidance seems to be geared towards allowing users to regain some of that lost performance Intel is now
demanding that by May 31st motherboard makers release bios updates with Intel's default settings profile as the default I can't believe this has taken this long to come to a head but aren't they also saying that doesn't fix it because the the performance uh what is it multi-core enhancement uh default thing controversy or like conflict between Intel and motherboard manufacturers has been going back for like the better part of a decade at this point and it was it was bound to happen
at some point that some kind of performance boosting profile of some sort was going to cause instability because it it all it has always been overclocking to run anything but Intel's default behavior for the CPU and I just I can't believe that it took this long it took it took Intel ending up with egg on their face over the instability of the not Intel default profile for them to finally say look you actually can't do this anymore and I'm willing to bet that this lasts one
generation and then immediately in order for motherb manufacturers to try to differentiate their product from each other they're going to go back to putting whatever the most aggressive profile they can probably get away with on the majority of CPUs is and we're going to be back to this whole song and dance until this happens again like there's just absolutely oh yeah no way that it's not going to just keep happening oh yeah and to be clear I don't even really I don't even really blame the
motherboard manufacturers here obviously they're going to they're going to push the limits of whatever Intel will allow them to do and they're going to try and differentiate their product I I lean toward blaming Intel that's the game they play yeah if they want to be competitive they have to do that yeah they're not studying the rules I mean look like what it is if if man if intel wanted motherboard manufacturers to differentiate their products they they didn't have to consolidate every single
function onto the onto the CPU and onto the chipset they might have they might have not tried to take all the margin for themselves in the motherboard I mean that was an option to be clear there were performance advantages to some of those moves like moving the memory controller onto the CPU to simplify the motherboard and make it more performant but it's just it's been a it's been a trend from Intel for a very long time to squeeze motherboard manufacturers and it's become harder and harder for them
to differentiate and so they're going to do what they got to do they they got to do what they got to do and if intel doesn't like it well then they're going to have to lay down the law and if they haven't laid down the law then this is going to happen this is around and find out it's that simple um one can only hope that Intel's upcoming AOL Lake desktop CPUs won't suffer the same issues on top of having no hyperthreading and allegedly terrible names uh this is this is pretty funny
yeah here we go um NextGen desktop CPUs have reportedly leaked aerol Lake core Ultra 200 series uh same core count says Raptor Lake refresh but fewer threads okay hold on where's my where's my branding here we go uhuh   the why not just I mean why Ultra why not just an can we just have I don't know like a nine can we just have some continuity here why do we go from 9 to 8 from 0 0 to 5 14 to2 I understand because this is this is the the generation processor generation but why did we move everything
down one or maybe two so a 600 class product becomes a four class product or I don't I can't even begin to follow along with this uh AMD had a new naming scheme allegedly new naming scheme allegedly maybe leak on asus's site that looked just as bad as intels if not worse cuz they shoehorned AI into all the processor names so it was like ryzen 9 Ai and then they switched to a uh they switched to a threel or a three-digit numbering scheme as well and it just it was utterly un just un indecipherable I
I I couldn't even uh that has not been confirmed to be real we should do we should do product naming consultation I'd be happy to they wouldn't want they no they wouldn't want our advice though you just you just call it CPU we'd be no I wouldn't we' be that would be all so stupid yes we'd be advising them on how to make it this is CPU one we also sell CPU 2 and three sorry keep going sty CPU okay our naming is bad too for very different reasons okay may maybe don't do naming consultation I think we could
do better than them I think anybody could yeah In fairness to me I wasn't involved just way too literal we are pretty literal backpack I mean we're not wrong it's a backpack screw screwdriver it is a screwdriver it doesn't even call itself ratcheting screwdriver just screwdriver it's a screwdriver it's it's you know what you're getting you do yeah it's better yeah sorry I just don't know how much it leans on marketing I mean look we've had some more fun stuff lately okay there's the FaZe zip up Hoodie faas
I like faas okay um okay that's that's pretty literal um okay we've got 100% cotton t-shirt the Steve turtleneck okay this is actually a pretty solid mover that's fairly marketing yeah good on okay Marino t-shirt okay stop stop looking at those names LED um fan wag hoodie is pretty good I named that one that one's good that is good I named that one the uncle lius hoodie okay but that was that was from a video I don't know if that's fair was literally actually a joke um this is not going to be better hm
I didn't mean to start this lounge pants are all right I added Pro to this I think no no I added premium to this one that that was my contribution to the name of that okay these are so are the premium Sports joggers better than the track joggers cuz the track joggers aren't premium the Dropout has a really cool name doesn't sell at all but people  people the Dropout sweater is like one of the comfiest sweaters I think I've ever had and people don't know that yeah cuz they can't try it I know retail
retail is a is a heck of a thing like buying clothes at retail I get it yeah it's tough to buy them online cuz you're feel the same way you're buying it blindly I get it I just I wish people had the opportunity to try it because it's very much like a comfy like nice a little bit more Hefty sweater it's nice it's good I enjoy it and I don't like pullovers but I like that sweater AMD has hit a record high in x86 desktop and server market share which is good because apparently their GPU gaming
business and custom not cooking business is not going so good but this man this looks incredible in servers their revenue share is 33% and that's on a unit share of only 23.6 so that means that they are killing Intel at the highend for service like crushing them that's crazy not even close right yeah I I where is where where is this topic oh I'm sorry I'm just uh oh you're just looking at stuff yeah I'm looking at this right here look at it go woo wow number Gober yeah I think's a little less hot
on the desktop side I feel I love how them D oh but this is server market share so it's not just AMD and Intel yeah no this is actually 86 oh I see so I love how them killing it is still being a third of the market well yeah but I mean you got to compared to some historical record that is crazy and you got to remember too like only part of the decision of which CPU to procure is which one is better a huge part of it is long-term contracts a huge huge part of it is production capacity like as an as
an end user user okay you would look at the marketing for someone like a a mouse pad Factory in China which that they have marketing you'd look at the marketing and go well that's stupid because it'll be full of things like what their production capacity is on a monthly basis and you're sitting there going yeah but are they good do do you make anything good depending on the buyer that may not be their top priority because they just need mouse pads and if and the and the factory that they're
working with May simply not have enough capacity of mouse pads and so at a certain point like AMD can only buy so much of tsmc's finite capacity and at a certain point supply and demand if everyone tries to buy it it will drive up the price to the point where oh well hey Intel's products not looking that bad anymore Intel meanwhile has their own production capacity so they effectively get to sell every chip that AMD can't make and it will be that way for the foreseeable future um that is until AMD
can get more production capacity from Intel's Foundry business that'll be an interesting day we'll see how that goes ever since I talked about how I I like Intel's long-term plan their stock has dropped considerably I still like their long-term plan but I made it very clear at that time this is investment advice I made it very clear at that time that it was a long-term that I liked long-term play fox in a box says oh yeah so forget contracts and availability what about
just Comfort people buy based on Brands all the time that was an lmg clip that went up actually shortly before the W show today from last week where I talked about not being fans but man people people buy what they're comfortable with and you're fans at different levels and fox in a box says at my company we buy more Intel servers because we have Intel servers and don't have issues so we will buy more of them which honestly in a lot of situations is a mostly good enough reason when it comes
to technology and how fast moving it is maybe less so but when you're dealing with like trying to convince people that are doing purchasing decisions for a huge range of things and that that just happens to be one part of it yeah I don't know anyways should we talk about uh hell divers and Sony yeah sure this is wild so this is not a a flesh out topic that we have so this is going to be a little bit erratic but uh cuz I think it happened like today this is this is pretty hot news yeah I don't I don't
know exactly PR but it's it's quite fresh I know it was Friday somewhere but it might have been somewhere else in the world um but Sony so let's rewind to last week Sony forced PlayStation Network login onto hell divers 2 now PC Gamers PC gamers are pretty kind kind of used to needing other launchers or needing other login even the Beloved balers Gate 3 uses its own launcher they have a really cool reason even CD project red has their own like account it's optional you can just continue to
play Rockstar Ubisoft e everyone in their dog has their own nonsense beloved developer battle State games has their own launcher and they're not even on Steam I probably could have gotten them on a spit take if only he was drinking something yeah yeah the the laran one most people embraced it a little bit more heavily because it syncs your saves between platforms which is like actually kind of sick if you had a save on a console you could sync it to a PC anyways um so some people were somewhat
surprised at the degree or the amount of backlash that they received for forcing this login one major component was because they forced the login after people had already purchased the game this is also not the first time that has happened yeah but but the really big kicker was that by forcing PSN they were suddenly not allowing people in certain regions of the world to pay this uh to play this game that they had bought and been playing for a significant period of time that's
because the PlayStation network was simply not available in that region so they were allowed to buy the game but they weren't allowed to create an account that is a prerequisite to play the game and what's worse fraud ently declaring that you live in a different country other than where you live by use of a VPN or something can get your PSN Network banned and then we're back to square one and you can't play the game yeah so Gamers raised hell it was great this doesn't happen that often um in well
okay it happens literally all the time yeah but it's not often that they actually get something done I think part of it and I've been meaning to talk to you about this but this is my theory I think the biggest part of it was that the boycott was forced yeah by the controversy itself I think and I've talked about this a fair bit with the recent battle State Games controversy smart we've talked about this a fair bit recently where gamers are spineless and they will raise hell
about something and then immediately cave and start playing the game and buying micro transactions again I have news about that and these companies never learn anything but in this case because the source of the controversy inherently forced angry Gamers to stop playing the game it affected player numbers in a way that is very large and very measurable because this is like the hottest game in the world right now to the point where they went oh no we can't do this people are not playing the game
and what we learned is probably nothing but what we should have learned is that that's how effective a boycott can be an actual one an actual one where Gamers actually stop playing the game and and rage hard so there there's more to it some regions also require you to have a PS4 or PS5 to even have a Playstation network account so some regions couldn't do it some regions had to have specific Hardware Etc it was a nightmare um there was a huge rage the the arrowhead the actual developer behind the game like
more or less agreed with the community and was like this is dumb um and was was kind of fighting against it as well so it was it was a very unified force uh massive massive uh review what do you call it review bombing on on Steam tanking the rating of the game very significantly this was a beloved game a month ago and is now being heavily hated on so this was done like on last Friday I think right before the weekend I think it's Monday or Tuesday comes around and Sony pulls it okay you don't need a PSN
account anymore come today and I got confirmation by people in chat that this was today uh you still don't need a Playstation network account because I guess they learned that much but I think they didn't really get the point the real point the point that people were really mad about because all those zones where you can't get PSN now can't buy the game a lot of people thought those zones could could play that's not true if you already own it you can play as far as my understanding goes please feel
free to correct me but I'm pretty sure you can play in those zones but now I think it's 180 uh how is it defined let me find it  quick three more countries banned it's like 180 areas you can't play the game in anymore or you can't buy buy the game anymore they apparently still can't play so this seems to be very much yeah it happened today things are changing actively 180 Regions they're calling it uh so it started at 177 and then they added Estonia Lithuania and Latvia to
that list which brought it to 180 you can see this changing live because the steam DB has a history where you can see changes so people are tracking the changes live which is wild yeah it's 180 of the territories that steam recognizes that Mak the logic here so that was my question why would you block people from buying the game in 180 regions what is the point what is what is Sony's you know potent because the only thing I can think of is you there's some potential legal liability for operating
like you know when you buy a piece of software and the Ula is like yeah you have to agree not to use this for acts of terrorism like like like is there some kind of is there some kind of weird potential legal liability from the game being sold in in these regions but then you know if that's the case then why is it a problem to you know to buy Dave the diver in Congo you know like I like what what exactly is the logic here and does it have to do with that Sony is running their own speaking of Congo
that's one of the places where they can't buy it is is is it something to do with the fact that Sony is running PSN and and so you know if they don't have all the legalities sorted out for operating in that region then then they can't but then if that's the case why not just wave the requirement I mean don't don't don't you want our money you know like from on behalf of Gamers everywhere do you not want our money yeah some people are saying in F chat this kind of makes sense that they're
doing this now hoping that the backlash will be less and then they want to add PSN requirement in the future and then when only people that could have PSN on it are really playing the game they're hoping that the impact will be lower I don't know if that's the play or not but they are adding this type of restriction to another game as well so this is not a small play for them this is something  do those regions have never gotten access to the game back they added three more places today yeah I don't know I
haven't exactly you know tried to play with an account from Yemen for example or Zimbabwe uh or any of these other places Aruba Angola uh there's there's 180 of them you can easily see it on the steamdb website cuz there's the change of adding 180 countries or 173 177 and then three more um but yeah it's it's it's weird to me if you were a game development Studio sure and Sony not a thing I know a ton about approached you I'll allow it consider that a lot of game development
Studios do look for publishers not because in modern day you really need uh the publishing side of the Publishers but because you need the funding so you're a gain development Studio you're looking for funding you need more funding to finish your game off you think it's going to be a hit but it's not out yet um and Sony approaches you after this happened do you take that deal or do you keep looking because I'm looking I'm looking at how Arrowhead is kind of being tossed around in the
middle of this dude I take the money I mean the games game development industry is is brutal um if if that's I mean obviously if I have another offer I'll consider it yeah so if it's if like if Sony's the only one on the table yeah it's like who's my better option is Microsoft yeah you might just get closed and and to be clear you we're not necessarily talking about an acquisition but like you know what what are Microsoft terms going to be do I have to do I have to allow it to be exclusive on
Game Pass before I can even sell it for myself or like like what right like I don't know it depends on on everyone is going to have strings attached just a part of the variable there's no free money yeah so with all of that in mind it might still it might still be the the best option which sucks but like realistically I don't I don't have a backup I I I I don't have $25 million to to give you to finish your game I mean if lonus if lonus publisher game funding group existed i' yeah I'd be happy
there's a bunch of other YouTubers starting game Publishers I wish them luck with that I mean hey I I heard there's a lot of talent looking for work right now looking to looking to build cool gaming experiences so that's the one possible Silver Lining is I think we're going to see like a like a boom of small Studios let's Embrace this silver lining for a quick second to get off this topic because it kind of sucks anyways um but big mode from uh oh is it Dunkey or what yeah uh big mode is this is this game
came out now animal well is it out it came out today animal well woo people seem to love this solo Dev did everything I obviously haven't had time to play it cuz it came out today but people are raving about this first game they've published right yeah sick overwhelmingly positive Steam Reviews right now good sign 97% of all reviews and there's been 1834 reviews out today 7% are marking as positive what is it 3% of people who own a game review it yeah 1800 is huge so this thing is
smashing already good job and people love it so Billy basso great work big mode good first release maybe I'll go home and play it dang good job so speaking of other alternative Publishers my my way too short video on on a float plane was talking about how this type of stuff is is happening more and more lately and apparently at least big mode is doing it well I'm not going to say the rest of them are going to do it well I'm not going to say there's you know a ton of Billy basos out there but I'm
really stoked that that this is working  great very cool obviously I can't tell everything about the game from this looks cool kind of reminds me of like undertale a little bit maybe a little bit of like Hollow night um I don't know it just seems Seems Like A vibe yeah really interesting art style look at the Reflections in the water yeah sick super cool is it very excited do you know what it's made with Dan uh he wrote his own engine all right Billy basso dang dude absolute Go goat solo Dev my goodness
line lus you're still muted by the way that's not even fair to the other devs anyway sorry what I had said before was it feels like somewhere in between like or it reminds me a little bit of like undertale or Hollow KN kind of a I think it's a puzzle puzzle style platformer rather than like a anything else I think hold on how big is the game uh is this real is it actually 40 Megs I'm questioning this 34 Megs 34 megabyte game 33 Megs it's getting smaller they are the mega are
the mega more like Omega bytes under the system requirements it says that you need 40 Megs of available space more like Sigma bites hold look at this look at this you a 64-bit processor 1 GHz of speed 1 gig of RAM and 40 max of space Oh my God I can run it on my watch is this roller coaster tycoon what's happening I would love to know what he wrote this in what the heck that is incredibly optimized hey that makes me happy apparently on on someone's computer right now it's

linch tips.com to join the squad uh anything else you want to go through in here Luke uh EA we don't have to talk about this too much I don't have a lot of details on it but EA announced that they might be putting ads in AAA games uh this isn't entirely new we've seen ads in games before I don't necessar know what they mean by this I don't know if they mean intrusive ads like it's going to play like a video ad in front of your face because there's been product placement in games forever like
Billboards and all this other type of stuff people just having items it's it's been a thing forever so I'm assuming it's new and worse in some way but I don't have a ton to say about it um also upgradeable laptops are back LP cam oh yeah has been in the news lately Lenovo has released a ThinkPad workstation that is the first laptop compatible with LP cam 2 the new you're muted LP cam 2 is here upgradable laptops are back Lenovo has released a ThinkPad workstation that is the first
laptop that's compatible with LP cam 2 a new dam standard that was recently published by jck a big selling point for these new modules is that they will be faster more efficient and more compact than so dim and also easier to upgrade or replace than soldered Ram so they're kind of The Best of Both Worlds replacement LP cam 2 modules are available directly from Micron I have had a ton of people like seriously this is probably out of every random esoteric Tech thing that people have asked me to
make a video about this has been the most common I have someone messag me about it probably once a month or so over the last while I don't get a ton of video requests like directly in my DMs or my inbox or my mentions but this is one that has come up enough times that I'm like wow people sure ask me to make a video about this a lot well conveniently for you we did and here's the ad that plays before it there we go oh yeah it's LP cam we did a whole video and it was pretty cool and we covered it in pretty
darn good detail we even had a module back a year ago uh you're welcome more like a year and a half ago we also hey you know before you send me a DM asking me to make a video just just drop a quick you know look on one of our variety of channels drop a quick search you know Cam and just you know see what happens because you might just find a video about it we've uh We've definitely covered a lot of stuff over the years anyway thank you for the suggestion uh this is really exciting because it's uh
it's not really mentioned in our notes here but uh the ability to run at the same speeds as having the uh the packages soldered onto the main board is a huge Advantage basically with so dim Alex explains it in great detail in that video uh we worked together on the script for it and he did an amazing job but basically the trace length is just too long for sodm to keep up anymore and uh cam helps reduce the trace length the the the maximum Trace length U significantly allowing us to hit not
quite the same speeds as soldering um directly on the motherboard or especially now we're seeing memory soldered like on package or not soldered but we're seeing memory added to the to the package so not quite at the same level but hey it's upgradeable which is an advantage for users and even an advantage for system Builders who want to be able to offer multiple configurations uh find my device expansion oh yeah I got an email about this Google is finally rolling out its
promised find my device expansion which will help users locate both online and offline devices and it works pretty much the same as Apple's find my network um there's a billion plus Android devices in the network that will ping your device over Bluetooth if it's nearby and send the end to-end encrypted information to find my device the system also stores recent locations with timestamps so it can be used to find offline devices and as recently as a couple of weeks ago we managed to get
yvon's parse back using an Apple Air tag this is very really useful things I told Luke about it already that person was definitely going to keep it until oh yeah I disclosed that there was a tracker on it and I was going to be able to make make noise with it as soon as I got in touch with my son back home to Ping it because I didn't bring an iPhone with me on the trip um anywh who users that wish to opt out of the feature can do so through settings and users can also manage when they want to
participate whether it's only in high traffic areas or all areas perhaps controversially users have the option to benefit from the network by using it to find their device without participating themselves I am against that yeah me too I think that if you complely agree if you want to be able to find your device I think Google should just draw the line here and basically say no what you want to you want to use the network to find your missing device but you're not going to contribute to it why don't you just
go drink a nice cold glass of off and cuz like it's it's it's not like it's not encrypted not reing yeah yeah not cool yeah you're going to download a Linux ISO you should help other people download Linux isos unfortunately the purse story we were in a pretty chaotic head space I'm not going to remember all the details but we were at lwigs for the shoot uh we got an Uber back to our hotel realized when we got to the hotel holy crap we don't have it we assumed that she had accidentally left it in the
Uber uh remember or not remember but you might not know this um we had pulled an all nighter right before the trip painting pl's car she stayed up with me um and we were working on it together neither of us was really at our best on that trip um so we assumed it was in the Uber we called the Uber driver because that's a feature and he was like I have a fair right now um I'll check you know when I pull over um he didn't call back so Ivon calls him back later he goes yeah I checked in the back
seat it's not there and she goes well okay what about the trunk and he's like I have a fair I'll check later we're like okay well just in case it's not in the Uber why don't we head back to lwig Studio yeah um it was not simple to get in touch with um with my son to check the air tag location because I had left my iPhone back home what am I going to need my iPhone for I'll just bring my regular phone um so we hadn't managed to get in touch with him yet so we were like okay well why don't we just head
back to the studio maybe we accidentally left it in the studio we got there and it was right around that time that we learned a bunch of things so the driver got back to us eventually that it wasn't in the car so we went uhoh we searched the studio it wasn't there we got the ability to to uh see where it was but we couldn't ping it yet long story um and oh no we could ping it but we couldn't find it in lewig studio so now we're really worried now we've got the like last known location but it was a
long time ago and it was at a park that was like a little ways away from lwig studio and we're like okay that's a bad sign Because unless we drove past someone with an iPhone as we were leaving and that was the last time it got pinged and it was in the Uber which the guy said it wasn't but like you never know I had a cabby lie and say that I didn't leave a jacket in a cab once and they definitely had it uh unless that's what happened um this thing is pretty lost and even if that's
what happened this thing is pretty lost uh but then it started to get updates more recently and it was just like at the intersection near this park and I I had already had the idea that if we left it on the sidewalk um someone might have just grabbed it Chuck been walking you know cuz you're going to be moving just ditched the tracker like in the park just hucked it in a garbage can or something like that and and then and then took the purse with them cuz the tracker's just
hanging in plain sight off of the purse it's not like in a hidden pocket or anything and uh so I had already kind of walked past the spark a couple of times earlier and I was while we were waiting and stuck and not able to get in touch with my son um I I had suggested to Ivon that we like walk around the park and like look in garbage cans and stuff like that um because it would be it would be great if they just took the cash and then chucked the whole purse tracker included so I was kind of Still Holding
Out for that um so I didn't realize because I was looking at the find my app never actually had to use it to find anything before so I was looking at the find my app through my son's phone at the other screen and it's like a huge icon like this and I didn't realize it actually comes to a pinpoint so at some point I realized no no it's exactly at that point in the intersection where that weird like hoarder looking truck full of garbage and with like uh a kid and someone in it and clearly like no
intention of moving there's a lot of like RVs and stuff parked around like it was clearly a um a poorer neighborhood where people were living out of their vehicles um so clearly so so that vehicle had caught my eye before and now I realized that the pin was like right on it um they didn't speak any English so we um we had interacted with them just sort of casually already but finally we were like okay well we need to talk to them because uh uh yeah we're going to have to like Google translate moment
figure this out at some point so we pull out Google translate and Ivon basically goes I lost my purse um have you seen a purse and they go no and we kind of go okay um well I need to wait a little bit longer before I can ping this on my own because by then my son was doing something else and we couldn't just have like him ping it oh right oh I remember why we couldn't just have him ping it because uh it wasn't near anything on the find my network so so we had the Loca the last location we had the
ability to Ping it with the iPhone but we didn't have an iPhone so we had to go back to see this is why I told you I was going to get the details wrong we had to go back to the studio my phone battery was dead so I couldn't call ion I was worried the truck would like leave uh because they had seen me kind of walking around a lot um right we had to go back to the studio they did they had an iPhone but it belonged to an employee who wasn't there anymore and they didn't have the PIN to to to reset it so we we
had to like search for whether a Macbook participates in the find my network we finally got that we brought it back we had to connect it to an internet connection which wasn't working on my phone cuz my phone died so we had to tether it to Ivans her phone was almost dying so we finally got to that point so then we talked to them again because we' already talked to them we already said we lost the purse but we hadn't we didn't have any way to Ping it so now we had a way to Ping it I right I couldn't
sign into my Apple ID on the MacBook because my 2fa was on my phone which Char I had so I was like I was in the middle of reverse charging while I was sitting there cuz there's Anroid app that you can use to Ping unfamiliar trackers but it has to be near you for 10 minutes so we have these multiple timers I'm trying to reverse Wireless charge my phone I'm trying to figure out how to log into my Apple ID maybe without it or something or like I could team viewer into something and get
something and then Ivonne is meanwhile waiting for this countdown timer for the 10 minutes so finally we get there and we're ready to talk to them again and we're ready to ping it and so I go over to the Taco Stand that's like on the street next to I'm like hey uh Google translate moment again do you mind turning down your music I'm trying to hear a Tracker and we go back and ask one more time uh hey um we've got a tracker on the purse um and so have you seen it because it's
going to make a noise soon and they go oh yeah yeah I was going to give it to you um yeah my my kid was sleeping so I couldn't before Oh yeah and we kind of go totally okay and she goes yeah yeah uh I was I was going to give it to you and and this is oh right a kid has been brought in a neighborhood kid has been brought in to translate yeah yeah I was I was going to give it to you uh my my husband found it and um and and gave it to me and I was going to give it to you and we're like okay anytime
now so um she goes and gets it and sure enough it's yvon's purse I guess they had no idea what an air tag was because it was still sitting on it she hands it back to Ivonne uh who immediately opens it up to give her the cashes a reward as she's saying everything's in there uh and Ivon goes oh well I guess you helped yourself to your reward already which may not have actually been the lady it might have been the husband who found it or even someone before that or even someone
before that but one way or another the cash wasn't in it uh but you know what honestly we were so happy to have it back that we had to go bother one of Ludwig's poor team members for like this is probably the fourth or fifth time by this point cuz we went in to look for it and then we went in to like borrow an iPhone and then we went in to go like hey I'm actually how about a Macbook and then we went in for some other reason we're like ringing the door every time right who who the heck are these guys no
I knew who knew who we were um but then the last thing we had to do was because we no offense to anyone didn't really want to walk around and look for an ATM um we're like hey do you have any cash we can like PayPal you replacement cash but we had no cash on us because I don't carry it and Ivon had her cash taken uh so we still gave her a reward thinking maybe someone cuz why would you why would you confidently hand someone their purse going everything's in it when it's
not when it wasn't so at the very least she probably didn't know um or maybe didn't know who know she she very possibly didn't know and they clearly hadn't time hadn't had time to go through it in detail so what I suspect was Buddy picked it up grabbed the cash immediately so that he didn't have to tell his wife that he had cash cuz like some relationships are like that and I can def I definitely got a Vibe um that you know there might have been some dishonesty right around yeah um you know
so probably grabbed the cash dumped it in the in the like hoarder looking truck thing that was just it was like full of garbage like full of garbage um which is weird because there were garbage cans in the park that were empty they could have easily put their garbage in there but no they chose to keep it in their truck um and then intended to go and look through it later is is the vibe I got because her airpods were still in there um and airpods Pros like if you have any idea
what those are that's one of the first things pretty quick yeah y her airpods Pros were still in there uh there were no transactions on any of the credit cards none of them had been removed clearly they thought they had all the Time in the World to come back and and go through it and figure out you know what was a value other than the cash um so so thank you thank you Apple for your air tag system that you um are now finally have done your part to help Google also have their own system so I
don't have to buy your air tags anymore and I'll actually be able to um ping stuff myself without carrying around my stupid iPhone but but does Google have like what tracker can we get on the Google side well they'll they'll be coming okay yeah yeah very excited it's going to be  nice yeah yeah I am um I'm very very happy that we got it back we ended up giving we offered them a meal uh because there was the food stand right there and they were like no I don't want that and so we went and got
cash and brought it back I'm like okay sure sure sure fine I decided on $60 for those of you who must know I felt like that was there were apparently three of them so they can get some food and I figure I didn't owe them any more than the bare minimum since I mean they weren't they were clearly not intending on giving it back one of them or another already had our cash and the other one clearly didn't intend to give us back the rest of of the stuff I like what are you talking
about you were going to return it if you're going to return it you could have easily found the phone number in it and called it that would have been an option um anyway it was very very stressful this was like the first day of our trip second this was the second day of our trip and we had two more days to come and it would have just been fortunately her passport was not in there yeah she had her passport separate never have some countries some countries force you to walk around with your passport that
is utterly insane yeah but it is a thing but if if that's not the case leave it in your hotel safe uh we should get on to merch messages because I have about six minutes uh oh I'll do I'll do some more I can do some more time than that but um yeah let's let's after dark it that's the wrong  I've already done it what's on this side I have a remote wow thanks Andy nice Dan good job oh that wasn't me leaving I was trying to adjust the lights I gotta howdy lld I am back in graduate school
after 20 years in a job where priorities were obvious how do you prioritize when tasks are numerous wait you already gave us that I already gave you that one it was so long ago farmer Nebraska and solar storms are wreaking havoc today interference with our GPS systems needs to be precision and has brought planting to a halt across the state needed for precision oh Precision agriculture yeah oh that's interesting scary to an industry thoughts yeah that's uh that is an impact of solar storms that I would not
personally have thought of me neither thoughts it's not going to happen that often I think unless it does I don't know yeah maybe yeah solar warming solar solar climate change the other way solar climate change I think they usually get colder um yeah un unless they don't un they get a lot hotter and bigger um yikes thoughts I don't know all right let's next one we we'll have to embrace tradition yeah L got to go pretty quick uh my goodness uh apparently the largest storm
is going to be here about 10: p.m. to 2: a.m. today if we can uh get outside oh to see the Northern Lights I have living in Canada I have still never seen them well me neither cuz most the times that they announce them it's just you're not going to see it here but theoretically this one you like actually might sick cuz they're always like oh you can see it in Vancouver and you go outside it's like no you really can't well it's always overcast here so that's an issue but maybe these ones biggest one since
2005 sick hi lld do you think Linux will ever gain competitive market share in the new consumer space yes well okay it already is happening exhibit a steam deck yeah sick and if valve ever releases Steam OS man I would seriously consider running Steam OS for like a media center PC like like a TV the console like experience of Steam OS very cool very awesome hey LDL love the wind show curious what you guys think about the future where AI plays a role in government in an effort to eliminate the
inherited flaws of Being Human greed power bias Etc well those last three things that you just said are all the reasons that they're not going to allow AI to make those decisions because then they wouldn't get the benefits of their greed power and bias um I think it'll take a long time for AI to play a significant role there because it's pretty obvious that they have no interest in logic and doing whatever is sort of clearly the most correct thing I also think that there's
a huge chance for when we start doing that those systems become compromised and then uh utilized in in like office space you know scrape the pennies off style ways that are going to be difficult to notice with lacking oversight uh and cause extremely major problems after trying Windows Mac and Linux I've uh found that all are missing some great features from one another what features do you think should be universally implemented by operating system sleep that works got them windows
stop turning yourself on to do updates and crashing stop turning yourself on at all if I turn you off stay off period wake timers do nothing uh no there's no super pro checks tonight guys um what features do you think should be universally I mean a lot of operating systems are like I don't you don't interface with it that much yeah I really don't that much I use my browser so much more than I use the oper system itself it makes me sad that more websites aren't services but I
understand like I probably interact with steam more than I interact with Windows if you think about it yeah yeah I think I agree to be honest because I I launch a computer I make sure teams slack and chrome are open I'm done I'm trying if I'm working Snipping Tool yeah you know like like what but then they all do they not all does does I know Linux and Windows no no I'm not saying as a feature I'm just trying to think of other things I need to have open yeah like almost nothing
your clock for work anyway yeah sure man does it bother you as much as it bothers me that you can't click on the time in the corner and get a secondhand anymore on Windows 11 oh yeah it's dumb what the heck I I use it as just like like a like a timer clock what why just just give it back and why did you take away the very bottom right great show desktop thing and you can turn it back on which is nice do you use that by the way click all the way down in the bottom right to show the desktop
yeah mine is turned back on yeah it's like why did you not on this computer mind you but on my computer at home it is it wasn't in the way of anything that  point oh it's reminding me to take my antibiotics ah yeah uh I'm patiently waiting for the Precision screwdriver is there any new news on it are you really patiently waiting though if you message me about it are you patient I paid money to ask you about it uh yeah that's that seems like the opposite of patience to be clear I'm
not complaining um but it doesn't seem patient is all I'm saying soon soon my pretties I think we ran into uh a weird complication where it turns out that another major Precision screwdriver vendor um got the tolerances backwards so instead of having uh the bits be exactly exactly a size and then accounting for tolerance in the bits by having the female side in their driver be bigger they made the female side of the driver be exactly exactly the size and had their bits be smaller to account
for tolerance issues so the standard is basically fed because this is a major vendor and so we did it correctly which would have made at the edges of tolerances our driver incompatible with third party bits ah not because we did anything wrong so these are the kinds of things that um hey you know you that's why you do pre-production runs and that's why you do validation and testing and uh everything will be okay we're going this is why Hardware is difficult we're going to do it wrong basically in
order to maintain compatibility as best we can fa enough but we're unhappy about and we're going to gripe I use my LTD driver to remove a GPS tracking device and ignition cut off for my 2013 Ford Fiesta have you ever found a device or Tech installed where  dealership that sounds wild is that from like a like a like a lease or like a I think you're in a movie now I think I think you get to be the star of a movie now that's wild wonder if it was a lease that they sold and then it was just
still there maybe or maybe it was a rental car that the dealership then sold dealership sell a lot of rental cars and a Ford Fiesta would have been very or maybe it was a finance deal and it's there so that they can repo it that actually seems like man all of those all of them are dystopian and all of them seem plausibly likely yeah I hate all of it bird question for Luke at a pet store in conure conure uh when he sees my 18-month-old son gets as it's not in con it's Conor is a type of bird
it's type A Conor oh sorry I'm trying to go quickly not doing very good right now it's all good it's uh at a pet store a Conor when he sees my 18th 18-month-old son gets as close as possible to him turns on his side and rolls into the glass of the cage is this a good or bad behavior I don't know Conor super well I would say that's a good behavior uh Conor are very hand friendly and they like to cuddle and stuff like that so he probably feels safe and wants to cuddle and be friendly and nice I I would read
that as a very POS like very notably positive behavior but I've never had those birds I don't 100% know but I would I would say it's good 8085 dll I'm looking forward to watching the Borderlands movie when it comes out even if it's bad what video game movies are wor you excited about also more tall shirts when thanks for all you do I was excited about the Warcraft movie and I hated it hated it wow tell me how you really feel I went to go see with my brother and we were both just like mad the whole
time it was annoying people are saying why it shouldn't have been live action that was dumb blizzard has like historically amazing cinematics they they basically always did and always have yeah them and squaresoft were like killed it and then they released a liveaction movie which was just weird and then they borked a bunch of the lore which was like what are you doing you mad bro you have like a bunch of the like weirdest nerdiest lore heavy fans and then you're just like change some stuff you mad bro what
yeah I was yeah do you have a habit of periodically downloading your account data from the products and services you use the last time I remember doing so was to see where my brother's friend spent his V bucks I don't I mean yeah I could see that maybe being useful you know in case who knows you know Amazon decides to stop showing you all of your previous purchases or something like that right like yeah I could see it being useful but no I really don't make a habit of it I don't either probably should
yeah hey lldd I'm a hiring manager and just got done with an on-site interview where the candidate was technically sound but not a behavioral fit how do you screen for both given limited interview time actually really like that wording yeah not a behavioral fit yeah I do I do what I call culture fit interviews and then I do technical interviews afterwards and to be clear like a culture fit does not mean uh discriminatory it means yeah I absolutely need to work with you on a
daily basis and I have to make sure that that's not going to make both of us want to blow our brains out yeah Ivon asked me some hilarious Prest questions and it was very good interview I mean yeah zon so I'm sure it was um I also have asked some hilarious questions but I don't think anyone would say they had a good interview I liked I liked my interview it was really long well yeah I mean if you're going to hire someone then you should take the time right oh yeah but wasn't ours like hours and hours long I
don't remember didn't you have to get dinner in the middle of it I think you've talked about it before you drove me home cuz all the buses shut down I showed up immediately after it was it was like I think monster right here it was like 4:35 p.m. is and then by the time we were done the interview the bus system had shut down and it was dark [Laughter] out this is cool agent ji something uh I have the interview then I give them a tour the tour really helps figure out their interest and personality that's a
really good idea that's cool I like that a lot actually that's really clever I've I've thought for a while super cool start like playing tape to tape with people or something like doing an activity with someone I think is extremely informative yeah that's what Aon did with me oh what' she do uh interview then tour oh typical she's so good at it um sick yeah I don't know if that's for everybody uh let's see I'm in the process of building my first house and I'm thinking about doing the painting
myself to save money I'm currently looking for looking at spraying would that be worth it and what should I look out for spray what is your sanity worth to you painting's a lot of work and it's tedious um I think what you should do is man you're in the process of building your own house man you got you got so much to do okay so it depends if this is new construction spraying can be very efficient and can be pretty cost effective if everything else is in place you probably don't want to spray the
amount of work that you save by spraying instead of rolling it's going to cost you in masking everything off and protecting everything else from overspray um I would say painting is the kind of thing that some people even very handy people just don't have patience for and it's worth painting one room because presumably you can do that painting one room to see if you have the temperament for it and if you don't just have a professional come in and do it they'll come in they'll rip through the
job um especially if it's new construction they really know what  done hey DL I wait sorry ask for what to look out for don't waste money on on just extra crap that you don't need you do not need a a special little bucket for holding your paint when you go up the ladder you just use a paint bucket you fold over the the handle you hold that in your thumb you hold the bottom of the paint bucket and you just fill it up about this much it's called a cut can not because you cut the can but it's for
cutting in the edges um so you just put like this much paint in the bottom then you dip your brush bang it on the sides and just paint a nice steady line just use a like a sash um I think it's called a sash brush the kind that's shaped like that okay like kind of like a sword um so don't don't waste money on on like you know oh yeah buy this little thing that goes on the Ed end of a pole and you know you like run it along the top to do edging don't don't do any of that stuff the only things you need to
paint a room are a brush a roller pull a roller a cut can and a drop cloth never ever no job is so small that you don't need a drop cloth don't do it it's not wor this from other people as well specifically about the drop cloth hey D I might try to Skunk Works a landan at open sace What's your most obscure land Party favorite that you've had issues running on Modern systems liar but there is a there's a modern like redo but it doesn't include some of my favorite things to do in Old learo it
had a map editor that was a lot of fun we uh we spent a lot of time in Mr mcl's portable what is Lio uh it's a little like it's like worms but Real Time 1 V one oh yeah it's like it's ancient how do you spell it l i e r o whoa it is definitely ancient it's super fun that's sweet D I have been Amazon free for a year after listening to Luke recently I had two Tech orders placed at other stores ship from Amazon got how do you avoid this should companies have to disclose this yeah gotam what okay I've
received boxes that were Amazon boxes from other companies but I don't think I don't think they just relabeled it personally I think they just had that box and reused it um wow I don't run into this very often just try to find another store I don't think there's like you're not going to be able to go back to them and be like I didn't want this to come from Amazon um but yeah just uh just go somewhere else there only so much you can do yeah best advice Get Wrecked yeah good one
Luke uh oh my God they they said the names properly hello Dan Luke and lonus this feels wrong now uh any update on whale land and what are you looking forward to seeing it computex from M Barton the whale I'm kind of hoping for NVIDIA 5000 series at computex that'd be pretty cool I don't actually think it's that likely but i' I'd certainly be into it could use a new you know GPU family maybe the pricing Won't Suck sorry it's not funny um update on wh land no we've got to work things out
with the city that's probably going to take some time we'll see how it goes hopefully they are um willing to work with us in good faith and if not then I mean it might be dead so uh yeah that would sure be  online all right and on that note hey thanks so much for tuning in we will see you again next week same bad time we're going to skim through potentials same bad channel oh I do need to skip through quick but there is a bunch of potentials I those were collapsed by default I didn't even see
them oh I'll start top you start bottom uh I mean sure lus would you consider daily driving a Sony Smartphone absolutely the one thing I'm waiting for is for them to allow reversing the back and multitask buttons um I I am right-handed I use back a lot and I usually use my phone in my right hand I cannot be reaching across it like that so I just I just need them to get that  ready I'm trying to curate oh okay William asks uh we've heard about the charges that App Stores charge but how
much did a store like NC make off of a $60 game so NC had very very poor relationships with game Publishers and game distributors uh so we would make as little we we could make as much as about three or4 off of a $60 game and as little as losing money in order to hit MSRP it was very stupid basically physical media sales was a complete disaster from us from day Zero until the very end it just made absolutely no sense whatsoever there was also like barely any there it was a yeah well if we didn't make any
money on them yeah why would we stock them occasionally we'd bring in some of like a really hot new title just to kind of bring people in the door and have them be aware that we existed but that was the only business reason that we would ever do that I'm just going to take a screenshot here this isn't freezing if you think that's happening okay cool uh do continue if you have any more oh do you want me to just like do stuff uh okay no I'm done I can read now sorry uh hey lld I've been really
enjoying David as a host recently what went into his move from shooting to hosting was it something he initiated or was it suggested by someone else at the company oh I mean I think that would be a story for David to tell but um I thought that might be the case I just I was super sure guess I can kind of tell maybe my part of it I I've always really enjoyed working with David and I think that from you know my point of view um it was It was a a cool potential path for him to to
progression I think that he'd been in that role for a really long time and I think that uh I think it's been really really positive uh we've always I really like his stuff I I see I got to be careful when I'm putting words in other people's mouths right because I was about to say we've always enjoyed working together but for all I know hecking hates my guts right who knows possible I mean I don't know that he'd still be here if that were the case he's been here a long time now is he at his I
mean you know I can't get into people's start dates you got to be so careful right about as an employer disclosing people's information I think I'm pretty sure that everything I'm saying right now is within bounds but you got to just you got to be so careful anyway I always really enjoyed working with him and I thought it would be uh be pretty cool to work on more of like the planning the video side together as opposed to the execution of the video side together and we've got some quite senior members of
the camera team that are really awesome to the point where we didn't need David to be there all day every day anymore um we've got Andy and second Andy and Andrew he goes by Andrew I was just I was so tickled when he came back from a family function of some sort and he was like yeah I kept people kept uh talking to me and I'd go oh where's Andy because he he gets called Andy and it never even occurred to me because he goes by Andrew here and also because we have Andy and Andrew in the camera department
so nobody would ever think to call Andrew Andy but like yeah obviously it's short for um and then Glenn Glenn's been doing awesome work um with the camera team lately as well so we yeah we've got like three really good dedicated camera camera people and some and some others that can kind of sub in when needed so yeah David moved over to writing I think he's been doing a great job he's got a very creative mind very very creative mind he loves he's a he's a doer he's a he's a thinker
we've got we've got I mean obviously the only reason I'm talking about David is because you asked uh we've got a really really great team overall world class but that was specifically in my version of the story not putting any words in this mouth why that particular transition took place hey dll loved the Luma field CT scanner video was wondering what you think about heat reactive cups that show the internals of various products when it heats up it's a super cool idea
pretty neat uh finding a mug source that doesn't have any lead in their has been very difficult if you've ever wondered why we're the only merch store on Earth what that doesn't have mugs that's a thing it's not for lack of effort but it's in a lot of the it's in a lot of the um the like ceramic coloring like the treatment yeah I was my probably fine current current amount of years old when I figured out that Crystal is lead crystal yeah like old Crystal cookware whatever was all is all lead I
have no idea I don't think a lot of it actually leeches into whatever's in it but like sure you know yeah so um at some point we're going to figure it out maybe I also was deeply uncomfortable with um how bone china works so only a certain percentage of what they fire uh meets the the the quality standard which you know is inherent I guess um but the solution to that is that anything that doesn't meet standard they have specially mapped out  goes okay any industry that has so much
waste that they have their own special landfill where they can put all of their stuff I I thought it had something to do with how it was mapped out I was confused us a second all right yeah no no it's just there's a ton of waste so much for every mug that we sold on the store they were going to produce like three to meet our quality standards so we were just like how about no yeah yeah how about not that all right so that's pretty cool hey W.D what are your daily driver battery Banks and hold on to be
clear to be clear there might be suppliers that do a better job or whatever but we haven't found them so we're so and yeah there you go what's your daily driver battery bank    the anchor 733 power bank so it's a combination wallwart slash power bank with PD um it's kind of inconvenient how heavy it is so especially when I'm traveling on like loose hotel and plane Outlets it has a tendency fall yeah feel how heavy it is yeah I can see that happen it has a tendency to fall out but
um the convenience of having a battery bank that is always charged because I use it anytime I charge my laptop and it charges this at the same time that's  um yeah I mean look I've talked about this before we won't take anchors money because I I don't think they've ever really made right um from that whole that whole security camera Yi brand situation thing um but that doesn't mean I won't use the product like people seem people seem to be very confused sometimes about the things that I say
there's a difference between company and self there's also people find this to be a very difficult concept when it comes to me and Amazon because they know that float plane has some workings through AWS and they're like you boycot Amazon but you used AWS stuff with Flo PL I'm like yeah you criticize society yet you participate in society it's like what like it's I as an individual won't do it this is not the gacha that you think it is I um I I just I am I'm willing to buy
a product and use it or in that in that case probably they sent it to us as a sample I don't know but I'm willing to use a product I'm not willing to endorse it and I'm not willing to take their money in order to promote it to you yeah  simple for lonus are you still using your steam deck no I did just finally finish Dave the diver though was awesome I played it on the Ally nice yeah it's a good game did you did you play it I started it I didn't get super gripped and with that
type of gameplay time I should be spending more time in Final Fantasy 6 so I have not continued oh yeah have you played it at all a little bit oh really just not a lot where you at I'm still stuck in that town I don't remember the name of it wow you suck yeah he's still in Zozo yeah you might say that his  yeah you get a bell for that one lldd have you ever met a person who you thought was a fan but they were actually some acquaintance you just forgot you met oh yeah 100% 100% like especially at
trade shows oh cuz man there'll be someone I haven't seen in eight years or whatever and they remember me because they watch the videos or something so their memory of me is constantly being refreshed and mine isn't and no offense but like I'm really bad with names and faces and I even going back to my days at NC when I had no YouTube channel at all I I would be meeting so many people um because I was a retailer and generally like you know everyone's trying to get their product in your
store so I would I would have so many people wanting to meet me that I there's so many faces and I'm so sleep deprived like I just I'm I'm at my worst at trade shows I try my best but I'm at my worst and so I just often have this issue I will I will sometimes start an encounter with someone and I'll I'll just gamble because I have no idea I'll be like hey nice to see you again and they're like what or I'll be like hey nice to meet you and they're like this is about the fourth time but sure you got to do the
neutrals no I I I just own it at this point good to see you first time last time who knows no I just no I just I just own it at this I do neutrals for sure even if I'm 100% confident do neutrals if I get it wrong I'm just like yeah I'm sorry I'm really bad with names and faces I think it's a learning disability one of my problems is actually they can't they can't come after me if I say  disability no seriously I can't do it to the point where I think they're might be something wrong with me isn't that part
of ADHD stuff I thought it I thought it was sure I don't know well it's a learning disability sure I don't know for me I constantly think I I like might recognize people so then who knows cuz I'll be like I might know this person from like hockey when I was also might have been at like a viewer Meetup or that so who knows or whatever else I'm like could be relationship I have no clue and then they'll say hi and I'm like sure could be generic white dude could be met at a Meetup could be played sports with I
have no clue all right next up let's keep going okay I'm going to go with that I'm just going to say sorry I'm neuro Divergent nice which is not untrue that is true let's keep it going hi Luke other than NASA what government Tech infrastructure would you like to tour like a nuclear power plant yeah if we want to see all their floppy discs I guess anxiety yes greetings from W team. LTT would like advice from lonus it's been a few months since I bought my manual car and it's the best purchase
decision I've ever made any tips and tricks for me have fun enjoy it while it lasts I mean it's I don't think they're going to keep making them at least not at affordable price points for much longer I mean you'll be able to get older vehicles obviously but replacement parts are eventually going to become difficult to source and the whole manual dve driving lifestyle is going to fall by the wayside yeah they have like simulated manual now but oh the CVT G awesome yeah every article I've read
about it is like this is actually fing incredible and it's funny because I I every time I come across another one I send it to Alex Clark with like a because I told him that that I thought that would be something that could like get me really into a car is like having all the torque of electric with like the fun of just playing with the playing with even if it's a fake gearbox like gear by wire or whatever um and he every time he's like he like oh man it's it's hilarious like seee harder bro because
he hates it so much he's a mechanical  he anyway when I get a chance to when we finally get a chance to try one I think we're almost going to have to do two completely separate short circuits that he'll have to do one and have to do one if you if you did yeah oh or you do one but you have you guys cover the same thing and you just cover it like back by back or like splice together be kind of fun that'd be interesting yeah hey D early in my it career as a help desk Tech after performing a career change uh
what is a memorable or favorite moment early in your careers I mean my very first day at the computer store being a boxing day which is the Canadian equal of Black Friday was oh I'm so sorry absolutely wild that's pretty epic uh there was there was one day where uh my supervisor at the time in Geek Squad told me that I could take my overshirt part of my uniform off so I wouldn't get stopped by employees and could just hide in the back and just work on computers cuz we
were backed up and he thought I would be the fastest at fixing everything that's pretty cool and I was so filled with pride that I did as good of a job as I possibly could have because I was like this is sick that was cool very early lmg I'll never forget packing for that very first CES putting together that that like duffel that had the editing computer with the extreme Edition in it like the super super tiny editing computer and then like it had like a like a monitor
or two like packed in it I think one of them ended up getting broken at some point maybe that was at a different trade show it eventually got broken think it was eventually but we had these like Acer like super slim for the time uh IPS monitors that were like honestly pieces of like by modern standards but they were good enough that we could edit videos um and like this whole clever idea that we were going to set up an editing Booth like an editing Suite like in our hotel room and like like man
we were up late those nights and we were like filming videos of the prep so that we'd have videos to upload because it was du or die time if we didn't make videos like that was it Luke and Ed didn't get paid and I had to go get a job like I also didn't get paid was that simple yeah we cranked that that year was crazy that year was absolutely nuts we're all probably going to live a little bit less long because of that one trip just a tiny amount oh yeah 100% but yeah no question hello Dan Luke and lus
Luke I'm on the opposite side of my health Journey from you being underweight and apathetic how would you approach healing in my case well I have no experience with that really at one point in time I was very very skinny um really yeah I had like fainting problems from it and do you have any memory of this time or it was before I knew the skinny in the room with us right now fetal fetal at this point or oh my goodness no no no this was like in high school um if I if I sat down and leaned
forward my gut didn't even go out it still came in I was really skinny it was largely because I was growing way too fast yeah I knew the humble brag was coming I was just I was just too tall and Chad say how tall I was at the time I just said it was a growth spur I was very tall at the time um and my was growing too it probably was statistically um and it's it comes to you know you got to consume more calories if you want to gain more weight and then the apathetic part this isn't going to help with the
needing to consume more calories bit but I find to be inspired to do things you have to actually do the thing first you have to be in motion if you want to stay in motion basically um be a flywheel let's go yeah so do more stuff and stuff food in your face try not to just like feed with garbage either though to be clear you don't want a dirty bulk just eat more food in general one thing that can help with that is eating more dense calories cuz like if you think about the
how people do it in the in the opposite actually though I know have have more nuts you'll be really surprised at how many calories are in nuts so if you go to like Costco and buy those big tubs of just like nuts the amount of calories that are in one of those tubs is insane y calories and Luke's nuts you wouldn't believe it they're trying to eat meals not snacks okay last one I got here LT and Nvidia thank you for the 480 super winning it prompted an emergency case change what was the what was one of the
most memorable times you acquired something and it led to other purchases you know what I'm going to ignore the second part of your question because the most memorable time I ever won something was when my school did like a fundraiser thing where you like sell whatever and like raise money and out of the like 350 students uh they drew one of those gigantic 5B Hershey chocolate bars as a prize and I won it my dad didn't let me eat it he made me like cut it up into pieces and bring it into my class
