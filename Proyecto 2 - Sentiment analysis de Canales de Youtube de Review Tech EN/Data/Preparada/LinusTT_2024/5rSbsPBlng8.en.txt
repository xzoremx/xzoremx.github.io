what is up guys welcome to the W show I was hacked again this time by vitassium and as many of you observed my wife doesn't respect me oh have you read the comments on that video it's wild we'll talk about that later anyway in other news this week one of our uh friends in the industry has been embroiled in a little bit of um oh controversy I'll have to give you some  we'll use our panel of judges to review I just got signed out of the doc so uh nice um um uh I'm working on it wow it's
a good show what a what a great show by a professional cloud cloud flare wants to help block AI training Bots which is actually sick uh and California is is changing how companies have to communicate purchases versus uh basically renting software a g pretty much what we do today which is I'm very happy they're doing this this is actually super  cool the show is brought to you today by remotely Squarespace jump cloud and of course our chair partner secret lab and laptop partner LG uh why don't we jump
into a little bit of behind the scenes um that veritasium collab we actually have been working on doing more collabs because we realized that we've kind of been stuck in our little bubble up here in Vancouver and haven't talked to anybody or collaborated with anybody pretty much since Co and there have been a couple of small exceptions but we used to collab with other creators a fair bit and we just stopped In fairness to us we've been a little busy especially over the last
year we've had some work to do getting our house in order but we kind of talked about this a couple of months ago I guess and aligned on that hey we need to kind of you know get out there put ourselves out there start start seeing people again I was pushing for this for sure yeah think it's cool it's a good it's a it's a yeah it's a good part about being a Creator well and it's fun you know I think it's fun for everybody it's fun for me I like to think I'm fun to collaborate with for other creators
and it's I think it's fun for the audience as well to see these crossovers anyway the veritasium collab was one that completely fell into our lap uh Derek reached out and he was basically like look I think out of kind of everyone that I could work with on this you're probably one of the ones that would appreciate what we're doing the most um and I was like this sounds like the coolest thing ever but something people I think don't necessarily realize is that in a production like this there
is a little bit of movie Magic that is not to say that the attack Vector isn't real it is real that is not to say that if Derek wanted he couldn't have intercepted my phone number put a skin on it oh uh we could talk about my skin a little bit later oh okay not right now all right don't worry about it okay the point is that he could have intercepted my number yeah but if you observed anything about the video that a little weird um it's because it wasn't my number because DK and our team had
serious um reservations around anybody whether it's him or the security researcher that he partnered with or anybody um you know just willy-nilly intercepting my communications I was mad were you I saw video came up in my notifications and I had a massive like WTF why did you not tell me oh yeah that actually makes sense yeah I probably should have mentioned and I skipped through the video be like what happened do I need to be doing something about like no one told me anything
happened and then I see your phone at one point and I was like oh that's not his phone okay and then I went all the way back and just watched it casually however however did you enjoy it yeah it was good yeah so so one of the things that um people seemed kind of upset about in the video was that Ivonne doesn't respect me why yeah I don't I don't I would just like to give you guys a little bit of background for what happened in our interaction first of all when I called her so I knew it was
coming from a real sim a Sim that they obtained over the counter because the point was not to just do a theoretical demonstration the point was to do a practical real life demonstration of how this kind of an attack works it is very real um so they just obtained a Sim and put it into a phone but that wasn't my sim so when I called Ivonne it was coming from a completely different phone number one that she wasn't familiar with oh I didn't even cuz I knew that so I didn't even
register okay so so I so when I first called her I was just messing with her at the beginning of the call did you notice I I tried to make my voice sound like like kind of like a scam I thought this was pretty obvious to be honest like I didn't I didn't even sort of I've been sitting here confused about what they would have even been talking about cuz I thought it was like pretty apparent so um so Evon hung up on me not because she doesn't respect her husband or doesn't want to talk to me she hung
up on me because she is a smart lady no it's good who happens to be the financial controller for a small to mediumsized business depending on how you measure it and is not interested in talking to AI robocaller spam people yeah um she did a great job it was actually partially just because I had an opportunity to just do a little test like if I sounded a little weird would she stay on the line or would she hang up no that's good she did the right thing she did 100% the right thing if
anything I yeah I just I thought that I didn't so then I the one that I do want to explain is that when I was actually talking to her and I was kind of explaining how the thing works and she said I'm with Cindy and I was immediately like okay bye and she was like bye um the reason for that is because our cat was sick um so we got two kittens uh a few weeks ago man I guess it's almost a month ago now we we adopted two little kittens that were our neighbor's friend found them in their
shed essentially so these are just like wild cat kittens um and one of them developed a fever and was super lethargic and we contacted our vet friend and we were like hey Cindy context um how long should we wait like CU I I know from talking to you like the smaller the animal potentially the the scarier any kind of illness Tech always but for the most part yeah but you know if if if you don't like have a lot of blood and meat and liquid in you you know not drinking for a day is a lot bigger of a deal for
something you know like this with no blood in it versus like if an elephant didn't drink for a day it's probably going to be okay it it does vary a fair amount but but yeah it I think I think we can say it's a general General probably yeah so so it was enough for me to ask and I'm like yo Cindy like how long should we wait to to bring him in and she goes a day at most and I'm like okay uh so what's your availability like um so she squeezed this in so the reason that I'm with Cindy meant this
conversation needs to end right now oh yeah cuz you're on a crazy time crunch was because she was at the vet who had graciously squeezed Us in to take care of sick kitten if that was rude I'm rude I was filming a video not that long ago Emma called me and I answered and was like I'm fing a video and she's like okay bye and just immediately hung up she did yeah so I don't know um it's it's all fine so anyway I just wanted to let you guys know there's a bit of there's a bit of movie Magic in stuff
like this but the video was great the attack is awesome extremely real and the demo was 100% real but if there was any kind of weirdness that you guys observed it was because it was a little weird I was calling from an unfamiliar number in the first place I decided to do the voice cuz I thought it was funny um I'm actually kind of surprised he left that in the cut I didn't really like I didn't really contribute any of my thoughts to how he should cut it together or how his
team should deal with that they were super professional uh it was super cool working with them I first met Derek quite a few years ago at this point five years ago or something like that and um remember the co Gap yeah no it was pre-co Gap at a Creator Summit I think so yeah it so I first met him ages ago no I'm thinking like it might be closer to like seven is what I'm saying no I don't think so I don't think so dude seven years ago I wasn't cool enough to get invited to a Creator
Summit that's 2017 I know yeah no I didn't go to C no really yeah yeah no dude even when I even when I went I think it was 5 years ago I was like not a cool kid you know like the dude they're seriously like like massive personalities at these things with you know Global you know followings and huge Brands and like like dude uh I think that was around the time that like Dude Perfect was signing like deals with Nickelodeon you know and I'm like I hi I make I make Tech tips um I can fix your
computer do do you want some tech tips do you like computers stop all the download do it so got him so I um so I was just happy that you know cool kids like veritasium and Michael from Vsauce were even willing to like talk to me a little bit um that was that was exciting I never thought we'd collaborate and then this one just happened completely out of nowhere and I'm I'm so excited I think I think Derrick's great um thought the video was great really appreciated it I learned a bunch of stuff but that's why
it was a little weird and everything is okay we're okay everyone's okay uh what else we want to talk about this week you want to pick our next topic sure uh do you want to talk about Cloud flare Cloud flare has intro announced to not introduce announced a suite of tools called AI audit which allows website owners to monitor which Bots are crawling their site as well as giving them background on the Bots who owns them and what their purpose is for example scraping information for AI training cataloging
web pages which you know You' probably want them to do or collecting information for research users can also choose to block all Bots to block them based on purpose or to block them individually according to cloudflare users will eventually be able to sell access to their site to these Bots either with a flat rate or a scaled rate based on their purpose let's go Cloud flare yeah there it was actually kind of a good week for like Tech Giants doing pretty cool stuff doing big like Enterprise level stuff as
well well I don't know if it's in the dock but uh valve removed Force arbitration from their from their um their end user agreement is it not in the dock no that that that's okay I mean it's it was it's a huge thing the internet's very happy there's a huge thing but there's not a lot for us to say about it other than that that happened and that's super cool one of the only times ever that terms and conditions have changed and it's like oh wow that's good for the better yeah
that is freaking awesome uh there there was another big there was another big one this week actually why don't we why don't we jump right into one of our other kind of oh this is sick more exciting topics I am not positive show I am not necessarily the the biggest fan of you know regulation for the sake of Regulation and I actually had a really interesting conversation at Creator Summit with a small Creator who um uses YouTube shorts to promote their snack business like they they are only really on
YouTube because they made promotional videos for their like restaurant that they franchise out and they did really well and they they're like at Creator Summit I'm like okay well this will be a cool conversation because that's not an  before anyway um anyway so it was really cool but one of the things that he mentioned to me was that working in the Lone Star State you know uh opening up in Texas was like easy as pie and the the regulatory burden for like a small like snack franchise somewhere like
California he said was much higher and that it was very frustrating but you got to give California props once in a while because this this is cool is awesome California has passed AB 2426 a new law that forces digital storefronts to clearly state that they are only offering a digital license at the point of sale these companies Must List all restrictions on the license upfront including the fact that it can be revoked digital storefronts cannot imply that customers are buying a
product that they will own unless the end user can permanently download the product and use it offline indefinitely so good companies that fail to do this will be subject to a fine for false advertising because that's what it is and so they should be you do not buy games you don't own games you lease them in fact you don't even lease them because there isn't a clear term there isn't a clear term to the agreement you are what even is it it's not it's like month-to-month rental except buying a
temporary right or something right of access by I mean it's okay yes yes yes it's an access license I understand what it is I just mean the way that they phrased it in the past makes it sound like you are buying games you go on the valve what which tab is it what's labeled store right you go on the store that sounds like I'm buying a game does it not people are like you forgot GG no no we didn't I don't know what you're even talking talking about G get off it GG is great love go yes yes when you buy
a game from go that is a DRM free game that you download you are buying the game they're just not going to have to change anything yeah we're not talking about Gog we talk people will have to CH we're talking about literally everything  my goodness the sponsor of the bill assembly member Irwin cited Ubisoft deleting the crew from players accounts in April as an example of why the law was necessary absolute Chad nice move absolute Chad good moves s+ thank you for paying
attention to stuff that sucks and going well hold on a second is this a one-off or is this a systemic problem this is a system problem California also passed another law the phone-free school act which requires schools to limit student access to cell phones except in case of emergency or with the permission of a teacher administrator doctor or individualized education program for children with special needs this makes California the 15th state to have passed such a law I have got to say um there's
recently there's recently been a lot of movement on cell phone bands and schools here in Canada as well I'm kind of cool with it oh yeah I'm pretty glad that my kids by the time they hit High School are not just all going to be on their cell phones all day I genuinely think it's a huge deal like I I don't have kids but if I did I would that you know of oh my goodness if I did I would one success rate got to count for something very much hope that this would exist because I the the brain rot is so
intense um billions of dollars going into trying to corrupt your mind into never leaving a device is not something that you want flowing into the brain of a child like it's just I don't know and like I realize that we both literally sound but think of the children right now um but actually but these are these are things that at this point it's becoming fairly well documented have negative effects on still developing Minds hon it's it's a think of the everyone like this screws
over adults and stuff too right but like at a certain point you can't control them and they're not even really control they're just controlling them at school which like that makes sense anyways yeah what are you doing on your phone at school that you need your phone for theoretically nothing like school don't a lot of the classrooms have laptops and stuff now yeah depending depending probably yeah and if you need one it does yes yeah so like and if you don't need one then then it's not going to
then it doesn't need it yeah so you don't need your phone stop it's like I'm honestly surprised that they I'm I'm hon ly surprised that this took as long as it did I mean they would they would literally stop us from intercepting pieces of paper that we passed to each other so how how how I mean I guess it can get kind of complicated right you know oh was is my personal property you can't confiscate it from it but like that never stopped anyone from confiscating something from me I mean They
confiscated my Silly String when I sprayed that girl with it I think the rules changed yeah that was only because she was the daughter of a teacher though they wouldn't have done it for anyone else I got an in school suspension for Silly String who cares when I was in grade one I I was racing little boats down the stream that was at my school with my friends on lunch or recess or whatever and then I had my boat with me in class and I wasn't even playing with it I just had it with me and she took it
and she never gave it back which ever how dare she I will literally never get over this this will bother me forever the fact that she never gave it back is nuts his paper boat my Silly String in suspension scarred for life school's school's traumatic man it's traumatic I mean my dad was always telling me about the Catholic school and they they hit his knuckles with the ruler and everything I'm like Dad you had it easy brother you had it what about my Silly String oh man but no seriously I think it's good
um there's the there's the arguments of like oh yeah but you would have it on you as a tool um so like learning how to use it what yeah yeah you don't just immediately stop learning when you leave school either and like you'll get into the you will have no problem learning The Habit that your phone has answers to things outside of school yeah I'm really not worried about that I don't think that kids need to be trained to use their phone more yeah let's be let's be real not an issue bad argument uh one
thing I want to add is there was a bunch of cloud flare announcements actually and some some of the other ones are really cool one of the ones that I want to point out was tweeted out by Troy hunt um and shared to me by I think it was handyman um any relation to Mike you know Troy right you I'm just being an man uh uh rap Cloud for cloud play around your site and they can now automatically hit have I been pwn uh pwned passwords during a login attempt check it against our DB as in have I been pwned DB and
pass a request header to the origin if the password has been breached that's so cool actually super awesome really awesome if cloudflare could figure out their Enterprise support I would be very happy but your tools are great and have always been really awesome I like working with you very much no plans of ever canceling subscription so I'm putting myself in a bad negotiation position but yourent price support has always been a little bit questionable and it's really expensive so if you
could figure that out that I would that would be great thank you thank you very much sick um we should probably um update the sign what are we supposed to do next uh if you want next let's do a couple merch messages heck yeah I mean how many how many topics do we have to get through I mean we can we can backload them that's fine I think we're going to we already did three topics Dan I don't know I don't know what's going on I was doing math the whole time trying to figure out when I'm
supposed to end this show so we whatever we don't expect him to actually listen to us he just says we we only pay him enough to sit in the same room all right  take come on we got deadlines we got dying birds all right oh oh dude dude what the heck you better hope they're alive when he gets home well that's why I want to get him home otherwise they will they will be they'll be fine they're fine they're fine guess what's here cargo pants I I would like to take a moment to just point out that
these pants do not defy the laws of physics so you cannot fit a submarine in them oh um what well just there were some people upset about the size of the laptop somebody's going to upload a picture with like a Lego submarine in their pocket or lus lied again he was wrong this was wrong anyway get them boys the LT cargo pants are now here for your wearing is that you is that one you which one this one yeah yeah of course yeah for your for your wearing and viewing pleasure complete with Magnetic
pocket flaps Hammer Loops uh zipper back pockets YKK baby loads of carrying capacity with different sizes of either pass through so see these ones here are like passrs for pens or whatever else or regular Pockets um yeah we flip and love these we have spent a lot of time developing them there's uh like an army of internal people that absolutely swear by them tinan I don't think ever takes them off yeah he's always Andrew from the camera crew only rarely removes his uh I have been dailying these you've
probably seen them a lot in the videos in case you're wondering um this is how  so they definitely change in color a little bit but yeah I I actually really like the way they fade out yeah I was going to say if anything I think they might look better um anyway it's available now 21 Pockets gusseted crotch that allows for a wide range of motion darted dual layer knee pads that allow you to kneel in them comfortably they're great for everyday wear with a soft washed down
feel and available now at lm. g/c cargo pants now there is a slight controversy already because I'm addicted to it we only offer different way sizes and a 30in inseam at this time we are exploring alternate inseam lengths which is going to be good for taller boys yes yes Dan I hear you um but we need to see if we've let me put it this way we've never really had oh Luke you are standing in none of our camera views yeah but you can't see my feet anyways what a guy um there's no there's no
camera view that shows that yeah they can none of our cargo other website oh my goodness none of our lower half products have ever been particularly out of the park Grand Slam hits uh this one actually does look like it's going pretty well so far but we didn't want to overcommit um every additional inseam length adds another three four r 6 7 8 nine nine SKS um so we we would like to restock we have actually already done the work for 32 in and 34 in inseams inseam is crotch
to ankle right is that right if I recall correctly yes um I don't know so anyway yep we know and we're working on it and if these ones sell well then we will absolutely uh be looking to to do more yes the other thing that is finally here is the new spout lids for LTT water bottles are now available we cleared out all of the old ones hey hey new and improved spout lid V2 on every LT insulated water bottle easier to hold easier to clean more durable those are the main benefits and
I have a spout lid for myself to upgrade to right now oh look at that we've got a bunch of different colors how wonderful is that got to love it I think the water balls have been out for a while so now you can get them again uh yeah the packaging is plastic the reason is that these are from the same it's the same packaging we used on our old spout Lids that we had and we just forgot that we still used plastic packaging the last time we ordered these which was a long time ago we ordered like a ton of them
um and we never updated them on that we wanted new packaging that didn't have plastic so um we're sorry we've let you down that is our bad um anyway I want to do a quick demo of the durability of the new lid and this is either going to be a great moment in W show history is this an Elon Musk throws steel ball at at windshield dude we don't even need to go Elon Musk to find an example of an epic live fail when doing a product demonstration is this is this a a backpacked dual layer moment shank so uh
here we're going to go we're going to go Linus cam here so what are you you going to whack it against the table so you're going to you're going to notice that the threads are on the outside yes it feels a little funny on the lips but we felt that the Improvement in cleanability incredibly easy to clean now was worth was worth the uh was worth the slight uh you know issue there we have these little pull tabs those are awesome on our O-rings in the in the top one too yeah uh also also
in the top there's a little pull tab in there so you can pull the o rings out really clean them because guys you should pull them out and you should clean them on your water bottle on your thermos on everything it is disgusting the amount of Gunk that can get built up in these um you said it doesn't fit the old bottle right it does fit the old bottle fit the old bottle I don't think anyone said this is an old bottle ah the very very OG bottles the very very first order that we ever placed it fits them
but you got to screw them on like really tighter at Leakes they change the threading a little bit it won't affect pretty much anybody uh because anyone who upgraded to a new lid with those I talked to customer service about it they were like yeah basically anyone who complained about it we replac their bottles and like it's pretty much dealt with um anyway uh the other thing what what what's the other thing uh oh yeah so this stays in place real good um but the big one is that yeah what's
he going to do we have upgraded the durability of this handle here you're dripping on your laptop well you know what maybe you should have thought of that before you gave me a laptop okay so there's uh this one has like kind of a little like sharp spot the old one so the new one is nicely rounded so when you're when you're carrying it like this it doesn't like cut into your fingers that's what you mean um okay but the bigger difference is that plan hold on which way is uh which way
is tight the old one breaks about that easily okay that did in fact happen yep I thought that was the new one and I saw it instantly break when he did that and I was like oh boy yall ready for this yeah let me just hide the banner oh  cool that's that's hitting pretty hard that's harder than a drop let's go nice  oh goodness still good luk verify yeah yeah no wouldn't lie to you it's good it's good uh all right yeah there is I don't even think there's a mark So spout lid V2 there's probably a Merc on the
table is there yeah yeah yeah there's D all right well water bottle one I guess yep um so yeah cool there you go enjoy so uh right merch messages now's a great time to leave a merch message all you got to do is go to LTT store.com throw one of our great new water bottle V2 lid plus water bottles or just a lid in your cart and you'll see a little box pop up for Merch messages you can also check out the new cargo pants uh merch messages will go to producer Dan who will forward them to someone internally
respond to them himself sometimes incomprehensibly um or he curate them for me and Luke to respond to Dan do you want to show them how merch messages work yeah sure hey lonus I just got a kitten his name is Kirkland really excited since you have more cables than anyone how do you keep them from chewing on cables um you hope that your cat doesn't develop the habit of chewing on cables uh in all seriousness though you can buy um you can buy stuff that you kind of paint onto it that tastes really really
bad to them that is probably the best way to go about it uh you I mean you can also try like you keeping the little spritzer near and like giving them the old Spritz when they do something that they're really really not supposed to um but it's the the bitter stuff is probably your best bet to my dear lonus Lucan Dan the man I was wondering if any fixed uh fixed shaft screwdrivers were in development and if so what are the different challenges in design compared to the existing screwdrivers fixed craft fixed
craft it's hard to say fixed shaft screwdriver fixed shaft started development before Precision did um we had sort of this grand um concept of what it would look like where we would have like um uh blades and handles that were that were kind of stocked as as pieces and we would almost build to order so the idea was that uh we would have kind of like with our desk pads where it was like and our water bottles where it's one price and you kind of decide what size of one you need right
the idea was that we would just have a screwdriver price and then you could mix and match your blades and your handles so if you wanted like a giant you have giant hands and you wanted like a giant handle with like a little Phillips number one or something like that or you wanted some a long one or a short one um you'd essentially be able to get a screwdriver in any configuration that you wanted and if we could get the cold press fit right then it would have all the strength and like rigidity and
solidity of a fixed shaft screwdriver but with the flexibility of of a configurable screwdriver um we did a lot of development on that we we worked on a version of the handle that has like a rubberized over mold um I don't think that ever went to actual injection molding but we have like prototypes that feel pretty darn good uh we designed a bunch of different blades we worked out sort of you know exactly what they would be but where it kind of has stalled right now is a process for assembly and
the risk of stalking that many SKS so if you think about it Philips number two let's say you know for Computer Builders that's going to be one you're familiar with how many Philips number two blades do I need oh well hold on first how many handles do I need we wanted about we wanted five sizes we wanted um small um extra extra small small medium extra medium and large or something like that I forget I forget exactly what we called them but it was internal goof names like they weren't they weren't uh
customer ready of those micro medium of those we were going to do I think two shaft girths so the the two biggest sizes were going to be like a big boy or actually oh it might have been three I think it was three shaft girths so already for each handle we're going to need two molds or an insert mold um so that that adds a bit of complexity as well so like the big one you could do like a giant like slot number three right or you could do like a Phillips 2 and then the very smallest one you could
do like a tiny like triple triple Zer Phillips or you could do up to maybe like a Philips one right so you'd have these like three uh these three blade sizes and these five handle sizes and there's going to be you wouldn't be able to do like the smallest blade in the biggest handle or vice versa but there'd be some overlap there okay then we had to figure out all the different tip Styles right so a Phillips number two we were going to need at least probably two blades time however many lengths we want
to support So if you want like a stubby length a medium length and a long like a long boy then okay that's already what what is that like six blades for Philips number two and that's just that's just one that's just one tip um then we had to figure out a modular system for labeling the the cap because we wanted to be able to like put these into like a block kind of like knives um and and be able to easily see or just like some kind of screwdriver holder like a vertical one or angled one or whatever
uh we wanted to be able to to do like a modular labeling system essentially and we we came up with a system for that they were just going to be like silicone like like kind of butt plug shaped things and they would just kind of pop into the butt of the screwdriver the butt end like in the butt um they were like plugs and they go in the what you're making it dirty it's the butt of a screwdriver Dan around you danced around everything else you just went right in on that one oh yeah right  just
um did I did I already say the right okay so the other issue is the the workflow and product management issue of like how to just in time this um how to turn our what is right now mostly a warehousing operation that we work with into like like screwdriver assembly on site as well because for the regular screwdriver assembly is actually done at pH molds where they where they do the molding they they like warm fit them um so it pretty much is stalled we could just we could just do what other people
have done and just find a screwdriver set and just freaking I don't know like put our brand like silk screen our brand on it or whatever we could do that but we For Better or For Worse often approach a product and ask ourselves what are we adding to this category and if the answer is not really anything then we kind of think maybe we just shouldn't bother um we are currently exploring a new way to tackle like fixed is shaft screwdriver so it would be like a um a multi-bit screwdriver but where
you swap out the entire blade but what I told the team is look if it's not if there's any wubble then to me it isn't worth making like it's not a fixed shaft screwdriver competitor at that point so let's just not even bother uh but I think uh Robert from the engineering team at creater Warehouse has actually been making some good progress on that so um maybe we'll have something to share with you guys in the next like 6 to 12 months but don't hold your breath if you need a screwdriver go buy a
screwdriver brother like I'm not going to not going to tell you it's going to be like God's gift to screwdrivers it's it's if we bring something out it'll be great because otherwise why would we bother making it but yeah um don't deprive yourself of screwdriver ownership on my Accord uh the last thing that I'm supposed to cover for for the um for the LT announcements period of the show is modmat signups we're getting closer to finally launching modmat so we just want to remind you that if you want
to get notified the moment it drops you can sign up at lg. g/m modmat it's going to be affordable it's going to be extremely high quality I think you guys are going to be really really impressed by it and I am based on how the last couple launches have gone with the Scribe driver and the Precision if you aren't on the email list you're not getting one we should if if that's going to be the we might want to just order more stuff um we're having some conversations internally around our stocking strategy
I think um I think that um the pendulum had swung pretty far toward ordering a lot of stuff and then struggling to sell through it in a reasonable amount of time because unlike a lot of retail operations ours is not entirely uh self-contained uh it has convenient access to Media Empire cache that it can just kind of use whenever it needs it so it has it had gotten kind of fast and loose with how much inventory it was allowed to carry um so you know since Taran came on one of his major priorities has been
taking care of dead and aging inventory um so we have freed up a lot of cash with uh lime day and there was another promo that we did last Black Friday Cyber Monday uh so we we freed up a lot of cash so we actually have a lot of stuff on order right now and we're going to be flush with inventory and and more inventory of the right things but I think in the interim the pendulum might have swung a little too far the other way and we were being very conservative about our order quantities and this is
just one of those things that you know look we aren't your local retailer who is taking an inventory from their Regional distributor who is taking an inventory from their um you know country distributor who is taking an inventory from the manufacturer and there's and there's a well-developed supply chain here that has enough excess at each stage to help smooth out any any bumps so that nobody gaps out right and and even then things Gap out like Intel has a controversy with 13th 14th gen and
they're out of stock everywhere nobody nobody can get one like it happens even to companies that have been doing this for decades we haven't so and we don't have the benefit of of of these additional layers of the supply chain to help us smoth things out we are ordering directly from factories we are creating custom products it's not like when when we don't have uh Precision screwdrivers uh we can just like Source another one and swap it into our bit sets and ship them no we we have to get them made we
have to get them machined we have to Source all the pieces individually it's um it's it's complicated and so when we Gap out we tend to Gap out really hard because it could be a 3 four month turnaround in order to get everything together get it all assembled and and bring it into the store so we're we're going to we're going to be working on that we're going to we're going to do a better job for you guys but in the meantime sign up for a notification from modmat if you want one because otherwise
you might not get one we ordered these a while back okay this says don't read the title read the first point good job we have a very special message from our very own Riley let's watch um are you doing this you're already playing audio so pause it from somewhere else uh yes I will I will do that and I made sure it worked this week wow Dan I did the bare minimum Yay good job good job no I think I think that goes beyond bare minimum I think that's minimum not be that's a clothed 
you okay are we doing this I was just goingon to let it kind of hang here awkwardly we don't have to do that we could we could no it's fun all right here we go okay so if you play that they should hear it you should hear it back flip watch this whoa that was gnarly hey you want what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] just happened I have told that guy so many  work it was off hours don't worry about it I think do you know I think makes it okay he has disclosed this publicly he has had like so many concussions every
time he's like lonus I can do a backflip I'm going to do a backflip I want to do a backflip on stream I'm going to do that I'm like no no I don't I it is not worth the damage you could do to your brain how did you allow this to happen uh that was not during work hour it doesn't matter don't encourage this Behavior do you know what happened last time he fell down the stairs I don't know he missed work for like 2 months but then he blew up now he's beloved boy that is not the
point what's your takeaway from that it  edit sorry okay there you go guys hurting yourself at work uh is a path to fame here no I don't know that's what he made it sound like yes yeah no I do not approve of this anyway let's just finish the thing want to learn more fun facts about me tune in to float plane for Riley week  Clips got to get the blood up the core issue with Star Wars today as I see it is that it's struggling to change itself how is your Tim Cook impression so good
I don't know the ship is not moving shoot the ship what does being a minimalist actually mean I'm going to be so loud I'm going to be so  mom uh-oh you keep my mom's name out your wow those were great you want more subscribe to float plane I'm talking to you lonus what I'm sub I'm subscribed to  plane not technically well yeah I think I'm subscribed enough yeah think when I think when you sign the checks to the development team you're effectively subscribed I don't think so actually all
right for those of you who don't know what people weeks are it's when we dedicate a week of float plane exclusives to one person with the addition of an extra float plane exclusive so that's three extras rather than the usual two a week uh Riley week concludes an 18-minute Star Wars rant office interviews and answering your very own questions about Riley can you guess which one was his idea 18-minute Star Wars rant oh yeah I like how they put a Time on it cuz Riley spent an immense amount of
time writing his Star Wars rant it was six pages so please give him love and support by going to lm. gly24 what does that do uh I have no idea all right Dan hit us with a topic you know what Luke hit us with a topic I'm going to interject here I got a message from Sammy uh float plane wallpapers are currently unlisted how you want we'll talk about them later distribute them we'll talk them ler as long as it's in your brain another another topic yeah uh yeah okay uh what do you want to talk about Luke
YouTube premium prices are on the rise a it was such a good positive show so far um okay okay let's go with something else Intel lunar Lake uh no it's actually no it actually looks very promising yeah yeah multiple Outlets have now benchmarked in's core Ultra Series 2 or lunar Lake CPUs at least the ultra 7 258 V unintelligible product names aside insane the performance appears to fall behind amd's topend ryzen AI 9 HX 370 but it is worth noting that this isn't the most performant lunar Lake
skew that would be the ultr 9288 V but Intel didn't send that one out for comparison testing despite this the arc graphics 140v igpu is apparently both faster and more efficient than the ryzen radi or than ryzen's rad oh God what' you do than ryzen's radon 890m according to notebook check that is only a little bit exciting um you know I personally don't necessarily need you know 8% faster mobile I mean I won't say no to it that's fantastic but what that what actually makes me excited about that is
maybe battle mage Won't Suck oh maybe battle mage medicated Won't Suck maybe Nvidia L some pressure on them come on come on I I really need arc graphics to be good and the other thing is that the battery life apparently Rivals that of the snap dragon laptops they've tested PC World ran it through their standard video rundown test looping a 4K video at fixed brightness and lunter Lake lasted 21 hours on a 73w hour   you framework investment aside I never stopped using my Qualcomm
laptop like dude I love watch this watch  trick yeah just wait just wait wait it's a good magic trick it's a good trick okay watch wait for it exciting trick it's not a very fast look at that it it's not about the speed it's about the quality of the trick I'm a   trick look at that my battery isn't dead yeah dude if you were me if you were me okay this needs so much more story around it this trick of yours if you were me okay you would know that any other laptop in my backpack if I pulled it out it would be
dead oh okay because I am really bad about charging it and um I just when I'm using it I just like leave it on for long periods of time because I'll be like referring back to it for notes and so it'll just my laptop is just always dead except this laptop this laptop always alive I love it it's amazing I just have my same like very old at this point laptop that I just drag the cable around everywhere for and plug in in every room I go to dude it's awesome MacBook battery life is a game
Cher and I would have loved to enjoy it for the last few years except I just can't Mac OS I'm I'm I just I I just can't like and the funny thing is I think that that was only because the last time I tried or thought about it it was like 3 or 4 years ago now I probably could Mac OS because pretty much everything I do has transitioned has transitioned to a browser in fact I was kind of thinking my next challenge might be a Chromebook challenge oh I I I have never I have never really given chrom OS a daily
driver treatment like a real Fair shake and these days is like yeah I'm using Windows but I'm using Windows with limited compatibility if I'm going to use something with limited compatibility I might as well open up my horizons to Mac or Linux or Chrome OS not Linux yet I'm waiting for Steam OS I want Steam OS before I um Linux again Chromebooks are what the heck  dude I mean part of that is because they just use cheaper crappier Hardware yeah but still like a hundred bucks yeah I
mean that's refurbished that's refurbished come on but still Yes actually noticed that part you're not is that the new like fund name for refurbished is that what that is yeah wow it's renewed it it was it it wasn't new but now it is renewed it's new again um that's that shouldn't have been allowed anyway in other news for Intel the company released another mic code update to protect Raptor Lake CPUs from crashing specifically it prevents the CPU from asking for too much power when it's
sitting idle or performing light tasks um so yeah well good luck for them I wish them luck with all of those things I'm I'm actually pretty I'm pretty H I know it's stupid and and it and it maybe uh maybe it's no it's not stupid I know that it doesn't affect me personally because realistically I'm going to I'm going to go for a 5080 or a 5090 this next gen I I swore I wouldn't go 40 series and I didn't um but I am still running 30 series or AMD and I am I'm I'm ready battle mage I'm ready I
don't think there's going to be a high-end skew and I would I would like a high I we shot a sponsored video this week and again you know investment sponsorship whatever all of that aside I  OLED so good so good dude so I I want a faster GPU I would like a faster GPU so that I can enjoy more of that that super high refresh rate high frame rate goodness um and I'll probably upgrade my CPU too even though I've already got a 79 50x like I'm I'm probably going to want to go x3d what I'm hoping is that 50 Series
and 9000 x3d will drop it around the same time or I mean well yeah when is uh when is core Ultra 2 or whatever when when is the desktop core Ultra rumored to be landing anyway I haven't checked lately but I'm kind of hoping it'll all line up handyman is saying that there's 5090 leaks oh yeah oh yeah it's supposed to be like we don't really do leaks on Wow anymore I don't know if you guys noticed that we don't really like do rumor Miller leaks but I don't even know that yeah well I mean we
don't yeah you're not wrong it's just cuz we don't care like we can talk about it once it's out pretty true and of the time the problem with us reporting on leaks is that we would like know so it created AIT little muddy trying to remember what you read online versus what you were told yeah and knowing where the line is it is a little sketch I don't know anything firsthand about 90 though so what I heard is that it's supposed to be 600 watts uh but but a real a real daddy chip though so 512 bit
bus 32 gigs gddr 7 that's that's the current rumor but they going to put real power cables into it uh yeah no it's probably still going to be I heard they might even do two of the High Vol voltage power Connors so we'll see how that  today uh did we actually do all the announcements I don't think we did did we do but let's give them a break from announcements there's a lot of announcements this week cool uh us bands Chinese cars and kasperski becomes the malware uh the current White House
Administration is planning to ban certain hardware and software made in China and Russia from Vehicles due to the risks of surveillance and sabotage the official press release expresses concern that foreign adversaries could gather information on both American citizens and critical infrastructure valid perhaps to disrupt the operations of said infrastructure valid The Proposal specifically mentions Banning automated Driving Systems suggesting the White House spars Vehicles themselves could be used for
possible sabotage um somebody watched a little bit of Fast and the Furious uh around the same time Russian cyber security company kasperski uh started uninstalling its antivirus software from American computers to comply with its own us ban but the company also installed a different antivirus software on said computers while kasperski did tell customers via email their existing subscriptions would be transferred to Alternative antivirus software Ultra AV users claimed the auto installation
wasn't mentioned however Pango group owner of ultra AV claims that kasperski communicated the transition to users starting on September 5th including an inapp popup stating Ultra AV protection will be automatically activated on your device which uh I would immediately think that my computer had been oh yeah hacked to all heck 100% Ultra AV protection doesn't even sound like uh like a real thing no not at all like I I'm I'm sure it is but it's not what we use and we have a team of people who
determines what antivirus we use so that's not something I've looked into a lot personally I'm just saying that if you don't follow you know the antivirus industry that could easily sound like a yeah that sounds like fake to be fair a few of them do sound kind of fake um yeah this is true so some strike dude do you know Sentinel one they're all like so intense do you know how many years I called uh um h no never mind go ahead ninja one and Sentinel one also piing from two different companies
blows my mind constantly anyways um some VI says I'm Pro it and I've never heard of it so I don't even feel that bad yeah uh some users were especially freaked out because after using a third party uninstaller app to completely remove Ultra AV it just re installed itself after they rebooted wow very cool that is actual malware very cool that is the definition of malware something that installs itself without user intervention and without user consent I mean is that not malware well
it could be a form like in in their defense it could be a form of like it said a third-party uninstaller app right  defense if you're an antivirus do you want third party uninstaller apps to be able to uninstall you yeah probably not yes I I will I will in their defense I will put that out there like if you use the actual uninstaller I'd still be freaked out yes 100% but I think I kind of get it especially if I knew anything about like you know kasperski and the whole
situation that's gone down with them and why they like aren't allowed in the United States anymore and stuff just just the whole thing feeling sketchy you know yeah yeah okay um there's a yeah there's a there's a work conversation buried in there somewhere but we'll deal with that another time um reboot remaster update yeah we could talk about that did we talk about that on the show Dan I don't think so it was a topic for last week but we didn't get to it so it's continued into this week
that's right okay let's talk about it um we have been in the background uh providing a little bit of assistance don't want to give ourselves credit for the restoration because that goes to other people but we've been trying to help uh we've been trying to help mark from disappearing Inc and the reboot rewind documentary team with their project to create highquality versions of the classic 1994 CGI TV series reboot a few months ago we reached out to the community for help getting the D1
machines in their possession running they have since given us an update on their progress and some side by-side comparison screenshots they have one of three D1 machines running and they have captured a few of the 200 plus tapes the tapes do require some tender love and care because the magnetic media is showing signs of degradation which is a good reminder of how physical media will degrade over time and modernization is always an ongoing effort uh we have sourced and now possess a full schematic set and
user manual huge thanks to the community for all the leads and a good reminder to support archival sites and the tapes and the contents are still the property of the original Studio Mainframe so the captured results are released as approved by Mainframe this is their intellectual property but we do have some comparison images that I would be happy to show with to you guys check  go Dam do the slider do the slider slider it's a slider oh yeah here we go here we go here we go it's insanely better d
wow this is what the artist this is what the artist created this is what 1994 technology could do via broadcast dude dude they look that is so sick they look so good that's wicked dude dude dude dude stuff like this like look how sharp that is look how sharp that is I need I need to rewatch this here's the first remastered episode on YouTube hopefully we don't get in trouble for this because like please don't like we I swear we did help a little bit we didn't do that much but we
did help a little bit so please don't dude even me watching through YouTube and you guys watching through my crappy stream you guys are going to be able to  better absolutely sick yeah yeah it's an HD um oh so exciting we are we are extremely happy to be even a small part of this restoration effort so massive shout out to the reboot rewind documentary team and mark from disappearing Inc what else we got for this week Mr Luke do you want to do a couple oh no iPhone it's time for me to get mad oh um
it was brought to our attention so shout out to the subreddit that ghost keyboards uh used a photo of me alongside a falsely attributed quote endorsing their product I'm actually just going to try and find um let me see if I can track this down here it is I can get it in the dock if you need okay got this ad from Ghost keyboards uh so this um best keyboard I have ever used with like kind of you know creepy mustache Photoshop thing this is from this is a capture from Elijah's AMD ult
Tech upgrade and they are promoting this uh this keyboard and they did a sale on it or whatever else so here's the situation if this was just like a meme and obviously fake and just post it on their Instagram which they did they did also post it on Instagram that would be one thing um in my opinion it was not obviously enough fake for one thing um for another thing the quote okay if it was just the image it's already our intellectual property being used for commercial purposes that is that is
absolutely not fair use um the quote makes it much worse because not only in that video did I not say it was the best keyboard I had ever used I advocated against buying it and I discussed with Elijah that I felt that it was not very good quality for the money so that's issue number two issue number three is that aside from them posting it as a meme on their Instagram or whatever else there was a clear call to action for people to purchase this keyboard based on the image and issue number four is
that it was also sent soliciting members of their email mailing list to buy the key or to yeah to purchase the key keyboard This goes so far beyond sort of we didn't know better or like uh engagement bait or Community engagement or or or you know soft collaboration or whatever the case may be um I know that there's a number of people internally who thought it was funny I didn't think it was funny I think that if it was clearly marked that I did not think the keyboard was a good value I did not think that it
was something that people should buy and if they were kind of meing on that lus says don't buy this keyboard uh we disagree buy it whatever else there was potentially angles where this could kind of work at the very least we should have gotten a heads up we didn't it just appeared um not cool they have have done at least one thing right since then um Colton reached out to them via LinkedIn I believe uh they apologized and they have removed the post from Instagram um I personally
think there should be a public retraction and a correction of the record I would like to see that happen um oh it's ghost keyboards those of you asking who exactly this was um at this point you know if that does happen then I'm not going to I'm not going to threaten any form of legal action or whatever else it is they've already removed the offending material however I consider this a pretty solid First Strike here and I don't think we'd be open to collaborating with them in any
way any form until they have publicly set the record straight on this um not  cool what else we got uh iPhones are like repairable or something dude that's really cool iPhone 16 got a 7 out of 10 repairability score for my Fixit that's crazy Apple has launched its iPhone 16 lineup which has demonstrated a significant improvement over the iPhone 15 in terms of repairability I thinks it has given the 16 and 16 plus a rating of 7 out of 10 compared to the four out of 10 that it gave to their predecessors
it's an actually like enormous jump uh perhaps the most notable change is to the device's battery adhesive this adhesive debonds on command this is so cool this is genuinely very cool when an electric current is run through it it's so cool dude sorry sorry I interrupted no it's fine no I'm going to interrupt okay I get so angry when I see apple Reinventing the wheel just to like screw people over this is sick just to make the device incompatible with a third party you know version that costs a
third as much you know Apple has colossal Monumental enormous engineering resources at their disposal and when they use it to work against the interests of the consumer it drives me absolutely crazy because this is what they could have been doing that is so cool so cool that is so cool okay go ahead while this will AC require users to acquire a new tool allows for clean easily rep uh a clean easily repeatable process for removing the battery that limits the potential for unintentional damage during repair
and it makes it safer those those Pillow batteries they can be extremely dangerous if they're bent too much or they're punctured if they're punctured this improves safety not just not for the user this time it's for the technician it's it's out of consideration of the people who work on these bloody things apparently good job Apple apparently the adhesive tape is a product but I don't care it doesn't really matter cool they integrated it into their device they did the validation they did they did the work
it's done it's in the product it benefits the user I love it the removal process is similar to jumping a car battery and requires a pair of alligator clip leads attached to a 12 to 30 volt power source the user attaches the black cable to a grounding screw near the phone's charging port then attaches the red cable to a special tab on the battery really the the current will cause a chemical reaction that debonds the adhesive and allows the battery to easily detach from the device after
around a minute and a half these batteries also use a hard steel case instead of a soft pouch reducing the possibility of puncturing the battery also cool dude are we are we on the timeline where Apple goes back to like like battery packs I mean we're slowly making our way there I'd be down with it um there's so many times that like I catch myself constantly walking around my phone Tethered to a battery Bank it apparently works with lower voltages you can just use a 9vt battery and just if
you can do that then you don't really need a special tool so cool yeah so cool which is awesome the um the pros battery doesn't feature the new adhesive but does but does have the steel case the pro Max has no battery improvements really probably because they stuffed as much battery in as possible that thing gets 27 hours of video playback holy crap yeah um so okay nonetheless both now incorporate the Dual entry design that debuted with the iPhone 14 which allows the phone to be
opened from the front or the back which allows many repairs to avoid removing the fragile screen which is cool iOS 18 also has a new repair assistant while the feature is currently a little buggy it allows users to independently calibrate replacement parts so that the device will recognize them that's cool that is cool the company is also making device repairs Easier by no longer requiring the device's serial number in some cases adding a section of settings that shows users the history of the
devices parts and repairs that's cool yeah why not um it's also introducing an anti- theft uh feature to block the repair if the new part was from a phone that had been reported as lost or stolen I'm also down with that start off with apple just you know fixing its own problem that it created and then ended pretty cool yeah if they can actually enforce this I mean that's the thing about you know sleazy you know Black Market people is they're going to find a way around this but arms race hey you know what I
this overall seems like what they're doing is uh good yes and and in in to the benefit of their customer rather than just to milk their customer I I mean they they are going to milk you but they're going to at least milk you to your  milking uh what are we supposed to be talking about should we should we talk about the last oh my God we haven't done sponsors yet okay the show is brought to you by remotely being the only person with tech knowledge in your family can be a super obnoxious thing when Grandma

trying them now yeah um on the topic of oh no here it comes no I was going to say that for later oh all right oh fine  Outlaws last week those of you who don't have the context last week Luke was like oh yeah why last week I think so why is everybody hating so hard on this I fired it up and I went around the like opening area and it seems pretty good and I logged off and then this week he showed up on W show set he goes I logged back in and I'm bored the lockpicking mechanic is
amazing I will die on that Hill the lockpicking mechanic is incredible it's the best one I've ever ran into in a game ever personally it's great and then you start needing to do more stuff in the game at all and it's like uh okay I'm done I don't know it's like it's it's very much you know that old like meme about MMOs where they're like ah yes but here's a new Quest get me that book across the room and then you have to walk over and grab it and bring it back it's very much like like why
don't you use the force to get it yeah you jackass yeah it's just like I don't know it's uh I don't think it's as bad as most people are saying but it's I don't know it's okay cool that's a ringing endorsement it's fine for a like 7080 game yeah I mean it's better than uh better than a lot of other Star Wars stuff coming out a  endorsement uh but yeah I don't know um get the saach cheats if you haven't already what I'm probably going to do now is not launch it again uninstall it best
mod just I've got other things going on I don't have the time for for games that are all right right now unfortunately um but yeah I don't know maybe I'll play it again someday but yeah you probably won't how's Final Fantasy 6 going good enjoying it more than than what is it even called Outlaws yeah oh how far are you now uh where am I thanks for helping me keep him accountable I finished all of my stuff like a year ago so much less stuff to do like a year ago though that's fair dude you've had so
long like you're at this rate you're going to take longer to beat it than I did and I took like 10 years cuz I first got it when I was like six I um I have free use of the Airship I was older I was older than that now and uh we we just went through the long series of effectively cinematics they're not technically but effectively cinematics of of you talking to the man what are they called again espers you see the esper like Realm and the you make you make a baby oh yeah you do and you you
like go through all those steps and then I have free use of the Airship and right now I'm trying not to like you know just Google everything so they're like yeah go to that place I'm like where is you got the map I gave you the map I do he's got the paper map from my physical copy of the game I think based on that I figured out where it was flew over there landed the ship and then logged off for there yeah okay so that's where I'm at so I haven't actually entered the place
to figure out if I actually did find it or not but I I I don't know educated guess okay so who's your who's your Mains um what is this name okay so the the trader chick that has Ric power I'm not going to remember anything no I'm kidding SS is great okay yeah she's one of them um the the guy that has the what is it Blitz moves yeah SA he's my favorite one so far I really like the whatever the one is that sends a bunch of him across the screen when they're on fire oh fire dance yeah yeah that one's
great I don't think it's actually called that in this no it's not I'm I'm like some of the characters names are even different so I'm going original like SNES Final Fantasy 3 and he's talking Final Fantasy yeah yeah um and then the other one is he uses tools and he has autoc crossbow yeah Edgar yeah so those are the four I tend to run that was four well and then wait I think that was three that was three so then who's Myas that one oh and the thief guy but he's like sucks oh but why do you m him
then I don't man him he's been with me for a while now because of how the story's been going I see okay yeah yeah yeah okay um don't don't don't tell him you guys don't tell him oh I'm assuming he like gets good or something I try to steal all the time it never does anything but I'm like I want to try so I I try at least one version of like every mob that I fight I will try to steal from I think it's worked once the whole game oh dude stealing from mobs is a complete waste
of time what is don't even bother they never have anything good they never have anything yeah that too like yeah why can you even do it there's the occasional one that's good like the fossil fangs you can steal uh I think is I think it's like elixir or something from them okay um as as long as you can get it before they like zombie your whole party and you just die there's like there's stuff that's good to steal from but for the most part it's a waste of time I just I'm trying to be very
thorough so like I think I told you in in that one town near the beginning of the game I was trying to figure out like you know you you bring the guy alcohol and then he lets you do whatever blah blah blah blah blah and it turns out I was doing it like too early you're supposed to do it the next time you come back or whatever so I'm like I'm trying to be very thorough I'm talking to everybody I'm doing everything so I don't want to miss something because I didn't try to
steal so I'm just every combat all right almost you know when you when I run into a repeat I don't do it again yeah okay okay but nice all right well glad you're enjoying it it is it is truly one of my favorite games of all time yeah it's been it's been good you've played Chrono Trigger right no oh my  um um I had a really good chat with Carl Jacobs at Creator Summit yeah he is an appreciator of quality games I I don't know I think I would trust him for game recommendations over you I'm sorry but
you just you you're not familiar enough with the classics did you like Titanfall yes I did two Titanfall 2 he he made me play the single player campaign all right um yeah what was the question oh yeah okay okay Dan carry on have it star Star Wars how how like how like Star Wars hello lldd will there be at any point an LTD belt for the    oh that was perfectly timed I don't know how we did that I want one so bad the answer is no oh uh we have not been able to find a supply
that meets my standards for like I was excited cracking and uh and or delamination and part of this might just be the nature of leather goods but um I it's just it's this like it's this like top plasticky layer that basically everyone in their dog wants to put on them and I think we ended up trying like between four and six different suppliers just looking for someone who who could give me something that was just a big old thick piece of cod you know like just just that nothing else and nobody
could do it and yeah cuz like if you look at it it's just like it's a mess oh yeah know I can tell and this is the kind of thing that I just I wouldn't be I wouldn't be comfortable selling buddy from the island that made us these is probably screaming right now yeah I mean I'm sure if we wanted to like you know Artisan you know make way too expensive per Bel 23 belts um sell 23 belts a year or whatever like I'm sure we could figure it out but uh no you just need to get natural leather not finished leather
well make them out of metal like a watch band maybe we'll figure it out another time but the other thing is like back to our conversation earlier about how one of the things that we look for in any category is you know what are we adding to the conversation and I couldn't figure out what we were adding to the conversation if like strapo leather already exists um like my my old Kirkland belt lasted a really long time do I really want to go toe-to-toe with Costco maybe not what about shirts shirts yeah our
shirts are great yeah yeah make a great belt oh well yeah well we haven't found the right great supplier yet just saying that doesn't mean you can just never do belts you're right you're right and and if we succeed at pants for the first time ever maybe there's then maybe we will look at belts sure that's reasonable that's very reasonable so far cargo pants are looking like they are going to be a success um and if that happens then yeah we want to we want to do more inseams we
want to we want to do sure yeah belts uh yeah no I know they're they're a little short on you yep yep duly noted I get it um the good news is is we've so far sold through um probably about a fifth of our inventory so nice yeah we we might move through them all in which case yeah we might be able to restock some other sizes cool all right how about one more what do we got here sure hit me Dan hey dlll I wanted to order a dual sense 30th Anniversary controller this week but they sold out apparently mostly to
scalpers what can companies like Sony do to combat this relatively shitty Behavior hey Dan I'm sorry I just read  fault whoops ah  gray what just gray what if you just got it has it comes with a cool cable dang it oh it come look scroll down see if  cable uh where's the cool charging cable I thought it comes with a cool charging cable there's a whole conversation internally about this uh I thought it comes with a cool USBC cable oh wait cable not included seriously okay well what happened to the
cool cable just just go get a gray skin for your controller I mean sorry it's PS1 gray I'm sure somebody sells PS1 gray skins probably I don't know dude I um this is one of those things where and you know what yeah the behavior like sucks people who actually want it should be the ones who have it totally but also it is very difficult to stop yeah I mean we tried and I actually think we did a really great job did PR right but it wasn't perfect and you know for example one of the things that was pointed out
about the verified actual gamer program uh where we had people like play a game essentially as like the ultimate recapture to prove that you were not only a human but a gamer one of the things that was pointed out to us after the first few of them was it's not really accessible you know someone could be a gamer but like not be able to interface game yeah interface with their computer that way and we're like okay shoot I'm like what do you do to be accessible enough for every person but also not
easily defeated by by a program right it's it's really really challenging and I I guess it kind of is what it is and the good news is that it is a 30th Anniversary controller it is not water um yeah you'll be all right yeah it's and I understand people are educating me apparently the the the buttons are colored and they're not always colored uh sometimes their gray controller looks like that and now it look looks like that cuz the buttons are colored but uh guys you're not going to convince Luke with 
okay yeah I just I don't know man oh I was expecting it to be like Wicked and then when you were like oh it's the cable I was like okay this is going to be sick and then it's gray the cable's pretty cool here let me see if I can find this here look who's not nostalgic no I am it's just okay that is pretty cool yeah so it's a us more than the controller so yeah it comes with the the console that yeah  that but this is this is a toy you know it's an expensive toy for adults but it but it's a toy and I um
it's not even a toy that provides access because you can just have any other controller like it's not like you know when when ps5s themselves were being scalped and no one could get a PS5 yeah like to be clear I like cool controllers yeah me too I I I really do like I my my favorite of my my Xbox controllers of which I own probably somewhere between a dozen and 15 yeah um is the the one that went out to the people who developed the console a handful of them flipped them
and uh you know what I paid way too much money for that controller um but realistically it was a fraction of what  so it's a it's a bit of an investment yeah if anyone wants to buy a golden Xbox controller by the way the previous buyer flaked so uh you know get in touch he gold flaked it's very much for sale didn't you want that Gears of War Xbox controller yeah and I I got it yeah but just like I don't know it but the Gears of War Xbox controller has like claw marks in the controller that go
into the plastic like they actually did a different mold for it at least yeah so that's something this is this it is a cool controller it has the Retro PlayStation logo with the with the colors on it stuff like that that they should have never ditched Etc but it's also it's just a great controller okay I mean okay so confirm pre-order so you have to pay $150 on top of the like $80 it is for the controller or whatever on top of yeah I would assume so really confirmed order yeah are you
buying an order you're buying or are you buying the controller oh apparently that uh that uh gears one was um laser edged so okay either way like they're doing it was different it was cool is this just like Nostalgia baiting yeah oh it's dude it's 100% Nostalgia baiting yeah 100% so you got and it's sick if you were going to buy buy a controller anyways this is a cool controller to buy but if you pay a bunch of money you're getting Nostalgia baited yeah Nostalgia baited I got it it's
pretty good yeah pretty good I was reaching for it I was reaching for it a little bit all right we got a couple more topics here why don't we talk about um the Concord controller is cooler than the game was that looks pretty neat kind of funny that they're selling  why don't we talk about our friend in the industry ah yes the big controversy this week the one the only MKBHD released a wallpaper app um for your phone okay IOS and Android and a significant portion of the community was quite let's say put
out yeah um about this situation their rbls were roused this is one of those things where you know honestly speaking guys I um you know I'm not going to comment on the business decisions of you know a fellow Creator um but what I will say is it was very clear that the community was not happy about the option for a $50 a year premium subscription um that effectively pay walled the the maximum quality of these wallpapers um for people who were not um interested in that there was also some some upset
around some of the requested permissions of the particular app um there was some some commentary and some observations around the quality of the app yeah um I believe that it turned out is is is it true that it was functionally just linking to a shared Google drive it was it so it was a it was a fire download server but there was no authentication on it so anyone could just download it and people set up Bots to scrape it cuz they were talking about how they were going to do like you know
I don't remember exactly the detail so I'm sorry but like some type of part of the idea of the subscription is that they were going to drop new like artist packs and and things like that so you could get new wallpapers all the time so people set up Bots that were scraping it which because they never signed any type of agreement or anything technically they didn't technically even buy pass anything it's technically legal then yeah um there was also some upset about the revenue share which from my
understanding was 5050 um and then even going into the hours leading up to this show there has been some upset that um Marquez himself didn't really properly address the community's concerns on the latest waveform podcast so that's kind of the summary that um that I think that's probably the best summary I can give you guys of of why people are upset um I'll give sort of a short Devil's Advocate argument here at least they're not nfts yeah yeah honestly they they did give you just a
straight up download of the I think the word scam is one that gets overused a lot these days I saw a lot of people describe the wallpaper app as a scam what it is not a scam what is is for a lot of people probably not a great value what it isn't is a scam it communicates pretty clearly what you're going to get and what it what you're going to give up yeah and if that's a value proposition that is acceptable to you then it's not a SC then you are more than welcome to pay it and if that is
not a value proposition then you are more than welcome to not pay it that is not a scam a scam is representing something as something that it isn't a scam would be if I said um go to LT store right now and every order comes with a free this um secret skin that I have on the back of my phone uh and then it just I'm still wondering about and then it just didn't arrive yeah that would be a scam yeah it isn't a scam um hll stof says but Linus is there a line where something is bad enough value that
it becomes a scam no that is not what scam means scam means that you have been deceived you have not been deceived you are getting image files you are sending money and permissions on your phone those things are all disclosed therefore it is not a scam it's not your thing it's not your B baby but it isn't a scam that kind of make sense no some people don't see some people don't seem to understand  um I looked up scam a fraudulent or deceptive act or operation vinan says by
"the same argument $1,000 HDMI cables are" not a scam well they can or they can't be if they claim to give you better audio quality or better video quality do then they are a scam because they don't do that if they are just expensive and they literally just say there are $1 thousand HDMI cables that make you feel a warm feeling inside for being able to afford them when other people can't then that's not a scam I am I I I I this shouldn't this really shouldn't surprise me that much given how many people I
mean I started this segment with a lot of people seem to misuse the word scam so I really shouldn't be that confused that a lot of people don't know what it means but that that's not what scam means scam is fraud scam is lying nobody lied nobody scammed anybody um nobody's money was was removed forcefully with against their will um so it's not a scam would I charge a $50 subscription for wallpaper images I was about to say yes you know what sure let's do it new announcing now
here on the WAN show now available at  is the LTT wallpaper pack I'm going to can I can I show the CMS is is that okay can I show the CMS that's fine right uh I think I just I'm going to show the CMS uh it'll be fine it'll be fine you'll like it okay I'm showing the CMS right now going live for LTT um sorry LTT supporter OG and LTT supporter and just text posts going live only for LT supporter plus which is available for $10 a month or $50 a year you said earlier in the show that you're going to
do the $5 one cuz it's I think you did oh wait oh yeah no no that's right SC scam no no I did the math wrong he almost scamm I did the mouth wrong but no you got to do you got to do OG as well no I don't oh but they're supposed to get everything no they only get everything that we originally promised them this is new this is net new scam radar no no no no all right tell you what fine sure you will get these wallpapers created this actually looks like all Sarah's stuff uh I believe this is all
Sarah they just kind of scramble yeah they just they threw this together they threw this together in the minutes before the show you will be able to get all of these wallpapers all you have to do is sign up for float plane at at least our $5 a month or $50 a year tier yeah there you go yeah let's see let's see let's watch people turn this into Linus's scamming his audience I'm I'm excited for it oh man they did a dead pixel one yeah dog the dead pixel one one could be used LTT
phone wallpapers for floaties let's go woo look at that wow what a wallpaper yeah dead pixel um that's that's that's on purpose I was expecting these to be garbage these are actually pretty cool what did you just say what did you just say about the valued member of our team no I wasn't sure how hard you were going to me like you know when we were doing those sales and it's 9:00 p.m. and nickl light's only there and he goes like he draws a stick figure like more orange shirts no this is like I was
surprised at how fast she turned all these around these are great yeah the uh the the one with the uh waves on it and the logo is what we use on the YouTube background as well that one's pretty damn cool we've got uh oh hold on uh wait which ones are the desktop ones I thought they were oh wait no they're only phones yeah here are some wallpapers no reason why they're uploaded now um thank you for that Sammy okay I thought we had to oh that makes sense that they would be phone ones that
we got to we got to compete we got to compete head tohe with our we're uh planning on this necessarily being like a thing that we do all the time no it's really not um we're just uh we're just having some fun with it so do I think that this was the world's most brilliant um tactical move um I can't say that based on the community feedback it um seems like it um is it a scam no no it is it is factually by definition not a scam so like calling it a scam is just telling other people you don't understand what a
scam is yeah um but I do think maybe you know maybe you count s lucky for that but I do think that this is you know maybe something that needs to be addressed in order to sort of rebuild Goodwill with the community um and so that's probably the that's probably the best advice which I I think they're doing I'm sure they're working on it I I hope they're working on it I hope they're I hope they're working on it funny funny hats asks me what about a ripoff um I think lots of things are a
ripoff I think that basically any designer Lael article of clothing is a ripoff I was recently made aware that the t-shirt that the Zuck wears that just like gray t-shirt is like $400 of course um I personally consider that to be a ripoff he doesn't a ripoff it absolutely could be but a ripoff is subjective scam is not that's where these two terms differ it's definitely not a scam if you think it's a ripoff it's a ripoff that's it and we could discuss that right but it isn't a scam that's
all do you have any IDE how many LTT shirts you can get for $400 I do actually you can get 20 well don't forget about the shipping maybe 15 plus shipping depending on depending on where you live okay all right all right taxes sure mind you you no you have to pay taxes on the $400 shirt too actually you got to pay shipping on that too actually I think we're doing pretty good hey um Luke's Birds unfortunately this is my last week on float plane oh no you won't get our second pack of wall papers
just kidding I don't think we're going to do another one no probably not I asked Sarah to just kind of oh no lonus your face is now my MacBook screen sa yeah okay that's great guess who just resubbed to float plane just for wallpapers this guy the system works that wasn't the point you knew what you were doing intern i i was mostly just Ming for the people who are already subscribed to float plane Dan these they're they're just pngs or jpegs or whatever they are there's no uh screen cap the screen yeah
people yeah if right click the YouTube if you want to steal it just uh there quick press print screen you got this you can go through all of them go for it I'm going to do it again I'm going to do again get the way the merch message out of way the merch message out of there get that merch message out of there doing it I'm doing it hold on I can no I'll move it down I'll move down I got you no I got you I got you down okay here you go okay quick quick quick  yeah I actually love that float plane
one they also really don't have to be that fast cuz once they get the VOD they can just they really cool yeah they're like actually good yeah well of course they are it's Sarah what you I'm always Blown Away by the stuff that comes out of that well I just I thought she had like five minutes and would do like one I didn't expect it was going to be she did have like five minutes she just has a lot of uh she has just a lot of really great artwork that she's worked on over
the years and extremely competent yeah I like competent people I I just do I really do let's play a game okay let's play a game really quick um what do you think will be the dominant misinterpretation of that segment we just did oh yeah that's a good  um downplaying the Privacy stuff oh okay okay well let's address that then let's address that really quick it's really bad okay okay what's next sounds like in in if I can throw my hat in the ring there as someone who has had
to in some cases write in other cases work with lawyers to write in other other cases write and then work with lawyers to write and then ReRe it for them and be like is this better and they're like yeah and I'm like cool thanks yeah um that has happened actually more than once um these things more than he knows even yeah I bet yeah these things suck and I I have no idea I have literally talked to none of them I bet you they were just like hey lawyer people can you please write one of these for us and
they were like sure blonc and just wrote it too aggressive because in a tweet that I saw I think they were like yeah we're not even Gathering all this stuff we just like wrote it too too harsh yeah I do I I suspect there is some amount of stuff for the free tier for the advertisement delivery stuff like that and there is there is some stuff they really just like needed to not do like that like the whole thing about yeah it took a colossal amount of work to make it launch on Android and
iOS at the same time multi cotland multiplatform there was a there was a couple things why say that if you like don't you know didn't do that I if it was maybe give us a ring next time we got you it is actually kind of funny to me how often I watch other creators just like stumble through things um making stuff is hard when when when we already stumbled through it and like they have my digits and like I'd have been happy to chat with them about it I don't know I you know on the other hand though we 
y that's a really good point we do that literally all the time yep uh maybe maybe creators just actually kind of suck at uh reaching out sometimes including very much us um there's there's some there's some pretty good ones there's some pretty good ones in the chat um lonus doesn't understand how words change over time which is just another way of them saying they don't understand that scam actually does have a definition and it doesn't mean that uh we got another one lonus is just out to protect other Tech
tubers unwilling to criticize them um we we straight up did no no no no no no no no this isn't no no it's not oh these are theories on what the controvery might be don't be so defensive for once it's him and not me this is great let's fight oh no there was another there was another really good one there was another really good one uh lonus critic izes marquez's wallpapers then launches his own behind a subscription at the same price actually accurate take yeah actually accurate
take yeah I love it um Trevor Trevor w asks bad faith question how is this different than your stance on horse armor my stance on horse armor is that it it's a different thing it was the first Pebble rolling down the hill that caused an avalanche of colossal shiness in gaming which fundamentally changed how Gam are made and played moving forward nobody is buying this wallpaper app this is not going to change I guarantee you some people do okay sure but this is not going to fundamentally
change anything about the wallpaper economy which is infinite infinitesimally I forget the word but whatever it's it's it's vanishingly small and the idea of paying for wallpapers has existed for decades and the number of people who pay for them is still exactly what it is today this is going to change nothing is is  it yeah I think the negative reaction to it was overblown um I think the negative reaction to a lot of stuff in this space is insanely overblown and has been for a
while now I do I do also understand why um like why people were so frustrated in this case I mean because it's someone whose job is to advise people on making good value decisions when they purchase Mobile Electronics um and this doesn't seem to be aligned with that um I do think that I I do think that there's also some friction that's around just paying for art um and I think that's contributing to the outrage but I do also I do see where people are coming from I just
think that this could have been messaged better it could have been handled better it didn't have to be a disaster and I I just think it's overblown like we saw we saw like genuinely taking over the Internet level trending of people just like trying to light him on fire and it's like yeah it's been a lot maybe chill a it's been a lot like you can you can express your like it's not good but I can personally think of times that would have made more sense to light Marquez up
over like it's just well no I I just I just mean it's yeah it's an overpriced product yeah dude and there's some there's some yeah F subjectively subjectively by the way I just got I don't know how Crystal manages this but she manages like something I respond to in basically like every show it feels like at Linus we need a scam shirt it's exactly the same as every other shirt but it cost like but it costs like four times as much and just says scam on the front I am so down and I'm down right
now I am sending this to Nick and Sarah I am sending it to them right now oh man I will bring you I will bring you the biggest scam t-shirt that you have ever seen oh what if you what if you it's probably not worth it but what if you got it like poorly printed no unacceptable yeah I wouldn't do that okay actually or what if we didn't print it at all what if it's just  more it's it's it's our black shirt and we just like include a Sharpie no we should we should put like
we should we should screen print like a little scam like on the inside so you'll know you got scammed but no one else will see it oh that's pretty good um okay well we'll work we'll work on some concepts for a scam shirt but what I can promise you is that it will cost more than our regular shirt that's the only thing that I will promise you right now it will be more expensive why cuz you got scammed that's why okay that's not even a scam no it's not even a scam okay okay we'll have to make
some oh no oh this is dangerous I you can actually do it no I can't actually yeah okay well whatever you'll think it's a scam maybe put scam in quotes M okay well we'll we'll work on it we we're going to work on it we're going to work on it you could uh you could pay to have the concept of a shirt shipped to you and then you just ship them a box we could share half of the profits with MKBHD we could people are just they're offering they're offering suggestions uh Workshop the scam
shirt no I'm going to I'm going to let I'm going to let Sarah do her magic you you've already seen I just I think people going in and being like you've ruined your whole reputation forever stupid this but like there was a lot of people that's so stupid like guys chill it's it's all the people who have never made a mistake yeah like it's the never made a mistake crowd d relx I don't know I don't know I mentioned this on the pre-show we're deep enough in the show now maybe I'll just say it but like
honestly I'm pretty thrilled with Marquez right now oh you're right right yeah yeah yeah he has single-handedly done more to take the heat off of me for a change than any other human being on the face of the planet thank you Marquez for once I am not the most  tuber nice it's nice yeah I feel like I need like a celebratory dut or something like I just it feels good feels good send them like a a vanue cake or something mind you mind you now that we've now that we've launched our own
our own wallpaper subscription uh maybe we'll be embroiled in the same controversy did I mention you can get  poost z4g well whatever you'll you'll figure it out yeah you guys will figure it out yeah apparently uh this is so funny apparently all the wallpapers are already posted on Reddit yeah of course they are this is dude this is great look at the comments on this um I never thought I'd sub to float plane this was too good of a deal I think I missed some context why is everyone saying scam I
know it's a joke [Laughter] but oh my goodness this is amazing yeah thank you guys so much I used I used Riley 24 to subscribe and download these that's pretty good as well actually cuz they're they're tracking that to see how well the the concept work oh thank you thank you we genuinely appreciate your guys support by the way uh float playe pays for our development team uh it pays for people like Sammy to to do their jobs bring you is great behind the scenes content um thank you thank you
very much the wallpapers uh if you decide to throw a couple of bucks at it hey we we we got to pay Sarah somehow you should probably after downloading them go check out the exclusives or something which is what the platform's like actually for it's very unlikely we're ever going to upload wallpapers again this is not a wallpaper thing also we might be bringing back some Early Access oh cool yeah not across the board but selectively um to add to the float plane fun we're doing an early access
release for our new secret shopper this time who are we secret shopping I'm actually pretty excited about this framework we secret shopped framework lus is not involved they don't know they know now wait did we talk about this last week I don't think so oh okay so I I pretty sure I learned about it today so yeah they don't they don't know um they are finding out probably now yeah right now yep someone sending a frantic message which order was it um yeah did you have them shipped here no
yeah I didn't course not also I didn't have them do anything well yeah yeah we I this was it was mentioned last week I don't remember that weird well it was all delegated I recused myself anyway uh it comes out tomorrow September 28th on float plane and then later on in the week on YouTube cool uh finally the last announcements thing we got to we got to pair these down a little bit next week is Ridge wallet collab we've been working with Ridge for five plus years oh oh sick and we finally got around

of parts in the world and that's the world and that's a bummer okay there we did a quick one there uh we might see high-fi Rush too that's exciting nice uh um Floppy Bird returns but it's a scam okay might actually legitimately be a scam not sure but maybe don't do that and Discord introduces Dave they're rolling out end to-end encryption for audio and video calls it will not however be encrypting text communication right which they say is to facilitate moderation and ensure safety
on the platform but if it's an audio call then you don't need to anyway uh discord's current moderation involves both user reporting and a combination of image hashing and machine scanning to flag csam other forms of automated moderation are controlled by Community moderators on the server level the full technical details for discord's audiovisual endtoend encryption protocol which they call Dave is outload up outload outlined in a white paper they've published likewise its backing
libraries are open source to allow for public transparency and scrutiny by security researchers at least it's progress I'll say that much sure all right let's switch over to after dark shall we yeah yes we shall okay phone time while he gets set up oh okay yeah really is this that important to you just what is why why won't you say it I think that's why I'm so interested I'm being baited so Dan can I ask you to do me a big favor yes it's not going to be an easy favor oh boy

now here I'm just going to give them a closer look at it and then you can feel free to do a merch sure all right for Luke hey W Luke if you can share what is the flow plane algorithm for deciding username color on a live in live chat yeah I guess live  yeah I we're just stopping it there we're not doing oh there's a Linus question after that I see okay got it um I don't remember that's entirely a Jaden thing uh I think it's a secret if I remember correctly I don't think it's a
secret I I think yeah Conrad saying it's just a table I thought it was either that or it was the first letter that it was based off of you can see the the texture yeah there you go if I remember correctly you can even play with the capitalization of your name and it will change it or something I don't remember exactly how it works um if you ever see Jaden in the chat poke him and he'll be able to tell you if he feels like it or he won't because he might not feel like it cuz he's not on
shift sounds about right I'm not going to tell him what to do um yeah that's it lonus how do you feel about PlayStation raising the prices on Horizon zero Dawn is this for the remaster or whatever like it's $10 more but now it's remaster or something or what what are we talking about raising the price like it just cost more happened but I don't know I don't know it costs however much it costs if you like the price then you buy it at the price if you don't like the price you don't pay for it that's uh
Playstation quietly raises Horizon zero Dawn PS4 price following remaster announcement um yeah I guess don't buy it I mean I don't know guys come on like yeah sucks games cost a lot of money but like you had like four year five years to buy Horizon when did Horizon zero Dawn come out yeah really Horizon zero Dawn release PS4 cuz like I bought it on PC like three years ago I feel like dude this game came out in 2017 it came out s years ago if you wanted to play it just play it I I don't know
guys it's a scam there it's a scam it's a scam it's scam it's a scam uh I mean I'm not a fan of game prices going up but like honestly we've talked about it extensively on the show before the fact that game prices haven't gone up a lot more is crazy I I feel like it's been a standoff where different companies are just like who's going to go first dude there's probably more people who work in the marketing department of a modern AAA game than worked on Super Mario World in its entirety right like
it's and that was a that was a $60 cartridge back in 1994 93 when did Super Mario World come out was it ' 92 was it I think it was 93 was it two 1990 good Lord right so yeah games are flipping expensive I mean do I think the whole we're remastering a seven-year-old game thing is a little bit ridiculous and sort of you know playing around with the the hype cycle and the fact that it's in the news and raising the price or whatever it's like yeah sure whatever but realistically
guys this is games wait another 3 months and it's probably going to be on sale again or whatever and you can get it for a lower price like I really yeah I don't think it's I don't think it's that big of a deal personally I'm H I'm sorry man I'm I'm gonna I'm gon to get I'm going  trouble uh okay I see I knew there'd be more to it um naturally people saw the this is I'm reading off of dual Shockers I'm going to just share my screen uh because they seem to have actually pretty good
coverage of this uh naturally when people saw the price spike of horizon zero daon it left them scratching their heads blah blah blah blah blah it's it's like almost doubled in or it's effectively doubled in price following the the the title of this article is it closes a loophole so I was like what does that mean uh apparently you if you if you own the original version you can upgrade to the remaster version so they released the remaster version at this price we're just buying the old one and
then upgrading oh I've got it okay uh so okay well that makes sense Luca 103 on the subject of scams asks where's your iPhone lonus after I shot the short circuit they needed it for some other content so they're going to give it to me when they're done with it 16 yeah I'm going with the 16 plus you're going to run one like Mainline oh yeah you're going to put that away yeah yep wow it's going away wow it's going away um D Starfire actually there's a couple questions from
float plane chat from earlier D Starfire asked I've always wondered what is lmg stance on like the LT gifs and Discord and stuff like that uh we don't mind that kind of thing this was in response to the uh ghost keyboards situation oh they're you're not that's not marketing something with an endorsement with Linus yeah yeah you're not creating a fake endorsement of a product that I explicitly said I don't think is a good value yeah I think the gifts are hilarious yeah I I we are pro Community
engagement and Community use of of our of our likenesses any anytime some like meme face of me uh takes over the the subreddit for a  fun uh Tor mson asks how's the cat I realized after I said that the cat was at the vet I never really gave an update he's doing great we don't know what exactly his deal was um he was favoring a leg a little bit maybe he just did something stupid cuz he's a dumb kid and and he got a little bit of inflammation got a little bit of uh a fever and then they they gave him um
they just gave him an anti-inflammatory and painkillers and he was fine in like two days cool so yeah he's doing great all right what's up Lee dlee and Lee I chimed in a while back asking Luke if he had played body Cam and his opinions on it is there any updates and if so how does he feel about the camera movement and mechanics did I ever talk about it I don't know if you ever did there was a brief discussion about it when it sort of just first yeah I thought that might
have been on the pre-show though or it might have been off camera I remember talking about the laser scans and the details and things like that but my went back to it I hated it sorry to sorry to the body cam tell us how you really feel was it a scam yes no no no no it like it has a really interesting aesthetic they did they they cooked they they did interesting things with it but there was parts of the game that were just like what like if you it was uh the gameplay that I was playing was like Seek and
Destroy style where when you die you're out until the next round right but you would then be able to Pilot a drone so you could just fly around the map almost no clip style because you have a drone find where they are and then the in-game voice chat you could tell your teammates where they were oh well that seems like an oversight so stupid that's a scam so my team had one less player than their team the the KD ratios of everyone on our team was better than them in general
but we would just always lose cuz it would come down to a one like just I don't know skill issue probably I was pretty bad to be  honest I did not do well but it was also super annoying like you you would actually get someone and you'd be stoked and then you'd hear the Drone come around and it's like oh okay guess I'm screwed nice like and you just you hear the voice chatting drone telling them where you are it's like irer 6 says they will announce a scam shirt next week
calling it now you must have missed the part of the show where we said we are going to do a scam shirt yeah yeah and it like it was it was one of those games where they're like it's realistic so they just made it like feel horrible oh sure like you're super clunky and like coming to a stop is really slow and like no it's really not actually that slow we don't have to play this way people can turn on a dime pretty quickly yeah yeah um I don't know but it is the you know the Aesthetics are really interesting
what they did with it is really interesting just I did not enjoy the gameplay and I did not enjoy the gameplay mechanics like the whole drone thing and stuff that drove me nuts um so I I bailed out but yeah I'm going to try to dump through some more luk ones here  app nice nice pretty good uh hi W show question for Luke what are your thoughts on companies asking employees to return  Amazon um I'm glad I don't have to answer this that they just asked Luke I I don't know I
think I think just like with pretty much any situation a lot of it's going to come down to the management um I think there are people I have can I talk vaguely enough about this I think so I have employed people that didn't work out because in my opinion they weren't necessarily a bad worker but they were not capable of work from home work um they they were you could you could kind of tell they were not you know they weren't doing it they probably needed more micromanagement they
probably needed more someone can literally see what they're doing all the time level micromanagement um which you can't effectively do with work from home this whole like monitor their Mouse movement thing whatever you will always lose that war and also just can we not yeah that too but the companies are never going to win so they can we just not they shouldn't even do it yeah because it's like invasive and weird and you're not going to win anyways so just stop yeah um but properly managed teams
with good people that are going to be honest and do their work work from home versus work in office I don't know it doesn't really matter at this point I think it's like easier to manage people that are work from home I think you navigated that really well the tough thing is that I feel like in our super polarized world I need a I need a more aggressive take no no no no it's not that no no no in our super polarized world you're either with us or you're against us and so I think
for you to I think that you know you would talk to the Kevin OES of the world or whatever else and if you say anything other than the employer has the absolute right to dictate when and where the Worker Works then they'll be like this is communism you know and to be clear I don't know Kevin o I don't know if he just every time I every time I read anything about his take on something it's usually what I disagree with so I just so I'm just picking on him essentially I don't know exactly what
his take is on this but I'd probably disagree with it and then on the other side you've got like our SL antiwork that basically goes I should work when I want however I want and if I want and whatever else um and and there's sort of this like for you to have sort of a a middle ground uh feels impossible like for you to say something like um you know yeah sometimes the employer you know abuses their their power um you know that's going to upset your your your capitalist fat cats and for you to say sometimes
the worker is not in good faith contributing positively to the success of the company that by the way pays their you know paychecks um then the other crowd is going to be up in arms because no person could would ever do that what you're saying is I just pissed off everybody yeah kind of nice I don't know Centrist yeah I also have people literally on my team right now that I think I could objectively say just work better by working from home more on task if anything like that that type of stuff
like there's just people are people and and people are different oh dude this is great people work FL chats lighting up with just like dumb [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that Kevin o  said oh man oh man I I don't even like he was on Shark Tank right yeah the Canadian one oh okay yeah the like you  called salmon tank anyway anyway yeah the reality of it is is there are AC there are good faith and bad faith bosses and there are good faith and bad faith employees and any kind of blanket this and only this is is the
interpretation of the situation is wrong yeah period yep it's a different type of management it also takes a sometimes not always but sometimes it takes kind of a different type of employee um y I think it can be beneficial for some people I think it can be negative for other people I think sometimes if it is negative for that person uh they might be willing to make certain compromises to make it work if it like saves them a bunch of money or if it saves a bunch of time or whatever else I've also found
that if it's negative for people they tend to be the kinds of people that lack the self-awareness to recognize that it's negative for them that is almost certainly also a thing um I think that's also on both sides though I think I think sometimes when if managers can't figure out how to manage remote employees um they will just say oh this system doesn't work andame all these people are bad and I'm good no one else blah blah blah blah blah when realistically it's just it's a you know
if if you are on a remote team and you like it try to do good by it if you want it to stay existing because there is a bit of a war on this stuff going on right now and I think being unrealistic about its potential downsides is not going to help um and I also think that there is there's bad faith arguments on both sides you know absolutely yeah it is what it is how about some more Luke ones hi Luke as an avid active curler from California sick yes we curl in California California you had me in not going to
lie they had us in the first half other Recreational Sports or is that it uh my question is lead second Vice or skip which one are you usually playing also do you prefer draws or hits oh generally hits no idea what we're talking about hits are you a curler from California I only hear them called takeouts um I'm probably wrong they're probably right um I bet you a hit is when it anyways don't worry it doesn't matter uh I I believe I'm usually second my dad is always the Skip and I don't
foresee myself ever playing curing if it's not with my dad so I will not be that role um usually my brother's the lead I'm second my uncle or someone else playing depending on if my uncle can make it or not is third and then my dad is skip yeah it's basically just the order that you throw the rocks in I no I know first second third oh yeah yeah yeah what did you say first second and third and then skip is just last but it's essentially like the team captain of sorts I sorry I
was just I was a little thrown off CU you like kept forgetting your dad's name what it's Rob not skip no I'm just I I know the positions okay I'm just fing him that's my  oh that's actually pretty funny terrible um but no it's not even just the throwing Order each one of them has like slightly different roles and responsibilities anyways most of it lays on the on the and that I don't know anything about because I've only ever done it once yeah all right okay back up to the top Hi D notice the new ad insert
tests compared to the normal ones on recent videos can you talk about these how are they doing any learnings enjoying the change up personally I got to tell you guys I um I'm as surprised as you to see some of them the one where my son gets swapped out with Dennis was a little jarring oh I did see that that was not that was not in the version of the video that I reviewed normally I'm the final pass review on LTT videos I did not see that um I thought it was really funny it was funny yeah
um yeah I I think we're just we're trying to we're trying to have fun with it a little bit like we used to do more of that kind of stuff and then we just got kind of formulaic and that's Dennis's job now is to make our make our sponsorship spots as engaging as our content I think he's um sorry excuse me I think he's doing a really good job in terms of making it more engaging I think that the team is still kind of working on you know what kpis look like for sponsors to to drive
more revenue from it but if nothing else if we're entertaining you guys then we consider it a good investment I think yeah um it doesn't all fall into my department now you got to understand that everything that I say now uh comes from the perspective of a member of the upper management but not the one who makes even when he doesn't show up to upper management meetings not the one who makes all the decisions I show up sometimes sometimes yeah and I get summaries you can I've told I told you
com I told you you can always like call me in if you need you know backup on something or whatever I told you that it's not even necessarily that I think your General input on things would be good though well and you can always table something for a future discussion if you're just like yeah I've known lonus "for 1,000 years and I feel very strongly" that as the investor primary shareholder of the company he would think this is phenomenally stupid like we can always have conversations nothing set in stone
we we make we try to make decisions as a team um and I do think we do a pretty good job I just think sometimes it's surprising the amount of times that the discussion goes to what would lonus think and it's like wow this would be insanely more efficient if he was here and said what he was thinking um okay but I got like videos to shoot the challenge is like if all I had to do was be an executive I could I could probably do a pretty good job of it I'd be bored as hell I I struggle to
stay on task in that way I I like creating reports and weird world reviewing reports like I can kind of do it like I can hyperfocus and I can like power through it I don't know if you probably got a bunch of emails from me like one morning yeah yeah I I no I understand this doesn't even I went through like 300 unread in my inbox and just like powered through it on a flight and like that's the kind of thing I can do but I'm I'm more of a I'm a sprinter I'm not a marathon runner and um and I'm
just like I I don't know I just I get pulled in all these different directions and I I enable it my behavior enables the way that people pull me into side conversations and like like talk to me about things so I guess what I'm saying is I'm more than happy to do that yeah but um yeah I won't be in exact meeting every time um anyway the point is um yeah I'm a member of the exec team but everything that I say is a perspective of mine now it's not just what the company is doing I am not the CEO the
company's big and there's a lot of execs there a lot of I had a conversation with Taran yesterday that was basically like he was like uh you know yeah uh you know are we are we doing this it was like something that he wants to do that I was kind of lukewarm on and I was like well you said we're doing it so we're doing it like and I was kind I was kind of joking with him I was like you know if I if if I give you the title it's not a title it's it's a responsibility and so you know
um as long as you have the title until such time as you are fired um you have my sword you know like there do you do you ask shareholders permission to do things you it would be more the board of directors board of directors but the board of directors would often represent the interests of the shareholders the shareholders theoretically everyone is sort of representing the interest of the shareholders but members of the board of directors especially in smaller companies like ours are often the
shareholders people are tagging me and then just saying warm nice um yeah cuz I mean I think it's I think it's still in in teran's defense I think it's still valid to ask the shareholders what they want yeah absolutely no it is it is 100% and and and and for me my role is not to micromanage that it's to set the direction and you know if there's a particular let's say a Personnel decision or if there's a like a like an investment decision um like if there's some some kind of action in both
of those him going to I'm in I'm in defend Teran mode now um no he's doing great in both of those I'm not saying you're saying he's not doing great I just in both of those situations um Vision man makes sense to consult in both of the things that you just described and depending on the impact severity Etc of those things Consulting shareholders might also make sense sure but what I'm trying to say is that what I is also empowered what I will probably say is here's your rope which is fair
enough use it to go as far as you can or use it to hang  expression fair enough right because that that's the way it is that's what that's what leadership is you either you have to be given the leeway to successfully lead until such time as you lose the confidence of the board of directors and then you're fired right like because it's the top it's the top position in the company it's realistic so you either are capable of leading or you've lost or you've lost confidence and you're done
right like there's no real like it's not like I can be like oh well why don't we demote you to VP of happiness or whatever right like is that that's not how that works when someone is brought into lead I feel like that is a role that some company has somewhere I mean probably but I don't think Taran would be the one to occupy it that guy is the worst resting face it's it's pretty bad I'm used to it at this point it doesn't phase me anymore yeah and to be clear I'm not saying
anything about him that I haven't told him to his face multiple times yeah yeah he told me like almost immediately he told he told you that I suspect he probably yeah I was going to say it was incredibly important for him to say that otherwise I would have been crying every time I talked to him uh no you get used to it super if if I know and everybody's like no he's just like this then it's like okay yeah I can I can I can handle that that's fine he's just like this by the way oh that's great Oh what
now what is a chief happiness officer oh my goodness yeah you can't have a chief happiness officer without that is the most dystopian term I have ever heard in my entire life beatings will continue until morale improves like all right top performers get an additional one minute break uh dear lonus if ad block is piracy but closing your eyes isn't then what is your opinion on a robot that detects ads and puts a blindfold over your face until it's over uh kind of joking curious I'm going to ask have
either of you seen Black Mirror I should I've only seen bits and pieces first season 15 million merits there is actually this they're forced to watch advertisements or they can pay to make them stop and if you cover your eyes a rising tone gets louder and louder and louder and it says resume viewing resume viewing and uh you have to watch it um is this in order to you know what I think I think it's scam yep scam yep okay I'm going to give you a serious answer uh it's the automation it's the automation that
makes it that so anything you do anything you do manually and then resume manually that requires your attention because that's essentially the payment the payment is attention it can be attention on the ad it can be attending to not paying attention to the ad I I don't look at ads I mean we've talked about this extensively like I I actually it it is a matter of personal Pride that I do not like to be influenced by ads occasionally I'll click on stuff very very occasionally but I don't like doing
it and I will actually go out of my way to just like avert my eyes for 9 seconds and then like check back in but attention is the form of payment so you're either paying attention to when it's over or you're paying attention to it playing through um and anyway it's not piracy it's privateering we've been through this yeah yeah interesting take hey lonus Lan Dan during a fresh Windows install Windows update downloaded and flashed my bias on restart is there an end in sight for the
amount of power Microsoft is taking lately actually hold on I want to go back to the other thing for a second it's also it's also down to like I'm not condemning anything whatever you're comfortable with you just do your thing there uh okay is there an end to the to be fair um actually the the BIOS flashing thing I believe that's more down to the integrator like that would never happen with a custom machine so I don't think this is really Windows um this is more Windows update having a
functionality that the system integrator is choosing to make use of um as opposed to Microsoft um seizing power there's plenty of Microsoft abusing power lately that we could point at I don't think this is it all right okay what else I got to make sure that that is broadcast since lmg has has such a wide array of different jobs how does growing in your own field look like for example graphic designer particularly with the continual growth of the company like a lot of small/medium I think technically we
still qualify as small by a lot of definitions um like a lot of small companies we struggle with this um because and we've had to in some cases create sort of I don't want to call them artificial because they are reflective of the increased experience and or compensation that is associated with them but we've had to kind of create new segmentations sometimes within roles that previously would have been the same so we previously had writer now we have Junior writer and Senior writer um you
could take you could take a piece from like Silicon Valley Tech stuff where you have like numbered levels yeah yeah something like that 3 that one good thing that could come from Silicon Valley Tech um I'm sure it's Miss used for horrible reasons somehow it's absolutely something that we have looked at a little bit and it's absolutely something that we haven't looked at enough and  solved lonus I remember you saying you had to go to Saskatoon to get your ti can how did you like your visit to our
flat chunk of dirt I did not say that um this this kind of thing this kind of thing happens a lot I read a lot of things that I apparently said that I definitely never said and definitely never happened um I imported it from Quebec so you're close just got the province wrong and you got who went where wrong um however conveniently I have been to Saskatchewan I think I end I think I drove through Regina though which which one does uh which one does the one road go through
um it was a long time ago I was I was 16 years of age but I did drive through the Prairie I didn't really think they were as flat as people make them out to be yeah I went through Regina I did not go through Saskatoon that would boy would that ever been a long way out of the way um yeah I mean they were like they were flat but I just the way people talk about it it's like yeah you could see for like a thousand miles in every D I mean like yeah sort of like there's Rolling Hills
and stuff like at least uh at least in the the the bottom part of Saskatchewan that I drove through Regina you guys Reg CH it's a city calm down I knew it was going to happen immediately immediately all Canadians giggle too good job chat uh question to lonus is there any other Tech or house dream upgrades you want to make thanks for all the amazing content um I don't know it's all like kind of awesome I'm getting pretty stoked on something we're going to be working on I forget um no
not us oh cool uh we as in myself and Emma um my roommate is gone yeah birds were sick which sucked they were gone for a long time it was very expensive but that let us you know get crazy chemical carpet cleaners in there just really like clean things up um not a great review of your former roommate for the whole house in in his defense it was pretty bad but we did do it for the whole house um and we're going to be moving all the like computers and stuff in there and we're already kind of planning out there
still more things to plan out but you know um both desks against one wall with like a little island in the middle for where the birds are going to go and stuff it's going to be it's going to be pretty cool sick it's going to be cool I can't really think of any uh any Tech upgrades that I need to make right now my my tech setup at my house is like kind of oh and that awesome no I won't go into it oh okay now I'm curious uh it's it doesn't really matter but what go away okay sorry uh does
stopping a long form YouTube video and finishing it later or the next day negatively affect the Creator I can't answer for sure but what I can say is that probably that would actually be a positive signal uh we have videos that have extremely low retention but extremely long uh strong performance over time um here let me see if I can just uh what is happening right now Google analytics is a weird or YouTube analytics is a weird yeah so here weird magic here check this out
um me just going to share my screen real quick here so how to build a PC the last guide you'll ever need let's let's look  one this retention graph is absolute poo poo like by the end of this video only 16% of people are watching this video and yet this got served for a whopping 12 million views on the platform so like for context here okay let's take something um let's take something more recent okay can you have too many Wi-Fi routers obviously it's a much shorter video but you can you can clearly see
here we're looking at more like by the time the end sponsorship SP 45% above typical retention right by the time we reach the end I don't know 1.3 million views let's not let's not let's not serve that as much uh YouTube home down YouTube recommendations down uh why would that be because the first video I showed you guys is reference material the overall watch time is huge because it's like 2 hours long so that 16% or whatever it was at the end amounts to longer watch time and YouTube wants you
on the platform the other thing is that people look at it they go well that's nice but I'm not building a computer right now and then they come back when it is time to build a computer that is a very strong signal so you just have to think about what kind of signal your behavior is sending algorithmically looking at something going I don't have time for this right now and going out of your way going out of your way to take part of your day and search for it and go back to it and finish it that is a
very strong signal that you were quite engaged by that content so I would say it's a very good thing actually don't don't like do that don't just like start videos and then like like go back on purpose to go watch them or whatever just just you know use the platform and it should theoretically tune itself for you yeah hey lonus now that you are switching to iPhone will you also be trying the Apple ecosystem watch Mac OS maybe homekit uh I don't really have any need to switch to Mac OS right now and
besides I think my perspective with iPhones was always using an iPhone as a Windows guy um and that will continue to be my perspective I think D currently working for a tech startup in a decisionmaking position and my team is scaling quickly what methods have you used to evaluate if you're making the right decisions for growth these are hard questions yeah it's hard I mean realistically you could take an entire degree of that yeah so and you'd still barely know what you're
doing yeah um find data you can trust at least a bit and then try to be guided by also as as much as I'm not a fan of the guy uh Bezos has an interesting quote on data stuff that I've been trying to push around a little bit lately as we're as we're getting more and more data driven um that the it's very easy for data tock why it's also very easy for you to misinterpret what the data really means so if the sentiment and it's really good to capture data and to read it and try
to figure out what's going on but if the sentiment and the data notably don't match try to figure out what's going on but generally you should strongly consider the sentiment it says something along that lines I don't remember what  is how have power tool companies been given a pass for so long for locking consumers into their ecosystems with battery while companies like Apple or Google are criticized for being anti- consumer because uh it's a different less um okay first of all if you talk to any
trades they hate that drives them crazy um you know you talk to uh talk to Farmers they hate lock down John Deere tractors you know they're not they're not getting a pass um we Tech folk just aren't talking about it because it doesn't affect us dayto day because no offense to you uh but you probably don't work with a drill every day because you watch this show and yes yes you I know you do but most of the views don't so we tend to kind of fixate on the things that affect us day-to-day the
things that we are closest to I mean that's that's probably a significant contributor to how flipped out everybody was over mkbhd's wallpaper app uh if someone that you didn't know you know if uh if what's what's her name the uh uh the goop goop actress oh goop actress yeah if she if she launched some uh gwenth goop yeah goop if she launched some if she launched some goop product that was like a $100 you know cucumber slice that you put on your eye or whatever you won't hear
about it you won't care that doesn't mean that she got away with it you know yeah you just didn't care yeah I'm fighting with a Milwaukee guy you're forgetting about the brand loyalty as well yeah they also might not care because they will happily give like Milwaukee $300 for a radio boo Milwaukee get the Makita espresso machine that's battery powered yes it's a real thing there's a lot of brand war in it's really intense with tools trol a crazy one you have aord we can't be friends
now my dad's a Ryobi guy I like the green dude there's people who would actually just like use a manual screwdriver versus use a drill from a brand that they don't like it's it's it is mind-blowing should is I will not touch team red so I wasn't um I wasn't kidding about that this is a this is a radio for $300 Canadian dollars um yeah KMS Tools is right look you got you got to show the Makita coffee maker you have coffee maker I need you too I know we pressed for time but you
okay well at least it's cheaper than the other thing okay I'm over it I don't need to click yeah that's fine you you get the point all right I appreciate you all I am curious about how Linus's solar panels have been impacting his electric bill maybe an idea for a future video lowering it a bit hey lld love how you guys keep reviews on LTD store as they are and don't censor poor reviews that said why are we not able to review products after a few months I don't know just review them right away I guess
well no that's stupid because then if you wanted to leave a long-term review you wouldn't be able to I uh I don't know uh we had an issue with our reviews um our reviews plugin this week where uh someone thought we were we had changed the the gradient oh it's still it's still like this okay so on some with very few reviews it the way the gradients work on the lower ones oh no it's the oh yeah no this is this is better because the opacity was different opacity opaque opacity oh was it like blue at the so
it's harder to see or um yeah the colors were different so it made it seem like these ones were not as big when they we weren't doing that in no we didn't do that int no no no it's okay it's okay it's okay anyway Conrad already fixed it but the point is that um we didn't do that intentionally the plugin that we use for customer reviews just like updated and like we didn't know and we had to manually intervene in order to make it not do that um so it's possible that might just be a limitation of the
platform we use we don't we didn't create our own review system and like I there are things I don't like about it uh I don't want us to make our own yeah that's basically where we're at on this it is what it is cool I don't think anyone else internally wants us to make our own either so yep sorry that will not be an initiative yo lonus have you played Paper Mario the Thousand-Year Door it seems like the sort of RPG you'd have fun playing I have not but I should uh it definitely seems like the sort of
RPG I would enjoy oh I accidentally that's fine just archived a second one hi wano this is for you lonus uh you have mentioned that you are emotionally needy in relationships how did you and Avon deal with this and what conversation complications did you both have well we're both emotionally needy so we um met and then basically you notice I never talk about friends that I have other than like people I work with it's because Ivon and I met became completely I believe the word is and
mesed umed yeah and um healthy or not um hey we're coming up on 20 years baby I'd say that's healthy congratulations um so cool all right I found the one that you deleted uh hello w. dll I'm currently without power and internet due to 4 days due to the hurricane Helen uh but safe how would you handle getting your Tech family through a similar situation  power I I'm I'm super obsessive about battery Banks I have tons and they tend to be rather charged um  reserves the problem is that he's
currently without power ah that makes things really hard you haven't already prepped yeah I don't know what uh what we did for a long time is we got an old Generator from a boat diesel generator from a boat and you could run that thing on like old engine oil if you wanted to was really powerful very very uh easy to run giant but also very cheap a lot of people do the natural gas ones outside but that doesn't really work if the natural gas infrastructure explodes don't know code red 255 in 
rerun the W show is always live except for that one time was it April fools that we did a pre-recorded one or was it Christmas I think we did one on Christmas I think it was Christmas I think we've done it once or twice we pre-recorded the W show um I'll prove it see I wouldn't do that if it was pre-recorded why would I think to pre-record that that'd be crazy 40 chess with time travel yeah okay well last one then oh ouch lus say I have heard you recommend ano 1800 for years I finally got the game for
steam I have been playing on my framework 13 do it yourself until 12th gen do you have any suggestions for a noob um watch at least a couple of just like people's startup videos and then invest no more than probably like 32 60 Minutes in that because it's fine you'll you'll you'll want to explore for yourself right like you'll want to kind of figure out your own way to do things and then the other big one is look at just one or two videos of people kind of showing off their final States because
that'll give you a some ideas in your mind for what you need to plan ahead for as you're laying the foundation of your city or cities my thing would actually be something that lonus hammered in hammered home for me um I was somewhat sheltered when I when I kind of first started playing ano because I would just like be the military ship guy and then lonus would build all the islands but something he used to mention all the time was to look at your production so instead of just like
looking at the map and you know you highlight over something and you're like oh I don't have enough of this I'll build another thing so that I can have more of it um that's actually a pretty bad way to go you want to look into your production and see how much your your like resource harvesting places are generating versus how much your your product producing places are are using those things and making new ones and how many of those things you actually need and balance the equation um instead of
just like building kind of stuff that you think you might need it's wildly more efficient and I find more rewarding and once you figure that out on one Island then the efficiency growth of like oh actually potatoes take up a lot of freaking space so I found this other Island that has potatoes maybe I'll just grow those there and I'll set up a trade route back and forth and do it that way doing stuff like that starts to become very  yeah this is cool I didn't know about this
someone pointed this out in chat Cas multibrand battery system Cas Brands um cordless Alliance something I think do you just need like an adapter or something uh I don't  Metabo cast cordless sorry the drill communicates with the battery itself the BMS as a special specialized computer in it on each battery um I know because uh family friend is a Makita dealer and he gets us buckets of old batteries that have basically just failed and then we Frankenstein them back together make
adapter plates and things like that um it's very interesting cool I forget what does c stand for I think we've love huged to the site oh cordless Alliance System there it is cool well good luck with that and good luck with you guys finding something to do now cuz it's the end of the show yeah we'll see you again next
