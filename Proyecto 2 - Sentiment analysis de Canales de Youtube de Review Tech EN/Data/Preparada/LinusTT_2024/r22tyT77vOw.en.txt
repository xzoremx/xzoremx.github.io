hey come on over here you want a free computer of course you do but not as much as veiler C does who has asked me to build in one every single day for almost 3 years on Instagram well you know what veiler fine I'm going to build you a PC and ridge even wants to help me get it to you I'm going to build this sucker pack it in one of their water resistant luggages throw in some extra Ridge swag and flly buy it across the world and hide it somewhere in a city nearby oh hide it you say you don't like
that well I mean surely after you harassed my social media team for years you didn't think I was just going to hand it to you did you I'll tell you what I'm a sporting man I'm going to have my team DM you the link to this video one day early which gives you 23.98 7 metric hours to decipher all the clues figure out where it is go there and claim your prize after that the video goes live and this computer  everyone how about we kick things off with our first clue the country we sent
special agent Andrew to was part of the Ottoman Empire until it became its own kingdom in 1881 now Veer probably knows knows the answer to this already since according to his SoundCloud page he's from there but while the rest of you figure it out let's start building this gaming PC there were two main concerns first we needed something that would fit into our Ridge carryon shipping or checking the bag were both technically options but let's just say that my Mean Streak here
does not extend to giving Baylor a broken computer so hand carry it is second we wanted it to be a pretty solid machine you know worth him going out of his way to hunt for it but not so valuable that anyone is likely to get shanked over it so we landed on a budget of "$1,100 or about 5,000 Romanian doll oh" did I just say that well there's going to be a lot of other hints and it's not always going to be in the clue breaks speaking of money these Ridge wallets are super slim very durable and come
with a 99 day risk-free trial meaning that you can send it back if you don't like it we're going to send this one Woo which matches the luggage in our care package for veiler or well whoever finds it first ah as for our CPU we chose the ryzen 7 5800 x3d from AMD with 8 cores and that sweet sweet 3dv cache it is still one of the best gaming CPUs on the market and before you get mad at me in the comments like on that recent Tik Tok because your Kink is being wrong in public yes we know the 7800 x3d is an
awesome CPU but ddr5 RAM and especially am5 boards are significant ific anly more expensive speaking of we went with the gigabyte a520 IAC sure it's a little light on features in IO but it's under $100 and it's Mini ITX meaning that it is certainly much easier and less costly to move by rail than an orthodox church and that IO is not so bad four USB 3.0 ports built-in Wi-Fi 5 and a single pcie gen 3 nvme slot wait Wi-Fi 5 gen 353 you know it' be a great year to host the World Festival of Youth and
students for Ram we've gone with a pair of gskill trident Z NEOS running at 3200 megat transfers per second cl14 might have been nice to go with higher speeds but we decided on higher capacity instead since running an mitx board with only two slots we're not going to be able to upgrade down the line and these two sticks give us a total of 32 gigs unfortunately for veiler we only went with with a partially futureproof solution for our storage our 1 TB Kingston nv2 might not
have the most capacity but that's plenty for the operating system in a couple of games and while it is true we won't be able to take full advantage of this Gen 4 drive in this motherboard most games today still don't use direct storage and gen 3 speeds are plenty for anything else and besides the price difference between Gen 3 and Gen 4 is only a couple of bucks these days and this way if veiler or you ever choose to upgrade this motherboard in the future there will be a bit of performance to unlock
of course though you would have to find our starting point first and to do so you'd have to know of a structure that has a more famous version in Paris but is not to be mistaken for a motorcycle company a Canadian rock band or even the name woo of our new cable management  store.com onto our cooler I believe we've made a triumphant choice we needed something low damn it we needed something that was low profile enough to fit in our case but that can handle a pretty heavy
gaming load and we settled on the noctua nhl9a Black Edition this little guy is only 37 mm in height that includes the fan and small boox Central says it does okay which I guess we're about to confirm it is a bit of a pain to install though so while I struggle with this I did want want to bring up a point that is often overlooked these types of messages like the ones from Baylor seem like harmless jokes and honestly speaking most of them are but what you don't see is the sheer volume of these
messages and the angry tone that many of them take when we don't fulfill them in this case veiler wasn't being aggressive or directly targeting anyone on staff but he was still quite literally spamming us so if it doesn't make sense to you yet hopefully that clears up why we've gone with the whole okay I'll build you one but you approach and I really do mean it this time when I say that this is the last time that I will be giving a computer to someone who begs for it like this moving forward our
community management team has cart blanch to shadowban anyone who begs for free stuff or just generally as a nuisance now that I've made my case for why I shouldn't be doing this let's move on to the case that we chose the fractal Tera it's a newer is miniitx case that a ton of people inter Al have picked up for their personal rigs thanks to its clean looks and its ease of use we're definitely paying a bit of a mini ITX tax here at $180 but it is the perfect size to fit
in our carry-on which I guess means it's  that this is not accurate like how old is this install guide they have not revised this guide in I you not do you know when the last time an S Bridge was "there that was like 6,000 GeForce 6000" series Pop mounted power supply oh good and now I can know how to install mying optical drive and my hard drive here's a DVI port on the back of my motherboard like what even is this this is not what this looks like the polarity is not even 
boy ooh well we're going to put in our system H that is going to take up a lot of the space but you know what I think we can still fit our hat fit our matching Ridge wallet oh put an air tag into the little secret air tag pocket so we'll know exactly when it gets picked up and they might have a ton of designs for these key holders that hold up to six keys but obviously we've gone with the matching one but first we're going to take out our next clue head south until you are in the
north all right JK you can check out all this stuff at ridge.com Linus to get 10% off their products or use coupon code Linus on checkout but we're not quite ready to pack this up yet because we need to install our power supply we went with the Cooler Master v850 gold it's fully modular and it's 850 Watts giving us extra Headroom for future upgrades fun fact by the way while we install this there was another lad in the running for this computer named Fabby he has been messaging us for even longer
than veiler but he lacked the dedication to do it every day he tried to make up for it sending us two messages on some days and you know what we might have let that fly but this one really man you take a week off and then you're like I don't know maybe they won't notice these time stamps sorry Fabby but if I'm going to make a PC scavenger hunt halfway around the world it's going to have to be for somebody who's no life enough to drop everything and go complet it immediately  we ended up needing only a small
fraction of our modular cables but hey R just got a toiletries bag now and we're not sending the guy any toothpaste or anything but look at that hey modular cable bag got to love it now for the star is of the show the Asus dual RTX 4060 just 8 gigs of vram and it still manages to look small but it was a GPU that fit in both our case and our budget and it's light which legitimately was a factor and now that it's all built it's time to play some games cuz I want to do a bit of training on the brand new 
built let's do this thing oh well this is non alah oh my gosh that's a you issue what games are we playing let's try door kickers too door kickers yeah wow um I've never heard of that well the developer of this game is from the same country oh very cool very cool that would be a fun little hint it's also a really good game I really like it it's   go and if you want to control the way they face or not cool now they're going to have their back to the wall and get shot at cuz he
didn't change the way they face nice got him oh you're injured did we win boom a a oh this guy's just facing a corner yeah yeah no he likes it he likes it he like oh military training they're going for it they're going to kick this place in boom door kickers got him don't shoot don't shoots me oh no our friend died we are locked at 144 though it's pretty awesome yeah not bad not bad oh 300 FPS let's go 250 let's go man fra frame gen is op though yeah it's crazy I never played
this game oh it's fun I think I've only played the first two levels he's only played this level I've played so much yeah I mean this is a good computer though right yeah it's pretty sick you're averaging like 250 frames even in this open area and you know what I haven't noticed any slowdowns or any graphical anomalies due to frame gen anyway for now it's time to send this computer on its way and we printed off this paper did we with a link to the video just in case somebody finds this
PC randomly and have no idea what's going on so that they know they can keep it instead of taking it to Lost and Found or you know whatever I'm going to sign it I'm going to sign it apparently seriously there's a ridge pen yeah bolt action pen baby I didn't even know they had pens we're about to be bitter competitors considering I think we're launching ours soon TM nice you know what let's let throw this in the package Rod doesn't need it that badly he's got to going to have to rep
the LT pin going forward I don't care how much Ridge pce in all seriousness though we love the products big thanks to rid for sending everything over for us to Showcase they've got even more on their store with over 3 million "customers and over 100,000 f-star" reviews the products speak for themselves and the lifetime warranty backs them up by the way if anyone does manage to find the computer can you try and get us some footage so we can Pin It Down Below or even tack it on the end
with the YouTube editor also should have to say this by the way but I will I know I went on a bit of a thing about people harassing and spamming online creators but that doesn't mean that anybody should be harassing or spamming veiler or Fab's Pages or bothering them I'm not mad at either of them and if you're mad on my behalf you must have trouble sleeping with how white your nights are you got to get that checked out brother and also check out this final clue if you've got everything else
locked down the code you'll need is small Gap to get this 0124 666 33171 good luck Gamers if you guys enjoyed this video maybe check out our last fully sponsored Ridge video where we bought out an entire tech shop for "the low low price of 32,000 Canadian" rubles that one really hurt the ridge wallet
