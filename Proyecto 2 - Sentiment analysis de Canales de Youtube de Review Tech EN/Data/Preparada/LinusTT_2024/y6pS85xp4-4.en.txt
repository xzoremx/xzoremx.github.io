siral bla asks where did you learn about technology and how do I get started I'd say the most important thing is to read read read read watch watch watch consume as much content as you possibly can some of it's going to be really great and well articulated some of it's going to be kind of hard to understand some of it's going to be right some of it's going to be mostly right some of it's going to be outright wrong the more you consume and the more sources you can find the more you'll be able to learn
who to trust especially if you take that knowledge and you try to app it in your daily life doesn't have to be on the highest End Hardware I spent most of my learning years working on crappy stuff that it didn't matter if I broke but that context that you build from all of that content consumption and that reinforcement from doing it yourself is going to give you the troubleshooting skills that you need to tackle pretty much any challenge
