"camera rolling this AMD $5,000 ultimate" Tech upgrade it's going to be a little bit different like this give me the camera it's for our camera guy Andrew he's a really great guy he's witty thoughtful a full third of his upgrade is going to his so and he's even got an accent go on say something oh God I don't know what to say right now you kidding me uh look I said it was going to be awkward yeah yeah thank you yeah isn't he dreamy though too bad he spent his upgrade money on a bunch of here for
vlogging his motorbike tour so enjoy him while he's still around everyone thanks AMD this is going to be a good one I'm going to die win one of three Call of Duty themed gift boxes featuring the new ryzen 79800 x3d the fastest gaming CPU on the market and Rog Alx and even an AMD Call of Duty hat you can't get this gift box from any retail store so don't miss your chance head to the link in the description for your chance to win I have to say the vibe of this place feels almost
unnaturally cozy and comfortable for me hey reys uh can you please go grab something over there for me sure yeah whatever man all right yeah yeah I don't even I didn't even notice it was so low until he walked in you know tell me this I mean did you really have to go this full Lord of the Rings hog okay I know we're basically Hobbits yeah I know do you even actually have an Irish accent or is that just a bit you're putting on I can't not do an Irish jaon in all seriousness this feels
borderline obsessive like after work you just come home every day and read Lord of the Rings I've never read any of them my girlfriend is a big uh collector here Emma is she loves Lord of the Rings all that stuff but she's also a big reader so you can see over there I'm very dyslexic so I've only read probably four books in my entire life you roll of course so okay I'll tell you something right there's a bit of a theme we're standing right by the Light I swear to God Andrew he's actually really great
when he's behind the camera really good sense of awareness on the set it's literally the opposite my girlfriend's also Swedish so there's a mix of Ireland and Sweden in here that Swedish berries yeah oh I mean these aren't actually Swedish are they the fish ones are yeah how did he beat me Tuda these are really famous in Sweden I don't know why since we're over here why don't we take a look at your setup uh this oh this isn't your Wi-Fi password it is yeah get rid of that yeah
I don't have a router so it's so your neighbor's Wi-Fi so it's your neighbor's Wi-Fi my landlord and he lives upstairs there's a lot of that kind of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] going on so yeah speaking of stealing let's see if we can find anything that Andrew lifted from work like say for example this project mat like I brought that for this did you pay for it no sounds like stolen thanks Adam see he shot a fair number of these so he knows what I'm going to be looking for for I bet he didn't think I'd be looking for
this this believe it or not that's something that we just have I kind of like things the way they are you know what I mean organized slash mhm you know he doesn't need multiple kinds of cereal he just needs cereal he likes it the way it is yeah I like everything the way it is which is why I take it out of the bag it comes and to put in a different jar what I gather then from the stealing of the neighbor's Wi-Fi and all of that is that while you haven't taken anything from the office it's more to do with
that none of it entices you no offense to the office office right but no it's just not my thing oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] straight away right there you go yeah that belongs to the office there's no way you bought medical tape no what about second roll of tape we don't use that what about Ridge wallet I mean sure say they could have it yeah found an international power cord I'm International I have no idea what's in there I've heard that before Oh okay it's my old laptop this was my
main editing rig when I used to work for myself and at the past company funny story um I found this laptop by watching your videos basically back in 2017 yeah not this particular one I don't think you ever had anything to do with with this laptop in particular but I knew what specs to look out for all that kind of thing just thanks to that yeah now you give people the tech tips let's take a look at the rig upgrade do you use this for editing or gaming or what yeah editing video editing it's kind of mid
tier I I used to do freelance work but right now I'm I just do it for pleasure so now um why do you have a low profile cooler in here this is yeah inexpertly built oh okay with all due respect what the actual heck is going on with the front of this computer it's been moved from there to there and I never noticed that there was so much dust at the front of it we're getting rid of it who cares sure are I noticed you're going for a significantly smaller build with the Loki ghost S1 yes indeed want to
downsize want to make more room on our desk over there for crafts and things like that and uh also you're into crafting are you yeah a little bit it's more my girlfriend but yeah I I craft a bit you know well I will now that I have all this new stuff what are you going to make the plan is like stickers like merch but not to sell like just for her friends and stuff like that that kind of thing okay but what are you going to craft I'm probably going to craft some sort of decals for my bike I would come
up with a name of like the crew make a sticker for it and put it on all the stop signs and stuff oh don't admit F [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I don't care what are you going to do you I mean I'm not from  don't why don't we get the build started so you're reusing your old GPU but basically everything else is new so ryzen 9700x that aligns well with the goal of video editing so we got 8 cores Zen 5 architecture you've got what I assume is going to be 32 gigs of RAM here nailed it 4 tbte SSD who needs that
kind of solid state storage I actually don't think I asked for that it says on your parts say 2 terabytes so I don't know if you get to keep that it's in the pile I'm keeping it you know what I mean I picked this um when we did Emily's gaming van I took I took a photo of the motorboard and I was like that is going to be perfect and then big fat 850 W power supply I asked Adam about this Adam's here that's the one isn't it yes that's that's the one so apparently this will fit how about this before we start
the build let's go take a look at some of the bike upgrades for sure wait I missed the office theft that was right in front of me he's been wearing our cargo pants since long before they came out oh yeah and you know what these are my second pair I offered to test them because we like to put batteries and all that crap in our pockets so yeah good pants though available now LTT store.com this is my bike you might recognize it I do um it's an sv650s yes s stands for Less comfortable
than the regular one yeah it pretty much does but you look so much cooler it's it's a pretty cool bike yours I think is a 2003 yeah 2003 this is a 2010 this is a really late for this um type I don't think they kept making the S after this year this is a smart choice because mine doesn't have abs exactly was probably the biggest change that they made from 2003 to now in terms of bike safety and um yeah this guy doesn't have it are this a brake fluid reservoir right there's always something covering it I
have no idea why I was driving down Highway 1 and someone recognized the LTT on it no way yeah all right do me a favor buddy uh go get a piece of wood yeah you bet yeah we've canadianized him he calls people buddy now yeah buddy hey buddy hey buddy oh I went the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] biggest piece you could find F oh my God what are we changing then not much actually uh I've got a top box that I'll show you that normally goes on the back here M we're going to try and make it so
that we can have camera equipment with us on the tours but for the bike itself we're going to put decals on the wheels like Rim tape and stuff like that cool all right I'm not sure they sent over two well you got two wheels don't you well well you see I hope so because they're very different colors what do you prefer this one's rubbish yeah isn't it yeah I mean and it's a far completely different Andrew look who theck is Andrew George definitely not me that's a real British
name okay do you think he's having a go at you he might be having a go yeah he's from Sweden though oh there's a lot of Swedish people in my life I don't know how to happen but it's not designed for Hobbits this one all right help me here okay right okay actually helpful mate I'm allowed to give him [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about being short oh God oh wait did you want me to let go of the break when we were doing that I hope you're I hope you're a joking it' be the first time someone's been fired on their
upgrade shoot you know what I mean me oh no it'll be me I'm telling you lmg Dogg floatplane float plane exclusive why does Andrew trying to put the bike on yeah this is this is bull yeah little oh yeah yeah keep it going no wonder so many people quit after we do these things he told me that he didn't real yeah there's no way I'm going to let that make the cut okay can I help with anything like wait that was it you're just going to give it a wipe down that was the dry there's so much dust on
it it's barely even cleaner than your computer what do we think WD40 probably I mean that'll clean it but then how do we clean off the WD40 it's a bit of a pain in the ARs I lick it off I love it don't do that H I'll go get another cloth Please Don't Spray the brake with this you spray a Brak yet just saying spray the break with the wd4 it's probably going to be fine I'm not going to help you with anything Don't Spray the break this is what it's meant to look like we'll show you in a second wa
that's cool I don't think we're getting that effect dude these are giant freaking stickers getting these perfectly aligned is going to be a thing okay well one thing I got figured out already is this yeah goes here on the rim so why don't we start with that I'm probably going to screw it out you know what it already looks good I mean sure maybe that's all we need we are going to have a conversation once you've done that first one though about what it's going to look like okay
conversation yeah you're in trouble it's not bad I mean that's on yeah that's pretty that looks good why don't we only do this but we do all the wheels with this oh okay wait no now I'm super confused because we totally have enough of these ones to do both Wheels yeah this is enough I hope it's enough okay then we're good so somebody probably looked at that straight away and knew that we had enough and now we look like two yeah do you want Reese to do the stickers no wow rude okay let's see what
these guys are up to hold on we'll come back to the stickers wow the mod mat ended up on my on my yeah cuz it's heat resistant so if I turn the stove on it should be totally no the ghost S one is very small yeah uh luckily this is a customade cooler from noctu that's designed specifically for this case really they did that yep they modified it it's the ghost S1 Edition I will say this is my first time really getting work done with the Precision kit uh-huh the magnetic lid is so amazing that's
the screws from the motherboard that's screws for the case and they're they're in that cooler going to handle the 9700 X okay yeah it should right right it's freaking that's why we went new you can decide which power profile you want to use the stock 65 wat profile or AMD now warranties a 105 watt profile that increases performance compared to our original review but obviously it's going to run a little hotter all right why don't we get back to sticker time sure yeah this Adam seems to have this under
control good going to come off yeah she's going she's going what am I doing sure you ready yeah here we go first spin ow I can't spin it it's hard I mean that looks all right doesn't it right yeah I I was real skeptical about this when I saw it like yeah it's all right that's actually not bad that looks good yeah [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what your side is better than my side yeah but my side I put the thing in the wrong spot yeah there's plenty of time for mine to get
worse there's definitely a few more bubbles in it this time and I think that from 6 ft away you know next to you in traffic that's not going to be noticeable you never know what these AMD upgrade videos are going to devolve into this is like 20% actual Tech hardware and like 80% putting stickers on a motorcycle I'm not going to lie I was a little bit worried because like I'm not like a techy I don't know mechanical stuff is more my interest you know what I mean well that's the thing that I
think a lot of our content misses the point of sometimes is that Tech is a means to an end yeah it's not just for the sake of tech like why are we doing this so that we can like Vlog our touring and like edit it together and that's why we need a good computer not because we just like to look at the computer what do you think it's not great because of the there's a thing here oh yeah wow no you actually it yeah now watch me do it even worse it's not a competition that's who
could do it worse please just always drive in the right lane I I I will oh she's perfect why didn't I think of this why am I putting all this work into painting just stickers on it I have little girls so my experience putting stickers on things appears to be uh pretty aced here compared to the average compar to what to what compared to the average dude I'm not average this is coming together great yeah I get why Andy doesn't like working in it though it's very cramped and you basically have
one or order that you can do things in so if you mess up one step you're going to find yourself pulling something like three or four things out just to fix it it looks great though it looks really cool yeah the cooling is even not going to be that bad he's got the 92 mil on the CPU Cooler over there big 120 mm cooler on the power supply that's what I love about sfx L that was a Silverstone Innovation taking the sfx form factor which is limited to a 92mm fan and just Mak it a little bit bigger allowed them
to squeeze those lowprofile 120 mm fans in there yeah because this is a Platinum efficiency power supply it's going to be dead quiet sick want to see a minor  sure okay well no no it'll go it'll go yeah I just want to I need to get this stuff and also before I close anything up we got to do a a boot just to make sure that everything's still good wise yeah this is always the scariest part of doing a case short circuit cuz either you're done or it's going to be like another
hour that's a good sign what you you just did it without even telling the camera guy you're going to turn the thing J A Moment of Truth act like everything's going great hey how's it going great apparently yeah well the bike looks good yeah yeah yeah why don't you go look at it somewhere why don't you go show the people your camera equipment you got and go take some pictures ofik fully functioning I guess I'm on my own here they're finished both front and back I think they look good
it's a little oh it's going great computer's going great it's a little not bad it only wobbles a little yeah it's only a little it's a lot less than my paint job did okay I got this this with the bike it doesn't look great or anything like that but you know it is for traveling and things yeah let's show them how much storage this bike has on its own look at my all my camera gear and that's the included toolkit so like 48 L goes on here yeah this is a camera insert from moments I got exactly cuz
we're going to velcro it so I'm going to get these power Banks so I can charge my stuff on the move I got a cardo this is a Bluetooth speaker that goes in your helmet and it's a communication device and means that on my way into work for example I can listen to music do you want to describe what that camera is nope okay I don't know what it is it's a DJI action 4 they brought out a five but I was too late but also I didn't really I don't need the five I'm getting uh ND
filters so I can keep the shutter speed the way I want to cinematic and then I got this um mic adapter and I'm going to run that into my helmet from here oh so that means when I can go around like oh look at the view people or people I'm probably not going to share any of that stuff but like I don't know there's a lot of noise out there you know I don't don't know if want to I don't know if people want want to see it maybe sure well you know that now that you've said that the entire comment section is be
upload it upload it do it do it um I got this one from chin mounts it'll actually fit my specific model helmet oh cool it'll go here oh yeah okay that's why they call them chin mounts all right let's dude you're going to be looking at your tank here to about here oh okay so I could see like here but what if we did hang it upside down we could try that oh yeah better yeah yeah that's pretty good you can see the instrument cluster and you can also actually see anything like
I can see up to here oh perfect yeah nice wide angle you can see any like leprechauns that are running by and Jam rocks he can't get down from there so  safe anyway we got to figure out the audio setup though yeah I know since we're in here do you want to talk about some of the upgrades that aren't for you like this Cricket oh my goodness they've gotten really small yes I actually edited yvon's cricked short circuits that she did oh really and ever since then I was like you should get one of
these things to to Emma right but we worked out that that the one that Ivonne had or has still is just too big so yeah we got the joy extra or something like that it's called I actually have no idea how these things work well you can put a cutting thing you can put a pen thing you can put like just like various ends on it and it's basically just a CNC controlled head moves around but that's the point of the iPad there we go yeah yeah so we got an iPad iPad Air yeah and the pencil grab the pencil pencil yes
and then so we draw Pencil and then print speaking of printing uh you decided to go back to what like the 9s and buy a printer yes this is another thing that uh is going to go with all our crafts the best thing about this was I got multiple messages on teams when it came in and every a lot of people were like I can't believe you got a printer yeah like I in like that was like well done almost Rockstar move you know you got one of the ecotank models from Epson so you can actually
print pretty copious amounts of stuff with these and it's pretty economical the only drawback as we covered recently is that if you don't print something for a while it can get clogged like any inkjet would but if you guys are printing out stickers or printing out transfers or you whatever else then uh yeah pretty much the way to go yeah yeah yeah did we figure out what was going on or was it just that he was running an older platform from some other maker and it just started working and I didn't
question it oh I'll get started on putting this cardo on here I'm just a little confused by this because I got the male side of the velcro here okay I got the soft side here but there's already there's already a thing oh dude is this going to be that easy done it just goes in there like that that's too easy oh yeah because that to kind of yeah just kind of stuff it in there and then we'll put this over top and that'll probably like kind of mash it in there there we go all right
yeah what do you think there yeah like just somewhere like not stupid looking wait no don't what if I was serious then you would have just done it tell me right now if you don't want me to do it no it's great tell me right now yeah no no it's good it's good all right we're going to have to beep so much of this video because of this this guy get your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] swearing under control give me this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] thing I don't I really don't want to swear that much it's just you're you
infu yay okay there so go on there jeez it's not great looking though is it beautiful I can you show it to the showing it to everybody but poor poor Glenn's like trying to do a maneuver sorry this looks like it's going well oh yeah it's great look at that 72° in FM mark on the GPU what's our CPU doing 86 86 I'll take it all core load turboing to 4.5 he's running at full Expo speeds it's a it's pretty pretty nice rig you got oh no you didn't leave it in 65 watt mode it's doing 88 Watts yeah let it do
PBO let's go now I would never call you cool but this may be the single coolest USB drive hey how much do you like this lamp being right here why do you need to move his lamp yeah I don't know cuz there's just not really a good spot to put his speakers unless we put them on the side by I don't I'm worried if we have enough room they look good though don't they the speakers sure yeah they like how to tell a friend/ colleague you think they made a terrible decision with only the tone of your
voice look at him and facial expression there are worse speakers out there are worst looking speakers but there are better ones of course and that that's a longer list do you remember where I'm from Glenn I do somewhere miserable and rainy so that narrows it down to somewhere on on this island somewhere rural it's not that rural which narrows it down to this island this island somewhere killmore no Ral it's right there okay all right that was close shout out Ral I was within what like an
hour yeah geog guesser that'd be a pretty okay score yeah there it is perfect ah not bad right it really is not bad yeah see see if it goes on okay oh sorry am I a up in your space here it's okay I got a helmet on I guess I'll just um talk for a minute and then okay I'll I'll blow air you like on the road  raining okay and get off the yeah you cut me off I cut your face I'm real happy I had this down yeah this I mean well we'll have to you'll have to go out for a spin and we'll have
to put that in here obviously yeah yeah actually seems like the mic that I'm using is too hot I might come back out tomorrow and uh shoot some more stuff tomorrow this is just Bluetooth I think there maxes out like four people which is not bad right and the r but the range is still pry not yeah the higher end version of these has has mesh technology so then like you could lead a group of like 15 people or something like that you know and it has much better range okay I got speakers on yeah no oh is it
working yeah okay my god oh okay that's  okay that sounds very serviceable from the distance I'm at why don't we talk about your lens yes please when you were here earlier you saw my camera equipment set up here yeah I picked up this lens and you said you got it for like $4 or something yeah well it was like 15 or something most of my lenses I use um manual focus lenses my camera brand of choice pan Sonic Lumix isn't known for having the best autofocus sure they're getting better but um I've always wanted
a 24 to 70 last item for the non- gamer I want to get into gaming okay you know this is like a terrible time to buy a Nintendo switch right I didn't buy it though thank you very appreciative yeah you managed to buy the one console that's not powered by AMD semic custom silicon but sure yeah they got a shout out look at a look at how compact we could only do that because they're a chip no that's no that is actually yeah really good power efficiency and all that yeah okay fine all right let's get
this switch set up and let's see how bad of a gamer he is oh my God you'll have to one one me Mario Kart it comes with Mario Kart yeah all right let's go it didn't occur to you at any point to upgrade your TV as part of this did it no do you know that you only have two HDMI inputs and you're using both of them um wait wait is this running upstairs through the wall to your neighbor yeah that's with the cable box yeah that's how I watch One Moment of Truth for the heckes by edifier what do you think for their
price they uh make noise they're fine for most people they're not going to offend anybody on most people okay here we go okay I still I've already what so X is go this is the last piece of the upgrade so you set an alarm gradually turns on and it gives like a a sound similar to the the sound machine I have over there cool everything's touchable so if the lights are bothering you you just go like oh I pissed it off broke it already I take a phone call and come back in everybody's piled into the bedroom what
is going on here thought you left I'm very Charmed okay get out I have a good idea and after a long day of upgrading  sweet dreams you've worked really hard today thanks for watching this AMD upgrade if you enjoyed it why not watch another shh though he's sleeping so cute
