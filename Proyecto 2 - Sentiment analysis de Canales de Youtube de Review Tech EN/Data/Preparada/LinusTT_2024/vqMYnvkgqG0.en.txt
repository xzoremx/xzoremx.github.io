I see you on the social media with your gaming rigs you don't know how to stay humble but I do and it's all thanks to my friend Amed from ABK case his humble computer cases will take your ego from Elon Musk to Keanu Reeves in two weeks flat or your money back but what exactly is humble about this I mean he certainly isn't referring to the Quality at $330 it's among the price here options for cases but it looks and feels topnotch deserving of the premium and besides if you don't have that kind of money his
store features a wide variety of designs for as low as $110 I mean pretty good for a smalltime entrepreneur and a local metal shop taking on the big players in the case Market maybe that's what he means so you just stand there mute I guess okay he says his cases are handmade and powdercoated and unlike some random drop shipper I was not able to find his product on AliExpress and he has hundreds of satisfied customers if his Etsy reviews are anything to go by so I can't wait to build my humblest
computer ever starting with these goldplated fittings these look sick but they don't really say humble do they no but neither is this segue to our sponsor ug green with its 12 gen Intel processor expandable 8 gigs of ddr5 memory integrated AI smart assistant and more there's a lot to love about their Nas sync dxp 6800 Pro stay tuned to learn more or check it out at the link in the  description our relationship with a got off to a bit of a rocky start when we overpaid for our humble Case by about
$50 on eBay when we reached out to him through Etsy and asked hey what the heck is up with that he explained that that's just because of eBay's higher seller fees since we were in contact we followed up with hey who the heck are you and why are you making these cases and the story is fascinating he let us know that he currently operates in a small machine shop in Turkey where he's been making his own PC cases for about four years now in that time ABK has expanded their lineup to include
wall-mounted cases like this one and even some open concept desktop cases the configuration we went with includes two large cutouts on the top for radiators as well as well I don't want to spoil it let's show you guys how it goes together we're going to kick things off with this Maximus z790 hero motherboard from Asus which comes in at a modest $550 not quite 1%er yet no but you're definitely in the single digits look In fairness to us AMT says this computer was I quote made to hang
computer parts on the wall and enjoy a magnificent view well gosh darn it if that's what it was made for then EK did the right thing hooking us up with all these goldplated fittings I'm going to stop you right there lonus uh we recorded this video a few weeks ago and used a bunch of parts from Ek since filming there have been allegations of mistreatment from ek's staff and our friends in the industry we hope we can remove this disclaimer in the future but now back to the video bo boy did they
ever sent a lot though we're going to use as many as we can no bends no B every Bend Will Be A fitting we're going to be scuba diving safe okay cuz we're not going to get the bends it's a scuba diving illness don't worry about it it doesn't have it's not funny then stop saying them never oh shoot is that a GPU block that's a mono block baby wait for what the motherboard well you also have a CPU block yeah you get to pick I think we should go mono block okay we were going to go with a core I9 139900 K 8
performance course 16 e course boost clocks of up to 5.8 GHz but then we thought that's not humble no so instead we've gone with the 14900 KS the fastest chip in Intel's lineup it turbos to over 6 gahz under extremely specific circumstances this is not nearly as monol blocky as I was expecting it to be in the old days you'd have motherboard monol blocks that covered the whole fraking thing including the chipset and whatever uh this is just the CPU and vrm so this is not too much work to install
what stop you're going to break the board I am so confused right now look H goes down on a threaded nut oh get the nutshot or if this goes well maybe I'll Water cool my computer for my AMD upgrade no I forbid it why I got drawn you  there we go beautiful just look at us screwing together sorry does this go here no where here no here boom done no oh isn't that worth the install of the mono block oh yeah it looks great oh my God look at how blinged out these ones are didn't
you tell me that some of these are like fake ones yeah the Chrome ones they're just dummy sticks oh but we wanted the visuals of the Chrome we're still going with 2 48 gig sticks here I believe "they're at 6,800 megga transfers per" second so these are some pretty fast 48 gig sticks then yes they are there's a good time to point out the tolerances cuz sometimes these Indie like case manufacturers can really struggle with getting all the tolerances lined up so be interesting to see how the
motherboard screws down not great look at this one oh wow yeah it's pretty crooked also I couldn't help noticing that these standoffs are so short that the back plate actually kind of interferes with them there's a bit of a spring action here wait I have a question for you how did we not go with gskill Trident Z Royal they haven't made DDR 5 yet really yeah they've only made the ddr4 kits oh cuz that would have been the humblest of all memory you could have actually gotten it like gold
to match the fittings everyone knows that the Royals are known for their humility you're going to notice we have two ssds here lus humble yeah reason being is one we wanted one that we could water cool obviously to match the theme humble but number two we couldn't actually put it in of these SSD slots because when we Mount our riser to our GPU it would block right so we're going to put our water cooled SSD down here and then our high capacity humble SSD up at the top here nice yeah I'm putting on
the power button right now things are a little DIY but I I like the style yeah it's pretty cool on on that would be on off on off on off on off on off and off on off and off off and off and off and off and off and off off off off the next day now would you look at this it looks great but are you pumped not yet are you I see where you're going with this stupid joke I think this is going to look absolutely sick between this gorgeous Quantum surface radiator from Ek and wow is that a nice looking
res pump combo it actually fits in the radiator slot this is going to be as humble as a computer could possibly be we've even gone with the humblest of fans in the wrong size damn are they I mean are they 120 mm cuz those look like awfully large  mil that's okay making mistakes is how we stay humble are they small and they just come in really big boxes I'm hoping maybe they just have the humblest boxes can't just call everything humble yes oh they are okay oh I was really worried wow
these are heavy they're solid metal orientation wise I'm kind of feeling fan cables down do these oh they got daisy chain oh sweet not as elegant as the Le and Le's it's just with a cable essentially but it still looks really clean speaking of which though uh I'm a little concerned about the air flow behind the case if we either have to push or suck through so I did bring three more fans that we could put Push Pull config to help lift this radiator just a little bit more more um if you
think it's needed I don't think we need it then let's not do it we've got all this ventilation all around here some even at the top here and you would be surprised how little space a fan actually needs above it to suck and blow air so I'm thinking we're going to go pushing air in it's not ideal for maintenance but it looks better and what's more humble than doing whatever it takes to look better that does look beautiful yeah well no beautiful is not quite the right word um what's the word
I'm looking for humble humble so on the ABK website in the area up here where we're putting our RADS they actually just had this like acrylic panel here that wasn't full of anything it had no liquid had no tube Outlets oh that's his whole new thing he's got an acrylic cutter now and he's going to make his own Reservoir yeah I think that's what it's teasing but he doesn't yet doesn't yet so we thought we'd put this in one of these spots but the problem as you'll notice the pump kind
of oh would hit the wall so we actually stole some standoff so we got a dry wall saw we did not cut a hole to make roof in the wall no I mean that's kind of an Elijah solution what we actually ended up doing was we took these standoffs we're going to use these to help prop this up so that way our pump doesn't end up hitting the wall we ended up going with this pre-water block 490 from Ino 3D called the eye chill frostbite it's got 24 gigs of vram it's flipping fast it's super clean looking H well it's a
little dirty but it's got a clean look to it for mounting we're going to need a couple of brackets oh where are the brackets oh you have brackets this is the support bracket cuz it's going to have some sag on it sure is wow is that ever heavy to get the pcie bracket they're actually installed on the underside of this case oh good how convenient yeah this is where all the extra mounting hardare is for all the stuff these are the post for the plexiglass the power supply mhm mhm it's all just
screwed into the back here neat nice now does it come with a pcie riser or do we just BYO BYO we had to bring our own not great for the price crap this Riser so long no no that's fine cuz here's what we're going to do okay uh just leave it okay y oh yeah see not so bad we'll just kind of flatten a little bit back there so go ahead and plug that into the bottom of the card and okay I'll just take up whatever extra slack we have okay stop yeah okay stop you have it lined up how are
you not able to put it in I don't know oh I didn't uncp the PCI clip okay oh shoot what we didn't put the SAG bracket on first why we need to why we can get in there just give it a little no stop oh my God is uh that supposed to happen when you're screwing something in I don't think so is the other half in  we're just going to turn it into a 632 hole we're just going to drive that in there and it broke off no no no after just half a dozen extra steps we're back to where we started with an M3 threaded
hole I do take shortcuts sometimes and sometimes they end up being long cuts but you know what are we having fun exactly no I'm actually asking are are  exactly nice I do want to check out the power supply at some point but I want to   yes yeah sure okay we've gone with the RG Thor 1600 watt titanium and I know what you guys are thinking 80 plus titanium efficiency a 10-year warranty that's not humble but don't worry we've got a plan we've replaced the stock cables with these gold and silver cable
mod ones with their Pro Series cable Combs humble oh my God come on just it's too shy and humble can't just call every part humble yes I can when you're humble like me you can do whatever you want it's actually kind of funny that we started out building a humble computer and it built a humble us so this is why I always come back to water cooling it's a pain in the butt like this is going to look really good I know right and humble do you know how much these fittings cost would you like to
know I would guess a humble $12 each damn bang on really yeah they're $12 each I'm really good at guessing this kind of thing it's one of my most humble skills I think we're going to have to do some bends I don't think there's any avoiding it yeah a I think we should do a 90 here okay then a fitting okay then a straight then a 90 here then a Bend okay that's the way okay yes Dad I prefer Papa I've told you that no you've actually said you prefer Daddy but I have said neither
of those things we're joking yeah you're a kid to me so calling him dad's appropriate then mhm I prefer Daddy no yes daddy wait you have to put fittings in this yeah I thought the two that's why I said like this this this and this was going to be a bit much that looks amazing okay that's that's going to be a long run that might that run might be too long right there in the middle of the span so dumb oh wait there's one thing I forgot this not humble can you get me a  please want to learn to bend tubes sure
I guess we are now let do it let's do it so what we want to do is we want to heat up the tube kind of evenly around not just in one spot because then things get a little kinky oh yes okay two things one do not lose any of these O-rings okay it will leak all over the place big mess everyone dies number two you got to note the depth that it goes into the fitting okay there see that now it's in oh okay so now noting how deep it goes into the fitting we got to figure out where we want to cut it off to in
order to achieve the height that we want  it collar goes there so this is a potential problem when you have really short runs the collar can't really sit on the bent part cuz it's not round anymore so realistically about there is about as short as you can reasonably go okay there you go you did your first Hardline run I mean you did it yeah you in the sense that like you were there okay it's like working with Dad you know yes oh whoops sorry Dad this extension is so stupid it's a $30 bling
attachment humility attachment oh sorry stay humble all right you B on it this  shoot your going like a sag because it's so heavy look at that run though okay is that sick or what God I can't believe how humble this computer is what is this what's what why aren't they the same height doesn't matter once again this PC has now claimed three people it's making humble I feel very humble right now there you go wiring is complete almost what are you doing well I need the STA power for
the pump that is not a humble cable I don't know where the rest of the cables went close your eyes search for your inner humility and the cable location will reveal itself to  eyes do you see it no oh okay I'm calling that good enough which one oo I know this should be a little shorter o it's pretty obvious yeah all right fine yeah I got to take this off I would say acknow in your own stupidity pretty very humble yeah damn it okay go do writer me no I want to finish this run how about you do this
one Elijah okay so basically it goes up and over so you can use this piece for that just put a Bend right in the middle okay and then just adjust your length until you're high enough to make it over to here with a Bend that's going to be the Saga you guys Elijah doing one Bend in this machine well two yes okay why do you why is that tube so short cuz he I'm doing just a little Bend here yeah you okay so if you do it with a really short tube you're going to make it really hard
on yourself cuz this is the one you told it's going to be very hard to not heat the entire okay okay okay the one he told me to use here let's use this one this will be ow it's hot and then you just do a  it you never done this before have you  all right let's pull this sucker ow it's really hot I swear there's a reason we keep him around that's pretty cash money right there you know what it's a it's a little high but I think I'm okay with it oh it's too short proud of you Elijah is
what I would say if I was proud of you oh my God I am really nervous about doing this Bend does that look good Glenn what do you think Buddy wow no response thanks okay I'm really confident now cool that's not terrible it's not terrible oh look at this look at this this looks sick he still doesn't get it sorry what am I missing you're  God if you're doing this at home kids put paper towel around the areas you want to protect we can lay this back down be watching for leaks Elijah what
the hell what the I'm trying to plug in the fans no we can't lay back down we can't fill it like that hit the power switch and then we turn it on and hope that nothing  humility okay it's the humblest of computers it has a no working power button did it accidentally get unplugged no unfortunately the wires that are inside that little connector didn't get folded correctly so the connector started sliding off when we tried shoving it back on it just fell apart okay so we
have found a couple of quality issues as we've made our way through the build but the good good news is that we have a humble motherboard with a humble power button right there and that's no harder to reach than that if we're being realistic this is up there my man it looks well it's not up there yet we're going to put it up there on the wall yes we are oh that looks sick does it leak no I don't see anything I mean I hope wow that looks flipping awesome okay so Elijah is this the part where we fix
Jake's nonsense on this run here it's too long here and too long here comes  that do you want to judge my two bends I'd love to this one and this one that is really wow what what a radius you've got there yeah to be fair I have no excuse it was it was my first Bend guys you got one word to describe this computer what is it humble see what's one word for black and gold um brilliant I don't know we need a desk yeah we'll drag a desk in after oh okay is that what makes the setup humble
there's no desk or no it's made to look at not to game on right now normally oh you'll actually notice there's three almost like nail cut outs as if you were to like hang it like a picture frame right I didn't trust that on our fake Studio walls right that's fair so I had Logistics Mount this piece of 2x4 that's got a little slit in it yeah so we're  one thing we didn't um anticipate you can see the wood right through oops oh yes wow don't draw attention to it it's good
it's good we got to fire this up yeah we  okay whoa wow that is humble yeah it is uh oh we need a humble chair oh that one okay well you have to sit back and admire it looks so good it's the perfect angle who needs to look at the monitor when your PC looks like this let's go I mean 60 FPS on these settings is pretty  baby you see these guys dodging into the car oh wow that one guy ended up under it and he gets up what a tank are you kidding me holy humble watch him get up
again he got up again that's not humble buddy okay how about this guy how about this guy right here look at this humble white suit B I love this machine it definitely needs two RADS and then a pump res combo right there but I got to give props to a met the design actually solid pretty easy to build in pretty intuitive and while there's definitely some things that he could do better now that I got a closer look at the powder coating job yeah and it could be quite a lot better overall I kind of love it it
looks really good it's a really great layout and again they have all the different layouts as well so if you don't even want this size they have some that are about half as big so you can do like a mini ITX version yeah I mean it wouldn't be humble but it'd be something just like this humble segue to our sponsor you green their nasn dxp 6800 Pro data management solution is fully loaded with a 12g Intel processor and 8 gigs of ddr5 memory Expendable to 64 gigs this along with two 10 gig
