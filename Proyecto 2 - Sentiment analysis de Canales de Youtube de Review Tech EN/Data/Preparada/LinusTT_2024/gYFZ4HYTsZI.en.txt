between all the sponsored products and the army of brands that you've never heard of before shopping on Amazon these days sucks especially if you're new to PC Building look at this I searched for graphics card and with prominent placement like this how could I possibly know that showkings is not a reputable brand of GPU I mean is the Radeon rx580 even getting driver updates anymore not since January it's ridiculous it makes you wonder just how bad of a PC would you get if you just searched for each
product category bought the first thing on the list and threw it all together I want to know so I'm going to find out right wait radon ampere architecture that's an Nvidia ar oh man these guys are ridiculous okay sorry right now and here it is everything from my Wu power  high quality video card there is one thing missing though it's a segue oh no here it is to our sponsor acronis in an age where the slightest infrastructure vulnerability could open the door to cyber attacks or unrecoverable data loss
acronis cyber protect has your back check it out using our Link in the video description let's kick things off with the only non-sponsored item that managed to top our search results or at least sort of top them because the ryzen 7 5800 X was the only actual CPU that showed up when we typed in CPU it turns out the Amazon search engine is kind of like your Boomer Uncle offering up a selection of random entire computers when you search for CPU processor meanwhile does give us some sponsored
results but the rule of the game was we had to buy the first valid result for the first keyword we tried so ryzen 7 5800 X it is at just $170 it's a great chip for the price and a solid start to what has now become an am4 Journey however if you want something a bit more affordable Central Processing Unit comes up with the 5600x which includes a wraith stealth cooler for Extra Value moving on to our motherboard the Asus Prime b550m a WiFi 2 was sponsored and was the first of our many sponsored
results we'll talk about what this sponsored tag means a little bit later but for now it's not really a problem while this board may not have the highest end features like pcie Gen 5 it's certainly a decent board and should fit perfectly into the vast majority of PC cases next up ddr4 Ram Nets us a pretty decently specked kit from oh boy oloy well thankfully whether you've heard of them or not they seem to be a perfectly cromulent memory supplier not only are they extensively reviewed on
"Amazon with this kit having almost 8,000" ratings but Tom's Hardware ran an article a few years ago with promising results that is at least until they looked into support oloy describes their warranty as limited lifetime but doesn't elaborate on their website on what exactly those limits are and when Toms reached out they discovered that they only provide brand new replacements for any failed sticks for one year and after the third year they reserve the right to charge you for any repairs technically
that can legally be described as a limited lifetime warranty it just demonstrates that ol's attitude toward customer service is less trust me bro and more good luck bro what about storage oh another good result with the crucial t500 2 TB at the top of our list it's got 4.7 stars with over 3200 ratings and the bad ones are mostly upset about DOA drives which do happen from time to time and the lack of an included m.2 screw though In fairness to crucial SSD mounting hardware is
supposed to be included with your motherboard so once again I'm happy with Amazon search results they're they're three for four wait a second does my motherboard include SSD mounting hardware it's certainly not on the board and I don't remember seeing any accessories in here oh there they are yep we're good of course if you've spent more than 2 minutes on Amazon in the last year you knew that wasn't going to last forever so let's see our result for CPU Cooler ah the SE 214 XT RGB from ID
cooling I mean I actually can't really fault the value here four heat pipes $18 that's like $450 a heat pipe and it's got a respectable 4.6 star rating with most of the complaints focusing on what I feel are insignificant issues like a cheap feeling back plate and uh oh bad instructions oh and not receiving am4 mounting hardware uh one moment please this looks pretty complete fan mounts am4 mounting but it looks like they're right there's no instructions oh guys you got to look inside the Box the
instructions are right  there yeah as long as you find all the pieces this is a pretty nice package at 20 bucks though that still doesn't make it an obvious win cuz for just $15 more you can get a Peerless assassin and that's a really nice cooler in fact Amazon seems to acknowledge this because a couple results down they've got that one tagged as their overall pick with that said it's not like modern AMD CPUs need a ton of extra cooling for overclocking or anything so this could
end up being the best bang for the buck only the results will tell and look at that it has addressable RGB on the fan moving on to our case whoa antech these guys might have had the spotlight stolen by newer players like fractal Corsair and fantex but personally I will always remember them fondly and after getting acquainted with the df700 I might just have some fondness today for just 90 bucks you get five total cooling fans three with RGB on the front all hooked up to a nice addressable RGB fan
controller and it's got a front panel mesh built-in cable ties a removable hard drive sled and while we don't get rubber grommets for our cable management the cutouts are rounded so you're not going to scratch or cut either yourself or your cables it's even got a bit of side ventilation for your power supply and any hard drives you want to Chuck in there very tasteful very cool what's not to like well individual front panel headers though that's still common in most cases and not all motherboards use
the same layout so I actually back antech here someone got a dented bottom some faulty fans and lights o one person got a Fan Hub though was allegedly so defective it burnt not one but two motherboards and a power supply and as for the middling reviews most of them thought it was nice but a tad expensive for what it is which is fair but if you catch it on sale what a deal now we've just got to power the thing and that's where our PSU the xpg core reactor 2 comes in this is another sponsored
result and while xpg might not be familiar to you they are a branch of a data that has actually been around since 2008 this fully modular 650 W 80 plus gold unit was just $83 which seems fine we haven't tested any xpg power supplies yet but the reviews all seem pretty decent and the community seems to like them overall and this one comes with a 10-year warranty however and this is a big however we found quite a few complaints about either poor warranty in RMA support or customers receiving not
one but two units that were Dead on Arrival so maybe you should stick with less sponsored more trusted Brands like EVGA or cic that wasn't an option for us though now these days you might be thinking 650 Watts that's a little on the low side but uh foreshadowing with this cable I'm running here let me put it this way we aren't going to be needing any more power than that meet the show Kings RX 580 sponsored I'm talking a GPU that literally isn't even getting driver updates 8 gigs of vram on
a 256-bit bus PCI Express gen 3 oh but this is nice dual fans for office and gaming and a DVI connector for those of you out there like me who buy their monitors out of people's garages this has got to be remanufactured I've never even heard of showkings but maybe that's just because they're ahead of enjoyment and led the trend I've just fallen behind so uh settle down slap this 7-year-old GPU in your system and uh call it a day I guess or maybe don't in all seriousness I can't think of a good
reason to buy from these guys when there are so many other options out there searching for them online brings up almost nothing except is this brand legit posts like we couldn't even find a company website and most of our onear reviews here have to do with the cards dying over time you're honestly probably better off just buying something used on eBay Facebook Marketplace or our recent sponsor of scrapyard 9 Java but we didn't have that option and thanks to Amazon sponsored
products here we are which I guess it's time for us to address the way it works is basically Sellers from around the world will place bids on specific keywords in order to help surface their products when you include those keywords in your searches generic keywords like CPU or Ram are generally more expensive while more specific keywords cost less and I know that most if not all of you watching right now are Savvy enough to not just buy the first thing you see but you would be surprised by how many
people do Amazon claims that the sponsored product system helps turn browsers into buyers they also claim that because sponsored products only appear when in stock and include trusted Amazon shopping attributes that they are helping customers make informed browsing and buying decisions sure because when I buy an rx580 in 2024 I'm informed oh wait we did peripherals too oh now let's check out our peripherals I guess we'll kick things off with the Vue Edge cs24 FK a 24 in 1080P 165 HZ IPS
gaming display unlike show Kings these guys even have a website we can't find this monitor on their website at the time of filming so that's something but realistically at $90 for these specs I don't think the product page is going to change too many people's decision if only the specs were the whole story the onear reviews are hating on everything from the awful speakers to product longevity to viewing angles to response times to you name it uh should we fire it up oh I'm going to need peripherals and
there they are the gaming essentials from Red Dragon red dragon's one of those brands that 5 six years ago we were meing on their you know hardware store level quality but these days they've actually got some pretty decent products it's too bad that this isn't one of them the s113 and whatever this stupid thing is the s113 they're both the s113 they don't feel great but somehow they have "46,000 ratings that's about 10,000 more" than when we first mentioned this combo in our why is everyone buying this
keyboard video about three years ago cool if only people had watched our video well anyway let's try it again shall we it's an m601 Mouse is it though okay that says s 1013 all right fine I mean it's hard to complain for 30 bucks but I'll find a way to the monitor's credit it comes with a pretty nice feeling DP cable and it has dual HDMI inputs it's pretty good and it's light yeah I like the case actually that's really nice to fuse RGB on a $20 cooler too oh man this keyboard is awful don't you
love membrane I'm not even hating on people for having only $30 to spend on a mouse and keyboard dude in scrapyard Wars y I ended up with what a g110 and a g502 for about $30 that's fine you got a budget no problem spend it smart having a tight budget is all the more reason to spend it this is not smart spending this is buying manufactured garbage speaking of buying manufactured garbage what did we pay for this uh something around 800 for the whole setup yeah mouse keyboard monitor $888 about
$890 you know what's funny about that is that is about the budget of the last scrapyard Wars it is actually yeah you're right In fairness this is a way way better CPU than I got but everything else about my system absolutely smokes this thing 370 I had a 370 well what about your drive though you did not have a 2 tab SSD okay that's true but I did have a 256 gig SSD and a 750 GB hard drive unacceptable it's 2024 hard drivve suck for gaming do maternal 1080p medium oh our 1% lows are dipping into like 40
territory that that's it okay we thought it was cuz we didn't have the display turned up to 144 HZ which is all it does over HDMI but that's not it it's that the frame times are so inconsistent that it feels laggy even though the averages are about 100 frames per second interesting yeah it's going as low as like 47 and then it jumps up to 80 90 and then back down to 44 so that's why it feels like under 60 no wait 60 cuz it's all over the place and it looked totally fine like from someone off axis
but yeah playing it I don't know how to explain it just feels bad well the way to explain it is that if you're only getting a frame in the time that it would take to be 40 FPS that means it's taking 20 milliseconds to deliver that frame it's going to feel like lag or like a stutter yeah but it's playable definitely playable not great but playable playable the really bad part is that was Doom internel running at 1080p medium I didn't even have it turned up rx580 was a great GPU Polaris was an
outstanding value proposition was that was a long time ago I think realistically this is a remanufactured mining card so some Miner Farms somewhere is just literally throwing these in the dumpster and then the gpus are getting cut off and they're getting thrown onto new cards and then someone's trying to make a quick Buck on Amazon by selling them as gaming gpus and they'll play games but they are not the best thing that you could buy for this kind of money the question for me is why
bother to remanufacture it like why not just dust it off so that it's less obvious cuz this looks like a new card yeah I guess that's true now it's time for some F1 with a keyboard oh God how do I steer what are your settings I don't know what what's happening right now go to settings I you're going to go off the track right now well I can't steer plof ah what's going on with our keyboard let's check our settings I mean we're running at 100 FPS again okay well yeah turn motion blur off sure yeah yeah yeah
but everything else is set to medium left a few lows here and there that's fine much better break which one's the break oh my god look I don't play a lot of racing games smart guy they even give you a racing line I if I don't know where the break button is then that's not going to help me much is it no we're shooting kind of late we round out of time I really want to check check out a few more games on the rx580 to see if it's actually any good in 2024 let's start with alen wake
2 wow we're not getting much fps let me make sure it's on like a lower setting 720p it's UPC so it's upscaling from 720p with FSR fine R Racing off it's not going to do any RT it's slightly better it's still really not good especially if we're actually rendering closer to  cinematic the game crashed due to graphics card fault and will now exit your pro your progress from last checkpoint has been saved rx580 cannot handle mesh shaders I don't know exactly if this is the issue we're running into
but it's probably a problem all right Allen wake 2 not so good but you know what it's a little older let's try Space Marine 2o that just came out all right you know we've got a solid 29 FP s in game uh 1% lows around 24 and this is 1080p low native so we could be running 720p with some upscaling but uh it's not very good and I'll be honest there's not a lot going on in here um we're let's go fight some tyranids and see if it gets any worse it's honestly not as bad as I
expected we're granted only getting you know 30 35 FPS still but I'm killing tyranids uh there's a lot going on right now and it's a solid 30 so if you're okay with playing space Space Marine 2o 1080p low maybe you should just buy an RX 580 in 2024 it's fine you know you're not getting the same efficiency that you'd get out of a modern card you're not getting the same performance that you'd get out of a modern card but it's fine I wouldn't have any expectations of warranty coverage on this thing either
but it's fine I just hate seeing people get ripped off you know yeah like I don't want to be like oh yeah well you can't even game on it or whatever cuz you can you just didn't get a good deal and that's not the point of this channel right to pump up things that aren't a good deal so overall we did find some good stuff I'm really happy with the case and the CPU solid choice too but other than that I would say maybe just ignore the Amazon sponsored items unless they happen to be exactly what you need
anyway and while we're at it the CPU Cooler might be a diamond in the rough as well we're sitting at 63° right now now arguably this is a game not you know the most demanding thing but for 20 bucks it's hard to complain just like it's hard to complain about this segue to our sponsor Squarespace Tech tips can be very helpful for many things but you won't even need them if you're building a website using Squarespace Squarespace is an all-in-one platform that simplifies the process of
