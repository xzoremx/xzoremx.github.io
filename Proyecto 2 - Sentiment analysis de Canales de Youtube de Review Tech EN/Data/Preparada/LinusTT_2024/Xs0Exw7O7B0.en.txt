show we've got a great show lined up for you guys this week Google's AI overviews feature launched and is doing all kinds of wacky things citing the onion recommending the health benefits of drinking urine um good job Google uh in other news Spotify bricks its thing which is going to make a lot more sense to you if you know what the thing is which we will cover later what else we got today LT released thirdparty investigation summary and the arm with Windows Revolution might come packed
with a privacy nightmare oh yeah that's going to be very interesting we'll talk about  that do I need to oh okay the W show is brought to you by Ridge acronis mend and our new WoW partner secret lab we've been sitting on their chairs for years so it just made sense check them out at the link in the video description to start us off we've got the LTT release thirdparty investigation summary lmg committed to releasing the results when this whole thing started and they did so by posting
it on X formerly known as Twitter the W show is not the place to discuss HR matters so we won't be talking about it here go check it out yourself if you are interested I also need to note that any comments in live chat or merch messages about this topic will just be ignored and any bullying or harassment of any involved party could result in consequences including a permanent ban so let's just not but let us continue on with the show yeah do you want to jump right into Spotify bricking its thing
yeah okay so first of all I had completely forgotten about the car thing yes okay so it's an accessory forget about it I never knew SL infotainment device and the idea was to be able to have Spotify in a car that doesn't have Android auto or doesn't have carplay or maybe you just don't feel like using Android auto or carplay and you just wanted this dedicated device to connect to Spotify and what's kind of cool about it is that people weren't just using it in their cars um I saw was it snowy LS I
don't know it was someone uh someone on the internet um said that they kind of used it in their workshop but basically it was just an interface that allowed you to interface with Spotify um it was invite only and it was launched in April of 20121 and then launched publicly in February of 2022 for $90 it was then pulled from sale just five months later meaning that many de many users who own these devices have had them for less than 2 years and nobody who has one has had it for more than about 3 years now
just this week Spotify okay hold on first of all Spotify began noticing people um that began notifying people that the car thing will be discontinued as of December 9th of this year and it will be rendered completely inoperable so not only are they discontinuing it they are actually going okay this is the date this is the hard date throw it in the garbage it gets better I mean worse sorry worse that was a verbal typo it gets worse Spotify is neither offering a refund nor is it even offering a storing
credit it is basically going hey thanks for your $90 we hope you enjoyed the limited amount of time that you had to own that product that we I don't know I guess this is now a retroactive lease agreement um I think you might have basically just specified this but when was the last what like when could someone have ordered it the same day that it was discontinued no people could have ordered this as recently as March April May June July as recently as the summer of 2022 okay so a little less than two years
ago that's wild though I don't get it I don't understand why like I I could understand saying like Okay we're going to end of life this thing it's not going to receive updates but it would probably keep working for a pretty considerable amount of time uh well yes and no because whatever whatever API hooks it might rely on maybe it doesn't and I mean this is a funny one to me because it is mindblowing to me my understanding and guys correct me if I'm wrong here my understanding is that it's it's just
like an android-based pretty simple thing um so from my point of view I don't really see the reason why this wouldn't have just been like running the Android app in the background and the interface wouldn't have just been the same as any other device in which case to Luke's Point there's no reason it couldn't just keep working for a very long period of time kind of like when Pebble stopped getting updates to the app but dude that worked for years yeah they didn't actually kill it yeah they didn't
actively shut it down um people are trying to sell them I'm finding uh like ebay.ca people are trying to s so the only reason I can think of for them to actively kill it right now would be if they created some kind of custom backend or custom interface for it to interact with and this is something that maybe you can explain to me okay because I don't understand it when I read comments in the YouTube Creator studio app they are oh yeah you you've talked to me yeah I've talked to you about this okay they
are not the same as the ones that are publicly accessible okay so for example if I sort by newest the Creator studio app will be like missing a bunch of them and if I go sort by newest in the on the live site they're all there there there's more of them there why the everloving fck do they have two databases of the comments on this video no no no no no hold on hold on stop typing stop typing stop typing what they're tying I know what they're typing too okay YouTube is a massive
service that has people accessing it from all over the world it operates at a scale that is barely imaginable to the lay person they absolutely have geore replicated servers running their services I get it that's not what this is I don't I don't think it's and I know this I know this for a fact it's it's I'm hooking into a separate for whatever reason that I can't possibly fathom it is it is a sub it's a subset why why would you redo work help me well I don't I don't think
they did redo work um I don't think they're pulling from two different data sets um I'm not necessarily sure what's going on it doesn't make a ton of sense to me but I don't know how the thing is  to have have two solutions pulling in different ways pulling at different times um why the Creator want like you're saying it doesn't have ones that are on the live one that feels almost backwards to me I would feel like the Creator one would pull like more frequently you would think that that's what I would
think so the fact that it works the other way around feels weird to me y I don't know I I can't fully explain it personally like personally I if if I was building this thing I would expect them to act identically well yeah I can understand how there would be two different entire teams like the the team that works on the YouTube studio app is probably a team of people that is completely different why are they doing anything other than tapping into the same API why so they could but they could in
a different way okay why maybe they pull comments less frequently whatever else but why they probably don't talk to each other so they don't necessarily know how  it I would I would think that there would be some form of standardized thing but like I have no idea I haven't worked at a company in that scale and it just doesn't make sense to me at all so I'm trying to make assumptions about something that I I don't get how it would become that way yeah it's a it's a it's a baffling thing dude there was I I
think it's teams not directly communic with each other accessing the same repository but in different ways and that's creating a frustrating experience there was another discrepancy that I found a while back that just completely broke my brain uh I'm going to I'm going to see if I can pull it up because I I sent it to our YouTube rep who is a wonderful human being and one of my favoritest persons that I've ever had the pleasure of dealing with at uh at a tech company  separate I don't
know all right um anyway what is what is the oh yeah yeah yeah here we go here we go so I sent a followup in uh in March uh so a couple of months ago um Creator Studio mobile app shows 98 replies on this thread uh second screenshot is showing everything that shows up when I scroll all the way down come on folks uh so you can have a look at my screenshots here this is the creator studio app so it even managed to log the number of replies there are supposed to be okay and this is oh dang it uh great
here we go and then here is everything that comes up that's all of them that's every reply there is no more room to scroll it's like eight and when I accessed it publicly because the reason the reason that I was that I was drawn to this one in particular was cuz I had replied to it so I replied to it and I was checking I was checking in on replies to my reply cuz it was an active conversation I not only can only see these eight responses I can't see my own  message when had you had sent are those
is there a time thing so are all those messages from before A Certain period of time this is this is what a decent amount of my theory is leaning on so I think those messages are yeah I think it is truncated here but what I can't imagine is any reason why yeah I don't know I just I think I think the whatever's pulling it is not happening at the same rate that it happens on the live no CU I could go back ages later and they still wouldn't be there oh yeah yeah so this this is this is the kind of
stuff you guys think you got your new YouTube interface and you're all mad about that guys that is the least of their problems they can't even figure out how manying comments are in a are in a chain like man I I remember I remember talking to someone someone at YouTube about this years ago I was like look if you guys want to be a social media platform you could be you could be the biggest social media platform like practically overnight but you've got to deal with comments you've got to deal
with user to user interaction because it's it's a cluster bomb right now and to to their credit they've done a lot cluster bom with respect to um with respect to moderation automatic moderation of like um Bots and stuff like that it's not perfect but it's so much better than it was a year or two ago but the fact that they don't have like a pretty bad I can't imagine people aren't posting like asky tanks anymore but there sure is a lot of other spam there's a lot less porn spam a lot
less like way less and it's far less overt there's no more WhatsApp numbers and usernames they have they have cut down on a look what I'm seeing a ton of and I'm seeing this ubiquitously on every video on the platform is is Amazon's groundbreaking new cryptocurrency I haven't actually seen a lot of those lately either sorry guys um is is replies that look extremely real and then you look at the little photo yep and you're like I still come across a lot of those but I see those all the
time dude what's even the point of those got to perform a lot worse yeah those can't be that effective so in terms of cutting down on the I wouldn't be too surprised if there are some but those comments a lot of the time users clicking on profiles hoping sure I look we can acknowledge the improve if didn't work they wouldn't do it but we can acknowledge the improve they don't do it as much yes not even it's improved it's improved the the names needing to not be like phone numbers and WhatsApp IDs and stuff
that's a big Improvement okay so I know that it's been at least a conversation I don't know internally at Google but but externally to Google for years that what they should be doing is they should be doing like a more of a Reddit style up voting and down voting system if they really want to improve comment quality and do they not is there not can you not down vote on YouTu you can up vote and down vote but what you can't have is conversation uh threads within a parent comment okay so you can't have like
multiple branches off of of of a that actually gets pretty confusing when people are replying to each other within that does get confusing so so this ended up on speaking of Reddit this ended up on the LTT subreddit when I replied to someone on the um the pool cleaning robot video and and people started kind of saying blindness is super aggressive and defensive here when they thought I was replying to the parent comment but what I was actually replying to was one of the comments that was a sub comment
under it by the original poster so what because I added them the Assumption was that it was replying to the parent comment but it wasn't I was I was directly addressing things that they had said and when some people noticed and we like um actually people were like oh what he said makes way more sense because he was actually replying to a completely different comment but it gets even better and this is this is where I'm going with this uh tying back to the mobile app when I sort by newest I can't
see if a comment is a parent or child comment so I never even knew that the original post existed I replied Direct to their reply to their own comment not knowing that it was a child comment rather than a parent comment so when I saw some of the backlash to what I said  like oh YouTube YouTube YouTube we can't live with you we can't live without you hey thanks for this career um any who Spotify what should they do what can they do to make this right because I mean it's not going to do us any good to
just say oh yeah Spotify bad people I hate them forever what what can they do now some amount of store credit would probably be good at the very least is that enough um how much it was a $90 device this is not a cheap this is not some throwaway meme product this is something people bought for nearly a hundred I mean probably hundred bucks by the time they pay for shipping for it I I don't know if they free shipped it but whatever in the neighborhood of $100 that's not like meme I bought it at the
dollar store  um I don't know you have to be able to stop supporting things eventually yeah that's a really good point and and whatever reason they did it for the way it interfaces with Spotify is not in a generic way that will continue to work until some unforeseeable time in the future so yeah you've got to be able to discontinue stuff but like this clearly isn't right too early um they did stop selling it what a year and a half ago so that's good you should Pro I I believe
you should give it more legs than that um and then I mean it isn't turning off for another seven months so it will have been 2 and a half years by the time it actually turns off in my opinion you should never really like deactivate things just let them rot eventually I don't know I'd want to see I don't think you're going to be able to allow like my my brain wants to is is thinking about like when when games shut down we always ask them like oh make it so other people can I don't think that's
necessarily going to be able to happen cuz this isn't like you probably can't like plug a USB into this thing and like reprogram it I mean easily if it's if is is it Android based does anyone know cuz if it is then you almost certainly I've never seen one I mean so I could be wrong you 100% can okay well then they should do that yeah I mean and look it's Linux based why don't they do that can people just do that anyways can I make an argument hold on hold on hold on it's
hackable wait one second I I know but we're going to get there we're going to get give me a second right I can understand I was hanging out with I was having a good time I know that I know that's why I took it away I just hate seeing Joy on your face I um I can understand why they might not necessarily be able to do that there may be intellectual property concerns in the code right oh yeah okay there could be there could be okay however I think at the very least some kind of nudge nudge or or
facilitation for the open source Community to to to take it over is in order here I understand why legal might not have allowed it but I hate this this is such a terrible precedent it's such a terrible way of behaving as a company that it almost doesn't really matter what the legal advice was you've got to find a way to do the right thing yeah and the right thing is obviously to make it able to continue to work and the very very least they could have done is to not actively brick it so apparently
people have already done a USB unlock of it there's already a jailbreak yes what I think would be pretty sick in my opinion there's apparently a subreddit already I love it car thing hacks nice uh what I think would be pretty sick is if they if they gave some Spotify developer time to the open source project I think that would be that would be such even if they're still going to shut it down in December or whatever I think that would be such a a good faith good guy move that people
would be willing to look past a lot of the crappiness of this situation overall it's not great it hasn't been conducted great so far and they can't commit I'm just going to defend them slightly they can't commit to this forever no you can't support something forever but if they're that's the problem with smart devices that's why I didn't buy that uh that floor cleaning robot because I told you about that conversation right where I was like okay but like what happens if
you go bankrupt does it operate without your Cloud thing and they're like well yeah it's not going to go away and I'm like right but if it does what happens is it a brick well yeah but we're doing great we're not going to go away you a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] idiot I'm not going to buy it was it was "it was like $188,000 or something like" I'm not going to spend that kind of money on something that just turns off a a lot of things like that like infrastructure like that is going to be
in deployment for the entire existence of that building I could expect that robot to work for 25 years I don't think I don't know even if your company doesn't go under you could get acquired by someone who doesn't give two shits about floor cleaning robots maybe they want to use your your automated pathfinding technology for application or something I don't care about my stupid badminton building yeah see you later you never know you don't know yeah but so I yeah I think I think that would
actually be very cool is if Spotify software developers Spotify software Engineers were given a little bit of time it has to be limited it's not going to be able to be a ton they're discontinuing this for a reason but a decent amount of time enough time to make a really solid uh contribution to the open source project don't take it over don't have anyone become leads on it or anything but try to contribute really heavily and get it to a point where the open source Community is like
pretty stoked on it and then just let  leave and that's not like a happy ending but it's a neat ending I don't think it's that kind of device I mean I'm sure in open source that does  too all right oh man what is our next topic going to be imagine imagine the fact that he can't even get it out this is not a good sign he's never had this problem before I haven't been canceled in a while just imagine being like yeah you know what this isn't good enough I need I need to push contributing 
open source open legs I need some people to test this one you got to push the contributing code then you got to pull it I'm on the Alpha version of the the  thing I I need to really access to all the features works with Android 15 oh man okay all righty you want to pick our next topic yeah yeah yeah yeah should we do our new channel yeah actually I want to I want to see cuz I think a lot of people don't know that it's live I want to see comments live of what people think of like the voice and
stuff cuz it's a relatively short video so people could go watch it I mean it's on our own video we can watch it together yeah we can react to our own video Dang it we can do that we can do that it's the Internet it's it's online it's it's brought to you by um a secret Lab secret yeah there there's their logo sure whatever that one's not even legible way to go oh what a guy it's obviously my fault um all right I've got I've got it loaded up Dan are they able to hear if I if I do
stuff why why don't I do a couple pings you can make sure my audio is working yep I can see that coming through it's here folks I'm just going to play it for you we're going to watch it together and we're going to talk about how it came to be can we hear it that's the question uh I mean Luke and I have listened to it but okay sure whatever hopefully we can but yeah yeah it' be nice I'll see what I can do okay I don't hear it now all right lus  okay1 it's a fully modular ATS power
supply with a single fan mode the power supply comes in reasonable packaging and measures 150x 86x 140 mm considering cable flexibility it has an effective depth of 175 mm the Corsair RM 750e is accompanied by the accessories as shown and supported by a 7-year warranty this warranty period is as expected for a power supply of this class the fully modular cables are of acceptable quality they have plastic insulation and are moderately flexible the provided cable set includes a single 12volt high power
cable allowing it to power all types of high wattage gpus LT Labs conducted all of the following testing at an ambient temperature of 20° CSUS the full test Suite including tests at extended temperature ranges is available on the lab's website Link in the description but before we get to the results here's a message from our sponsor the Corsair RM 750e carries an 80 plus gold rating and we measured 90% efficiency at 50% of its maximum rated load that's equivalent to power supplies in a similar class
throughout the full rated output power range of 750 watts there was a 0.162 volts drop on the 12vt rail which is within ATX specifications and similar to most other power supplies we've tested the the rest of the output rails met ATX specifications this stability should provide a steady platform for the operation of other components in the computer the peak-to peak signal Ripple of the fully loaded Power Supplies 12vt rail was average for its price and wattage at 31 molts the 5vt and 3.3 volt
rails had signal Ripple of 17 molts and 21 molts respectively modern power supplies typically have no issue complying with ATX Ripple stacks and this unit is no different we test a Power Supply's resilience to momentary power dropouts and ripples using our brownout test that interrupts the input power for a few Mill seconds this allows us to measure how long of a power Dropout the sample can sustain without interrupting the output power the Corsair RM 750e was measured to withstand 13 milliseconds and 14
milliseconds Dropout at full rated load for5 volt and 230 volt inputs respectively this unit performs similarly to other power supplies the Excursion test momentarily applies up to 200% of the rated load to test a Power Supply's ability to support components that may temporarily require more than their rated current the Corsair RM 750e withstood a subset of the excursions but failed with others it's compatible with most systems but may struggle with high-end Hardware connected the Corsair
RM 750e is equipped with the protections as listed providing the full Suite of protections for you and your equ equipment we measured the overpower protection to engage at a maximum of 131% of rated load while the 12vt rail alone is capable of 81 amps 130% of its rating this is equivalent to similarly rated power supplies offering good protection against component faults while also allowing the power draw to slightly exceed the official rating we can recommend the Corsair RM 750e
because of its good load and line regulation and resilience to cross loads for full specifications and test results follow the link to the product page on the LT Labs website all right so let's talk about it I I jotted down some notes from chat while we were going yes um so a couple of these I think I can just answer immediately a couple of these maybe become discussion uh one of them is voice too slow in that case in my opinion just adjust the video playback speed you know it's funny because I
actually saw some comments saying that it was too fast on float plane adjust a video play back speed yeah like are not too fast someone said that normally they watch at one and a half speed and they had to slow this one down to to 1x interesting so it's going to depend on your familiarity with the subject material I think I suspect people are saying like the voice Cadence is off and stuff that'll improve over time um considering where we started it's way better the first time we previewed this
was probably about 3 or 4 months ago something like that man this is a big Improvement so it will cons L improve some some comments that I saw were like It's not taking uh like breaks to breathe mhm I mean it doesn't breathe so that makes sense I heard a breath though I heard it take a breath did you really it's imitating yeah you hear a little it doesn't like pause like there's the sentence pauses are not it doesn't run out of air yeah I noticed that as well yeah um so like stuff like
that will be improved over time um someone said I'd stop watching that's completely fine um one of the reasons why people have been asking why we chose AI voice for this um because these aren't going to make like any money at all um and there's like well it's not just that these are not going to get any views which is why that's going to be a thing which is why they're not going to drive any revenue and I suspect watch time isn't necessarily going to be amazing stuff like that there's there's
comments like I'd stop watching not enough emotion stuff like that fine it's not supposed to be hyped up really exciting interesting content to watch it's supposed to be like I am interested in purchasing this product I would like a very on the point information heavy cookie cutter video third party validated give me the information and then if you're interested in diving into more CU you saw one part that you found as interesting then you can jump to the lab's website and get more info there
it's not it's I don't suspect unless you're like I really freaking love power supplies dude um I don't expect you're going to watch every video on this channel I suspect the subscriber conversion for a channel like this is not going to be super high but if this was back in the day and I was building computers this is the exact type of stuff I would have tried to find because this is why I would look at content on YouTube was because I wanted to see video of the thing out of the box that
was like 100% what I was looking for I didn't care about the unboxing experience I wanted to see the thing after it was out of the box and to verify some assumptions I was making and there's going to be people that are going to watch a lot of videos on the channel but they're not going to subscribe for entertainment unless maybe they work in the industry like if I if my if my job was procurement at a system integrator and I was just like totally oh well this is convenient if these guys
are just going to test every power supply and I can just get a notification on my phone so I can make sure that I'm keeping up with with what's good because it's like my job absolutely I could see someone subscribing but for the average Builder who's putting together a system for you know their roommate this quarter and you know doing something for their sister 6 months later you're going to subscribe to it but it's very likely you'll watch one of them or you'll or you know what like we haven't given much
thought to playlists I guess I just it just popped into my head maybe maybe Bell Jake bellance is is the channel manager for this but yeah um I don't think we've given a ton of thought to that yet but uh you know something that would be cool is if we had playlists that are like at various wattage ranges or playlists that are at various price points price points will be tough cuz they're going to change so unless we had a way to unless there's a way to like hook into YouTube's API and and manage your
playlists automatically or something like that based on you know pulling real-time pricing information or something I don't think we'll be able to do by price but if we could do it by wattage range for example then that would be a really cool way to go through the channel and basically go okay out of 500 wat power supplies okay I want to learn about some of these of course I understand and this is this is a comment that I saw uh I guess it was over on over on float plane or someone was like
this doesn't see or maybe it's on maybe it's on Twitter um this doesn't seem to add a lot compared to reading an article you are right the correct format for a power supply one pager is a page yeah not a video but what we have to recognize is the realities that exist in the techos spere in the medi spere that have made it so that this abomination is now how you will find out about the the testing data of a power supply viewer habits have changed to video the money that used to be in written
media is a fund is functionally gone compared to how it was in the in the you know early to mid to even late will not read something people will not read something and even if they did that site that writes that thing that no one's reading would have an an an extremely difficult time surviving so the equipment that's involved in this and the Personnel that's involved in this um is is so expensive I just don't see a path where you could do this testing in a written format unless
unless it was you know like to my point earlier about being very interesting to people who are in the industry unless it was like a paid subscription or something like that but that's not where we want to go at least with the basics of is this thing okay to buy what kind of computer can it power what kind of do its safety protections actually work like that's not something that we want to pay well um I do think that there could be more detailed testing data that might only really be useful to you know
people who are going okay can we procure uh you know thousands of these for our systems for next quarter or something like that and okay an example of that I have an extremely particular type of load that I need to put on this sure um in the long term you know I could see us scaling up the number of those chroma testing units that we have and we could go okay yeah I mean or or even do like paid testing yeah we'll we'll we'll test 10 instead of just one we'll test 10 we'll run your Suite on it
whatever yeah or whatever the case may be so in in the in the long term there's all kinds of different directions that we can go with it but the reality is if we want this content to exist we've got to go where the reader is and the reader is now watching in video form um so and how many people that's a big question mark right is one of the answers we were trying to find when we were uh working on the concept for this channel because this channel exists because we want to make it we want this
information to be available um but one of the things that we had to figure out is okay how do we make this self-sufficient it's not the question wasn't even how do we make money the question was how do we make this make any sense um because don't kid yourself this is a creative company we media organization if you don't think that there were some misgivings internally around AI voice for example oh yeah come on guys there were absolutely misgivings but the way that we're looking at it and
the way that we've messaged it internally is look this is not replacing human intervention a human developed this test suite and a human needs to test this power supply by the time we do that I'm sorry but there isn't for the "for the two to 4,000 views we're going" to get on this video there just isn't any budget for the the media side of things and in the long term I want that to change I would love for that to change I would love for every look I would love in the longer term for us to
"be able to count on 100,000 or 200,000" views per video and for us to go okay let's scale it up like why are why are we doing this all Cookie Cutter now you now that we've got this kind of momentum um but I don't know if it'll ever get there performing like that sure I just I don't see it happening personally well maybe I I I see it happening in spikes like I I suspect if some like Flagship GPU comes out and we have a GPU equivalent of power supply circuit so I'm making multiple assumptions here um
it could be a banger but I think the day-to-day releases of that channel are not going to be able to and you might be right and we see I I'd be happy to be wrong but like one of the one of the kind of tough conversations that I had to have with someone who um to their credit approached me about it sure approached me with the concerns right like that's what we want so they approached me with the concerns and they basically went look I I have serious I have serious ethical concerns I have
serious creative concerns um I I don't understand who this is for um help explain it to me I basically went okay here's the situation we went and we looked at the very few channels that are left that are even trying to do dedicated videos on power on on an individual power supply skew um we are expecting at the very best at the very very possible best somewhere in the neighborhood of "like 5 to 10,000 views on average for" each of these videos that puts our budget somewhere in the neighborhood of 
what would you have me do I want people to have this information I need to get it to them in video form my options are either that I Outsource to some place where I can pay like slave labor wages which we have never done and I have never been comfortable with or we pay proper wages to the testers to the people who are working on creating this data we try to find a way to scale that from you know 10 to 25 bucks to maybe we can scrape together some affiliate Revenue um to make sure that this is
sustainable in that form and we lean on automated tools as much as we have to to make this even remotely have a chance and they kind of went well I hope the voice can be better and at least it is at least it's better than it was it's a lot better in my opinion and and I I do like I said earlier suspect there will be continual Improvement there I just I one thing that I disliked a lot was when it was your voice when it was a modification of your voice that was that was odd for me I didn't like that so the
funny thing is one of the reasons that we had actually leaned that way initially was that there seemed to be less Community backlash to cloning my voice versus cloning a random one because I don't know why but it seems like the perception was less that we replaced a voice actor with an AI and the perception was more we are we are applying a an efficiency factor to Linus's Time by saving him the trouble of reading the lines and the the distinction is arbitrary yeah what but
but but that voice sounding like me made it an extension of me instead of this whole this whole landscape is is weird to nav right now I know right it's it's because we're all figuring out kind of how we feel about these things and where the lines are and stuff um and while that's still happening it's just it's it's a little tricky but I think this is okay and I like the idea of if the channel does start performing well we could you know get talent for it or whatever that's that's interesting I do
suspect the quoted number of views that you just said I think some of the videos on these channels are going to do a lot worse than that oh yeah and I think some of the videos on these channels will smash that out of the park I think so too I think um and yeah it's gonna be very up and down I think very inconsistent here's something that I bet you guys didn't necessarily realize is the AI voice is not the only automation tool that's being used for these videos I don't think I knew  output of the video
Yeah whoa yeah so so the reason the script is a little bit formulaic sounding is because it's actually yeah you're doing the same shots so are are you are you naming the files in a certain way is that how it's doing it so all the shots will be the same all the graphics will be the same with the same names is um the exact details of how it's done are going to be Ed's department not mine right um but then the the the the little the little color commentary because that was something we
realized about the first one that needed to be fixed it had no cont text it was just like the however Point whatever Millow ripples like it didn't it didn't sound like anything if you don't already understand it right and so I was like okay look guys we have to come up with a way to create a script that allows for some color commentary or we are going to completely lose any chance we could possibly have of people watching this thing and learning anything so when it says this is as expected for power
supplies of this class there's basically variables there's almost like a drop down box this is worse than expected this is better than expected this is as expected so when it did like the cables are of acceptable bendiness or whatever the cables are of exceptional bendiness the cables are of subpar bendiness compared to our expectations and now a human is involved in in bending those cables and seeing okay yeah we know the depth of the power supply but like really what can you fit
it because that was something that I asked to be added because the depth of a power supply doesn't tell you what case it can fit in you need to know once accounting for cable bendiness how deep it is right um so that was something that that's something that a human needs to do this is not AI content This is highly human created content that is edited together and voiced by automation tools it's something that I have no idea if it's going to work but boy do I ever hope so given how much we've invested in
it because I don't think the lab's website on its own is going to have a chance of of reaching any kind of break even point no it's got to be something that can be funded by the other branches of our company and that um and and that will allow us to reinvest in it and continue to build we have some ideas to help it uh but it will always kind of   oh right we're supposed to do merch message I'm excited to tell you guys about those uh do we have any Store updates that we're supposed to talk
about I haven't looked at that part of the oh oh yes we have a huge promotion that we are running right now on the LT screwdriver this applies to any screwdriver that's right classic colors retro noctua or stubby if you buy any LTT screwdriver by uh oh really by midnight today wow that's a really short draw okay you'll be entered into a draw to win either a giant LT screwdriver check that out that's from that stream we did "earlier this week or a $2,200 gaming PC" as seen on our PC Building stream this
last Wednesday for the full details and legal info you got to go to LT store.com productss screwdriver so cool right anyway uh one of the things that you can do if you decide to order a screwdriver right now is you can leave a merch message in the shopping cart we don't want to just take your money just you throw your money at your screen and then what we like acknowledge your comment no no no no no you should leave a merch message so you can throw money at your screen and get
great quality merchandise in the mail in the cart you'll see a little box whenever we're live to leave a merch message it will go to producer Dan who will pop it up on the bottom down there like that reply to it forward it internally to someone who can best get you an answer or oh sorry Dad curate it sorry Dan uh sorry my bad the button's broken yeah for sure or he will curate it for me and Luke to address on the show Dan do you want to hit us with a merch message to show the folks how it
works sure absolutely yeah we've got a few here let's see uh would you make an apple leather  no so oh God please make a medium tall I need to replace my leather jacket so bad so please have tall shirts yet Dan we're losing this war I don't care I will have them Custom Custom Tailor me one you know how we did that mock neck yeah that we called the Steve where it had the seam down the middle just like his iconic okay so I had oh no I the Jensen the Steve Apple I had planned so
Matthew from Creator Warehouse his AMD ultimate Tech upgrade is coming up okay and I don't know if it's going to make it into the cut because it's sponsored by am so who knows what the it might not make it through our own internal business team you know whatever and it's not like it's it's not like it matters in terms of our editorial Integrity if we can talk about a future product or whatever so it's not the kind of thing that's not the kind of Hill we're going to die on so it might not make it through our
internal team it might not make it through AMD but one of the things that happened in that video is Matthew and I decided to tease a potential upcoming product called the Jensen the Jensen cuz we've wanted to do a leather jacket for a while I don't know what kind of leather we'd use we actually haven't gotten that far but one of the things we have decided is that the jacket will be designed by AI because of course it would oh he's already got some really great Concepts so obviously because you know
we have designers um we would make it actually function in the real world but it would have like Pockets that don't open zippers that don't go anywhere at least it doesn't have to do hands you know AI things the AI the AI jacket the Jensen huh H Dan Dan huh I think if it's in a medium tall I will buy two right I think W 2 in flow plane chat uh has summarized my thoughts so far of that's going to be a really expensive joke how many do you think you're going to sell you're going to sell two today
going be expens he's going to use his employee thing so you'll I'll pay out of pocket I don't care dude I okay so you're selling two to Dan I guarantee you I guarantee you okay guys come on let's hear from you who wants one Dan I need I think we need to get a poll in here uh yeah right away yep uh Firefox let's get that pull and besides and besides if it doesn't sell in the in the in the D googley your life video one of the one of the top comments was like along with all the float plane users I
am 70% of people that use Firefox or something like that I don't remember the exact sign and I I burst out laughing I was like oh but think about it this way Luke even if we don't sell any of them  off all right we'll get that going you mad are you mad bro I'm voting no brother are you angry I do need to replace this jacket though why oh I'm so excited I I can't find a leather tailor to actually work on it looking I'm trying to find an artist Collective around here that could recommend an
artisan but it's very very difficult I know a person who works with leather goods who lives on Vancouver Island because he came to uh LTX oh yeah you're not talking about that person are you is someone I know no oh okay never mind um I can't find any company that makes them anymore so yeah all right well bummer for Dan yeah sucks yeah maybe we'll get him a Jensen okay where's our where's our do you want pockets that don't open and zippers that are to nothing do you want that is that
a good is that does that do that dude clothes more interesting clothes are supposed to be self-expression artistic self- expression I got to remember this the person who has one brand of socks and one I've been wearing one jacket for 10 years t-shirt 10 years I've been wearing this jacket in this I haven't even changed my shoes in a decade in this case the use just multiple pairs of the same one to be clear the use of AI actually makes sense it's It's So Meta like it's an it could be an ironic
expression of like hating AI it needs a little pocket where's the ding it needs a just yeah exact that's what I'm talking about that's the first time I've had to do that for Luke heed disgusting he needs to have a pocket on the on the like uh chest for your Humane  yeah but it should be like the wrong size because has no concept of scale all the product failure Pockets you have like the that may you have like a slot for the rabbit we'll make it out of rabbit leather oh oo
"45,000 jacket that's a lot of rabbits" mood murdered yeah um they just be Android anyway sorry uh we were we supposed to be on a topic right now because I actually wanted to come back to PSU circuit a little bit that was the second merch message that was one merch message that was one okay hit me again and I'm just going to leave this page open so I don't forget to talk about okay yeah sure uh same sort of thing curious about the amount of stolen items found during Tech upgrade videos were
the items actually considered stolen or is this just a joke about the amount of stuff employees take back with them both a little bit of both I think yes both is  okay sorry I was eating jerky um okay so part of it is that I was a little bit legitimately annoyed in some of the very early ones to find work property in people's homes nothing that mattered um in the grand scheme of things what were some of those things like what like cables MH like a like a a cheap USB dock that realistically we
didn't pay for and and probably they intended to return at some point because remember we started this series when work from home was a lot more common at our company because of all the covid lockdowns and stuff right so people had a lot of stuff at home that they were probably going to return it but it wasn't assed like asset tagged inventory so nothing would have prevented them from just keeping it and so it was this kind of gray area area where it kind of started with me being like hey come on
man and then obviously I ended up with a lot of false positives because legitimately people do end up with a lot of stuff that used to belong to the company you know we got LTT store well we also have the lmg store which is where people can sometimes get access to you know a unit that came in for b-roll for a sponsor and ended up cosmetic damage and they were like well we don't want it back and it goes in the it goes in the giveaway pile we have a giveaway pile um we also have wild Christmas
parties not in like a like a tech bro Silicon Valley games industry kind of way in like a wow I can't believe the giveaways um that they're giving that they have at this uh you know two drink maximum otherwise pretty you know controlled party um so so people end up with stuff from the Christmas party uh people end up with we have done on occasion in the past um the Christmas party is a lot of stuff it's hundreds of things every year we have done on occasion in the past um like extra
credit things that people can do for what we call lmg bucks I don't think we've done that in a long time but in the early days I've never even heard of that yeah no we we would have stuff that's like ah this power supply has a broken fan in it lonus could open it and put a new fan in or if you wanted to just like take it home with you and put a new fan in it then you can have 50 lmg bucks or something like that and if you if you buy must been when I was off float planing I've never heard of this
almost almost no one used it but this is just an example of one of the ways that people could have obtained stuff over the years um I used to just get paid in Hardware that I mean no yeah not by me yes well topped up you were above the legal limit otherwise yes yes yes yes you can't say stuff like that Luke you got people are going to you know how people are it was fun anyway so lmg bucks uh for stuff that's in our inventory that's like used we don't if people want to like buy it and
we don't need it we don't charge full price for it so people can use lmg bucks to stretch a dollar pretty far so people people use lmg bucks um a lot so people have stuff that they've bought from work stuff that they have won from work stuff that they've taken home from work for legitimate purposes and in the case of Dennis stuff that they've just taken um because I don't know he thinks he has tenure or something I'm not sure how that works in his head so it is a it is a combination of things and like
anything it's been amusing for me to see the community speculation around it because the number of people that are outraged either way is baffling uh the people that are that are outraged that I am that I am such a that I'm such a I don't know overbearing horrible boss that I'm going to be berating someone in public over this cable that they took um is probably about equal to the number of people that hate me for being such a such a disorganized corporate Overlord that I can't even Inspire my team in
this horrible toxic work environment to not be stealing anything that isn't bolted down like it's it's amazing how you can just take a aing joke that's just a meme and interpret it as I've always I've always wondered like if we do one at my place what stuff like what stuff will not be stolen I cuz it's a lot of it like I don't even know like I I don't know well that's what asset tags are for yeah but sometimes there's asset tags on stuff that was given away H really yeah oh
really yeah okay well we'll see uh I might remember and then I think I have like three generations you know personally select the items for the giveaway every year right yeah yeah so I know but there's there's three generations of computers in my place that are from my like weird upgrade thing that I have mhm mhm well I guess we'll see I like found some graphics cards at my dad's place and I recognized them as work property yeah yeah so I think we'll figure it out but I didn't
even know but I did so like it's yeah it might be interesting guilty oh yeah I've  I don't anymore but like I don't know the line used to be a lot more blurry when there was like three of us um it used to be as simple as like hey my GPU died um I want a game this weekend and I like don't want to go to the store yeah can I borrow a GPU and it'd be like yeah don't take one of the ones we need for this review on Tuesday yeah I need these ones and it's like okay I'll grab some
other ones yeah it used to be pretty lucyy it was pretty fluid but that was that was a really so the stuff that I have is going to be like ancient I say these days the vast majority of what I'm meing on on camera I am meing on yeah it's it's mostly the yeah it's mostly going to be the really old stuff this is why Luke hasn't gotten an upgrade yet says Belle in the chat yeah I love it every day is set upad every day I'm upgrading sorry um right so I had wanted to come back to the lab's website for a
second here oh because we also have the written version that video which I didn't mention before so you know that's pretty cool so it's it's just like we want to make it so that this work that we're doing is digestible easily by as many people as possible so we have the written version which is as deep as it's going to get basically and then there's also the video version for people that don't like reading stuff yep depending on uh you know what part of the world you live in you might be more interested
in 115 volt versus uh 230 volt power Excursion productivity might also be easier for you to just like Google translate the lab's website read it that way yeah exactly uh so we got that there and then this is really cool they also did and this is co-authored by Oni um our test technician and Lucas who is our power supply uh wizard um that is to help you power up your knowledge and it's basically a how to how to watch how to read cool right where they go through our graphing formats kind of explain uh
why we've laid them out the way that we have how to interpret them uh what matters what doesn't uh this oh man this was this was an entire probably half an hour to 45 minutes of a meeting this this graph and uh breaking the sine wave and the interruption during the brown out off onto this separate graph um and I I got to make one of my best jokes ever in a meeting that I think I already alluded to on W show before so I won't make the rest of you suffer yeah I thought that was wrong hold on one
second I think I think you slipped uh On's title is senior content writer not technician oh sorry sorry sorry writer writer writer y thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you sorry sorry sorry sorry um he was just focusing on the next thing he was going to say it's sorry on yeah enjoy your GPU that you got consolation prize something she was in a video oh yeah she was right oh yeah yeah yeah no I saw that I saw um pretty sick constellation yeah I know right um anywh
who so yeah there was a there was a lot of debate about this graph um and like you know how to make it more readable so yeah we gave a lot of thought to it and if you guys want to know what the thinking was and how to interpret it this is a really great primer on how to  good very exciting okay what do you want to talk about next uh we're off merch messages right we're doing other topics I want to talk about that's what the paper says yeah yeah yeah I want to talk about I just
read what's on the prompter [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you San Diego the arm Windows Revolution might come packed with a privacy nightmare oh I know right okay all right do the thing this was this was the topic that hit me this week I I dove into this a little bit but I'm going to read these notes first and then I'll tangent into whatever I'm thinking of uh this week Microsoft officially unveiled its new lineup of laptops featuring qualcomm's 12 core Snapdragon X Elite and 10 core
Snapdragon X plus chips all of which are based on arm that's like the big drop here these laptops reportedly have a battery life of 17 to 20 hours and several apparently outperform an M3 MacBook Air ac Asus Dell HP in Inspiron I thought it was HP Inspiron is Inspiron a different brand uh Inspiron is a Dell brand so I don't know don't worry about it Samsung and Lenovo have likewise announced new snapd drag powered lap snap drag Snapdragon powered laptops um laptop lineups as
well these laptops will launch with Native arm versions of Adobe Photoshop Lightroom Firefly and express it's an interesting setup to not have Premiere but it does say with premere and illustrator coming later in the summer Microsoft is no longer calling these AIP PCS in instead calling them co-pilot plus PCS which really makes me think of uh G Plus Linux but anyways um the the company is heavily emphasizing their AI capabilities including uncontroversial features like AI upscaling but all it's
not completely uncontroversial but sure um but also a recall feature this is the one that stood out to me uh that has raised some concerns among uh I almost said piracy among privacy advoc recall gives co-pilot a kind of literal photographic memory by taking an automatic screenshot every 3 seconds this would store around three months of a user's recent activity by default according to Microsoft the feature can be turned on or off and these snapshots which the vast majority of Windows users
will never turn it off because the vast majority of Windows users never go into settings and change anything so keep that in mind uh so you might most people won't um these snapshots are encrypted and stored locally and may be deleted at any time further users can create black lists that prevent recall from taking screenshots when certain apps or websites are open likewise these images are tied to specific user profiles on the device critics however have expressed concern that the feature could
still wind up capturing sensitive information because of course it could which might be abused by someone with access to the device especially if a person unknowingly borrows a device or uses a public device with this feature enabled the UK's information commissioner's office has announced that it will be making inquiries into potential security issues posed by the feature I mean this is one of those topics where we read the thing and then I think we basically go that's bad
yeah yeah yeah yeah uh Elijah in chat who I don't like acknowledging because he's supposed to be working but it's after hours so I guess it's fine Elijah says for his AMD ultimate Tech upgrade which by the way is coming oh he's going to switch to Linux over this feature and you know what oh B I would even blame him based even though you can turn it off it's like yeah you can turn it off now and then windows will update and it'll turn it back on and it won't tell you and we've seen it time and time
and time and time again and you know what I I think with man with the with the way that things are developing right now man that's so based on game compatibility on Linux um my understanding and I haven't talked to Emily about this much but I have a little bit because she's been pushing me to do another Ste OS gaming check-in or not Steam OS uh gaming on Linux check-in cuz it's been a little while and I kept saying look I want to do it when Ste OS gets released broadly and she's all like
yeah but like is that ever going to happen I I've been like yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and now I'm not I don't know who knows it's a good question yeah it's a good question so anyway we're going to do it um but from from that conversation she was basically saying yeah in Nvidia driver support is looking like it's like going to get a lot better like like soon like like they care um dude like is Linux going to be the gaming operating system wait and windows becomes the like or
like is Linux going to be the like the x86 gaming operating system and is Windows I mean looking how hard Microsoft is pushing are they going to become like the arm the the the arm productivity you know operating system the mobile like laptop only operating system computers and here's what's really confusing to me about this is why is Microsoft so focused on beating the MacBook oh dude is Apple's market share even this you opens with him talking about the first line mentions Apple 
thing this is Apple's market share  16% yeah so like what's the what are you doing so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what it's like it's like Intel at the the prime of their market share which was not that long ago but inel at the at the height the prime of their market share opening a new feature talk by naming AMD why like what are you doing you already dominate it's weird I don't know man and I like yeah like dude oh apparently this is this is in the United States too so that's going to be way higher than it is
worldwide yeah 100% And I get their their their competition or whatever else but at the end of the day you're you're kind of you're kind of chasing this this minority um this minority shareholder or not shareholder but a holder of market share I I don't know and and you know what look it's capitalism baby you got to grow and taking some of Apple like taking taking 10% like this is the thing if if they can take 10% of the sales that would have been a Macbook okay they grow their market share in the US by
1.6% and I get it you got to you got to show growth but like do you even do you even think that this is the solution to that cuz I don't know I think the solution to that is is making really good AI stuff that works better on arm processors convincing people to upgrade because people have we know that from the co era people bought a bunch of stuff and they don't need to upgrade it cuz there's no point here comes a hot T make that are worth upgrading your hardware for you know what I think is
happening right now I think that Microsoft is contributing to a significant Improvement in Qualcomm mind share among computer buyers that is ultimately going to be exploited by Google you ready for this you're falling back on your your Chromebook thing Chromebooks if you wanted a machine where battery life was of the utmost importance are you going to be running Windows anyway no Chrome OS supports Linux applications now Chrome OS supports steam gaming on Linux is getting better all of these things are
happening right now so is Emily saying that there has been cuz I haven't looked so I'm not this is not this is not me countering to be super super clear before because you know the Linux people can get a little Defan sometimes I'm not I'm not I'm not relax is Emily saying that there's been significant steps since we did our challenge yeah because I would I would love to switch would love to switch it just wasn't quite there if it's there I'm gone cuz honestly I don't mind windows
at all I actually kind of like Windows 11 in a lot of different ways and I know people hate Windows 11 I don't care I enjoy it the things that I don't like are this snapshot thing them when you update Windows them overriding some of your settings and changing things forcing ads into my operating system go away and then making search just the worst thing in the world those things are the only things I actually dislike a lot of what Windows done Windows search is the worst thing in the world all
right maybe exaggerate a little bit but the the ads is too far this snapshot thing which you know it's going to turn itself back on is too far uh and the search being trash and constantly searching the internet when I want it to search local and it even when you tell it to only search local now it just can't find things yeah which is crazy there's no reason for that so like I yeah I'd love to bail out I really like mint actually I like using mint my biggest problem is constantly jumping
back and forth for applications mostly games some applications is just really annoying I want an operating system that can do my stuff I'm excited I uh I I think I think the the age of the Chromebook is Dawning you're excited about Chromebook well it's Linux it's kind of cut down [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Linux so so think by Chromebook taking over Linux will become stronger because of more contribution look at the trajectory of chromeos Chrome OS started super super locked down basically only ran
Chrome it started out with all the devices having completely locked down firmware so you couldn't even install a different operating system if you wanted to now you can run Android apps on it you can run Linux apps on it I believe some of them have um some of um allow alternate operating system installs uh by default don't quote me on that last one we did a video on this recently so I'm I'm it's kind of in my  um I think that if Google is smart this is their opportunity kids grow up using chrom
OS millions and millions and millions of kids grow up using chromos and so all chromos has to do is keep getting a little more functional now Google is also a tech giant like Microsoft and is absolutely capable of succumbing to the same hubris as Microsoft and just screwing up chromos and making it so bad that we couldn't possibly switch to it but no I absolutely do believe that Linux is the beneficiary of chromos gaining more popularity and chrom Os stands to be a beneficiary of Linux
gaining better support and gaining better access to Applications people want to run yeah 100% one thing that's interesting is is as based as as Elijah's move is and as much as if if significant improvements have been made I I would yet again be happy to consider it at least I don't think most gamers are going to care what about productivity I think workplaces are going to stay on Windows for the foreseeable future that's my problem yeah like we can't want we can't run wow on
Linux unfortunately yeah yeah there's it doesn't work okay so that's an interesting one handyman uh in flo plane chat linked me something that is pretty cool which is uh works on w.com and then in this particular instance SL games going to go to my laptop you can search the games that are that will work on Windows 100 Asian cats I have no idea some game okay no know the analog yeah that's fun yeah I like that so like some of these you've seen the amount of games on Steam right there's going to be some
weird names I I'm not I'm not talking about the the there's seven ways to die I don't  game I haven't heard of a lot of these but it is what it is but yeah there's there's already sites popping up like this what's what's the homepage what else is on here oh just games cool um can you can you sort by like category popular like games you've heard of is  okay looks pretty Bare Bones for now but um yeah in the long term maybe it's still be oh well there's there's 1348 results I'm expecting they're not all
tagged properly that makes sense um so the the category stuff is probably not working great but interesting site you could what what do you want to search for how about that um let's go  cool H close it got ring I mean it's better than Windows search it's just extremely fuzzy fuzzy search it's comfy blanket search um yeah I don't know that's that's neat but it's  just I don't like this I care I appreciate that it's stored locally yeah but some of the stuff stored locally does not mean secure
encrypted does not mean secure nothing is impenetrable nothing is fully secure do you hear the argument for why we should be okay with it because this is all just coming anyway and we should just kind of deal with it everyone's going to have an equivalent thing like man we're talking about them having capabilities like I forgot my my password for my for my mobile operators you know online portal what is it um Cortana yeah you can't be you can't you can't be storing that stuff yeah it's sketch yeah
this interview on Bloomberg television um I I think this is the interview at least at some point in time the interviewer asks Sach Nadella is this it yeah I think so I'm not 100 certain this is the right one but I think it is um at some point in time in the video uh she asks him like this is kind of creepy basically and he responds with effectively what lonus just said which is like I don't know AI stuff is going to be like this so get used to it not obviously not exactly that very PR spe
he word smithed it quite a bit better than that yes but that's basically I'm not nominating you for new CEO of Microsoft although they might go in a good direction with you at the helm I don't know if they'd make money though H probably not yeah yeah um oh uh question sync plane asks hey can you ask Dan again what doesn't work on Linux for w show yeah I'm very curious about that oh that's uh that v-mix yeah that's basically just v-mix yeah um it uses too much of the windows
libraries for especially because almost all of it is GPU um it's very very stable because it's a pretty much 100% GPU computer someone's this is this is one of the problems that we run into and now I'm going to piss all the Linux people off um so there's a couple things we start talking about how we could we could maybe adopt Linux again and float plane chat erupts with you should use this drro with this thing and this that's that's scary for new users and then the other one
is tell me the software that didn't work because they know some way to magically get it to function in some way somehow yeah I'm running it on metal I'm not going to emulate an operating system underneath it yeah yeah there always upates and it stops working and then we want to go live on Wow but it doesn't work so you have to Tinker with Linux to make it function it's like it needs to be or we could just spend $100 on a Windows license yeah this is Windows 11 that has v-x installed on it and chrome
this that is all that is on this computer this is why business I don't really see them moving um and and at home as well like there's always that one program that I need to be using that doesn't exist you had a rough day at work driving home three different people cut cut you off someone scraped the side of your car you're upset you go get some coffee and you spill it and you finally get home you just want to play video games and you sit on your computer and they won't work for some
reason and it happened a lot guys I think if you're being honest with yourselves you it doesn't bother you because you enjoy the tinkering there is tinkering which is great which is fine fantastic I have lots of things that I do the hard way because I enjoy it I don't have to paint my own motorcycle believe it or not I'm doing it I have pictures I was going to say speaking which I put I put white on it nice um primer nope no it's primed gray um but the frame needs to be painted white
because the pink that's going to go over top of it um doesn't shine through as brightly uh if it just goes on Gray primer I apparently don't have pictures of it so forget that how much longer do you think the paint shop keeps telling me today bro don't tell me today like tell me tomorrow give yourself some wiggle room for for seven or eight business days they've been telling me I'll have it for you today is it today or is it I don't know it doesn't matter sometimes sometimes
you have the best intentions and I I'm just I'm waiting on the mid coat and the effect coat and then I can do the whole thing like I'm I'm ready to paint that's exciting yeah I'm really  someone said yeah it's also perfectly okay to only partially move to something if if it doesn't work I hear that but then like I said earlier in the show like I don't want to be switching between operating systems all the time why are we training up our level one technicians on two operating systems

really that was that was the worst the dancing cow is pretty great though dancing baby what year is it I don't think it one uped uh me apparently being Dan's Dad yeah I was a little weird um is it too late for an abortion so like why does he have a beard I came out of the womb with that  baby oh boy what do you want to do next three merch messages oh yeah right sorry yes Dan yes yes sir sure okay so Sor uh having trouble balancing work and time with my partner she says we compromised
on shared time too much but I made 2/3 versus last year I work odd hours to get overtime but get three days off advice three days off is a a lot right but do those hours always coincide with her time off because yeah if you have three days off but you spend two of them like gaming in your cave and and to be clear I'm not saying you're doing that I'm just saying 3 days off does not necessarily equate to 3 days together totally I mean that's a tough one you got to you got to make time
relationships do not autopilot you also need to set realistic expectations because as they said I made 2/3 versus last year economic times are tough right now you can't just like not push I mean I remember we talked we well not we didn't talk about it but we alluded to it last week when Ivon was on the show with us um where yeah we had some really tough conversations and what I often fell back on in fact you know being across the hall from us and those with those paper thin walls uh what I
often you've probably heard me say this before but what I often alluded to was that that old expr sometimes they would go downstairs to like the living room area thinking that it did anything anyway um I often would talk about making hay while the Sun's shining um like that's a if you have a good opportunity now but then you also like depending on your financial situation you might not if the sun's no longer shining you might not have an opportunity to not do it make anyway I
mean the answer is kind of the same either way I guess is like yeah at the end of the day work is our modern equivalent of going out and foraging for food and building shelter um if we don't do it we don't eat and we don't have shelter and there are alternatives you could be a mountain man and you guys could go to the mountain and you could forage for food and build shelter um but what I suspect is that she doesn't want to do that um I mean maybe maybe in which case I hope you're ready for some significant
lifestyle adjustments might be sick you won't be watching W show much from out there I don't think a little tough um yeah it's tough I mean I think the the most important thing in any relationship in any conflict is you got to communicate you both got to communicate okay what are my needs what are your needs what are the realistic um challenges that we Face to uh to meet both of them and what's the closest that we can get to a middle ground yeah and like you you're pointing
out yourself I made 2/3 versus last year uh she might not be as financially minded or financially focused um I find there's usually like one person in the relationship that is more so like for for for you Ivon is more financially focused I think um she's better at it which is say that much probably good um but okay man this is this is one of those things where I feel like in in trying to make sure that people properly appreciate that Ivon is not just the boss's wife and take your wife to work
day I I've talked a lot about how good she is at that kind of stuff guys don't kid yourself I'm not some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] idiot like I I I know how to budget things and stuff so I was yeah I was meing on you but I yeah I know well the problem is that there they don't know that yeah there seems to it's fair enough there seem to be a lot of people that when I build someone else up and I kind of have like I have kind of a self-deprecating style of humor um people seem to take it at face value which
well hey I see you and that's okay my my literal friends my my point was is it it might be a good idea to sit down with the books with her try to explain or with them uh try to explain uh oh no it says she okay yeah with her um try to explain like this is this is why okay I made 23s versus last year these are my financial goals over the next while which will put us in these Financial positions where you know retirement might be more comfy we might be able to uh I don't know rent a better place or
buy a better place or buy a place at all or do whatever have more insul financial insulation if something bad happens say one of us loses a job this will give us more of a Runway like explain all of these different types of things but if I could give a little bit of advice don't mansplain it ask questions totally ask questions like in the event that one of us lost a job how long would you expect us to take to get a new job and how much of what we're making now would we be
willing to settle for so you can ask a question like that lay out a scenario and then do the math together rather than doing it all of time and basically giving a presentation CU that can that can have a little bit of theck totally that makes sense yeah yeah I work with them on it I don't know I'm showing my seven-year-olds some games from my own childhood for example Roller Coaster Tycoon worms and Age of Empires 2 how has your children responded to older games like these as
they grew older did uh any really get into some um I haven't I haven't played older games with my kids that much but what I will say is they tend to enjoy things the most when you do it with them so if you just give them Roller Coaster Tycoon and walk away I doubt that's going to be very effective but if you sit and make coasters with them that will be super effective um like uh my son would never pick up Lio on his own like he doesn't he could um but he loves playing it with
me so that that's the kind of thing you got to do right if you if you want want them to kind of enjoy the same things as you and you want to kind of make that connection just make sure that you understand it has to go both ways I've had to spend more time than I otherwise would have playing Minecraft dungeons um because my kids like it and it's what it's like it's diablo right like it's it's a stupid click on everything Dungeon Crawler game right like and and to be clear if you enjoy
Minecraft dungeons that's fine there's good gameplay mechanics and I'm sure at like a high level you can like be good at it and stuff it's not just click on things or whatever like some of the raids are pretty challenging and like we got wiped and stuff so no disrespect intended it's just not really my genre and um I've played a lot more of it than I would have if my kids hadn't asked me to right and let's see what's our last one here hello duli I recently sent my 89 Civic hatchback into a tree at 35 mph a
day before I went on vacation have you had anything catastrophic happen happened before an event but found a way to go anyway what a specific question oh no um oh before an event I mean I'm sure I've had something terrible happen before an event I mean you get sick anytime you go anywhere so that's kind of catastrophic yeah I'm worried remember that time you went to Japan and then just stayed in your hotel room the whole time that was taian Taiwan sure whatever that's where
I'm going again hopefully I don't get sick again I thought you also had to stay in your hotel tell room a lot in Japan yes yeah so I'm not wrong so I haven't not been why you got to be like that why am I being so defensive right now I haven't not been sick during a vacation for 3 years nice and we're rolling the dice again nice seeing how it goes yeah yeah yeah maybe it'll work out you got I'm not sick don't worry thanks unless I am oh we'll find out soon yeah I mean it'll affect me too I guess let's
hope neither us is sick yes um I don't know it's happened a bunch of times tell me this I don't really want to give examples tell me this okay now obviously I'm not going to ask you if you're going to wear a cloth Square on your face but would you consider using one of the like organic particulate filters like I have for my painting Booth would you consider wearing one of those on the plane because Close Quarters on a plane look I don't I don't give a f if you believe that Co was a government conspiracy or
whatever I I I actually don't care uh the the cold hard truth is that proximity especially over an extended period of time to people who are infected with any kind of even remotely Airborne illness increases the chances of you getting sick stop if you're going to say anything other than that being near sick people makes you sick you're actually stupid and you can go away um so if you were to wear like a real filtering mask if that was an option because it is they're like 100 bucks and the
cartridges are much cheaper they're like interchangeable cartridges yeah I have I have one I used to use it for working with cement how badly do you not want to get sick I think not badly enough to wear that which which is funny because I actually find them who cares wildly more comfortable to wear yeah they're not that uncomfortable but people like hate it so much I don't know why I tried it before when when this whole thing first popped off my immediate reaction was to go get my old like cement mask thing
yeah cuz I'm like they have removable filters I'll just buy the n95 ones cuz those exist and you can just click them in and then I'm good right and the whole world was like no we have to use these really annoying one siiz fits all they don't fit your head they're going to literally cut your ears masks and I'm like what why when I when I'm on planes you know what I actually do yeah I wear those old noise cancelling headphones that you got for  2014 I don't even remember I don't
remember when you bought everybody noise cancelling headphones for trips like a billion years ago okay I still I still have those and I I hook the mask around those so it doesn't cut into my ears cuz if I don't I I've actually bled from masks before my head's too big I 3 print did a bunch of um ear saver M so annoying and I'm the one with the ego you have you have that makes sense I did it for that was um during Co they were the blood people the bloodletting people I can't remember what they called
like Life Labs and stuff like that oh the blood letting people you mean the clinic yeah the clinic where they let your blood go into the tubes do you call your doctor a saw bones it' be funny it' be very funny Dr sawbones please I have the I have the vapors um and those worked really well cuz they were having to wear masks like for like 10 12 hours a day and they were all bleeding as well so you could try one of those although theyd probably be pretty silly I don't know what happened
I used to I used to get sick decently often enough that it was annoying but it would always be for like really short periods of time and it was like usually pretty easy like I would get sick on like a Thursday or a Friday and I'd be better Again by the time I'm back in I work on Monday and I'd like lose a weekend and it would suck but like it didn't really matter and now I'll get sick and it just doesn't go away for so long and like the most recent two of them I tested and they weren't Co so
like it's just something I have no idea I don't know man I um for me the uh I I don't wear a mask anymore because we don't have mandates and lockdowns and there's you know there's there's a lot more certainty about uh Co and its various uh its various changes over the years and all of that so I'm I'm a lot less worried about it um I mean it's it's the unknown that was that was the reason for a lot of the protective measures we didn't know you know what it was going to do we didn't know what the
impacts were going to be long term um so I don't I don't wear a mask anymore but what I do still do is I wash my hands way more than I used to me too that's a that's a new one for me I never get sick anymore think about it when's the last time you saw me miss a day at work because I'm sick yeah like basically never remember and in the old days I used to work anyway but I you go back to some of the old videos and I'm like I'm hosting it like this have no voice and stuff dude I never get sick anymore
washing your hands more and it's not like I was like a dirty gross disgusting person before anything like I wash my hands when I use the bathroom and stuff like that but I switched my mentality I used to wash my hands whenever I did something dirty now I wash my hands before I'm about to do something that requires cleanliness yes and also that yeah and that has made probably the biggest difference out of every behavioral I'm also really hardcore about um uh when I go to the gym I'm really
hardcore about not touching my face with my hands sometimes I might you know there's sweat or whatever I'll use like my arm I'll do it but I'll make sure that I've washed my hands first well I'll do that but then at the gym you're touching in the gym there's no way yeah so I I I I pre-wipe down every surface that I use in the gym including bars like barbells whatever else and then even despite that if I need to touch my face I'll use like you know you you do this with your hand
so you can have a point with this part of the wrist and then I'll like use that if I need to or just my the whole back of my arm or whatever like I'll find some way to not use the inside of my hand without I'm touching things with unique username reminds me that you just had a UTI liner sorry for the reminder I did uh but that's not related to transmissible although there there are personto person transmission things that can cause a UTI which actually reminds me of the time that my doctor in
front of me basically told Ivon oh honey he's cheating on you have I never told you this story no um what anyway antibiotics they're a miracle I'm fine  oh so cute oh no but I got um I got an unrelated blood test for something what's happening I got okay I got an I got an unrelated blood test for something or other and uh I tested positive for I'm going to get all the details wrong because I am not a I'm not a doctor and it doesn't matter to me in my daily life but I I tested positive
for like the the associated proteins or the antibodies or something of one of the hepatiti um okay and basically whichever one it is it's one that you that is is sexually transmitted um so I went in for my for this totally unrelated blood test it was probably something to do with um uh getting my blood test Ed to figure out if I had arthritis because um I had these issues with inflammation in my knees and now they think it was juvenile rheumatoid arthritis so it's kind of gone in gone into remission it'll
probably come back with a vengeance when I'm old but for now I'm doing pretty great good um anyway so I was I was probably in for a blood test for that or something and they basically go okay but you've got this like antigen or protein or something it was something to do with some one of the hepatitises and um they basic I basically go okay so like what does that mean and they're basically like well it you know usually indicates that um you've you know gotten that you've had
at some point uh this this sexually transmitted disease and Ivonne pipes up and she goes okay but he hasn't because I don't and I never  goes well that's how you get it so I think you guys might have to have a conversation  this and look for me and Ivonne It's Perfectly Normal and acceptable for us to have a meeting with with our doctor like with each other but for her to basically like and it really was that obvious um now so we left like OB obviously Ivon and I have a lot of trust
in our relationship because as we were leaving um I was like um no and she's like yeah I know um but Ivonne having a background in Pharmacy having an actual medical background herself oh man that's something that I think it's got to be useful makes me more Angry than almost anything else like and I I don't know what it is I don't know if it's the general you know arrogance that you can see with doctors sometimes I don't know if it's like a misogyny thing I don't know what it is
the number the number of times that I have had to stand there while a medical professional talks down to Ivonne when she clearly understands everything that's going on very easily especially when they're talking about drugs for me to Pipe in and go she's a pharmacist you don't have to explain what a cortica steroid is you can move on and for them to keep going through it explaining to her like she is 3 years old I don't think anything makes me more Angry than that anyway so the point is
this doctor who I probably have had that conversation with already because I understand these things pretty well whether it's from just paying attention in school or it's from taking some some first year biology classes or from doing flash cards with Yvonne I've picked up a lot I don't I don't need to I don't need someone to explain to me what an anti-inflammatory is I don't need someone to explain to me what an nset is I like I I I know what these things are and I you know aren't you paid by the
number of patients you see like let's let's do this thing right so I tend to kind of jump in with that she's a pharmacist you don't have to explain this she knows what aspirin is let's let's move on um anyway so Ivonne starts asking probing questions so dismissive the doctor was so dismissive of her questions where she was basically probing for okay what are the other like the doctor was treating her like she was basically asking if she could get pregnant from toilet seat you know like
is that how he got it did he but what she was actually asking for is like okay look I'm a little rusty on the antigens versus the proteins versus the antibodies is there some other thing that could have caused that could have caused it and as it turns out when we went for another blood test and we came back for the results the doctor with no apology whatsoever for the incredibly awkward situation she'd created that could have in a different relationship caused ruin a pretty big stir
because even if even if you did end up figuring out that it wasn't true irrepairable damage could have been done no apology whatsoever is basically like yeah he like had he had some exposure to it at some point through a vaccine and had the the whatevers um but we didn't check for that last time so I didn't know [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you like you actually don't get to do that that's not cool and don't worry I have a new doctor now um that was a it was a clinic doctor I hate
going to walk-in clinics it's basically but we didn't have a family doctor at that time between the two of us and my technically still my family doctor is like out in Mission cuz he was my family doctor from before Ivan and I like moved to not Mission um so like I just didn't have one yet and I was super young and super healthy mine is super far away it's like 45 minutes an hour sucks am I I the walk-in clinic four minutes from the office baby I locked outy she's amazing that's awesome dude she tried to
call me on a weekend about my results for the UTI thing she like calls me on a Saturday I don't pick up because I don't answer my phone because it's leaked a thousand times and I just give up on changing my phone number at this point um so she calls me on a Saturday I don't pick up she texts me she's like yo I dealt with all your stuff go pick it up at this Pharmacy it's the one near you I checked what holy crap pretty sick she is absolutely based I love my doctor and
she's like my age so I basically as long as she doesn't retire um Dr T please please don't retire yeah as long as she doesn't retire I I I'm I'm keeping her for life she's awesome yeah like yeah yeah I the only at this point the only reason why I go into a walk-in is if I am 100% confident what's going on I'll go in and like tell them and then they can get me whatever yeah a lot of the time they'll argue with you anyway though honestly the one that I go to usually they just
like verify really quick and they're like okay sure and then cuz I have this Pro I I've explained this to you before my like ear canals are kind of weird like I can't have the Squishy in ear buds cuz they just fall out um I also sometimes have a hard time um when I get off of planes sometimes my ear just won't pop oo that's bad so I have to go in and like they help me do it oh that's rough so I'll just like tell them like this is the problem this is the way that you guys have successfully done it in
the past and they'll just be like okay just do that's pretty straightforward it's like cool they'll like man phys walking doctors or just like any doctor that just like doesn't care um is such a kind of it's a Scourge dude I agree but I get it here because here we have such an insane shortage so they have five minutes with you how are they going to care if they have five minutes I get it five minutes one question what are you going to how are you going to get invested in this person like I it
sucks Dr T please don't leave me yeah and some people are like time to switch doctors it's not that easy it's not that easy we have a significant shortage and insane shortage she probably doesn't have open spots she probably has a system where family can get added on so any of these families that are growing that's her new clientele she can't bring on more people and it's really challenging because there's there's there's Dynamics at play that are not as simple as just like oh I don't know why
don't you guys substitute or substitute why don't you guys subsidize uh your your your doctor training programs like it's not it's not that simple like if you a lot of the is that we have a brain drain down to the United States where doctors make a lot more money but a lot of the reasons that doctors make a lot more money is because of how bloated and uh broken the US medical system is like that whole you know here's your $30 Band-Aid thing that goes on where insurance companies um where there's
where there's these outrageous fees that are being charged because insurance companies will just pay for it and then will just you know buil their their subscribers for it that whole that whole system is hyper inefficient and facilitates doctors who will work down there making way more money such that a more efficient system can't compete with it and to be clear I am not saying the Canadian system is efficient I am saying it is more efficient which is objectively true I'm so sorry my
American friends um they get like some of them get like super super super super mad about any anything to do with that sounds any even remotely critical of anything about America and I apologize sincerely for that that's that's that's my Canadian way um but your system's not very good yeah apparently there something called earplanes that can like help with the thing that I have maybe I'll look into this some sort of used station tube dysfunction the Band-Aids have freedom I
don't remember the names M I hav't like I I I figured it out with my doctor like I think it was like the second time we went to CES so this would have been like 2013 2014 that's why we have guns so we can end it when we get sick doesn't the Canadian government also recommend that some of the Americans in our in our chat are uh spicy yeah all right guys uh yeah yeah langle man says I've been waiting eight months for an MRI for a rotator cuff injury love Canadian healthare yeah yeah
it's not a perfect system I will not even begin to pretend it's a perfect system um everything's it turns out everything's corrupt wherever lots of money is involved yeah that's what we learned yeah up here the weights are brutal like I when I was I was really sick I don't know three months ago something like that um and it was like go to a walk-in and they're they they basically I I did once and they were more or less like I don't know okay cool um and then I I went to go schedule an appointment with my
actual doctor and he was like well it's going to be like a month or a little bit more before I have an appointment open cuz it's not an emergency I was clearly not like dying I was just sick for a really long time he's like well you can book an appointment I was like well I'll probably be better by then he's like yep okay you can always book it and then cancel it when you're close and then an opening will be available to someone who needs one soon yeah just just saying that's a that's a
system we're apparently supposed to do when after dark we haven't even made it through all our topics Luke has to leave in 18 minutes go but we didn't even talk about Google's AI citing the onion and recommending the health benefits of drinking pee what Google's AI overviews in search appear to be drawing information from very questionable sources with limited discernment including telling a user to try making cheese adhere better to their homemade pizza uh to add about an eighth
of a cup of Elmer's glue in with the sauce the source for this wisdom appears to be an 11-year-old Reddit comment made by user Smith AI overviews likewise recommended eating at least one small rock per day which it attributed to UC Berkeley geologists but is actually a recommendation made in 2020 in a 2021 onion article another user asked what mammal has the most bones and was instead told that snakes have the most bones of any vertebrate not a mammal I'm afraid these errors
included medical misinformation such as recommending smoking two to three cigarettes a day while pregnant even prior to the full roll out AI overviews were making similar mistakes including telling at least one user to drink large amounts of urine in order to dislodge a kidney stone I mean you can't prove it wouldn't work a Google smoke spokesperson says that the mistakes came from generally very uncommon queries and aren't representative of most people's experiences I mean that's the thing
about hallucinations in it you see most of the world as it is except for the ants that are crawling out of your skin that cause you to rip your skin off you know um any who users can use the web tab to remove these elements or automate the process by changing in their browser settings to add udm equals 14 to the end of their search URL in other AI news which is awesome the Chinese website for Cooler Master is apparently advertising their new cryus 5 product which comes in six
different colors as competitive AI thermal paste the official name for the product translates as thermal paste AI Sports Lottery um any who they've apparently apologized for that and it was a translation error or something but I just thought it was funny to put in with our AI news that's funny iix it has dumped Samsung they officially dropping them as a partner saying the company seems unwilling to make goodfaith progress towards making its devices more repairable however they will continue to
provide parts and repair kits for Samsung devices to Consumers um since partnering with iFixit 2 years ago Samsung has apparently kept Parts price high and continued to engage in unnecessary Parts pairing according to a leaked contract Samsung also required independent repair shops to report the personal information and repair details of customers and to immediately disassemble Samsung devices that were repaired with third party parts so and with the amount of rules that repair shops have like so eat
Samsung basically um I criticize this kind of stuff when Apple does it and I would spend a lot longer railing on this except Luke has to go so um dang sorry cold ones reviewed our screwdriver oh really oh uh Dan we tried every YouTuber  [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this is the LTT screwdriver I mean nice yep I'm a I'm a man I'm a man nice this really gets me going wo that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sick look at this get all your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bits in there that's clean have you tried it out have you tested it oh

those the new recipe is like basic mainstream chocolate like if you're like M Nestle arobar that's quality you will like the new recipe but the old recipe is a way more like traditional proper chocolate can people confirm okay so the order is correct okay yeah yeah so they they just they went mainstream in basic probably because people were like ew and they were sitting there going okay well why are we spending so much to put so much real cocoa in this we might as well give them the the swill that they like
sorry swill is a drink thing but uh yeah give give them the trash that they like yeah um man honestly I don't get it though because you can just get Lind chocolate at the grocery store which is going to absolutely destroy both his original recipe and the new recipe but hey like you know influencer product right if you like what Mr Beast does and you want to support him I I I got I got no problem with that but I do think their branding is like world's best chocolate bar is
um how do you how do you get away with that world's best chocolate world's best pizza what do that even what does that even what does that even [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] mean Define that yourself yeah I mean I guess but I would think you'd have to I don't know I I'm sure whoever worked on his marketing gave some thought to it or something um Elijah lint is gross yeah but Elijah have you eaten any foods like you tried a mango for the first time like a month ago like what what do you even know
about food I'm sorry was that the first time that was the first time he'd ever eaten a mango it's like come on man I don't know with him sometimes cuz his whole like Innings thing no he knows he's just trying to mess with us yeah so you think he's trying to mess with you no no I don't think so you don't think so you think that's actually the first time yeah yeah yeah yeah I don't know I don't know I'm 27 years young had never eaten a mango I'm a little sus I'm a little sus on that I don't think he would lie
about that were you there you weren't there for the conversation I thought I was there for him eating it though yeah no no we offered him some never tried that before the hockey night yeah yeah that was before I got there I had mango drinks and dried stuff so he had dried mango never eat fresh mango okay okay okay so basically what I'm going to take food advice from someone who's never tried fresh fruit like no I'm sorry I'm not I'm not going to do that it's not going to be like that um wre all
right what's next right I'm trying right I'm trying to blow through these things so that we oh oh this is very important uh we need you guys to help us um I've got notes from Tanner I have an entire doc about this good Lord I might have to do this later holy crap it's like four pages this is very very important okay Dan don't let me forget I will get to this after uh we've got a float plane early release guys if you're subscribed on float plane you're going to want to go check this out we've got cable
managing Samy setup sponsored by secret lab this is a whole new series for us so we've got an early release I think this is coming out this weekend or something like that anyway um we are going to be starting by doing a couple of internal people setups so we started with Sammy Dan is coming next we will be cable managing his setup and then assuming that people like the content format we're going to be opening it up to the audience if it goes well on this continent we will be opening it up

dollars no big deal right you got that uh and then buy a plane no problem and then Flo plane support Joe has offered to be your your Private Pilot so a plane not that expensive a hanger oh that too yeah yeah very expensive also planes that can go across continents dude quite expensive dud you are talking to small cesas or one thing the second you can do super long range you are talking to someone who has flown one time one time in his entire life in business class oh yeah me too one time it was
by I don't remember some sponsor ended up doing the flights for us and we realized like as we got on where on the plane we were going it was brand and I we were both just like what and we came out of the experience you know some people are like I did it once I could never go back we came out of the experience be like I'm never paying for that cuz we looked at the price difference versus what we got we're like bro no I mean we both got here right yeah ex exactly like I don't know yeah man there is I I
cannot man I'm trying to think okay cuz like like Taylor Swift was like flying from her like overseas ass concert to like watch Travis Kelce play in like super bowl or whatever and like you know what I get it if you've got that kind of resource man I got such a k oh that's an irrelevant amount of money I got such a kick out of people being like Taylor Swift is now a billionaire earlier this year I'm like are you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] kidding me okay if my stupid company no offense to
my company got an offer if my highly intelligent company yeah if if if this if this got valued at a tenth of a billion dollars at one point are you kidding me that she just crossed the line you don't think Taylor Swift is worth a hundred of me 10 times please are you kidding me anyway anyway um okay so on the one hand like I get it when you have that level of resources if you can just just buy a plane Jo if you can just if you can just hop to your boyfriend's football game like I can see
why she would do it but I legitimately I legitimately have a very difficult time imagining a world where I would do anything other than commercial air travel like I just I don't I I don't I I I don't think I can I don't think I can accept it helicopter just I mean Jo  KOB I'm serious those things actually reasonable those things are death traps I the amount of times I hear do you know why they call it the Jesus nut because  face no it's because there is one nut one nut because it's perfect and he
doesn't need two sorry sorry there is one he lost the other one in an industrial accident we don't bring that up there is there is one nut that gets torqued onto the top of the rotor assembly that holds the rotor blades in place if it comes loose for whatever reason on this vibrating ass spinning ass Contraption if it comes loose the rotors go and the helicopter fly falls out of the sky so you call it the Jesus nut because you pray to Jesus it never comes off okay those things are flipping scary
okay have you flown in a helicopter youve been in a helicopter before average helicopter crash at around nine "per 100,000 flight hours that seems" crazy high okay Luke have you been in a helicopter before yes a few times okay they're made a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cardboard yeah that's kind of true like I I was I was looking at thing I was going like that's  like okay so that answers the question then not the helicopter route time to buy a plane and Jo and fly it for you easy you know what okay Taran you know
constantly coming up and down yeah that there's got to be a cost to that there's got to be a cost a l less than a plane you could just get a plane and then when when he's not when he's not what about a plane time share this is what I'm saying you coulded Taylor Swift plane when she's not going to her boyfriend's doesn't know who I am yeah I think I think change you want to see in the world maybe if you went to a football game once in a while a football game a football game when you say football like
that it's a black and white ball but when when when he's not flying Teran you know he can fly other people boom now you have a new company Jesus boom new company oh Lordy um solved I'll say this when personal like one passenger plus like your backpack Vall never going to happen will not happen in our lifetimes have you met people who drive cars what what sorry I can't tell whose side you're on you think it's going to be AI or not you I I I think the only possible way is if it's like predefined
routes or AI driven or something like that I don't think is haven't like traffic accidents gone up since Tesla introduced self-driving cars I don't know man no idea there's a lot of companies trying to build these things they're going to fail stop it and that's okay that is something that I would legitimately move for I would relocate to an area that allows me to have my own personal like like little quadcopter that I can fly to work in see if if you just if you just want a personal
plane you can already do that yeah but that where am I going to fly it I don't want to goere on staff who can fly it I just go to working back you just you just buy a plane it's simple I look I got a motorcycle and people are all like oh yeah you know like I I did like a 6-hour ride up to Squam Mission back and I did this and I did that I'm like yeah I drove to work I excuse me I rode to work and then I rode home I don't go anywhere I don't I don't want to go anywhere I just I just want I just want
to go to work in my little private plane that's all so anything that I can't land in my backyard I'm not even interested in I I don't even want it there you go Joe there's the specs for the plane it has to be able to land in Linus's backyard there's a pool there careful careful oh man get a heli land in your yard and land at the office do you have any idea the kind of letter I would get from our strata Council if I tried to land a helicopter at our office you don't think they like it is
is that is that guy still around oh yeah yeah yeah yeah neighbor Steve he might be down he's our neighbor tell them your friends with Taylor Swift here we go yeah but it's never going to happen laws are not going to allow this I will move I will move to the UAE no you won't I won't move to the UAE no you won't that was false where where would potentially  you yeah they're in a desert there's not a lot of like you know people where are you even flying to at that point Texas I will join Mr musk
in Texas if I can have a Jetson you would have moved to Texas I I would consider it I would strongly consider it is that where we're going to have the cult can we have these in the cult um you can wash mine move thean Texas I'm down cultist are allowed to wash my personal aircraft do it thank you sir thank you for the privilege property will be insanely more affordable I need to pause for a second C cult guys that's a joke this is a joke we have where like we we should form a cult and I should be
the leader I am playing a character touch grass okay cool the non jok is that buy a plane for Joe to fly no that's not happening totally happening we do live near the islands he could buy a floow plane yeah I they are Jo Joe can train to fly a FL extremely and land it where Fraser River yeah your your Lake cabin you go to Bowen Island so what I'm going to live on the Fraser River Port Brown is really nice it smells disgusting it's a little icky it's a little it's maybe a little GES go
to gang you know what I am sure that Joe could drive the car from the float plane dock to to your CH yeah chauffeur plane and car Cher there you go I don't think he'd mind as long as he gets to fly the plane uh we did a fraction of our topics today we are less than half of the way through our topic and I need to kind of you have to leave 3 minutes ago okay if you have to go then you've got to go but it means that we are uh we are in for I can hear I can check maybe we are in for
an adventure uh the US government has put a 25% tax back on Chinese assembled motherboards PC cases and graphics cards the Tariff was paused for a year to collect industry feedback it's unknown when it will resume but the Biden Administration has indicated that it will be steeply increasing tariffs on other Chinese Goods like semiconductors lithium ion e batteries and electric vehicles uh the Tariff on semiconductors is the steepest and will be increasing from 25% to 50% uh this is going to be a problem but
it may not be as much of a problem as you would think because a lot of these companies moved their assembly or at least Diversified their assembly outside of China in order to get around this back when the Trump Administration put it in place um Scarlett johanneson is having a bit of Johansson sorry excuse me um is having a bit of a tiff with open AI over a voice that um people including her say sounds eerily similar to her which is her that is to say uh the movie Her which uh is like the AI in
the movie Her which is voiced by her which is Scarlet Johansson who is having this dispute okay she did the voice for her um so we're we've got a couple quick voice comparisons here can we can we listen can we listen we ready oh also while while we figure that out uh I I won't say the thing we're doing but I have a response from wend cool is he down he's down and he has some suggestions nice I knew he would y okay when did you give it to yourself well right when you asked me if I had a
name I thought yeah he's right I do need a name but I wanted to pick a good one so I read a book called how to name your "baby and out of 180,000 names that's the" one I like oh a bedtime story about robots and love I got you covered gather round Barrett once upon a time in a world I actually don't think those sound as similar um maybe the inflections the first one was actually her right yeah yeah okay cuz I was listening to the first one and I was partially focusing on my phone when you
were teeing up the topic God was voice that sounds what she has a super sexy voice what who Scarlet Johansson you don't think so what a comment uh what why do you think she was cast for the part it's just a weird it's not like it's a controversial all right you're basic um got him you like the voice that whoever directed this movie thought you would like sorry very basic sorry you know what I like the backst street boys too what are you going to do about it that is pretty basic come at me that is that
is pretty basic they're the Backstreet dads now and they're just as cool as they were if not more so yeah listening to that first one I was like wow that does really sound like her that I didn't is from the movie the second one it it sounds like uh you know inspired by uh I don't even think it does I don't think it sounds anything like her I  sounds if you yeah like I I didn't hear it and immediately think her but maybe it sounds like a bad impressionist trying to be her if that makes
sense like not an actual impressionist just like your friend yeah I don't know I uh I'm afraid anyway there there's a whole thing where like they apparently reached out to her to be the voice and she refused and then there's some other stuff going on over at open Ai and people are concerned about the company's Direction I don't know I'm I'm so sorry I feel like this is almost like uh what what what was it like Lindsay Lohan or something that was upset about one of the GTA cover art things was that
Lindsay Lohan I think so I don't remember who it was but I remember that  GTA yeah yeah this like really I I I I'm sorry but that is that is the most NPC NPC you know blonde bikini person ever like your hair's curly here hers isn't like I don't know man I no like people posing with the P sign at that time was super Comm check your messages oh no not yours oh well for you never message anyway what I'm kidding uh there's a bilingual brain implant I don't know maybe next week um
okay the last thing that you really need to weigh in is that battle State games has tripped over their own again again yeah so you not know but this okay following battle State Games decision to undermine its $150 Edge of Darkness edition of tarov with a $250 unheard Edition with an exclusive PVE mode and various other pay to win goodies some players caved and shelled out the additional $100 to up upgrade a few days later battlestate reduced the cost of upgrading by half but instead of
refunding those players the $50 difference they gave them a single use $50 in-game voucher if the player buys something that costs less than $50 they lose the remaining value yeah could these guys be more cartoonishly anti-consumer if they tried I think this is maybe just something that we didn't cover at the time but this is this is fairly old at this point um I think they've gone somewhat quiet for a while just realizing every single thing that they were doing was bad and dumb um so
they stopped doing things because that was actually better for them I mean that's not a terrible approach yeah um was sure weird especially the lose the remaining value thing but I think I get it I'm assuming that they just don't have like a credit system yeah probably hanlon's Razer it's probably not malicious it probably is I think some things that they do complete and utter competence yeah but hand L Razer doesn't say there's never malice right it says don't attribute to malice that which can
be adequately explained by incompetence and I think you're right I think this falls under probably incompetence I think so just cuz like they they try to do all the things themselves right oh so popular hello did you check your messages okay please do that by okay this one's a lot closer maybe it's Kate Upton I I don't know I don't remember who it was was it it was Lindsay Lohan yeah yeah yeah yeah but Reddit was looking for something that was more similar apparently yeah
sorry apparently I a bunch of people thought that was their phones my bad I lied I have one more topic okay icq is no more uh oh yeah I didn't know it was still a thing me neither oh okay but it set to shut down on June 26th which is in 2 days after nearly 30 years of operation should we buy it oh my be better than teams can we use icq internally please can we can we SSO icq oh my gosh  integration guys that's not actually an option I'm I'm meaning you suck it's June 26th not oh sorry it's May got my
hopes up um yeah I don't know should we buy it wouldn't that be hilarious is it is it potentially for sale I don't know users are encouraged to migrate messaging platforms from parent company a VK VK who is this I don't know probably it's Venture Capital with a K like it's it's probably some holding company who knows have I ever have have I ever told you about the name of EA game one of EA games' Mobile  I hope they sit on tax oh that's pretty good that's pretty  wow worse uh okay we've got something really
important for you guys yeah here sorry one sec I'm just G to yes yes yes Capital games yes yes oh it's funny sorry uh yeah oh so I've got my notes from Tanner here um we need your help okay so this is up to date as of 3 days ago uh we are trying to digitize the full quality masters of reboot the first computer animated TV series uh the reboot Master tapes are in a D1 format uh there were only six models of vtrs that used that format and only two or three of them will likely be able to
read these particular master tapes uh the vtrs that will work are the DCR 300 and the DCR 500 from broadcast television systems which was a Bosch and Phillips partnership we purchased three vtrs oh good lord uh we apparently purchased a DCR 300 and two DCR 500s and we've had some small playback test successes confirming that the tapes are in surprisingly good shape and it says C bottom of dog it looks great uh okay so here we've been working on this in the background for a while because we just
think this is pretty sick and Good Vibes and oh my God yeah that looks so good yeah okay man now I want to watch some reboot okay anywh who yeah oh man that's super exciting um very clean all right the problem one of the DCR 500s was working for a short time however it is now experiencing errors and while all three machines have some sort of issue there should be enough to Cobble together something that works the main error we're getting across the machines is Servo reference V pulse frequency too
high the machines will not load or play back without clearing these checks we've tried tracking down the company that made them so far none of our contacts have been able to find anything um these particular machines were manufactured by BTS from 1992 to 1995 which meant a different thing back then uh Phillips took over BTS in 1995 which then turned into okay this is a lot of thank you Tanner uh these are a lot of Tanner details uh let me distill it down um Thompson broke up blah blah Grass Valley
Inc may have taken over the D1 Hardware B catalog but our contacts there were not able to find anything the parts that didn't go to Grass Valley Inc were sold to partner Capital group in 2008 something something something Prasad Studios didn't have any information for us they are based in India where it appears the D1 format was never in use uh replacing capacitor uh is something that we have tried and we apparently had replacement rollers fabricated and replaced where they were
degraded what we are looking for ah yes this is this is what I was looking for manuals for the DCR 300 and DCR 500 we're missing operator's manual circuit diagrams part one and bts's internal service manuals we also are looking for some specialized tools we would like to get extender board 1409 for tape deck adjust M tape dr5 and any additional calibration tapes we also would love to get in touch with some experts if you have hands-on experience with BTS D1 machines particular the D particularly
the DCR 300 or DCR 500 doesn't matter what region you have experience in um they had offices in Netherlands Salt Lake City Utah Singapore uh Brazil France Burbank California and mulgrave Australia um odds are good if anyone knows about these machines they would have worked at or near one of these Loc what we are not looking for armchair technicians that think they might know what the issue is we have plenty of those internally sorry my finger slipped um rude we are not looking for technicians with
similar familiarity with similar players um these were produced in a time when Tech standards were fast loose and constantly changing we are not looking for anyone to cold call any of the companies involved do not cold call on our behalf we've already done it don't harass people it's it's stupid um we're not looking for anything that is built for a tape deck that is not the D1 format and we are not looking for external options to capture the tapes we want to learn and share the knowledge
not just hire a capture service um the contact information is right here this is very important reboot rewind reboot rewind doc gmail.com if you can legitimately help us with any of those things we said we do need and not the things that we said we don't need um very hopeful that we can restore reboot to its former glory that would be super cool I had heard we were interested in doing that I didn't know Tanner was doing any work on that yeah dog this is very cool to hear epic
going yeah I I I was like blank check let's go and then apparently we bought three machines it's an extremely blank check blank check with a really long underscore on it look I think it's a I think it's it's cool it's very cool it starts a lot of conversations about how we think of the internet and we think of things that are digital as as as as being preserved forever as being around forever but actually as the as the the the waves and waves of of data creation have gotten larger and
larger we are actually at risk of losing more and more and more unless we make a con a concerted effort to preserve what we had what was important and this is again you know back to you know the skin that I have in the game it's a Canadian show uh produced here in Canada and it is I I believe of historical significance being the first animated computer animated TV show so yeah Toy Story pretty special moment um reboot also a a pretty special moment in uh in computer graphics
but I also have to leave see you later goodbye sort of not end of show asks how's this better quality than Blu-ray you can't make a Blu-ray without the master tapes these are the master tapes these are where the episodes are stored they're not available in their original quality anywhere else so this is so that there could be a Blu-ray  so cool um all right so I guess it's uh just you and me oh uh hi let's go with not this view maybe I mean yeah that's not great either um how about that how about just
I move yourself over there is that a  you you didn't even manage to go in the right direction really it's backwards it's backwards I didn't even realize said uh yeah sure uh we I don't know if we want to put Dan in the chair because he's logged into all his stuff over there and it'll be a bit of a hassle for him to do that over here and we've still got to do merch messages I think it's time for w show after dark so uh shall we shall we do that sure I really sincerely wish that I had used the uh
fact that Luke was still here to run to the washroom earlier because now I just get to hold it for the rest of the show cool all right hit me Dan sure sure will try and make this uh work uh Hey eek and NAD I recently got an RFID collar cat feeders to prevent them stealing food from each other and they have been awesome is there any pet related Tech that you ended up loving I had one of those RFID um Kitty doors and the idea was that one of the cats would be allowed out into the garage and one of them
wouldn't uh they ended up being so strong our cats um the the Bengals that they were both able to just force the door open in either direction but the concept was pretty cool because the idea was you could authorize in out in and out or nothing on a per microchip uh basis uh I I have not actually ended up investing in much pet technology my cats just seem to be too smart to care about anything that's not actually human controlled like you can't just have a little you know thing
on a motor that just kind of moves around they just they get bored of it hey D when did LT writers start getting more screen time and what goes into deciding when a writer is or isn't featured on a particular video this has been a different answer at various stages in the company's history I mean the first time a writer was featured on screen was when Luke joined me for wano like 10 years ago or something like that um as for what goes into deciding when a writer is or isn't
featured in a particular video there's a number of criteria that we look at internally James is actually the one who creat kind of a a rubric for uh determining you know whether someone should be on camera and what are the success metrics that we're going to be looking for it's something that's not actually rolled out yet because up until now it's been a little bit more gut feel but there are definitely things that we that we look for I mean we look at subject matter passion uh that's
something that's really important to us cuz you can you can train people to be somewhat functional on camera but you can't train someone to actually care about the thing that they're talking about and genuine caring about it is in a lot of ways a lot easier than learning to act like you care about it right so if we just take people who are genuinely really interested and passionate and excited you know even if they are you know let's say um a relatively low energy personality right like you look
at your high energy personalities the people like uh like a me or an Alex and you compare that to someone that is maybe more of a a low energy person ality like like a Nicholas plof he can still be really excited and you can still get engaged with that um because he just genuinely cares right so it it makes up for a lot of differences in style that might otherwise not really work um one of the things is you know how well do we want the video to perform it's no secret that a video will perform
better if it's hosted by me and the more hosted by me it is the more better I mean it's something that Mr Beast has talked about on his videos where if his you know Supporting Cast appears for an extended period of time retention goes down it's it's uh people subscribe to these channels and the the closest parasocial relationship they have is with the primary host of these channels and you can kind of you can have other personalities be part of it but they are less permanent than the primary hosts of
these channels I mean like I don't I don't know for certain that Luke will be on LT forever I think so I mean we're buddies we're good um I he he believes in the company he believes in our mission all these things are aligned but at the end of the day you know an employee doesn't have the same level of permanence as the owner founder host um so you know that's something that has to be carefully considered when you're going to start grooming someone for on camera appearances and and investing in
both that that training of them for for the new job that they're doing and training the audience to get to get used to seeing them right so there's man there's a lot of things to consider but I'd say the biggest ones are are just you know how much is the audience going to like this because at the end of the day you guys are the boss and if you guys like it then it's good and it works and if you guys don't like it then it doesn't work and the whole thing collapses right oh let's see hey D would you like
to in uh who would you like to invite next to the WAN show I find myself still thinking about the conversations with Jim Keller and telling anyone that we listen I find myself still thinking about the conversation with Jim Keller that was great um I have not had any particular thoughts on someone else we'd like to invite to the WAN show that one just kind of fell into my lap I still have a lot of the same concerns that I had around having him as a guest right like we almost never start on time
because our schedules are are hectic and and difficult so anytime we have a guest who you know earns more in a day than I'm worth in six months right like I and I don't necessarily think that Mr Keller is paying himself that much I just mean if we were to bring on okay let's say let's say Jensen right if we were to invite Jensen to the W show it's like I don't know how how many how many cents did the Nvidia stock go up in the last half an hour while he's been waiting for
us right like I it's something that I feel self-conscious about that's for sure I don't want to disrespect anybody and if I know that I'm probably not going to be on time then I'd rather just not book the meeting so there's a little bit of that and a little bit of just like it's tough to find the right balance right like I've definitely seen other Tech creators that have platformed people that I honestly wouldn't have been that comfortable with a lot of um a lot of people are hyper
influential but honestly have um have things to answer for that I would feel obligated to ask them like I I there are a number of people in the billionaire class that if I had them on the show like think about it for yourself with Jim Keller it's no problem let's talk about you know microprocessor design the future of computing amazing conversation what a great guy um but you know he doesn't have a lot of baggage as far as I'm aware like if if I had one of like one of the the you know the real Titans
like one of the one of the one of the billionaires right if I had one of those on the show like if I brought if I brought in Jensen if I didn't ask him why he doesn't give two sh about Gamers anymore would you guys be happy with that right so what am I going to do I'm going to bring these guys on I'm going to do a puff piece I'm just going to like ask some questions they want to answer and and that's it like look at man look at how much um Elon musk's demeanor changed as soon as Don Lemon
started asking him the questions that he should be answering he basically goes I don't have to I don't have to answer your questions yeah because that's his attitude he doesn't think he owes anybody aing explanation for anything thing it's that it's it's that arrogance that I would feel obligated to challenge if I have someone here on my platform in front of your eyeballs that's that's my responsibility and I'd honestly rather just not have them on hey lonus when renovating your home
was it worth it to you to install Outlets with USB both type A and C in convenient places or did you decide using charging block was better I wish that I had done some of them with uh USB ports I uh we didn't we just left all the original Outlets because we didn't want to throw money in a dumpster for no reason uh but I I I definitely wish that I'd strategically put some in in fact I bought a couple and they're still sitting in my bin of stuff to do to strategically install like under the
kitchen counter and like in a couple of other places I I considered at one point replacing all of them and if we were going to replace them I was going to be like ah screwed I don't know get the USB ones uh but then I looked at the price difference I was like okay actually you know what just forget the whole thing put the original ones back in U but yeah I'm going to go around I'll do it myself in an afternoon or something like that it's if you I I I I'm not recommending
that you do that in fact in some places it's illegal to work on your own house in that manner but I um I have the capability of replacing a duplex receptacle so you know just to turn up the breaker make sure all the things go in the right place um so I do intend to do that at some point hi W.D buying this is a Father's Day gift my question is for Luke uh well hm awkward I've worked at a startup that does web scraping what are your thoughts on the laws that protect from it right now it's
a gray Zone lus do you have any thoughts for Luke uh sure yeah um Luke generally believes in a in an open internet and um understands the the complexities and challenges around allowing anyone unlimited access to your API um so that's why you obviously can't just pull as many requests that way as you want so that's one of the reason reasons that screen scraping is done he also understands the value of protecting your data protecting your content um and understands why you know a website might
try to protect against screen scraping but you know I think he's going to balance th that knowledge against his General belief in um that information should be openly available uh to people and so I think he would probably have a a nuanced take rather than uh a yay or nay this should be a thing or this shouldn't be a thing there I did my best I'm pretty sure that's something like what Luke would say I got another question for Luke dang it I uh whoops uh have you followed anything for the game
Dark and darker have have you you don't play extraction Shooters nope I haven't look Luke okay Luke he's not going to answer Luke hey W question mostly for lonus hey we got one are there any other VR games aside from beat saber that you used to work out I personally love until you fall I man beat saer just kind of became my thing um I definitely liked hollow point before that um it's a wow is that ever a dynamic game once you get past the first couple of levels you're diving you're
ducking you're dodging um really cool if you haven't played it before basically you've got a bow and arrow and you've got to you've got to shoot these things that they turn red gradually and then when they do they fire something at you and when you break them they fire something at you so you basically have to hit them and immediately Dodge every every single time you take one down you got to and you got to be looking all around you all the time because they they spawn in and then they start
changing color and then you get up a little bit higher and then like guys start coming at you on the ground it's it's it's it's crazy when the pandemic yes I was trying to do the ant baru voice thank you for catching it quantum Rand when the pandemic hit we went from one to one Chromebooks we went to onetoone Chromebooks as an IT teacher trying to certify students in the A+ I have students that have never used windows it's becoming an issue how can I prep them you can't um uh yeah no but this is
what I'm talking about this is what I'm talking about you got an entire generation of kids who the only computer that they might interface with on a regular basis is a Chromebook um I think A+ is going to have to kind of like figure that figure that out a little bit and that's going to have to be part of their prep materials that they develop and let's see last one I've got for you here hey lld I've seen some big YouTube channels starting their own streaming services recently did they
contact you about float plane has the moment for float plane as a service arrived um no I think we need we would need to hire someone whose entire job is to is to build out float planes offering and it's very clear to me that there are streaming services that could benefit from our team's expertise I I I tuned into the Canucks short-lived playoff run and I discovered that um sportset plus which is owned by Rogers which is a media giant here in Canada um ISP mobile network provider uh anyway they they own
the broadcasting rights for um that particular series I think the NHL in Canada I don't know whatever I I I forget how the rights work it's been a long time since I followed it closely the point is I was watching on Roger Sports Net plus and um hilariously I discovered that they have not figured out a DRM protection scheme that protects their streams from users simply logging in opening a stream window getting a session key and then just sharing that with anyone they they are
not actually doing any user account authentication we solved that like five  um and I'm sitting here going dude we've got like half a dozen people what are you even doing so yeah there's definitely opportunities there with companies that have money we just haven't developed that business because we're doing we're doing other stuff I I don't know what to tell you I I would I would love for float plane to really take off but as it is it's it's still doing fine like we've got I think like
"35,000 subscribers on float plane right" now to LTT alone we've got other creators on the platform um it's just  thing uh yeah sure um hi friends it's my husband's birthday on the 3 and he always listens to the W show on podcast could you give him a shout out he wishes there was more W show throughout the week well it would help if you told me his name um but hey I'm going to do this the best way that I can um shout out  so that's that that worked out great and I think we've got a
problem oh no we do we do have a problem hold on I think I have a solution I can't push the button I think I think I have a solution it's illegal uh I I'm I've got this I've got  on hello uh Hey we've got a bit of a problem what all right thanks for for tuning into to the W show we'll see you again next week same bad time same bad Channel
