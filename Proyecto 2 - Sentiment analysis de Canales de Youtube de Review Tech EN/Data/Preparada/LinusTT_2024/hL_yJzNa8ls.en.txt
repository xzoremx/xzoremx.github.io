this is Doug's brand new racing Sim we spared no expense to allow Doug to take full advantage of a Lamborghini Kos without risking his real one getting impounded and although this setup is relatively cheap for a Lambo with an "$118,000 price tag this virtual car" eclipses the cost of many used cars there's only one small problem it isn't currently together and I need to leave for the airport in 5 hours well we better get cracking folks and build this as fast as we possibly can thanks to
some help from our sponsor origin PC who were kind enough to not just sponsor this video but also send over an absolute top-of-the-line PC that's even painted to resemble Doug's personal Lambo you can check that out at the link below now this isn't going to be the most over-the-top racing Sim we've ever put together the one we have upstairs probably has a few more features but in talking to Doug's team it became clear that they weren't necessarily looking for the ultimate racing Sim they were
looking for a really good racing Sim that U actually works every time you sit down at it that means that things like a full motion rig a multim monitor setup and VR are out of the question that also means we needed a little bit of help we weren't aware we needed help but when we reached out to Advanced Sim racing a Sim racing builder in Quebec their co-owner Mark Andre looked at our parts list and he said eh not bad but it would be way better if you just let us select all the
best parts so that's exactly what happened starting with this ASR Pro cockpit with a custom paint job it's made of extruded aluminum so it's super strong easy to adjust and most importantly easily expandable with accessories like this heavyduty TV stand a PC stand a keyboard tray anything you want as cool as triple monitor setups might be there a bit of a pain in the butt to configure especially in your various games so we went with the Predator z57 have you ever seen one of these in
person no the resolution of it is 8k horizontally by half of that vertically so you're basically running at half of 8K and this is about the wildest curved monitor we have ever seen W there we go not bad right wow it really does seem like one giant windshield yeah the only drawback is this only runs at 120 HZ I'm very sorry all I know is that it has a Lamborghini on it fair enough everything's got a Lamborghini on it let's take a look at this rig that origin sent over even though we are
targeting a mere 120 frames per second because of the resolution and the importance of Maximum visual Fidelity in Sim racing origin spared no expense creating Doug's PC we're talking a ryzen 9 9950 X processor with 16 cores and a 5.7 GHz max turbo a Corsair h150i LCD liquid CPU Cooler and Asus Rog Crosshair x670 hero motherboard 64 gigs of Corsair Dominator titanium ddr5 memory an Nvidia RTX 490 4 terab of nvme storage and of Corsair RM 1200X shift power supply they've got a couple limited time offers
running right now we'll have those Linked In the video description but the most important thing is not limited time and that is that they warranty includes free lifetime phone service which don't take this the wrong way but you seem like you might need yeah definitely Car Guy Tech guy I needed to be coached on how to pronounce Lamborghini it's kunak uh kunach kunach sorry we all got our Specialties so with that in mind the trading Wheels come off now and you are going to put together the rest of the
car PC the good news is most of this should be pretty self-explanatory like this steering wheel exactly this is your wheel base the mosa racing r21 it has 21 new M of peak torque you would know torque I got torque yeah so that basically means that it could pretty much break your wrist if you were stupid enough to put your hands in it and the force feedback went wild wow okay that's what I'm looking for for one of these that 21 newm of torque that's a maximum and in most cases you wouldn't
experience more than about 10 in an actual race car unless you crash of course so you're probably going to want to adjust that down for for daily use being direct drive though it means that it's going to be like super responsive and realistic feeling or at least that's the theory I have you're going to be the judge of that for me cool I'm excited to find out I'm legitimately curious to find out how close we're going to get the actual Racing Experience so am I especially cuz we have the real steering
wheel oh no way they didn't tell me they got this this is the OG wheel from the actual car and then we've just got a mosa adapter plate on it yeah we CNC machined the little adapter oh my God that is so cool it's going to feel very real okay but we're not ready to do the steering wheel yet there we go you know it's funny I was going to volunteer to be the one to screw it in and then I realized like you probably have more experience working on low rigs than I do so I guess you get to screw it in right
and hopefully I'll get to do some of the cabling too yeah oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah no don't worry I'll save some for  go get a jack no no no we don't need a jack we're good we're good I got it I got it don't even worry don't even worry I promise I have very rarely dropped heavy things on other YouTubers faces you promise you're not going to kill me I mean it probably wouldn't kill them right no this really is the perfect intersection of tech and cars right like the experience of working on it right
right that is true not that different it's not now tell me something they seemed really proud of this seat for some reason is what's the story behind the seat this is a very close approximation of a real Lamborghini seat from this era the same look the same stitching the same sort of feel I think we found it on eBay it was probably out of a car that crashed and killed somebody no I'm kidding probably just caught on fire but the seat's good yeah the seat was really hard to get into this if you
look we had to make a completely custom plate on the bottom because these are like fiberglass right into the car it was awful that's super cool great work Justin thank you I realized we didn't even talk about the pedals have a feel the brake should be pretty cool there's a load cell in it so it's supposed to feel like it feels Breaky yeah exactly and then the clutch is three-stage so it's supposed to kind of mimic the feel of real clutch engagement yeah it does okay impressive good if he says it's
good then I'm good um also the travel is completely adjustable so whether you've put something aftermarket in your car or whether something is worn or whatever else you can kind of adjust everything make it actually feel correct yeah got it and really that's what this rig is all about with the authentic seat with the paint job with the adjustability we want to get this as close to keeping you safe so you don't feel like you need to get in the real one all the time you
know as possible right good I appreciate that we're just looking up for your audience thank you so much yeah we've already spoiled the genuine Kosh wheel so obviously we're going to be giving Doug that but do you want to talk through the other two wheels that we're going to be equipping him with we've got this F1 style wheel here it has clutches in the back really really nice dual shifting clutch CL stuff is that real carbon fiber yeah forged carbon fiber here also more of like a rally GT car
style one this is legit look at all these buttons what could all these things possibly do I assumed you would tell me well I I've never seen a button that says box on a steering R before whip whip whip wiper okay thanks I don't know it just says WIP I assumed it didn't mean work in progress so these are all programmable you can map them to whatever you want some of them will be actual car things while some them will be like Advanced to next race or whatever else no okay that's fun but you
haven't even touched this one yet oo real Nappa leather ooh the Box button is back and whip wow this is legit too and forged carbon it seems so much better than what you get in a normal car I know right and certainly better than what you get in the Countach speaking of yes we spoiled this earlier but I think now is a perfectly good time to show you how to swap out your wheels so go ahead and take this okay put it on there easy and then when this is powered it'll be locked but I'll just hold it for you now
go ahead and twist yeah there we go there we go now it's engaged yep by the way uh you probably noticed there bit of a gaping hole in our planning just kidding the plan is perfect Joel telling 3D printing nerd he's sending over a custom centerpiece for it that is going to look it's getting printed on a Muki 3D printer that does inkjet stuff oh that's that one the multicolor one yeah it looks insane and then it really will look like the original kach oh it will will hey we
got power on on the display now yeah it's a little far away for a typical windshield but don't worry we're going to get that in closer for now we want to install your butt kicker oh I can't wait okay turn around no no I'm kidding that's an actual thing I'm kidding it's an actual thing these are lots of fun now you specifically asked us to not give you a full motion Sim but we still wanted it to feel like you're in a car unlike a full motion rig which is going to take ages to set up and get working the butt
kicker just uses your in-game audio and basically is kind of a subwoofer that is attached to your butt right and it is literally called the butt kicker yeah that seems right so where do I where does it go in your butt no no no I okay well here we we'll go over there one sec this is a situation where Doug's preferences may have accidentally made his rig a little bit better for his purposes a full motion SIM can even slow you down in some situations because they aren't always super accurate compared to
driving a real car so all this does is kind of fill in the low end and improve immersion a little bit long after your actual subwoofer has given up we got four butt kickers yes my butt's really "going to get kicked $1,400 worth of butt" kicking did we really need four Alex we asked them for one and then they were like what about we send you four we were like sure that's perfect four is better than one yeah until you wire them all oh question for you Alex is he expected to
put this all back together once we ship it to him I assume we're shipping it right we're going to ship it and I'm pretty sure but don't say 100% sure but I'm pretty sure that advanced Sim racing is going to send over some text to your office and set it all up for you I already did it once do it again no problem yeah all right this is all me yeah never mind Mark Andre uh you don't need to do that service uh no no please Doug can do it please now Alex you said you felt very strongly about this
particular choice do you expl why so many Sim racing shifters just feel like there's a stick with a couple buttons this right here from bdh has an actual shifter linkage inside of it that runs through here and it's modeled off of a Ford Escort RS causw word no way interesting and has super easy switching between sequential and H pattern and also using this knob right here you can really easily change how much force there is to move it's it feels incredible you can switch between an
actual manual pattern and a sequential and it features hall effect sensors for an extra long life what are you hooking up now Alex oh just power for the wheel base oh that actually makes sense I was like that's a pretty big power adapter surely that can't be for yes it can like I said if you're not careful you can actually break your wrist in this right right right I'm going to try to avoid that remember the goal is safety if you just want to line up one of them for me
yeah it's lined up which one uh this one here okay yeah so play play around with that whoa now we're this feeling real this position actually seems pretty good does this this moves right this can move up down uh yes although you know in the real couch my knees are right up against the steering wheel so this feels right oh okay we actually need to make it not ergonomically friendly in order to mimic the actual car my turn to go upside down okay yeah where do you want it do the other one do
the one closer to you that one's perfect right now in there oh yeah you better believe it I'm going to get you back in the chair since we moved it around so much I'm so sorry all right let's see now man getting in and out of this thing is chore for you hey is it as bad as the real one no the real one is much worse cool we got to tighten up the shifting though oh there we go that's feeling oh it's so hard that's that's right that is correct almost unusable that's what we
need while I tighten this up why don't you check out your handbrake ooh handbrake yeah no handbrake button for this guy wow so I can do drifts oh yeah this thing 100 bucks very simple just bolt it on should be fine and we have a couple different positions it can go in depending on where exactly you want it okay perfect how's that feel wonderful like I can do some drifts that looks awful I think this isn't even tight enough compared to the real car but I'm going to leave it there
cuz it seems like that's all we need to do that's life let me tell you something you drive this car about 20 minutes you're like well I'm good for the week I'm I'm all set thanks and that's how I want it to feel when I'm playing my sim too speaking of inconvenience are we really going to install 5.1 surround Alex yeah why not because it's really inconvenient we can just like zip tie it on for the day ooh that's the right way to do it that's the Lamborghini way to do it I didn't even know anyone bothered
to make high-end 5.1 surround setups for PC anymore but here it is the steel series Arena 9 there's your Center Channel yes the true V12 soundtrack comes through there we go that's not going anywhere I'm guessing that's not too far off to the fast ing Solutions in the K either that's right that's right you've done a beautiful job oh oh oh no way oh yeah buddy I promise we're really close to actually drifting around a track but first we need to see if the butt kickers Works do you want to go
ahead and fire up some audio yeah let's  it perfect four butt kickers might be a lot no it's great that's how volume this thing is going to vibrate itself  whoa oh my God the sound of the brakes is that supposed to be like that there's light there's light well yeah there's light in the world no I've never seen light before how's it feel though how's it feel amazing it's so it's so real real istic there's a lot of feedback here which is so cool oh yeah there's a turd here forgot about that one that's
okay that's okay you didn't wreck it you didn't wreck it and if you did hey it's a digital wre yeah although the butt kickers would probably really kick my butt the wheel feedback is amazing it really does feel like the real car  and oh and it's it wants to get squirly all the time which is true of the real car too I have never driven my car like this so I have no idea if this is how it  situation oh can even hear the carburetor noises it's quite amazing oh oh you're just
fighting this car it's so accurate it's all you ever doing my arms hurt it's a pain in the butt but it was the right call Alex to have the speakers yeah the speakers are great headphones is not going to feel right okay we should have a look at your best lap and then I should see what I can do this is going to be my best lap for sure H don't jinx  oh oh man those brakes what an accurate representation of this car the feel of the steering wheel especially whenever I get out of my actual one my arms hurt
and they do right now that was the lap that was okay if you guys are enjoying this by the way over on Flow plane we're going to have Doug's take on ploofs modified Civic Mighty Car Mods had their way with it and it's now okay this is a 2004 Honda Civic  car oh man oh wow she really does yeah she Vibes this is real life I'm going to need this seat quite a bit further for oh uh-oh well we made it for you can you not all oh it hits the shifter it hits the shifter well it'll
be like driving my dad's car all right so the time to beat is 2 minutes yeah just about oh wow that is really heavy good Lord I don't even think that's as heavy as the real car I couldn't shift the real car like I was shifting this one oh my God you made it look who God oh God oh God oh God oh God oh God oh I'm going to die just bent some valves in the engine no question about it oh my God the how did you do four labs this is ridiculous oh boy oh God no oh no I forgot about the turn no it's okay it's
okay it's okay all right the cork screw is coming up you got to be really careful here uh-huh yeah I mean yeah oh that's not going to do it that's God so what we're learning is never let me drive your car brakes brakes I am hitting the brakes okay brother breakes more brakes for God's sake this uh LED indicator on the front here for your RPM is actually really nice it really helps yeah oh you're going way too fast you're dead oh no no no I'm not dead I'm not dead I'm not
dead I got this i got this i got this we're going to get back on the track come on let's go let's go I forget which way this turn goes I guess left brakes for God sake I mean I was on the brakes before was that not enough is it not it's never enough Breaking for you well all right all right you were 16 and 1/2 seconds off the face on that lap you want to do it again nope that's stressful dude my forearm I know it's hard is it unique to this car cuz that is exactly how the Kosh drives
it is that hard to use the steering wheel you might have to drop the force feedback for other cars that really was like quite a real look at what this car drives like I assume would drive like on a racetrack it was felt just as Buzzy the shifter was just as hard the steering was just as hard the braking was just as bad should we try a different car well why don't we just try a more modern Lamborghini then sure the Huracan performante you ready okay room I can see why people like the
older cars though this is almost like kind of sanitized yeah it's easy it's too easy how's the wheel feel the wheel is still pretty harsh more like the Countach I think okay so that's something that you might have to fine-tune as you go then yeah oh we're only at half wow for that k run let's say 30% probably how's that when way easier and more accurate to the car honestly this thing feels like a spaceship yeah in comparison compar to yeah even still I'm breaking too early
I'm still trying to adjust from the old car now I feel less stupid about how I was breaking last time I know I just didn't know the car like that's how that's how you're braking now effectively you just give it a little okay slow down buddy right and then you're good to go this car is enormously more forgiving too that that car was  sketchy okay let's see what we're going to get man I'm going to do a 144 so I'm 15 seconds faster than the fastest I did in the other car and that's after only a
couple of laps that's two laps yeah now tell me this for the price we paid for this rig which is about "$188,000 Grand would we be better off" just hopping onto cars and bids and just buying a Lamborghini uh you probably "can't find a Lamborghini for $18,000 but" not even a really old one no but you can certainly find someone usual stuff for that money why don't you show us how much the car we're driving is worth this is probably the closest to Pro actually truthfully this is the Clos its
approximation to what we were driving although it is yellow uh what the hell I know that's why I was cringing when you slammed it into the wall 10 times it's a valuable vehicle and it is a little bit more than "the $118,000 of this of this particular" driving situation but it doesn't it doesn't let you crash into the wall so in a sense the simulator is better let's change gears and let's find a car that costs the same as our Sim I found one hold on Alex no we don't have screen cap
running on that put that away okay that I'm pulling that up though that's the there you go oh dang it this is what you "want $188,000 okay here we go 2002" Bentley Arnage look at this thing this has turbocharged V8 massive car mhm and this is the kind of car that you you own the factory you drive this car you know what I'm saying look at this look at this quilted look at these quilted seats imagine the luxury you could have in your life for 18 G's is that a sheep skin foot like M it's Lamb's wool Lamb's
wool you ever have that I wouldn't want to wear my shoes in there you don't you get in you take off your shoes and it feels amazing on your bare feet who would take their shoes off to get in their car you want to rub it on your face what no you're kidding me no it's not you actually kidding me I mean you wouldn't do that I would consider doing that look you could have a trade table  exactly so what do you think of the setup it's amazing it's awesome it's so cool I actually think that the butt
kickers are amazing they really add a element of realism to this that's like special I'm not going to lie I was kind of questioning it when we came into this but it works it gives the car like a rumble that really is like accurate yeah and you don't feel you don't need like an entire motion rig in order to have that feeling you can just kind of vibrate it along with the frequency of the of the audio and it's like yeah especially for the these cars that vibrate so much when you go over the
rumble strips and the graph yeah gravel it like really does a good job of capturing that it's pretty impressive it's pretty cool actually yeah and you know what else is really cool is uh our sponsor for this video origin PC we didn't really talk about it much but notice that while we could hear the speakers and feel the butt kickers we couldn't hear a bloody thing from this darn near silent liquid cooled computer and it'll handle any game we want to run at Absolute maximum settings
even though he's running half of 8K resolution which by the way is twice as many pixels as 4K right unintuitively right cuz it's half instead of a quarter it's a lot of pixels but I think it's worth it for the immersion and it really does feel immersive it's quite amazing so now that this is set up this is about as jump in and go as it gets right and that's kind of the that's what I want to do want to just when the whim strikes me I want to just jump in and go and now I can if you guys enjoyed this
video and you're into the intersection of technology and cars maybe you like the time we put a turbo on a laptop yes yeah like an electric turbo right so it just did it do anything it blew out so much air that the keyboard bowed out that's great that's what you want your laptop to do so
