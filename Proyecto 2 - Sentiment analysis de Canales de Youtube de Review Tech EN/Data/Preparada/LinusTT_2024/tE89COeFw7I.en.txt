have you ever done this recommended a product to someone only for them to come back and tell you the whole thing was a nightmare it is the worst feeling it's even worse when you recommended that same product to I don't know a few million other people so when this email hit my inbox I was freaking out not only does buddy say he's got a broken laptop which I mean that happens from time to time DOA happens but then he goes into his awful experience with framework customer support now my Instinct was to
run to my computer and send an email to the CEO demanding that he help this customer but then I thought if one person is having this problem there could be hundreds or even thousands and if something's rotten over at framework putting a Band-Aid on this one complaint isn't going to solve it so I took matters into my own hands or rather someone else's hands deploying a crack team to go undercover and secret shop framework and spoiler alert things didn't get off to a perfect start with
one of our two machines arriving with a factory defect which I guess is good because it gives us an opportunity to put their customer service to the test the stakes really couldn't be higher here as some of you may remember from my investment disclosure I said that if framework doesn't uphold the promises and commitments they made to me and our community my breakup with them will be swift absolute and in public you might also remember in that video I segued to our sponsor really Bridge who's coming
at you with something totally different a soft wallet it's a double-sided leather wallet designed to hold both your cards and your cash and you can  description let's start this off by taking a closer look at the email that kicked off this whole investigation after Seth received his DIY framework 13 and installed his own Ramen SSD he was having issues getting it to post he reached out to support and was frustrated to say the least when it took 7 days to receive a response that
wasn't automated and adding insult to injury they asked him to try troubleshooting steps that he already said he tried first thought then 7 days is a really long time to sit there with a fancy new not to mention expensive paper weight but hopefully it's an outlier to find out we attempted to recreate his situation by ordering the exact same laptop opting to bring our own RAM and SSD but since one laptop it's not very large sample size we decided to double it placing a separate
order several months later for a pre-built framework 16 fulfillment for both of them was what I would describe as solid we ordered the DIY 13 way back in March 6 days later landed on our doorstep not bad considering it came from the other side of the world as for the framework 16 same story except in July and and it arrived on a different doorstep we wanted to make sure that if we had to open support tickets for both machines that they would not be coming from the same person or from the same
address now we'll get to support in a bit but first one of framework's main attractions is that they provide resources that assist the user with repairs and the maintenance of their device so rather than just have me build the DIY Edition again we recruited Natalie from our LT store team she knows enough about tech to be interested in it but hasn't spent literal days with her head inside a computer let's see how she did all right what is this cool okay oh wow stickers it's actually pretty
enjoyable watching People's you know real not overblown YouTuber reaction whoa stickers wow I kep this is what a normal person looks like when they're reacting to stickers you can tell she's being like super careful with everything yeah but that's the way that a real customer would be people often get after me about the way that I'm like yeah I don't know yeah someone else will pick up these boxes a lot of the time it is me after the shoe but yeah I like the I like the quick Pace you know 100%
whereas she likes to work in computer at the end all right packaging is not that great to open oh sick burn on the packaging I do like this paper very I don't know how protective it is but it's very nice and clean I gave her basically nothing going into this cool I told her that your bu building a laptop you can use as many guides as you would like which is from Frameworks website that's pretty cool so this is representative of pretty much a worst case scenario in terms of how informed she would be
because if she had actually placed the order herself she would have maybe read the product page but she's going in even fresher yeah which is important to keep in mind she's under a lot of pressure doing something brand new for her and something she's never done and trying to be camera presentable um so please like the video and leave a nice comment for Natalie cuz she did great in all honesty yeah she's our  fresh oh Bel Air all right set up upgrade and repair guides view all guides so they had a QR
code that she was able to scan start with step one yes unbox your framework laptop don't power it on just yet you'll need to install some modules I will open it from the packaging first then framework laptop wow so excited Natalie locate the framework screwdriver in the package underneath yep so only the only tool you'll need to assemble the framework laptop DIY Edition okay let's see if that's true that is pretty cool that you only need one tool to build it and they give it to
you and this is actually where I noticed the first issue with Frameworks guides here oh it had the QR code in the box and it's she scanned it and it took her to that website there it didn't take her to the direct link for her specific skew I think that's something they could improve yes so she has the AMD version yes step four insert the ddr5 memory module so we lift open the flap there's two slots it's cool that they have videos in the guide not just pictures that's sick according to the video and
one thing I did confirm is the QR codes on the individual items themselves do take you to like those specific uh instructions so for the Ram or whatever right so everything else was right except the very first one which is the one that they shove in your face when you open it oh there we go first Ram stick doesn't look like she got it in quite a little more in might help I do think that video could be better I think they could show that you have to like slide it in a little harder one thing I
think that's tough about the video too is that like overlay of like the back 10 forward 10 and play stays open in that tiny window and it darkens the whole screen so it's like a little annoying you can see her several times she tries to like tap away so that it like goes away and then there's the click okay she gets it yep nice using the T5 bit in the frame or I need my handy tool unscrew the Fastener she works for Creator Warehouse Natalie you can say screwdriver it's not a competing product
yet do you think that screwdriver is better than LT stores how dare you H LT screwdriver all the way yeah she knows what's up I was just asking you she knows what's up it was a non-biased question traiter I speaking of bias actually this is probably a good time to ask like how I can evaluate something  them oh uh how can you fairly evaluate something like framework when you have invested in them Elijah what's your problem you managed the project you know that I didn't do anything but Greenlight it and
film it well and add this super awkward interaction this is a really awkward way of telling them yeah I I added this part I thought it was funny that is not magnetic and I have to hold the screw in yeah what what is this Throwing Shade all right step five done go take that framework I would honestly call those like the easiest steps of a laptop cuz you can do that with even some pre-builts already well the challenge is getting that thing open sure in a lot of cases yeah it's really easy when it's
easy to open up the machine mhm install the touchpad cable assuming it's this gestures of well the picture the picture doesn't really match that's a really good point make sure the touchpad side of the touchpad cable is fully inserted here so this is one of those things where it it comes inserted already but they actually give a step eight just in case right make sure you double check this yeah it would be nice if they said it is pre-attached yeah but it could come loose in shipping tell me
why yeah so yeah it does say in the red there the cable should be inserted far enough yeah but it doesn't say why I'm checking it yeah like occasionally these come loosen shipping due to thermal expansion and contract like tell me why I'm doing something yeah educate me there you go nice good job Natalie uh align the corners of the bezel to display and place it down the bezel is attached by magnets and should easily click into Place sometimes sometimes the display cable can kind of not cable manage
perfectly oh no that's going to happen isn't it you're going to find out very  good doesn't not sound great oh she didn't screw on the top yet no she wasn't supposed to the instructions did not tell her to screw on the top the instructions ask to open the hinge 180Â° and put the bezel on she followed that yeah so she didn't have it quite aligned yet yep let's try this one again so you can kind of see some of those cables there y by Magnus okay was that is something that framework could improve
yep it would be nice if they had pictures of what correctly seated cables looked like yes because I've actually run into it before where I routed it across the wrong thing and that made it worse not better mhm so she's now like double cheing everything she's like worried about her input cover she was worried about all of this interesting there's a lot of comments on these do the comments outline some of the issues that we've encountered already there was someone in the comments that help that
would have helped solve this issue that crunching we'll find out in a little bit was actually due to how the um screws because they're captive fell underneath the laptop and the hinge catches it when it tries to close got it and so it's the bezel related because you have to lay it down for the bezel yeah but it's caught on the screws yeah but the comments are not that obvious yeah she even mentioned she's like do I have to go in the comments I go to the comments there's no
way I go to the comments there's no way you have to go to the comist for instructions there's no way I have to go to the com oh Natalie so she doesn't so she doesn't she doesn't framework needs to go into those comments mine for nuggets of gold yeah and get them oh this wasn't back when I had my horrible haircut oh God man that's gross why' you show that on camera her infection what it was just her there now  infection so you can see the screw there caught on the hinge that's what I had to
do I had to turn it upside down so the gravity took the Fasteners back down  Crunch and then this is where I tell her in the comments someone points out that the Fasteners will get in the way yeah so this is actually where now it tells you to keep going and screw the Fasteners back in I think this step should honestly come first but they don't want the screen to be closed because without the bezel you know it doesn't add all the protection and everything right that is a big wall of
text for the expansion cards but I understand why I didn't even know this when I did my unboxing but the AMD version specifically has certain modules that work best in C certain spots MH modular IO it's pretty cool it's kind of cool it's pretty sick open the lid and press the power button all right this is the Moment of Truth here we go where's my top down view there we go note that your first boot will take a while before the logo that's a really good thing for them to point out especially modern AMD
platforms they take a hot minute for memory training on the first Boot and there you go there we go there's some intricate parts that are a little bit difficult to kind of grasp at first obviously with the the screw issue we didn't know until we looked at the comments um but overall like it's kind of it's a pretty fun experience building your own laptop do you think that you would save the personal between $100 to $200 to do this experience again this is the moment of truth I think so yes she
think so yes even after some struggles it's worth the savings for a hundred bucks a couple hundred bucks off the laptop the more of a Savvy Shopper you are on your RAM and on your storage the more you can potentially save because I got to tell you when we did the framework factory tour and I discovered that the DIY ones actually get fully assembled into a working machine before being taken back apart yeah and then sold as a DIY it's not labor savings yeah it's not paying a
markup on those additional components 100% the touch pad's working perfect that's good oh okay this is the camera and this is the audio that you're hearing from this framework laptop mic so hopefully everything sounds good sounds good Natalie good job Natalie thank you she put the stickers on nice cool this is actually pretty symmetrical the stickers I'm very proud of that I mean I'm pretty proud of the laptop too I'm definitely including that editor make sure that Parts in there at the end so
after this we did a full check just to make sure everything did fully work and it arrived to us in 100% working condition excellent mhm which means that if we want to recreate Seth's issue we're going to have to do some work he said his display wasn't turning on and the LEDs inside his chassis were giving him three different error codes but we couldn't find any reference to any of those codes on framework's website so either framework hasn't published them yet or it's possible Seth misinterpreted them
either way we won't be able to recreate his exact situation that he had the closest thing that I could come up with I took a knife to the display cable and cut it until it didn't turn on anymore it worked or did didn't work and then meanwhile we asked Alex to unbox the 16 look at his face that's a man who laptops he does laptop he seriously laptops okay this is their config which explains why we're able to get it in a week which is absolutely fantastic that's about what you expect and
especially given it's Canada went right into hosting mode I just asked him to open it and check it he was like hosting I was like this is great this great it's almost like he's been doing it for seven years I think so wait we wanted a pre-built config here this should have been pre-built I'm not sure why did we order a pre-built so this is where it gets confusing because we ordered a pre-built and as someone who never ordered a framework before I expected it to come 100% built but
because the framework 16 has the modular interface on top they make you put that together yes to make you know how to reconfigure it but as a user I was very confused when I saw the keyboard on top I was like huh do they mess up our order it does appear that it has everything that you need minus the iio but does it have a keyboard it does not it does not that's something that I normally expect on my laptops are you supposed to have a  no man that's so cool that's still one
of the like ah it's pretty cool it's sick the one we're watching on right now has a numpad installed so the keyboard is shifted to the side and the spacers are both on the right you get to choose if your trackpad is centered here or centered on your space bar when you have the numad over here that's a really nice little bit of customization that you can do we have confirmed that our pre-built is supposed to come without the keyboard installed that's a little bit questionable in my mind but at the same
time if you're buying a framework and not planning on configuring it just don't buy a framework buy any other laptop that's not repairable that is a fair statement as well that's a fair statement yeah yep the sales pitch for framework is the repairability the upgradeability the customizability if you aren't even willing to just put the magnetic keyboard on and it attaches real easy so like it probably isn't the machine for you yeah and that's okay audio is a requirement I don't even know
why this is a dongle they should just have it attached to the machine another fair I think criticism I agree with that they gave it to us on the third and then took it away on the 16 ooh we've got ethernet oh look at how fancy it looks it's right see-through oh never mind I don't like that as much anymore it does not fit within the chassis I actually I I have a bone to pick I don't like that because me being stupid I will drop it in my bag and one day I will go with that end first and I
will destroy it it should have been flush the way that I think of it it's a Wi-Fi for first device like many other mobile devices this is a great little USBC 2 1/2 gig dongle that's pretty cool at a good price very compact compatible with anything totally understand the  though thank you for destroying our capture oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] so the ethernet doesn't break very well but it break the Other M oh shoot the system locked up hold on hold on we'll we'll we'll turn it back
on we're just going to shut it down and turn it back on did I break the computer can you just make sure this still works hey thank goodness and your 2 and half gigs still works as well nice anyway the point is that if you do put it in your bag with this thing in is it the most elegant thing ever absolutely not I wish they had one of the little hingi style ones or something um but will it like immediately break no you just might have to reboot your computer all right it's
now plugged in let's try turning it on again yay input module connector board not detected uhoh uh is that supposed to be installed for a pre-built the input module connector board yes neat so he goes and double checks it just needed a little click it's possible during shipping 30 seconds for someone who is so far above the average in terms of their technical knowledge and experience with laptops like Alex is the 1% yeah if something takes him 30 seconds it's going to take
my mom 30 minutes to figure out for laptop repair my mom's good at lots of things yep Graphics all fantastic it appears that framework has done everything correctly finally let's just confirm that the webcam is working also is this microphone okay the microphone switch Works yep as far as a laptop has arrived correctly this one passes so then that seems like a w well Alex didn't quite check everything unfortunately there was actually an issue with our numpad in the top left region the top left region of
the numpad what does that even mean it was several keys and it was inconsistent oo so we tried reating the module on both sides we tried taking it out doing a whole bunch of configuration and ultimately we couldn't get it working even after updating Windows drivers and bios um so we had to open another support ticket and hand off to Elijah to give you the results from the DIY 13 I opened the ticket explaining what my issue was as well as some basic troubleshooting steps that I had already
taken the idea here was to see that if they would ask me to repeat my work just like they did with Seth 24 hours later framework responded with some follow-up steps and questions to help figure this problem out further after answering them and Responding back to those questions 54 minutes later they followed up one more time I was honestly pretty impressed that they got back to me so quickly and then we ran into the same issue Seth was having they did ask me to repeat a step that I had told them I did
in my first email and as an end user that's really frustrating to have to repeat yourself but as someone who did work in tech support helping people fix their Tech issues in the past I can't count the number of times that I have asked someone to reboot a computer that they said they have only to check their task manager and see that it's been up for 3 years in my personal opinion I think them asking me to try that is totally fine especially since this is their first time asking me to try it but
if we dive deeper into set case a little bit later you'll see that's not what happened to him for my machine here I had one more back and forth session and then framework came to the conclusion that we needed a new Display Kit and if you remove the days I was on vacation and the weekends where I wasn't working it took the framework support team three days to reach that result which is honestly pretty solid my new Display Kit arrived in 6 days and as you can see it works it took about 15 minutes to swap
it out using Frameworks guide that they both emailed us in that support chain and then included in the box with the screen repairable laptops for the win that's awesome as for our framework 16 that's where everything falls apart they killed it again who who am I kidding if you take out the weekends where I wasn't able to respond it took them 4 days to diagnose that numpad issue I was asked to send back the old one and they did Cover the shipping I just had to throw it in a box and send
it on its way at no point was I frustrated or upset with the framework support team and I'm confident in saying that they had no idea who we were since both devices were purchased using burner emails on credit cards that were not associated with an employee here but framework doesn't come out of our investigation looking perfect I'm going to throw it back to lonus so we can hear the rest of Seth's experience he spent almost three weeks chatting with support during which they did send
him a motherboard as a troubleshooting step but then after the swap Seth was still having the same issue like kijah pointed out asking the user to try something once that's fine even if the end user does say they already did it but in this email chain we can see that framework asked him not once but twice to try external displays and not once but four times to try different combinations of shuffling Ram around I think that would make just about anyone feel like they're getting the runaround
especially if this is happening over the course of a month now he did say some kind words to framework in the final email expressing that he believes in their mission to create more sustainable and repairable devices but that given the laptop was for his wife's schooling he couldn't wait around forever for a working device I don't blame him for asking for a refund so what's the takeaway then for you guys it's what we always say you should be looking for multiple sources of information every
time multiple media Outlets consumer reviews to get the whole picture of a product or company you are going to have to go out there and dig for it as for framework well hey the good news for you guys is that while you do make mistakes it seems like the impression even from people who have a bad experience is that you guys actually care and that's a badge that you can wear with honor that doesn't mean that there's no room to improve but hey at least you guys recognize it this Reddit thread actually
popped up while we were working on this video with Buddy buying 150 devices to deploy and then realizing that every time they opened a support ticket they were going to have to go through this same tedious Back in Forth email experience I mean for an end user snapping some pictures and communicating over a couple of days might not be the end of the world but if you're going through that kind of rigar roll with a fleet of devices you're going to be tearing your hair out thankfully though
the op made a follow-up thread explaining that because of his feedback framework is actually expanding and changing some of their systems around their business to business sales model meaning that other companies should have an easier time buying and taking care of a large number of their devices they even ended it with saying they sincerely give a that is very encouraging and while I'm not going to give them a grade because I don't think you can boil this down to just a letter or a
number I think it's safe to say that I'm still on board and actually whether he knows it yet or not so is Seth I realized Seth you probably have another laptop by now but I would like to offer you as a show of our appreciation for bringing this issue to our attention Elijah's handf fixed framework 13 so hey thank you very much and as for the rest of you let us know in the comments if you've had any experiences with framework that you guys would like to share and while you're down there hey
