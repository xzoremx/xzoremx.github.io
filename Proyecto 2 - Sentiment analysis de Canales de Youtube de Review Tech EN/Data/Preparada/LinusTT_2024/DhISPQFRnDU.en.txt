one by one we've been setting up our team with "$5,000 ultimate Tech upgrades that they" can spend on anything they choose from board games to extremely scary induction forges and today it is Colin our production assistant turn we're going to be upgrading his music gear his camera gear and of course his gaming PC with one of the best CPUs AMD has to offer there's just one small problem Colin is still learning English which AMD knew about and decided to send over this  translator no I'm so excited let's try
it okay col and say something why do you look like Slim Shady Great Scott it   another AMD upgrade means another AMD giveaway this time you can win one of five Radeon 7700 XT Frost Punk 2 edition cards from Sapphire not only does this card feature 12 GB of vram but it's also themed after the game Frost Punk 2 which by the way you actually get a deluxe edition code for the game with the card enter for your chance to win by using the link in the video description being mute has made Colin extremely popular at
the office because he can never rat out anybody for taking things but that doesn't mean that he isn't guilty himself in fact I've already found something that is very recognizable because it's probably the only one in North America Colin why the bloody hell do you have one of these I acquired this from the Christmas party that's what they always say the pillow I knew about when he came from the old country he had absolutely nothing so we kind of said yeah sure you can have one of those I'm
unsure what does device does but I still acquired it from the office it looks like you put a bunch of Apple watches in it I I I've never plugged it in it was in the swag pile and I just took it he should talk less I've never seen so much self-incrimination I title tailed it myself calibration complete de Voom spark your life connecting what the hell is this thing apparently it's just some sort of pixel art display it's $1 170 Canadian dollars so it's a $100 off so clearly nobody
else gets it either did you help him with any of this because I don't know if he realizes that this is not really very modern I don't even know what that is maybe Colin can explain it so tape I can talk now I know but can you like understand this is tape yeah it's tape not good it's not good I agree that's why I got this this is the power play fpv DVR so basically what you can do is this makes this now a tapeless setup okay so it's a little box that goes from The Av Port
the out to the AV in right on here and it looks like a GoPro it looks like a GoPro but it's not a GoPro and what you could do is maybe just get a GoPro no because it's it's I want it to look like the camera is this like some Zoomer where like it's a Vibe and you want to record like an old I wouldn't say maybe Boomer it looks like you've got almost everything for a new PC are you taking anything from the old one yeah so I'm taking the power supply and the AO out of the old one
okay hopefully the aiio transplants without too much trouble and then Elijah do you want to get things going with the TV yes sir I think Colin likes having holes in his walls do you like holes in your walls there's no holes involved with this TV we not mounting it to the wall well not until Elijah gets his hands on it I put like five extra holes in someone's wall there's still going to be a hole so am I helping with this or so far no okay I mean you can be helpful if you
want okay yeah I can I've built one or two of these I think all right it's what that thing is though right uh a computer  right I'm yeah I'm moving my TV oh you guys know there's no room to put that down right yeah there is yeah there is oh okay it didn't look like it was going to fit with the Soundbar there okay fine so nervous doesn't trust us pece after into his house don't move it now want to explain your rationale behind your parts here you've got a pretty decent gaming
machine already but you've clearly gone balls to the wall yeah so I have a 5700x in the old PC this is just the obvious choice um mainly I use my PC for only gaming um so gaming and music stuff I use for my Windows machine and then on my Mac I use for all the cre stuff so this kind of is more gaming Centric but this gives me enough ches and enough power for the music stuff got it he's gone with 32 gigs of ddr5 6000 cl30 which is basically the perfect spot for bang for the buck so I don't think you
noticed but the CPU is from the office too oh this is from our Roundup yeah yeah and then this board is from the Caris okay he sold it to me on the low I didn't look too far into  two you got scammed what do you mean I got scammed this is a 500 gig in here yeah that's my old one the new one's in there oh what Colin I have to preload it okay with videos with videos from the web cut that that is exactly where I was going to put this down thanks Elijah well I was clearing the desk cuz didn't you
want to show off you know show off what oh it's not quite the final version no way we've got a modmat here today okay cool let's build on the modmat made in collaboration with the original creator of the modmat the LT modmat is better in every measurable way all right coming soon LTD store.com let's go you can sign up for a notification I got to say this is a very Nic looking build did you build this yes I did damn what do you need all this storage  Drive I only have bad jokes I don't want to
know something something goon cave something man your dating profile must be a trip my favorite thing is that you just automatically assumed I'm single like there was just no doubt in your mind I just mean you know you have a goon room it's a lay I prefer layer I actually just lost a screw though oh it's it's stuck to along with another bit it's stuck to the magnetic end of the screwdriver LTT store.com Ultra strong magnets while they struggle with that Colin actually bought a bunch of Ikea stuff because he
found a Pinterest perfect Ikea Des read it Reddit perfect Ikea desk and uh I'm going to get started on that by mounting things into the wall so here here we go I'm going to mount this peg board uh Colin didn't give me instructions so I'm just going to YOLO it but I think this goes above he's got two of them can we actually confirm are we going like this are we going like this uh horizontal do two side by side I love Colin that you were like hey we're just putting the TV
on a console there's no way Elijah can put extra holes in my wall and now you're having him Mount these so I would say so this that is kind of the same length as this so this shelf okay easy easy there easy tiger what are these instructions they're good instructions you said this that that this I was so confused I say that okay is like is is the same length as this okay so we want to line it up right and then you can put these and you want to measure it out so it's equal on each side and you're going
to go one and then have the one right next to it okay it's very easy what am I mounting first that's why you're doing it you green the makers of the nexo charger yeah did you really include that with your upgrade what do you need a like 200 watt USB charger for cuz this cuz basically what's going to happen yeah is that there's going to be a power bar up here yeah and then I have all the shelving and all all the hooks and everything so I'm going to have all my all my camera charging stuff on the peg
boards got it so this is kind of going to have to feed a lot of it cuz a lot of it's um uh USBC I've always kind of wondered what people are using these gigantic usb chargers for that yeah is a valid use case yeah and the Goon server too that has to okay let's we got to tone that down oh speaking of weird stuff I own you're a big fan of Star Wars I hear I used love the pre right you love the prequels wait what you love the prequels uh cuz boy do I have something a full siiz Jar Jar Binks in
his goon cave I I I own these two uh star Star Wars memorabilia um so I don't have the full body but I have the best part of the head oh what a weird thing to say is it oh they're putting two right yeah so what one on one side one on the other no I want them like attached yeah they will so I'm saying like where is the center like they have no chance no hope between the two you might as well just start putting in holes well no and then just no no no no no just measure the tape
and then well we can move the table I was going to say that we could just move it so I wouldn't worry about it so then I'm just going to put so this is fine yeah you're fine oh my God wait actually are you fine though oh see I know the only thing the only thing I'm worried about is that this end it doesn't line up with this this is the center of the table we can move the table I know but I I but you're cramming me this way I already have it in a good spot I'm going to now there shouldn't be a stud here 
okay what do I hear all right here we go no takes Backes go ahead penetrate the wall for Glory nice all right you're so sweaty yeah cuz I'm so  self-conscious why are you holding it cuz I don't want to lift my armpits cuz now I'm sweaty and life is like me no good result can come from such a bad process high up but I make it work I  stop dude we got to cut this down bro while Elijah's working on that why don't you tell us about your drone upgrade is this part of it yeah so that's part of
it um I currently have uh a mini2 and this is the air uh 2s uh I bought it from the office so basically the one thing I wanted to fix was having 4K 60 on a drone mine currently only does 4K 30 so this does 4K 60 and it does 5.4k in 30 and what do you use a drone for so mainly I would use it on weddings just with the consent of the bride and groom or is this another weird thing well you know they can hear it oo colins case is a big upgrade 01 Vision pcmr Edition that must have been something
that we ended up with as a sample that you bought on the cheap no no we I got that sent in from uh lean Lee so would you recommend that as opposed to as opposed to like zip tiing it what kind of question is this would I recommend my own product from my own store or would I recommend a zip tie that looks like sh zip tie is cheaper yeah it is cheaper that's a good point these are really expensive I'm  a but look how cool that is I know it looks so clean I did it and the magnets
are so strong you can like plug in a thing and you can pull it out and the magnet will keep the thing on the thing that is the best explanation I've heard so far why can't everybody just say it like that yeah but you see where I might have screwed up oh how they're overlapping yeah I didn't think they were supposed to overlap so oh so two extra holes okay uh we'll find out what go do your review stop editor cut it here to make it look like I did it Colin look hey we uh got
him perfectly leveled there's a tiny bit of a gap but I think it looks you know looks kind of good my God Elijah you did it in one try yeah there's no extra hole  get that in there hell  oh huh finally got the pegboards installed we left a little bit of a gap which kind of nice your shelf's installed we made a huge mess with all of the uh the C cotton candy so we're going to get this all cleaned up I think is there anything else we need to mount uh no not right now everything else
either will be with the hooks and and with magnets got it okay then we'll slide this all back and then we're good to go yeah oh my God you're bringing out the heads yeah nice head game on point it is wait what oh dear oh you're recording oh no so the one thing I'd like to do is take these goby lights and put them underneath and there's just two so I think they sink together and they should just go right into one of these pretty easily okay is it just to like shine light at your desk yeah just so I can
like app control it there at night if I'm alone in the dark um as I am there you go look at that and then o even more mixed light in here sorry editor now that we've put the desk back and lonus is still figuring out the computer you brought out all your camera stuff what was part of the upgrade and what isn't part of the upgrade you already had so the big part of the upgrade is the RS4 um so this is a new gimbal this is actually replacing my rsc2 uh I love this thing but this is
this is this is pretty Overkill I'm I'm camera illiterate okay what's a gimbal like what does it do a gimbal is basically a stabilization unit for your camera that basically you can put it on it and your and your shots are just really smooth got it so if I you were walking or something exactly so if you're even holding like a handheld tripod you'll still feel the bounce of your walks this Smooths it all out got it okay okay cool and then what is some of these like camera filters by moment
yeah so I got four filters I got all 82 twos I got the cinare gold streak I got the antiglare CPL I got the Blue Streak original and then the uh variable ND all in 82 got it which means that I have to which I also got these as well yeah so these are my knf uh step up rings so basically all my lenses currently are 67 so I have to I have to adapt them up to 82 got it okay so again I I know I said I had no idea anything about cameras how much is a gimbal cost uh this one's
pretty highend so this one's around 640 bucks Canadian oh Canadian okay so 450 us I'll thr on screen but yeah that's super cool that's super super cool so it's good it's good if you if you need to get like lower the ground yeah for like animals and pets it's great cuz you can just kind of just like follow them yeah there we go okay putting in my last fan here my exhaust fan I've got these ones screwed up I've got the Hub all wired and everything we're looking for one more CPU power cuz apparently we're
missing one this board actually has two headers then I think we're ready for a post test so let's screw this in I took a short break for a meeting and somehow it's worse than when I left it the shelf's on the wall though are you proud of me do you mean specifically this computer or is it a more general question all right we've gone with a 7900 XTX cuz Colin my boy is a gamer I mean I guess if you have nobody to talk to and infinite budget nobody else sleeping in your bedroom
what does that to do with the GPU just it makes sense to invest a lot in playing video games really fast col in  no none of this makes the YouTube cut turns out there was a lot left for the YouTube video but there's also over 30 minutes worth of extras on float plane as well as a 15minute meet the team video with Colin we learn more about his role here at lmg and he even tells us his weirdest experience that he's had on the job so far head over to lmg Dogg plane and subscribe today this
looks like ass where are all the cable Combs on the other ones well just only the one has cable Combs on it okay there's no cable Combs on those ones no there's not what you guys knew this yeah I I I could have told you that you you like I said it didn't matter you know what doesn't matter Elijah what your face did I just call out what you were going to say what your name is what my name is who shim shim Shady why are you cable tying the AO pumps I'm adding aesthetic no you're not
adding any oh that looks like ass not that looks like actual ass take 10 steps  God oh yeah oh yeah there you go oh yeah bud okay cool look at this Andrew what the like look at this one oh my God I can see the hole no no you can't you have an entire thing in front of it you managed to put the hole right in the gap between them oh only on a certain angle I can't see it from here what Colin's not complaining I don't care no it's fine do you know how many extra holes I put in oh man how 
four lus what you put the side panel on we didn't power it on yet uh oh calling your computer's broken he didn't plug in the front iio there's a problem you didn't plug in the front iio El do it give me a second I thought you built the computer no I didn't I didn't get much time on it cuz you know Elijah you're doing great I don't know if I am you're cheesy okay let's plug in the damn  cheesy like literally why didn't we decide to let him talk today uh it wasn't us that was AMD by the way thanks AMD
oh yeah yeah AMD lots of good technology gpus and CPUs and AI hey what I just turned off oh it's okay never mind fine yay okay three of these fans are not on the ones that I didn't install so I mean you you have a lot of gear like do you like play yes I do I I do in fact play guitar are you like a Weezer cover band or like no no I'm not in a band I'm not in a I'm definitely not in a Weezer cover band you could be in a blink2 cover band this system here is my pedal board um so
when I moved I wasn't able to bring my amp so I kind of needed to figure out something else um this seems way less complicated this is actually not that complicated it looks like a lock but it's not and a lot of them kind of do the same thing but I just have a bunch of them so I have 1 two three four five six uh delays mhm um you only need one  you still haven't explained what any of this does oh well basically so this is all di so you so you plug in it goes to the board and spits out out of here and
then it goes into the interface okay so and then this pedal actually is my amp okay so this is from uh UA this is the dream uh 65 Reverb um cuz if you run everything through it minus this you'll probably need like a uh like a Plugin or some sort of preamp to uh push everything wait what is that how did I not realize in this picture how did you not realize you're right there what is going on here this is my favorite band blinkin 82 so I thought the heck you guys I thought you uh Maria made me this
yesterday how does it have film grain oh I have it on a video background I have it on wallpaper so if you have wallpaper engine look up Linus 182 and it too can be yours I am dead serious it's live right now why do so many people who work here have pictures of me in their houses I got to remember who you're doing at before while you're setting up to play some music for us is there anything Elijah and I can do um you can run the HDM cable that I bought just run it from the back in uh around
the room into the TV cool right we haven't even turned on the TV yet okay cool let's do that uh where's the cable it's in this room that has everything in it just go in the Goon cave I don't care I found lots of magazines that Colin likes for the Articles oh my Playboy this is a really nice Playboy um it's from uh 19 don't open it it's all  don't imagine that being the page it opens to so I'm going to want one of the four oh they're all 4K 12 HZ that's right this is one of the new ones what
TV is this we didn't even say what the model was oh it's an LG C3 ooh oh open box unit he got it for like dirt cheap cuz it was open box how much was it "Canadian fo it was 1,700 Canadian I" think the finished setup looks really good though oh yeah this looks amazing like all jokes aside this is sick uh are you going to play music for us or you just going to stare at your blank screen well I have to I have to make sure the GPU works yeah yeah yeah yeah cuz of our sponsor AMD what is this what is this this
Tinder profile have you never seen super bad oh yeah I know okay I recognize I bought it from teu and uh it's definitely the lowest quality jpeg I've ever seen blown up to the biggest size I've ever seen it's like not even remotely centered if we go right right here that's that actually adds to it that's really the teu experience I got a promotion for nine free things and um this was part of it but the catch was that you had to buy two things so I ended up paying $50 for all this
garbage so I I got scammed from 10 there isn't even any room on this for more pedals I know I got to swap them out where even get put okay is this is this more delay or this is something else this one is so this one's kind of a weird one so this one's a micro Looper so typically a Looper is you time you're playing so so you count to four hit the loop then it goes this one always listens so it works in Reverse so you'll play and then you hit it and then it will start looping whatever you just did
uh and then these controls these control like your length so you can make it really short yeah or really long yeah is this alien thing more of your teamu garbage yeah it is actually anyways this is a great time to tell you about my other pedals so I got from uh Ranger effects the Reverb X it's another Reverb so I think I have six I have another pedal Dave Ranger actually just sent this one over but it's called the mini drone so I actually haven't used it yet so we'll kind of figure that out but I do know
that it just makes a drone which you can control two pitches um and that's really all I know so far so you know what they say pitches be crazy here we go here we go go he's riffing he's riffing boys let me just show you kind of what's I think this is the the best example we're going to call the Riz riff so this is a fuzz pedal so this is a fuzz pedal right so you hear that sounds like sounds like garbage right yeah okay and now it sounds like an amp  now   oh I just destroyed oh God
Jesus so that's a basically a really horrible demonstration of it it gives you a lot of control though you can you can manipulate stuff like you can basically manipulate any sound right in multiple different ways but it's just it's something to if you're playing something like that was really cool catch it there's a song about how you know being a guitar player is good for attracting the opposite sex uh I would know about that one no all right maybe you're playing it wrong I
think I think so I think they don't like to hear I think they like to hear a real news like a not come on give me that no oh Adam song yeah well I mean I'm I'm all dressed up for it hey there we go see he doesn't know how to play he was just pretending not to ladies ladies to tie all the video stuff back together you got Da Vinci resolve nice the the paid version you should have seen the previous takes that we did of this it was embarrassing what are you going to do with da Vinci though like
you I don't like paying Adobe I actually hate them nice and for the past last four years they've just been running up my credit card so you can buy Da Vinci once I already so this so This say 16 I actually have 18 cuz you get free upgrades Y and it's a it's a better editor it's got It's got better color and this is for what like doing weddings or like yeah well pretty much just anything really um just like freelance work kind of yeah yeah yeah exactly cool I feel like we didn't talk that much
about what we've upgraded like we're about to play some video games on the new TV obviously we upgraded the computer got a 7900 XTX got the drone the weird camcorder thing that I can't even fathom needing a couple pedals and then like that's it well I got all the video stuff as well I think you were I think you missed it so so um I got a brand new gimbal I got all the filters that I got in I got a new power bank none of which answers my most important question what the is that computer doing
it is the most beautiful piece of art I have here have you played tape to tape before oh yeah really love it but why do you never join us for runs you never invite me I've literally never been invited I don't have you on Steam all right we're going to fix this we're going to fix this are we friends now I I don't know are we best friends are we are we go oh why you get to things escalate so quickly with you sorry do you play like mouse and keyboard or something no no I
just I haven't played in a bit okay okay we just got to move the puck a little bit better here boys okay we got to move the puck let's move the puck let's go Carlos Chico yeah this was fun this actually ended up being while not a huge change to the layout or anything like that a huge change to the vibe of the space like man it went from well it went from what it was to a really nice living room setup then that TV is gorgeous this computer corner is amazing I mean spending a
bunch of money on a case is not the kind of thing that I would necessarily tell people to do but oh man wouldn't you want to sit next to this freaking awesome and the pedals are now you have those and now I can make more noise yeah uh well oh yeah they need this back I'm so sorry yeah I know I'm really sorry no you actually can't have it anymore wow it's like taking a bone away from a really angry puppy see you later and thanks am for sponsoring AMD ultimate Tech upgrade don't forget that
you guys can get a chance to win whatever it is that the thing is you can get a chance to win is at the link of the video description oh I went the wrong way
