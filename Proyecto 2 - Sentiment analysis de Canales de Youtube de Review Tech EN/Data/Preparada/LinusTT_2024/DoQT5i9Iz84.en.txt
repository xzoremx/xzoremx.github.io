when I casually dropped the bombshell recently that uh we're building a land gaming center y all understandably were like what I have so many questions so I brought Chase and Dan out here to get you guys the answers I can't wait to give you guys a tour cuz there is so much going on in here let's go we've got two units Each of which is "about 18,000 ft and as you can see" they're brand new which comes with some draw backs things as simple as toilets and walls are BYO but it also means that
no one else's junk is in the way of us executing on our vision of the ultimate land Center there will still be some challenges we'll be sharing the parking allocation for this complex with at least a dozen other tenants so uh Hey guys do you mind if we use some of the spots on the weekends cool but there's lots of other great stuff about this building it's even got water wow water look there's even an area where you can touch grass you can fit so much power in this bad boy speaking of power that's
one of the biggest challenges when you're hosting a land event how many people are we trying to connect to this thing we're trying to fit 250 to 300 people in here uh and we want to do multiple way lands a year well then we're going to show you guys exactly how we're going to do it after this segue to our sponsor build Redux you can build your dream gaming rig with build Redux you can customize your build any way you want and let build Redux do the heavy lifting all at a price that's comp
competitive with building a PC yourself check out build Redux at the link down below tour time right now we're standing in what's going to be a closed off land equipment storage area because under normal circumstances this is going to be a Badminton Center so the idea is everything we need to host a land is on pallets and wrapped or on racking inside this area and what's our goal for roll out and unroll out we basically just want to roll out the entire land in like a single day set up all the table set up
all the power all the networking and then roll it back into this area so that we can be back to playing babington as fast as possible freaking awesome but that means that there's some stuff that we have to hardwire into the building so from the panel over here we're going to be using these twist and lock power connectors they're called cs6369 connectors and then each of those is going to be positioned what I think it was about 20 F feet apart all the way down the building yeah and each
receptacle is going to be 50 amp and 240 volt so we plug into a distribution box and then that runs out to each lane so we can power everyone's computer hopefully without an issue so then this side is going to be checkin it's going to be our stage it's going to be kind of like console or retro areas if we have any other booths or activations everything's going to run along here that way you can kind of split the the whole room for the console area we could steal my old projector setup yeah we'll
have full lighting control in here we're going to just completely cover over all the windows because you don't want any light for badmington and you especially don't want any light for a land party no so man we could have like even like a couple projector walls for people to play Smash or whatever yeah for sure I mean if you look at this wall over here there's actually just these huge blank gaps that's perfect for projectors and anything else you want to throw up on the about that bad news uh that wall is
going to be kind of an ugly color for badminton so what color is it going to be like green or blue okay well we'll definitely just have to use the other wall then yeah that wall is going to be the same color for the same reason uh guess I guess we're going to have to invest in some projector screens yeah don't worry we got a okay okay enough power though we brought Dan here for a reason let's talk about networking but to get there we're going to have to kind of Traverse the badminton area where's
the slots going L us uh slots you say well officially we aren't going to have any but Chase I think you were saying we could put arcade machines along this wall yeah we could have a row here or in this little corner right here so we have a lot of room for a lot of activities we don't have arcade machines we will figure something out I see here on our way up I'll give you the lay of the lamp this double door is going to be staff only and completely closed off during land events for security this is going
to be the entrance um service area and pro shop for the Badminton Center this right here is going to be the world's most expensive hallway between the pro shop and what will be the concession change room area and that's because these two units were not really designed to be combined so there's a giant support beam here ah the reason I bring this up though is under these stairwells there's going to be a couple little Harry Potter closets one of which is going to be a network closet that is connected
to I'm not going to run all the way there now it's quite far which is the reason that we need this little closet because otherwise some of the lines along this wall would have been too long Ethernet can only do about 100 m before you start running into trouble on this side this is going to be all badminton all the time although who knows if wh land gets huge maybe we'll wire it up for power or networking at some point it's going to have badminton specific lighting though special HVAC so that
there aren't air currents within the space all kinds of cool stuff then over here we're going to have our change rooms and our concession area so men's change room little utility area with a sink and washer dryer that kind of stuff women's change room naturally this is the women's with the natural light they always get the nicer bathrooms this is going to be a little concession area we're hoping to have like you know muffins coffee bubble tea that sort of thing and then this is the stairwell
that I was hoping to take up and it's on the ground uh that's okay we'll take the other one hopefully that'll be fine this is toode right seems like it here we are we're going to have a little office space right here and a network closet that um I am deeply worried about this we're supposed to have one of those big flooring eaten UPS units in here want to run us through what we're going to have in here well I mean we've got our ups we've got our full-size rack we've got our switching infrastructure for like
the 300 individual ethernet runs we don't need 300 individual runs do we yeah I mean this place is massive we're getting all ethernet down the sides here we've having the fiber runs we've got ethernet runs for all of the ethernet connected speakers we've got all our Visa machines downstairs all the cameras all the cameras taking security very seriously all of the door access Chase do you have the plans yeah I do so this is uh the server room and then the office right next to it so I don't I
don't know this this looks like it's right yeah that's right I think it was bigger at some point it's tall we could just put the on top of each other like bunk beds servers I like that idea that's a good idea lest does not seem amused oh okay how did this happen I mean that's about 19 in this could be our rack this is going to be just like the one under the stupid office stairs there's enough room it'll be fine well we're going to get that resolved but one way or another about every 10 ft so
twice as many drops as the power drops we're going to have both ethernet and fiber in a perfect world we're going to use the fiber and we're going to have 25 gig going to each row of computers so that would mean everyone gets a full dedicated gigabit Uplink to what is not going to be the fastest internet ever but given that we're going to have uh steam cache in here that will also handle uh caching Windows updates and all that other kind of cool stuff should be more than enough speed for anything
you guys would want to do while you're here and then because fiber's fragile and this is going to be a Badminton Center 98% of the time in case that gets damaged we're going to have cat 6A dropping down to each of those spots as well and the capability of having a 10 gig copper Uplink in case we need to it's like you might have to slum it with 500 megabit to your desk assuming everyone is hitting it at the same time I think you'll be all right is this the bathroom up here Dan I think so
considering there's a toilet hole and another thing there wasn't 100% sure if it was a toilet hole um it does look like a toilet hole though I mean any hole is a toilet hole this is going to be a kitchenette um with the idea being that if we turn this into a member's lounge or turn it into more gaming area during L uh you'd be able to you know microwave some pizza pops or whatever the case may be and then over here through this door is going to be a gym nothing heavy we're
not going to have like massive weight machines or anything like that I'm talking some treadmills and other cardio stuff maybe some medicine balls that sort of thing and then it'll also be an observation area where you can kind of you know your kids got badminton lessons or something you can stand on the treadmill watch the lesson everything's kind of in flux right now though it could change just like you know we changed this having stairs haha in all seriousness these stairs will come back the original plan
was actually to have them go down a little bit across and then up to the other side but there was a reason we couldn't do that I forget what it is so now we have this door hey I found the toilet for your toilet holes oh perfect it's makes a good stand honestly yeah for the backpack from LTT store.com hey nice why did you put yours on the bowl you said it wasn't used we should talk about how the PA system is going to work that's right man there's nothing that makes me more Angry than a PA system
that could the owner of a whose lights are on I don't know so I tasked Dan who actually has a ton of experience in audio with coming up with a PA system that's going to not suck and we ended up with uh it's a full Dante integration with ethernet connected Poe speakers pretty much everywhere honestly seeing this place for the first time today I'm a little concerned but I think it'll be fine oh good that's always a good sign thankfully one of the controllers that we got for this has
some really powerful Echo rejection as well cuz we're going to have wireless microphones and things like that yes some of the major issues with having microphones in a giant Echo chamber like this is the speakers feeding back into the microphones however one thing that's going to help is you know how we always spray the ceilings in our building we're going to do it here as well because as much as I love the sound of like you know I actually hate that sound I also hate being standing on the opposite side
of the court and not being able to hear what the other person's saying because of all the standing waves so yeah we're going to spray it and then in the long term we'd like to also get some giant panels and just kind of plunk them on the wall every once in a while as well that will be great yeah we're going to do some hanging speakers up there all of the speakers are going to be along the walls as well in here we're going to do them everywhere how many speakers are we going to have I think it's like 40 or
something it's a lot but I mean the place is giant right there's really only one or two in here um the nice thing about doing Dante is for the microphones and things like that any ethernet Jack in the building you can just plug them in and you're good to go all of which is obviously going to be great for lands but also good for badminton we want to run tournaments here and when you're calling people to their court it's nice to be able to actually hear them especially if you're in the change room
or something like that and in the long term we have very big dreams for what we could do technologically here for badminton we're going to have cameras on every court right out of the gate so if you're running a tournament or something like that you can just send a twitch link to your parents and they can watch or you know cool stuff like that for the kids and then in the long term we'd love to use those cameras to have a little instant replay you see these trenches on the floors each of these is going to
carry power and networking from the wall to the center between each court and the idea is that we could run anything here but in the short term the plan is to have TVs one here one here one here one here so that on each Court after each point the camera says okay hey the shuttle touch the floor use Machine Vision for that and then it'll play back the last 3 or 4 seconds so that you don't have any disputes about line calls for example I would love to automate scorekeeping in the very long term but
that's going to take some serious work and maybe a bigger Network closet for all the gpus that would have to power it bunk beds we're not doing bunk beds D we're doing bunk beds now we'll we'll be fine I mean we got the Chino which has 6 490s in it that'll fit in there they're going to need that back uh since we're here did you guys have any other questions or concerns yeah are we going to be covering up all of these windows especially the ones on the roof and the sides all the windows are going
to be blacked out okay perfect yeah we want perfect light control in here for badminton and then for a land in the longer term I'd love to have two sets of Lights visible lights and then black lights mhm so we could just turn the whole place like like like Rave style all black light I think that be you could get those ones that blind people no no oh we get the ones where we'd have like UV reactive paint and then we'd put some stuff on the walls that only shows up when you're hosting the land sign the
sign the wall kind of thing in UV light oh for middle of the night stuff there's no reason we couldn't bring some stuff from LTX right yeah we could bring anything that we still have from LTX back here so like the RC cars the Retro Corner any of those kinds of boosts if we still have some of the stuff kicking around fun would figure it out okay we depend though like the RC cars is that would we be playing badminton on the weekends on that side of the building during the day certainly but whether it
would be happening at night depends on whether we have 24/7 access for Badminton Club members got it and that's TBD right now so almost certainly we won't at the very beginning so I see no reason why we couldn't open up those doors at night and just like go Hog Wild over there yeah I mean it gives us a ton of space to just do some fun activations if we have anything that needs a little bit more room and I think I did pretty okay with the speaker placements there's going to be a center one just above you
and then of course kind of dotted around with all the walls and if you treat it then I think this will be okay right now it definitely needs it oh yeah oh yeah I want to convolution this so I can  Reverb horrendous yeah send me that and while you're at it maybe send him this message from our sponsor Square creating your own website shouldn't be difficult luckily with Squarespace it's not their all-in-one platform makes it easy to get your website up and running quickly just start with their fluid
