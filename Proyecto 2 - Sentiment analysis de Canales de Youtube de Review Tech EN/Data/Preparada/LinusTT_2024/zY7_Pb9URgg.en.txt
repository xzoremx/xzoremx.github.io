part of my new philosophy lately has been to bring more positivity to our coverage I mean certainly we have a responsibility to acknowledge and educate about problems but we also want to highlight the good that's going to be hard today when we watched Intel's presentation on their new core Ultra 20000 desktop processors our first thought was boy do these ever look familiar and while we were impressed that AMD was able to achieve similar performance at significantly less wattage not many of you were Gamers
don't want want 5% Improvement they want FPS and they want it now and well kind of kills me to have to be the one to tell you this but Arrow lake is more like arrow through the heart because you're not even going to get 5% at least not across the board the good news is that your power bill is going to go down but in many cases so will your performance so strap in for a very bumpy ride with me as I try to navigate what on Earth is going on with CPUs in 2024 but first a short layover to visit my
aunt's Segway to our sponsor Ridge their magsafe wallets are back in stock it's the ridge wallet you know and love but this time it attaches to your phone crazy check it out in the link in the  today AOL lake is full of changes some of which are pretty radical I mean for starters gone is smt or hyperthreading along with Intel's traditional monolithic die approach on the desktop instead we get a tile based architecture with the fos packaging that we first saw in meteor Lake and they're laying down
clusters of skymont efficiency or ecor between our now single-threaded lion Cove performance or pees we also get four XE Graphics cores on the igpu tile that should be a lot stronger than Intel's previous attempts at integrated graphics and while it clearly isn't on the level of amd's 3D vcash chips they have upped the level two cach per piece core by 50% from two Megs to 3 Megs wow there's also been some big changes to core turbo Behavior more on that now you thought I was going to say later didn't
you we've got two chips with us today the core Ultra 5 245k that's a 6p core 8 e core chip that boosts to 5.2 and 4.6 GHz respectively this is Intel's intended gamer sweet spot at least for now then we've got the core Ultra 9 285k that gets 8 p course and double the ecourse for a total of 24 cores this one should be the productivity and also just do anything monster it'll do 5.5 GHz on the P course and 4.6 on the eour at least it sort of will because the 285k has five yes five different boost
frequencies depending on what you're doing it technically can actually turbo up to 5.7 GHz but that's only going to be a couple select cores in lightly threaded workloads all right thanks Intel as for the last CPU the one we don't have today it gets eight peores but only 12 ecores and a slightly slower clock speed so far so interesting but how's it going to play out for the folks shopping today we wanted to compare Intel's own last gen amd's ryzen 9000 and for the folks gaming on the top
chips from the last couple of generations we included amd's most popular x3d chips a couple of important points though we decided to roll the latest Windows 11 24 H2 and our 96 and 9700x chips are tuned to the new 105 watt TDP that AMD unlocked last month and finally we didn't bother with the 5800 X 3D for productivity that's a gaming chip so with that in mind let's talk gaming performance all of our tests were run at 1080p low to all but eliminate GPU bottlenecks and put as
much pressure on these CPUs as possible in City skylines 2 not only do we see a decent improvement over 14th gen in both averages and 1% lows but the 285k is beating everything in 1% low close the only problem is it's crushing our 245k as well it turns out in heavily multi-threaded games this current generation gaming chip is looking decidedly last gen it's not all bad news we found some generational uplift in Total War Warhammer 3 it's not much and also the 285k gets kind of stomped on by
the 9700x in both averages and 1% lows with the 245k trailing right behind and that's it that's the positive news for gaming as we always say look to multiple sources to paint the most complete picture but for the rest of our suite the results are very disappointing shadow of the Tomb Raider has the 245k in last place clearly losing to its predecessor the 14600 K with the 285k not doing a whole lot better our x3d chips crush it in "averages and even the vilified 9,000"
Series chips from AMD come out ahead but AMD is far from Intel's only enemy here even Intel's own 14700 K is decently ahead of our new core Ultra 9 in average FPS fortunately that's not the case in rocket league but the 285k is still losing to its predecessor it seems that this game doesn't care much about 3D vcash but loves lots of cores and lots of threads and is the only game we tested that placed the 950x on top and it's bad news again for the 245k which found itself at the bottom of the list
coming up short to the old Core 5 again both in averages and 1% lows yikes and in Red Dead Redemption we see another case where not only is AMD beating Intel into the ground but 14th gen is Right alongside getting in some kicks where it can and f123 doesn't look a whole lot better this is a massacre ladies and gentlemen I mean sure at least the 245k beat last gen in 1% lows but that's it and you know what else beats last gen our new community backpack it's got all the tech Forward Design you love from
our OG backpack but in a smaller tighter package sign up for a notification at lm. g/c Commuter or at the link down below moving on to Counter Strike 2 both new chips are solidly in the bottom three with the 285k getting stomped yet again at least we see an improvement with the 245k and 1% lows cyberpunk sees both doing okay for averages but their abysmal 1% lows leave them buried at the bottom of the chart not only being bested by their own previous generation but also a 2-year-old AMD chip running
in an 8-year-old socket truly this is a sad day for gaming and therefore the world or is it we asked Intel to tell us their top two and bottom two games that showcased their new power efficiency gains and we tested them ourselves with the 285k and while it's clear you're going to see some huge swings in performance depending on what you play with these new Chips it is equally clear that you're going to see a reduction in power consumption across the board something that Intel unlike AMD really needed to
get under control with this generation we'll touch a bit more on Power and thermals later but you can see here that yes in Final Fantasy 14 Dawn tril we're losing 20% of our performance but we're also dropping 40% of our power consumption and Hitman that was a similar story with a 45% decrease in power for only a 133% loss in fps and those are the worst two what about the best in 6 we've got a 35% power reduction while gaining almost 9% performance on the turn timer and in
f123 nearly 40% less power with 12% more average FPS don't get me wrong Guys these are truly small slivers of silver on some very large cumulon nimbus clouds but they are there this justtin Intel has informed us that despite claims of APO or application optimization being enabled by default on AOL Lake it was in fact off on the motherboard they sent us for our review we've rerun the tests and discovered a small frame rate increase in CS2 essentially no change whatsoever in Shadow of the Tomb Raider and a
decrease of about 10% in Red Dead Redemption 2's 1% lows the rest of our games only saw a 1 to 2% change which could be attributed to run variants some of our productivity scores even went down slightly with the feature enabled for the record APO should be enabled by default on all boards either in time for launch or shortly thereafter I can't believe I'm still doing this character it also appears that Windows 1124 H2 can have lower performance in games compared to other windows versions this is the
version our testing used but since 24 H2 is publicly available you may even be using it right now we're standing by our results if you want to learn more about the wide variety of performance you can expect depending on which versions of Windows you're running check out Hardware unbox coverage as they tested the 285k on multiple windows versions and power modes showing some pretty big changes in fps your mileage may vary we're still not impressed with aake when it comes to gaming back to you
lonus I don't expect almost any gamer to look at this and think I am very compelled to buy this product but what I can hope is that like we saw with AMD Zen one that maybe this is the start of a long journey to recovery for Intel because if they can figure out what's going on with the games where they're getting absolutely dumpstered productivity looks pretty okay in blender there's a solid decrease in time taken to render for the 285k against the 14900 K and we get about a 10%
Improvement between the core fives as well unfortunately for Intel the 950x is still on top but considering that the 245k Beats both the 9700x and 9600 X I'm seeing this as a bright spot for Intel a surprising one given the lack of hyp threading on this new generation compiling with gdau sees more improvements for a lake 2 with our 245k once again beating the AMD 9700x it may only have six peores but those ecores are really starting to show their strength now that we see them do
more heavy lifting in multi-threaded workloads Intel has really invested in making these new skymont eor beefy to the point where they're really more like underclocked Raptor Cove PE course in handbreak we see more improvements in av1 encoding the coral Ultra 9 sees a 22% uplift over last gen with about a 15% uplift for the core Ultra 5 neither of them can crack the Behemoth that is the 32 thread 950x but it is nice to see that the 245k isn't completely useless trailing just behind the 9700x x264
encoding is a similar story with smaller gains over previous gen on both chips but hey now our 245k is beating the 9700x by a hair and we see very similar results in Prime seeve with our 285k in second place place and the 245k admirably beating its 9600 X counterpart especially interesting in our results is cinebench the 285k finally lands on top of a chart in multicore and both a lake chips comfortably beat their 14th gen counterparts the lack of pee multi-threading and the extra ecore
clusters really hurt the accor Ultra 5 but at least in single core it puts on a respectable show trailing just behind the 14900 K just like in games though the story here heavily depends on the workload and we got just abysmal results in Puget bench's photoshop with both new Chips performing worse than last gen and straggling behind AMD by a wide margin in Premier Intel is better than AMD but this was already their fight to lose and unfortunately they managed it aerol Lake
doesn't even manage to beat their last gen 14th Gen processor so pic Victory and seven zip is another disappointing loss in both compression and de compression wamp wamp can we maybe find some more silver how about AI I mean after all unlike amd's most recent desktop offerings these new Intel chips have npus oo neural processing and at least when it comes to open voo we really see them shine with our 285k netting an 82% increase over the 14900 K CPU score in the same test and since our
245k has the same npu tile it gets nearly the same score there as well walloping the 14600 K here we start to see what all the fuss is about with Intel's new igpu as well those four XC cores are putting in work with more than double the performance of last gen unfortunately AMD CPUs don't support open Veno they use Windows ML and in that race they beat Intel's CPU scores however in most cases on Intel you won't be using Windows ml so depending on your use case these new npus might really
matter to you because I don't know you can afford a brand new CP and motherboard but not a GPU I don't know we'll have to see how developers use these things what could actually be a factor for you is power while our 285k peaked at 250 watts to top the charts earlier it only averaged 218 which is a 303 wat drop from the 14900 K to be clear Intel is still clearly juicing their chips harder than AMD but at least it's finally coming down and it looks even better when we compare our 245k to
the 14600 k okay less power higher score you'll love to see it it's just too bad that AMD Twisted the knife on their most recent launch it's also just not that clear of an improvement we looked at Intel's best case for performance per wat in gaming earlier but in our usual process for power and thermal testing we use f123 and gen over gen it's more of a mixed bag here yeah they're using fewer Watts on both SKS but surprisingly they're running a few hotter so it looks like unless they're
using significantly less power you can expect a pretty similar operating temperature but hey at least you can reuse your old cooler with the new LGA 1851 socket oh yeah I only briefly mentioned this before if you want these new Chips you're going to need a new motherboard sick truly guys I don't remember the last launch that left me this disappointed I mean there is a ton of cool stuff here to get excited about like the potential prediction Improvement thanks to removing smt and
the new knobs and dials for overclocking leaks have even popped up showing the 285k reaching over 350 Watts for an alleged 82% performance gain it's just too bad that the majority of you guys watching this video are probably never going to try your hand at overclocking Beyond enabling XMP on your RAM anyway speaking of ram big changes there we're getting CU dim support and a ddr5 only memory controller Intel told us that these CPUs should see some decent game gains when cranking up the speed to
"8,000 megat transfers per second or" greater which sounds pretty cool except that ours completely refused to do it so we weren't able to verify their claims stay tuned though maybe now that both AMD and Intel have settled on ddr5 we'll have to test a wide range of memory speeds on both Platforms in the not too distant future maybe an update or two in the meantime will fix Intel's issues in time for that which leaves us with one last kick in the teeth when we started writing this review the ryzen 9 950x was
scarce and prices were high but as of the weekend before the Embargo lift the 950x went on sale for as low as $599 that didn't last long and at the time of filming they're already back to the $700 range but it's a good way to get us started on the conversation about pricing today you can buy a core Ultra 9 285k for $589 you're also going to need a new motherboard that supports the new 1851 socket and realistically probably some new ddr5 memory if you want to try to get faster speeds out of it the ultra 7
265k probably the chip that actually matters in this launch and unfortunately the one we have zero benchmarks for it costs almost 200 bucks less at 3.94 and the Ultra 5 245k is 309 considering that Arrow Lake isn't a drop in replacement it is really hard to get excited about this pricing when we look at the competition especially when we consider that the ryzen 7 9800 x3d is rumored to be released next month Intel's calling AOL Lake a reset on the desktop road map and I guess I'm just hoping that that's
true and that this is a Zen one moment like that was a major change with some real improvements but it wasn't that competitive the real competitiveness came later with Zen 2 and especially Zen 3 so for Intel right now unless you're super keen on an npu on desktop or you're one of those people who still thinks that AMD is Kirkland brand Intel it's really hard for me to find a reason to buy these if you do want to pick one up we'll have it and all the CPUs that we tested Linked In the description down
