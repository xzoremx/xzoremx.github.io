we've been seeing ads for this thing for years and you guys have even suggested making a video about it twice but come on look at it in a world where a top-of-the-line GPU costs a couple of thousand who in their right mind is spending double that amount on the chair you sit in while you use it oh wait I know it's us it's literally our job to buy outlandish stuff like this and show you guys what it's all about so With a Little Help from our sponsor epomaker a team of Gamers engineers and designers
who are dedicated to Bringing highquality customizable mechanical keyboards to the community at affordable prices we'll take a closer look at their rt100 keyboard a little bit in this later we have finally put the Clen scorpion computer cockpit to the test and found some unexpected conclusions but before we get to those let's rewind a little bit here after a 10 2 32 day waight for shipping this is what arrived in my driveway or to be more specific at the curb at the end of my driveway
luckily no one stole it so let's get it inside and take a look we're going to have a link in the video description if you guys can't wait to follow my example and blow your own money on one of these oh but I'm not at the stage yet where I think I'm ready to recommend it this is far from the lightest ch hair that we've ever looked at coming in at a whopping 200 kg of shipping weight to their credit this is one of the most userfriendly packing crates I think I've  wow that is smaller than I expected say
what you will about the size you can't   you I wonder what percentage of the  me how the devil are you supposed to move this thing dude there's a lot of pieces in here I thought you said the assembly was supposed to be straightforward their assembly video is only 3 minutes long I can't be that hard how many legs do scorpions have when I  legs oh wa now it reaches its full magnificent height that's just mostly   packaging oh sick look at these lights okay I got an arm oh it opens up I'm
just trying to picture the person whose house you walk into and this is in their living room you know it sends a message what's the message Jordan nothing good this is the bubble wrap output of a small nation that's quality foam oh sorry sorry oh oh oh how Do You Like Me Now ladies mess probably yeah you could no no you could this is It's movable it's movable thanks Colin but I think I got it a oh I think I crushed those cables got the instructions up but before we start them I just got to say where's
your tracksuit buddy the form's impeccable but you got to get the stripes this is the Scorpion's decorative foot also a weapon its only contribution is to be a tripping Hazard it's Law and Order that would got me all right it's gross the cable's white I know right but it's the one white thing on it it comes in white too and gold and gold yeah okay  that that's pretty cool next up is our arm with the controls for the Scorpion tail and the seat on it I don't know what any of these buttons do and they're
not labeled but this seems like a good time to tell you guys the whole thing is made out of powdercoated steel with PU leather over what seems to be a really high quality foam it has built-in RGB lighting pre-installed 5 meter cables ours came with three hdmis and two display ports and apparently 160° of adjustment on the  itself that's about 5° will my wife get the insurance if I die in this thing that would be active  ready oh there's the other arm now that's funny the RGB remote is just one
of those Wireless RGB remotes but just embedded in the side of it there we go all right being able to adjust this forward and back would be good oh no way no it does move oh look at oh wow look at that it has all the adjustment since we're talking about this arm I want to look at the RGB control this is flipping cool you just touch anywhere on the Wheel and then it's that color we went with the three monitor mount we've got three ah of these gigabyte M27 U gaming monitors
they'll do up to 160 HZ 4K they're vesa HDR 600 certified and come with HDMI 2.1 and the reason we cared about that was because we initially thought this didn't come with any display port pre-wired but it turns out did so they've spent money on things that matter like the motors feel good they feel smooth it's it's reassuring as you're moving it around the build quality is obviously a little on the industrial side you know it's welded steel what do you want how are we
going to get power to the monitors oh no there was a power bar up there I think yes there is in fact a power bar in there all we got to do is remove these three screws and we get access to it only three Outlets but there's a five monitor mount there are such thing as C13 you know y Splitters and whatever just okay we found an oversight is this how the RGB is mounted I guess it doesn't matter we'll adjust them in a note afterwards yeah not much in the way of other adjustments
though hey not so much you just got to hope they kind of balance I think yeah oh uh how's the clearance on that not amazing cool so we need to put it sideways in order to which is fine cuz now it's just like the RGB strip exactly I'm not sure what the plan is for cable management here LTT cable arches to the rescue there we go oh that's pretty good that's pretty darn good now obviously for a gaming battle station so magnificent we're going to need a pretty magnificent computer so we've gone with
a what's that Colin what is it 7800 X 3D and a 4090 I'm just guessing oh it is oh great realistically which cables you hook up to your monitors is going to come down to what IO you have on your graphics card more than anything else I didn't look at this before we started so I guess I'm using a DP to HDMI adapter should we see if we got these monitor cables right did we just blow a fuse wait we don't even need the power bar there's another power bar behind another access hatch built into the
chair ow ow oh do they seriously have the top power bar plugged into this power bar and it's not like it's a high current application or anything check this out the Scorpion claws open what no way if you have a little kid or a pet and you just really wanted them to not have eyes then you just leave these open that's great it's dangerous just like a real scorpion I've got a plan for us to team workor this Jordan if you can operate the dials I'll keep an eye on the cables here and Colin
you keep an eye on the cables at the  something oh oh wait there's not even a problem call in for crying out loud okay Jordan I'm not going to lie I'm a little sketched out about lying in this thing how's your insurance good but the thing about insurance is I'm not the one who gets the payout you always say monetize your death it seems like they've done a pretty good job of keeping the length of the cable travels the same regardless this should address the monitor but that whole thing where the whole thing
shifted is a little sketchy Ian I'm not getting into it what do I care why are you not getting into it I'm over the weight limit oh that's a thing you encounter sometimes with Asian design in the North American Market you saw the whole thing with Nintendo um theme park yeah where like the average American male like couldn't go in one of the rides or something like that before we get in we didn't have any issues with the cables while we moving the chair but that's not necessarily a
given forever based on that these are just kind of hanging loose and there seem to be some things in here that they could get caught on the good news is I  ite no problem oh we haven't talked about our peripherals yet this is EPO Maker's rt100 mechanical keyboard the gasket mounted design is both quiet and comfortable while it's 97 key layout offers a compact form factor without having to give up a dedicated number pad or media controls that's in no small part thanks to the multi-function media
control knob it's got USBC Bluetooth 5.0 and 2.4 GHz Wireless connectivity meaning you can connect to your PC or Mac or I mean whatever it's Bluetooth right however you prefer and hidden in the storage Bay for the 2.4 GHz receiver is the connector for the smart mini display a programmable smart display that shows essential system and real world data right out of the box and just like the south facing RGB Lighting on every key is customizable B to suit your preferences we'll get more handson with
the rt100 in a minute but first we need to get some games loaded on this thing oh shoot I never checked if I plugged in the right things well this one's got a signal find what are the odds I got only one of three no question if the goal is to find the chair that makes you feel like an absolute boss your Journey's over these monitors look great though man 4K is sharp at this distance it's a kind of setup that just puts a smile on your face you know there are some issues at my height
exactly the monitors are in the right spot when the angle is right and there's not really a ton of adjustment on these things also I'm already noticing that when I move the mouse and type on the keyboard there's a little bit of Wiggle wobble now we got this working holy crap I think the best thing I can say about the chair right now is I kind of forgot I was sitting in it and I really do mean that in a good way the worst chair is the one that you think about while you're inside it Jordan what's up
remember how we adjusted the angle of this display just right well now yeah it's pointed up this way oh so the fact that I have no on thefly adjustment means that unless I had a fourth motor right here in this one which we checked we don't I have no way of adjusting this angle after the fact well my keyboard Mouse oh no okay it come it comes in a little bit the angle's a little funky the benefit of that is that it doesn't tip toward you like on some of these that I've seen in the past the
disadvantage is that your arms are like this WIC screen gaming form still thing I got to give some credit to the rt100 here sponsored or not it's a little narrower which objectively creates more mousing space in a scenario like this but unlike a 10 keyless if I wanted to use this for work as well and I needed a number pad everything's there it's good to go we're going to switch over to  okay that we can fix the ergonomics of   okay if I want to just hold a controller here to get this completely out of the
way it ends up going over my legs like that and then now it's so far away that if I do need it for something to navigate a menu or cuz I get an email I got to drag it way back over here in fairness to Clin I haven't seen good solutions to most of these problems so the question in my mind isn't so much should you buy the Clen scorpion if you're shopping for one of these chairs as it is should you even be considering one of these chairs because I've yet to use one that even
even for free I would consider putting in my house obviously people are buying them though or they wouldn't exist which if you think about it is kind of a good thing the immersiveness is great so whatever my feelings are about these things obviously they exist which means obviously people are buying them and finding ways to work around some of the challenges be they ergonomic or be they practical like one of the things we noticed is if you're not using headphones you probably don't have a
really great way to handle audio I don't know about speakers mounted to the edge of these monitors they're kind of wobbly enough as it is with that said I think Clen has got the most usable package I've seen so far so maybe it's time to get some Impressions from the other members of the team let's see who wants to swap out their existing station for this how do you get in Jordan well  out I feel like I'm in a dentist chair  wow oh this keyboard's got a little screen on it it's kind of cute what can
you put on the screen uh it'll do like your temperatures your CPU use weather oh okay you can put those animations and stuff where the logo is so I can put memes you can put memes on it hell yeah I'm actually kind of shocked at how comfortable this is I thought this would be a lot weirder and not as enjoyable I could I could play in this all day but would you buy it well how much does is just the chair cost I don't need the whole setup uh the chair is $28.99 us plus shipping I think that's totally
reasonable I I would enjoy movies in this I think and would you replace your workstation oh yeah easily oh are you kidding me is that an actual option we get to keep it yeah okay that's not like cut my achilles tendon we're gaming now it feels a little cramped to be honest I feel like it's a little it's a little it's a little tilted yeah it's a little crooked yeah the goes buttons all the way this is not the chair's fault the chair is actually pretty comfortable you really want to recline it or else your
wrist kind of feel like they're getting a little cramped would you pay for the chair yourself I don't think I'd want to pay for this myself would you want it as your workstation oh no I'm good wow Pinnacle of luxury hey I don't even know what to say it's really unique I am really concerned though um about how close we are to the monitor cuz I think after like eight hours of a work day or playing or gaming all night it's going to be pretty difficult even my field of view can't even go from edge to
edge so I feel like I'm not getting the the most Advantage out of it um but super comfortable to be honest with you uh I really like it could you imagine if I brought this home to my wife she would be so upset if I didn't care about budget and had the space for it for sure I'd probably rock it would I buy it sure yeah I'd do it and would you use it as your workstation here oh definitely oh yeah this is unexpected we have not one but two members of the team who would like to daily Drive the Scorpion and the
only fair way to settle this I think is RPS rock paper scissors best two out of three okay ready and go I thought you were doing rock paper scissors oh you want me to do the you want me to do all the work for you rock paper scissors shoot shoot okay shoot shoot someone say shoot oh oh we got one win one no Rock Paper Scissors Shoot yes oh it's one one Rock Paper Scissors Shoot there it is okay now we have to haul it upstairs that's his problem not ours oh good what no we can we can get
him some help we'll get him some help Elijah we'll get you help all right I always need help are you serious I actually have well yeah you said you wanted it I thought it was more of just like a  okay maybe we'll do a float plane exclusive with Elijah's long-term Impressions actually living with this thing day-to-day Oh that's oh yeah I'm actually really excited and I'm excited to tell you about our sponsor oh wait I already told you about our sponsor this keyboard's pretty sick yeah check it out
we're going to have it linked down below if you guys enjoyed this video why not check out the last one we got which was kind of like this concept but no Motors
