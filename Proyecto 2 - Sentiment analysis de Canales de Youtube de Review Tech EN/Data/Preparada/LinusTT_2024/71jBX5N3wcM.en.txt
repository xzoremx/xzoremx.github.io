as young PC Builders you will be tempted by Sleek shiny options but you mustn't take the easy path is that the magc mini awesome Elijah you didn't even try to resist it it's a $600 computer nothing even compares to this and while thousands took to the online streets to rip into Apple's outrageous storage pricing it doesn't change the fact that for the base model M4 Mac Mini he's right if all you want to do is email and video conferencing some light professional work even some
casual gaming $600 seems like an outright steel for this new machine I mean heck i' probably recommend it to a friend who just needed a decent computer at a fair price so has Apple built the best system for the 99% to find out we're going to drag race it against both a $600 Mini PC and Tower desktop PC while also discussing some of the pros and cons that you might gloss over if you take these devices at face value But be sure not to gloss over our sponsor ODU start simplifying your work
processes with an all-in-one platform for your business learn more about ODU  description let's meet our three computers for malice standing at a height of 2 in and featuring 10 CPU and 10 GPU cords the Mac Mini will it be held back by its lack of storage or will its unified memory deliver a knockout blow for team PC standing at 2 in tall the minoram Venus and towering over the rest at 15 in the cbble together desktop Tower this machine sure takes up a lot of room but it's dedicated card means
that when it comes to gaming it means business there is of course a lot more to know about each system so here it is but those are just details for now what matters is that at the time of ordering each of these machines came in under $600 before taxes and shipping which brings us then without further Ado to Benchmark number one cinebench in both single and multicore flavors and go here  oh God this is not going to be close dude wow wait it might be a little close oh this is spinning
up oh it is starting to slow down but it's still it's not slowing down much wait wow this pass it wait what  surprised what's in here huh that's not even current gen ryzen if you remember as well this is normally $150 over our $600 budget but it was on sale I like sales so it's kind of you know being a little bit of a cheater here by joining the lower weight class anyway while these run let's talk about Apple's new M4 silicon compared to last year's M3 Apple's added two more efficiency cores
they have more than doubled the number of operations that their neural engine can complete per second and they have increased the memory bandwidth of their already f F unified memory by 20% perhaps most importantly though compared to their most recent Mac Mini which had an M2 processor and even compared to their other M3 devices Apple has doubled the memory capacity of the base configuration from just 8 GB to 16 now I have no doubt that the most tab hungry of you could easily make use of more but
we've at least reached the point where I'm not uncomfortable recommending a base configuration so good job app and good job on the processor itself we'll talk about performance in a second but first I want to talk about Energy Efficiency look at this thing here's all three machines running the same load except the M4 is using a fraction of the power of the other two for a desktop obviously this level of efficiency matters less than it does in a phone or a thin and light laptop but less power
consumption means less heat output and quieter operation you can see even even when it's running a test does it even have a fan oh yeah it does wow is it ever quiet though and enough fawning though let's take a look at the performance and wow the desktop and the Mac Mini are shockingly close in multicore but what's really surprising to me is how far out ahead that mini Forum pulls two extra performance cores goes a long way for the multi-core but does that hold up for single core let's see three two
one and now we wait a while I mean technically we don't have the final result but we have enough of it where the M4 really excels is single-threaded performance which is one of the things that contributes to Apple silicon machines feeling so responsive and snappy even the first generation ones which seems to have become a bit of a drag on Apple sales you talk to an M1 Mac owner and they're like upgrade why who needs to upgrade wait there's one right now I have two M1 Mac
Air M1 and Max studio M1 Max what's the reason for oper let's move on to our next test here we're going to Target the GPU using blender to render the classroom test scene and go go okay what are we expecting oh dedicated GPU turns out having one of those that's a thing but an outstanding integrated GPU it's doing much better than this one that's a thing too uh yeah he was invited oh wait is that Frozen uh oh no there it goes a minute yeah okay that's about 12 seconds slower than our Tower
PC but a lot faster than this is this even done yet uh no it has quite a ways to go good Lord now In fairness 3050 not exactly the most impressive GPU to be almost on par with but when we consider that this is on board it's pretty darn impressive however custom form factor machines like this are giving up a lot in terms of upgradeability in the long term which makes them a pretty questionable value if GPU performance is a priority not just today but in the future because this 3050
we can get rid of it throw something else in there and we're going to be even faster all right movie Magic cut final score just under four minutes wow the Mac Mini is just a quarter the time and you've got to give it credit it's just so cute which like it or not is a significant factor for some people when they're choosing a computer now before we get to gaming let's take a look at a large language model specifically llama how about we have them each write 10 high cus about our Tech bro vest now
available on LTT store.com I was the medium labeled Elijah no offense but I don't think so bro what you're taller than me and wider I don't think I'm an XL though I give you an XL yeah wow you really do look like budget s bman freed now screw off ready go this is the same test we "used back in our 50 versus $50,000" computer video and while I don't expect as big of a difference on these three machines today it is an opportunity for us to talk about one of Apple's biggest
advantages if there happens to be an AI workload that utilizes GPU memory the typical wisdom has been sure no problem just slap some high-capacity gpus like a Quadro into your system but with Apple's unified memory the sfc is able to dynamically adjust how much RAM each section has access to whether it's the CPU the GPU or in this case Apple's neural Eng Faded Glory worn my love for Tech still shines through all vest is my heart Tech bro flare that won't be beat are you rolling on this this is freaking
ridiculous look the quality is not what we're using to evaluate them here because they're all using the same model so theoretically they should be about the same what we're interested in is the speed and if you guys were looking over my shoulder you'll have seen that the M4 absolutely destroyed the others so unless you're a Data Center and you need need the absolute best in AI performance and you're willing to spend millions of dollars to get it one of these with a little ram upgrade might be the better
choice for you although Ram upgrades on this are a pretty big room elephant yes my friends we saw the Reddit post that you could buy two base model Mac minis for the price of one that has twice as much RAM and storage in it apple is still pricing their storage at the literal weight of gold old which is an awful value another sore spot for some is the power button which is not only now on the bottom of the machine but at the back of the bottom with those two things aside though there's no denying
that the machine we're reviewing which is the base model absolutely kicks but for the price but does it hold up in gaming while Apple silicon has the raw grunt to put up decent gaming performance numbers compatibility continues to be a struggle now of course most Mac users aren't going to expect to play the latest tripa game so we're just using shadow of the Tomb Raider as a tool to measure the performance of the GPU in a different way and also to enjoy the onboard speaker that actually sounds
a lot better than not having a speaker at all it's not a fair okay that's fair I guess what it what it is yeah oh wow what's also not fair is having a dedicated GPU apparently dude this poor thing yeah even this one though it's it  Cook hey huh of course the Mac couldn't hold a candle to our mid Tower PC but In fairness to it it held up quite well against a last generation AMD onboard GPU and I know some of you are going to say well AMD has newer ones and like that's nice but
we're looking at Price comparables here not generation comparables so what's our conclusion then mid Tower PC wins I don't think it's that simple no it really isn't is it I mean on the one hand uh good job with the high FPS there buddy but on the other hand there's a lot more to life than gaming and our M4 mini excels in areas that our custom PC Falls flat in now if you're the average LTT viewer the size relatively High noise and power consumption and the inconvenience of digging through PC part
picker for the best deals and then assembling everything that's all part of the fun rather than a burden and totally worth it for the upgradeability and customizability of a machine like this but if your mom phones you up and she wants help troubleshooting this thing wouldn't you rather just send her to Tim Apple's house for help and I didn't even mention it has a headphone jack and Thunderbolt this thing is sick now the upgraded configs suck and apple really needs to give their Collective heads a
shake but this base model for $600 is every bit as good as it seems on paper if someone you know wants a computer on a budget ask them what it's for and if you don't hear gaming I think that the mini PCS take the Victory and if that user happens to already own an ie device the Mac Mini gets a pretty big boost the workflow of like airdropping and using iCloud between devices really is kind of magic sometimes just like this magic spell to take you to our sponsor ODU are you tired of
