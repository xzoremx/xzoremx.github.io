we just kicked off Spring cleaning at our studio which wouldn't normally be a video except we came across this a "$15,000 server with two CPUs eight ssds" and a whopping 6.3 terabytes of ram when we got this from Intel 3 years ago we did a quick unboxing promising a deeper dive into some of its more exotic features and then promptly forgot about it well that Ram I showed you guys is is n Ram at all but optain persistent memory modules you might know that Intel's optain business
was sadly shuttered in June of 2022 which means the contacts who originally sent us this have sadly moved on we on the other hand haven't so all these years later I am finally going to do what I said I was going to do and finish building the rer piece I mean sorry I mean digging into what made optain so special and cool and what ultimately killed it just like I'm going to kill this segue to our sponsor ug green they're getting into the Nas Game and they claimed their new Nas sync
dxp 4800 plus is the most powerful Nas under $500 it's got four Bays for storage a 12th Gen 5 Core Intel processor 8 gigs of ddr5 memory that's expandable and more check it out at the   before we go any further some of you probably need a refresher isn't Intel optain and SSD what's it doing in a ram slot well optane was more of a family than an individual product ranging from inexpensive hard drive accelerators for pre-builts where the manufacturer was too cheap to install a real SSD to
incredibly low latency not to mention expensive storage for the fastest servers in existence what all of these uses had in common though was they looked like conventional memory and storage devices but functioned somewhere in between and that's exactly what we're looking at here this appears to be a normal SSD but the 3D Cross Point chips inside it have just 100th the latency of regular Nan flash as for this guy well it looks like a stick of ddr4 memory but it's actually an Intel optain persistent
memory series 100 module with a whopping 512 gigs of storage on it and this server has 12 of them for a total of 6 tabes that's enough to fit nearly 12 High bit rate float plane exclusives solely in system memory wait a second lus memory I thought you just said it was storage I did but the simplest way to take advantage of it is in memory mode where your optain modules just show up to your operating system as a whole whack load of RAM now the bad thing about this mode is that it forces optane
to have one of the big downsides of RAM for security reasons every time an optain module in memory mode gets restarted it generates a new cryptographic key effectively wiping all of the data that it contained the good news is that optane can handle many more wipes than regular ssds so this is unlikely to harm it and what's also cool is that no special coding is needed to immediately use memory mode and the cpu's memory controller will even automatically move colder data off of
the memory onto the optain and vice versa let me show you how this would work in a demanding professional application right now you're looking at solid works flow simulator but we aren't simulating anything at the moment because first we need to generate a mesh which is essentially a 3D Space full of data sampling points where some fluid let's say air is going to interact with some object say this heat sink it's not using that much RAM though what 45 gigs 48 gigs that's a lot of ram okay it's a
lot of ram but it's 2% of what we have the issue is that it just takes hours for the CPU to process a large enough mesh like this for it to fill up all of that Ram let alone the optain that's in there and this is a really silly way of doing this so what you're saying is flow doesn't need that much RAM obtaine is pointless no no no Flo Sim does need heaps and heaps of ram just a model like this doesn't necessarily if we were trying to run something that's super complex like crashing a car into a
barrier having terabytes of memory could be the difference between a finishing in a day and a finishing in a week of course though this isn't memory its latency is several times higher which would obviously impact performance the question is though how much to find out we came up with a rather terrible idea why don't we just remove a bunch of the actual Ram so that the system has no choice but to use the obtaine and then  after it's not going to do anything is it nope oh jeez there goes the alarm wait
maybe there's no way no sadly Intel thought of that and requires each stick of obtain pm to be paired with a stick of ram in order for the system to function at all and they have a recommended ratio of 4 to1 optained to RAM for Optimal Performance ours however it's more like a 16 to1 ratio and the server came straight from Intel so what do we do with the rest of it as it turns out many customers simply used higher ratios but there are some other ways to take advantage of the persistent
part of our persistent memory app direct mode and storage mode which Alex is showing us now yes app direct mode exposes the optain directly to the application which can use it like storage Ram or somewhere in between unfortunately we aren't able to show this off because doing so would require us to code our own program that explicitly takes advantage of it and this is a task that almost no company's worth billions of dollars found to be worthwhile so doing it for a YouTube
video would have a dubious Roi to say the least what we can show you is storage mode have you ever wondered what would happen if you could plug your SSD into a high-speed memory slot well basically this storage mode presents the obtained tier operating system much like an SSD just with super low latency compared to traditional Mand flash setting this bit up though was what caused this project to be stalled for months because we just couldn't figure out how to do it not because Alex is
dumb or because I'm dumb but rather because the BIOS on this Intel motherboard is so poorly organized now okay okay sorry this is going to be a bit of a tangent but motherboard manufactures can you please figure your shiz out I mean we have this industrywide problem where every single motherboard maker calls the exact same setting something ever so slightly different and then puts it in a different place meaning even if you are quite knowledgeable and not dumb and you know exactly what you're looking for
there's a solid chance you won't be able to find it we were easily able to figure out how to use app direct mode on Dell super micro Lenovo and HP server boards since they had decent documentation but no not the Intel one we even called up Patrick from serve the home who literally wrote the guide on how to do this and he couldn't figure it out either okay look at this Lis I'm going to go back to the main menu we're looking for the memory controller spot where do you think that
is well I would go to Advanced and then I would probably go to memory configuration so this is why we needed Emily to help us find it yes it is under PCI configuration um option ROM controller and that's where the memory controller is of course I can't believe we didn't think of that Anyway by using storage mode we're able to select how much of the optain we want to be presented as an SSD and we can create volumes with it much like with a raid array with the maximum performance
occurring when you interleave across multiple optained dims that are operating on the same CPU which essentially creates a raid zero array on opan now as you might have guessed this does come with the risk of data loss so if you don't care as much about performance you might want to mirror the data across both CPUs or I don't know maybe just buy an SSD but all of that aside the coolest configuration is mixed mode this allows you to set a target for how much of your optain will be storage and how much will
be Ram creating a Best of Both Worlds situation where the BIOS handles all of the complex bits and you get both cheap RAM and super low latency storage all right what's your memory percentage goal what do you mean goal it's doesn't really do exact it just kind of gets close to the percentage that you want I think we all know the answer to that nice so we reboot need sorry seemed mad okay all right no you don't seem mad you seem rightfully like we need to discuss this come on come on create name space
here we go there we go how about now there we go I love how surprised it is it's making a YouTube thumbnail face speaking of which we're working on a really cool video now that YouTube has AB testing for thumbnails Maria is creating a like cringe YouTuber face version of every thumbnail for a little bit and then just like a nice relaxed one and then we're going to make a video about which ones people actually prefer whatever they say they prefer it could change our thumbnail practices there we go all
right okay what we're looking at right now is our G Drive which is a conventional nbme SSD and our o Drive which is our optain drive and this measure is seconds per transfer which is essentially the latency of each operation on the drive now what we're going to do is we're going to run Crystal disc mark on both of these drives at the same time and theoretically yes yep the regular nvme is way more which is bad o is opan opan which makes sense because it barely even appears that's how low the latency of
this is which doesn't matter for everything and in fact if we have a look at our Crystal dis Mark results it's not that fast in terms of sequential transfer speeds it's just that it's really really responsive wow we've done it we go okay we can actually see what the crap we're looking at now here we go this is what we expect to see all three tests are running right now there we go yes and our SATA is much higher in terms of latency not to mention that it can be very inconsistent
see that initial Spike when we first hit it that's a yikes and while nvme is a lot better it doesn't have that super super flat line when all of them are running the same test that we see with optane where the latency is negligible which which can be a huge benefit for certain applications and not terribly important for others which is cool in some cases really cool so then why does optain no longer exist the answer is many many reasons the first and biggest problem is that optin arrived 2 years late it was
supposed to come with Skylake in 2017 with speeds that matched the ddr4 2666 that would be paired with those processors but obtaine didn't arrive until Cascade Lake which used 2933 megat transfer per second dims that meant that by choosing optain you would be giving up memory bandwidth to every application that doesn't need the extra capacity that is not ideal also in 2017 there was a global drram shortage as phones like the Samsung Galaxy S6 Google pixel and HTC1 M9 started using ddr4 while Samsung
and Micron were struggling to ramp up production 16 gigs of RAM hit prices of over $200 that would have been a perfect opportunity for an almost Ram product at a lower price except that by 2019 that same 16 gigs of RAM was down to more like a hundo also remember how we mentioned that each stick of obtained PM requires a stick of ram to pair with it in order for it to work well yeah so companies that were looking into optain they weren't just comparing the price of opan versus Ram they had to
look at the cost of an optain module and a stick of ram compared to just getting two sticks of ram that uh oh by the way are going to run faster Tom's Hardware has an article from 2019 about the pricing quoting a single stick of this 512 gig optain at a cool $675 meaning that this server that we casually lost when it was new had "$81,000 worth of optane in it that" sounds like a lot because it is but in 2019 a single stick of 128 gigs of ECC memory was roughly $4500 meaning optain was only about
onethird of the price so wait hold on a second that was in 2019 that still sounds pretty good I mean the demo we just did looked pretty good optained for the win right well I do love your optimism remember guys we spoiled the ending earlier and everyone dies but it doesn't have to be a total loss there's maybe a valuable lesson here for the industry to maybe learn this time intel if you're listening and everyone you need to stop locking your products because I didn't buy enough of your
products the Cascade Lake CPUs that did eventually sh with obtaine had two variants a standard version and a large memory footprint version in the case of the Zeon plattinum 8260 that we've got in this server The Standard Version supported only 1 tab of ram a number that's pretty easy to hit with regular old Dam meaning that if you wanted to really take advantage of optane you needed the zeeon Platinum 8260 L well I mean that's no problem right I mean how much more could it
"$3,400 oh yeah and since you're buying" two of them it's an extra $6800 before you buy a single flipping optane module can see why they used L as the suffix for those adding insult to injury you know what also happened between 2017 and 2019 while intel was struggling to get optane out of the door AMD launched epic Rome and then epic Milan featuring more cores more memory channels support for four ttes of ram without a silly large memory footprint tax oh and by the way they were also
cheaper this added up to not a whole lot of people buying optane and Micron who owned the Fab where all the optane was being built finally said you know what enough is enough it was and still is a very cool technology but in 2021 Micron figured you know it be a lot cooler how about not losing 400 million ion dollar a year so one year later Intel killed optain which um raises one interesting question why can you still buy it well about that even though there hasn't been
a Fab making the stuff for years now in 20122 Intel revealed that they still had over half a billion dollars of inventory left over and they haven't exactly been pushing it that hard I mean what is this pricing Intel do you want this on your books forever there are some awesome closeout deals out there these 16 gig accelerators are amazing there are go-to drives for a DIY Network Appliance or a NZ because they're literally five bucks and opan features substantially more right
endurance than nand which is great if you want to constantly retain and overwrite comprehensive system logs and this one on new egg is still among if not the best drive on the market even if it is starting to show its age in some ways for example it'll have outstanding latency like we talked about before but it runs at a quarter the maximum speed of a modern Gen 5 Drive which is a bit of a yikes so in conclusion Intel do you want this thing back we uh honestly really don't know
