what is up everybody and welcome to the WAN show we've got a great show lined up for you guys this week I forgot what the title of the video is so um uh it's about the the Tesla thing oh Lordy it has been alleged according to inside sources from Tesla that the company's self-driving training put more weight on training data from influencers and Youtubers with Tesla vehicles in order to ensure that the people who were most likely to upload video of Full self-driving functioning had the best
experience we're going to be talking about that and how we feel about it what else we got this oh wait no I was going to do two you need to do another yeah I'll do two I'll do two what's going on nobody cares about the AI features on Snapdragon X Elite whatever the order is snapdragon X Elite laptops what no one cares about the AI they just want battery life that's it are you kidding me Luke that's the whole kid me but Luke I thought AI was all that matter could you think of the children and their
their AI features what else we got this week well I wanted to do that topic but uh ryzen 9000 launched and uh Xbox game pass increased in price because apparently everything has to not just increased in price also got convoluted as all get out I can't wait to talk about that oh dude it's B there's like  5 the show is brought to you today by manscaped ag1 and SE Sonic of course alongside our secret lab chair partner whoops I mean our chair partner secret lab whatever the point is there's the
logo this is great northcore star says this just in my tech illiterate ant isn't a tech CEO obsessed with AI you're right what no the the AI versus battery life Snapdragon the point is let's jump right into our headline topic which is of course that Tesla's self-driving well I think self-driving is generous but then again calling it full self-driving is also generous so let's just call it Tesla's driving assists shall we uh according to Business Insider sources inside Tesla have claimed that the company's
self-driving training puts more weight on training data from influencers and Youtubers with Tesla uh uh and also CEO Elon Musk so that one is actually Mak sense to me well no I want to unpack that one a little bit more later first I want to talk talk about the influencers current and former employees say they were instructed to put additional resources into routes that were frequently driven by these VIPs for example having employees who review and annotate footage for training having
them spend more time on footage from these drivers wow if effective this strategy means that Tesla's full self driving would be significantly smoother and more accurate on these routes than it would be on a typical Road it is therefore likely to conclude that the company wanted high-profile drivers with large audiences to have a better experience without even knowing that their experience was not representative of what the average user would see which is super bad this is this type of
activity is something that you have to try to look out for as a reviewer um the the first way that I was introduced to it was people talking about Golden samples yeah where companies will send you a like known perfect version of their product instead of just picking one off the line and that can be a problem especially when you're talking about Performance Products because we would talk about like golden sample CPUs where a brand would send you a CPU that is like the best possible binning which
we've tested multiple times and never found evidence of in terms of our CPU sampling but what what I've heard is that it was potentially a practice in the earlier days of tech media especially when overclocking was a far more important aspect of reviewing a potential chip at one time that was like the main that was the main thing I would read on articles when I was a kid person you but can you overclock the snot out of it yeah yeah um now my question is because obviously there's the there's
the things about this that are just generally skey right like you you shouldn't want to misrepresent your product because it's going to lead to bad experiences for your customers I mean we discussed this in detail when we did our video earlier this week on amd's extremely misleading naming scheme for their ryzen mobile processors it should be in your best interest as a company to accurately represent your products so that you create brand loyalty and people come back to you time and time
again so I'm not going to get too deep into that right now but what I want to talk about is is or should be illegal because technically I don't think that Tesla is violating any law nobody says that they have to that they have to manually annotate the footage from every user equally they could have any number of reasons for focusing on a particular area oh we're doing a big focus on hilly terrain or we're doing a big Focus we're doing a big push on unus usual signage or we we found that this user is in like
the bottom 1% for successful self-driving sure so the area that they're driving in must be highly complicated let's try to train on that data and figure out what's going on so they could offer up any explanation for this that would be at least plausible enough that it would be difficult to nail down Beyond reasonable doubt that they did this simply to juice the perception of full self-driving and bu people into spending thousands of dollars for a feature that is not going to perform the way that they might
expect it to now there have been situations where it's not really buking I think when Tesla offered a preview of full self-driving I believe they offered a month was it two months they they offered a preview of full self-driving and many people tried it out and were happy with it and kept it but many tried it out and kind of went this is this is not what I expected and did not move for forward with the purchase but there have been times when I don't believe there was a meaningful way to get a refund if
you bought it and correct me if I'm wrong have they always offered the option to return within 30 days I have no clue I would love to hear  guys no not always yeah I did I didn't think so I was pretty sure there were times when they were basically asking you to buy it sight unseen especially in the earlier days when the like the beta weren't even functional from a from a fully self-driving perspective so at what point do we look at this whole thing and does this become one of the
like great scams of the 21st century yeah I mean it's rough CU it's been going on for half a decade now there are still people who will attack me for talking about how this has been how how this has been a failed promise how it was so obvious from the start that still didn't weren't they the ones that announced that it doesn't work on Hardware 3 or whatever yeah oh but people oh dude people are still so mad what what is up with your Elon hateboner or whatever else it's not it's not Elon
specific I'm sorry I can't I can't hear you with his in your mouth like I my job is just to cover the tech I don't care I don't care and any company that lies so consistently about something so expensive I mean look look at it from this perspective if you bought one of that the one of the first Hardware 3.0 cars where they said anything running Hardware 3.0 will be full self-driving you could be done with that car by now and you never got it so someone in the chat said hold the influencer
accountable um that doesn't work if the influencer doesn't know how could they know that's thing we go out of our way sometimes like secret shopper for example is a situation where we are trying we are doing everything in our power to best replicate the average user's experience it's extremely timec consuming it is extremely expensive we have to bring in essentially actors to play the role of the customer right because I can't just what call up star Forge or call up main
gear and and place a purchase uh when I you know literally um know or have interacted with the ownership of these companies right like it it doesn't work that way right so secret shopping going incognito can be extremely challenging and it's not even really applicable to a situation like this where the only reason they own the car it's not like anybody gave them the car the only reason they own the car is because they're a customer and so as a customer they are fully entitled to experience it
dayto day that's another thing this is something that you can't really review like in a week it's tough right so I can't just I can't just hire someone to be a a Tesla full self-driving tester and then I mean I guess conceivably I could but I would have to I would have to hire them to just drive the car around or or not all over the place sit in car all the time for some extended period of time Incognito and then like funnel that data back to me with no tie between the car
and myself and I'm just I'm looking at it going like this is you got to understand what you're asking sort of these average sort of car Channel or or technology Channel people to do like it's not if it's average even if you're a really big time car car Channel and and have the funds to do that is that what you really want to SP spend your funds doing is dodging their training thing so they can't tell that it's you like the heck no yeah there's there's no way that they could possibly be
responsible for it there are due diligence things that we as you know influencers or Media or journalists you know the people who cover this stuff and at their from their various angles right there are things that we can do to anonymize ourselves but in this case they had no reason to even I mean this is some tinfoil hat level [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] here like that they're going through in fine tuning the roads that full self-driving works on to be rep to be better where I for where I drive I mean what kind of
like narcissistic [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] would you have to be to even think of that to even think that the companies that makes the products you buy are going to fine-tune The Experience just for you yeah yeah and I'm sure somebody thought of it but like I clearly it's and clearly it's real but this just this blew my mind you could like you could um I could see ways if depending on the compute in the car that you could have it training actively specifically for you in your area yeah but that isn't what they do
cuz they train the model offsite and yeah know I know I know I'm just y now the next thing that I want to unpack is the fact that it is specifically tuned for the routes that Mr musk drives now hold on this I don't know if this is a problem personally okay I can give my take reason why I'm going to I'm going to take your take sure and then I'm going to obliterate it okay yeah I so the the you know there's probably something negative along with this but the first way that I read that uh was more based
around Elon being very open and with the data of him driving so he's like whatever train on this as much as you want not necessarily I want all my roades to be perfect here's my two reasons it's terrible actually there really one reason that it's no there are two reasons there are two reasons that it's terrible no it's one reason the reason okay hold on hold on cuz think about if we did something you would want it test it on you all the products in lt2 store have made like for you okay but here's
the problem if you handed me a golden sample that was different from the one you give the customers I would be livid all right yeah fair enough y because you're making a fool out of me I'm going to go out there and I'm going to sell them on the features and performance and quality and then they're going to get something that is not what I promised essentially whether you whether you misrepresented it to cover your own hide or whether I am I don't know misguided enough you
should almost have like the the least strained on data I should be the most anonymized user so I am getting the most real experience now I can understand from Tesla's perspective why they don't want his car especially to just swerve into a telephone pole but if other people are going to drive in it you should be confident enough um that you're willing to do that in exactly yeah yeah no I'm on board now all right y good enough but it was a good effort I tried I so like I I it's I mean it's the
same reason why I like having customer support close to developers yeah is because you you need to hear and understand the daily problems of the users um because you know you're not going to be able to solve every single thing that comes up exactly but you shouldn't be shielded from them that is the biggest problem that I have encountered time and time again with management level people especially in larger organizations is the more removed they are from the day-to-day
operations the more they just don't have any chance of understanding the customer yeah and the more the more misguided their product development gets uh even even in an organization our size I feel it sometimes oh yeah where I'm sitting there going oh really and and this is coming from someone who is reading your chat right now this is coming from someone who who reads comments who also reads the daily summary getting an outside perspective from our community coordinator uh Steven um on what you
guys are saying it feels so official to hear you call him Steven chewy I still have blind spots and it's just inherent to getting larger like I'll find out about a okay here where's that thing Dan I can I please have the thing the thing you showed me before the show the terrifying thing oh okay I would like it oh my god oh really okay actually okay I just about crapped myself when I saw it's not done yeah it's fine it doesn't matter there's actually a lot more that's going to be
added okay this this is the process flow there we go for the creation and publication of an LT video what is it missing D it's missing it's missing the pre-production steps so that red box in the center there there uh is the entire pre-production steps when the video is planned with what when it's going to be shot where it's going to be shot what do they need when is the shooter assigned good flipping gravy so remember when in the in the pre-show I pointed out how much live stream on F plane costs yeah
one of the questions I had the first time I saw that was how much does that cost a lot I bet how much does every one of those jumps take time how much time is just in jumping that many every time somebody orders something Logistics has to do work every time somebody uses something in inventory Logistics has to do work it's I mean people keep asking the knock on effects L has like 100 people how do they not have like a video immediately about everything it's like how many what percentage of them do you
think work in writing support staff is incredibly important and so valuable and invisible to you guys in the end product I mean look do yourself a favor okay next time you go to a movie in the theater first of all give yourself a gold star for keeping that dying industry afloat and then second of all don't walk out when the credit start watch the whole list scroll by obviously we don't operate on a Hollywood level either in terms of our budgets or we're not filling coliseums with water or our production
complications but it should give you some idea that it's not as simple as you know lonus and two of his brosies on set fooling around with computers there's so many touch points there's that many there's that many touch points and we're not producing one at a time yeah there's like 20 or 30 that chain is parallelized 30 times it is insane it touches every single Department in the company including CW how we started doing that was we were we were looking at our that's what that's
just this week that I've done that in yeah and that wasn't even the original task but now it's like the clearly more important one um the original task was okay we have we have teams we have slack we have uh G Suite we have Outlook we have uh people text each other people Discord each other people call each other people call each other on teams people call each other on meet people like oh yeah usually calls me on Whatsapp I got to add that to yeah we got to add that so we're trying to
figure out like what are all the communication methods at the company and what do people anything highly confidential I almost always message yvon somewhere else just so you know as long as the somewhere else is good then that's fine it's good it's endend encrypted yeah that's fine yeah I'm just saying I'm just saying that and we don't need that I'm just saying I'm adding it to your list is that if something is like of the that is how it should work if you wanted recommendations our team no I'm good I'm
just saying it wasn't in your list so I'm just helping yeah but so we were trying to map yeah what communication software do we use how does it get used when does it get used Jamie leaves Post-it notes for me dear God really I'm going to cry well did you see how many times the mirror in my office fell down so he leaves Post-it notes for me every time it falls down say saying it's definitely fixed this time and also other Post-it notes I mean that's that's just fun that's fine keep
doing that um but yeah and then and then this like spiderweb started forming and uh yeah I mean this has been something that I've wanted to look at for a long time and it's really interesting seeing where the potential communication breakdowns are because for example the entire editing stage is done through teams DMS between the editor and the writer and so if the writer is working on four or five videos simultaneously then he's managing four or five different individual email uh teams DMS
with four or five different editors that are in multi-stage production right things get wacky and like some of this stuff is going to have to keep happening oh yeah but we need to be aware of that so that if we pick a new communication Suite it needs to be able to handle these use cases that we already have something that I'm trying to find break the whole company because we tried to migrate us to a different chat client yeah um entry and exit point for communication yes you want to buy a
thing who is notified when are you Reen notified when that next step has happened right it's crazy Crystal dear asks why is there a mirror in your office it's a fair question given the state of my hair today but in theory I'm an onscreen talent and should probably know what I look like before that would be a genuinely pretty funny flow plane exclusive is in the I think it was the reviewing the best rigs that we've done over the years video uh we turned it into like a lonus hair review partway
through if you remember that I do they should actually do a like Linus's hair over the years video there's some pretty wild stuff would be kill in the early NC Tech tips days cuz it would just be whatever I rolled out a bed with yeah and it would just be sometimes it'd be Duke Nukem bleach blonde hair yeah um there there were there were some as appearing on camera like basically every day with no schedule other than when I have time to do it man I've had some Mondo zits I've had some supremely bad
Hair Days yeah I've made a lot of questionable fashion decisions in my  documented yeah it is what it is so that's cool I'm I'm actually I'm going and I'm looking right now I'm going to I'm going to NC Tech tips here I mean yeah I don't even know who this guy is but don't don't worry about him who gets the AdSense pay for this these days I have a theory yeah like but that's just a theory yeah yeah yeah yeah I'm not going to say what my theory is but I I have a theory and it's uh it's not the
most like up and up Theory but it's a theory all right ah yeah really I think someone's getting it yeah and I don't think it's anyone who works at ncx yeah well it isn't me I'll say that much that one's good that one's good this one uh no middle left the blonde oh oh Lordy the super blonde oh my goodness yeah yeah wow let's go yeah um here here is I just got out of bed day that's for sure uh yeah I don't know what that is 14 years ago I know right oh man what the remember this cringe uh lizard hat yeah
so that was air that was airbrushed for me on a like sidewalk in Victoria or something nice yeah had like a a gecko on it or something I don't even I don't even I don't know what I was thinking you guys I that dude that hat made a lot of appearances though that might be it oh it might be a different hat it doesn't matter the point is that oh God  back any so good the bleach blonde was that was a that was a classic dbrand wanted to bring it back I thought they were going to sponsor me to di it again
on the show or something I'm down dbrand come at me yeah yeah yeah it's going to be a big bag of money or I'm not doing it though cuz my wife is not going to be into it not going to be into it uh speaking of hair stuff how's the painting going well I told you already that I had to completely strip the wheels right yeah yeah yeah yeah so I stripped one of the wheels which took me I don't know 2 or 3 hours or something like that so I stripped one of them down to like primer
SL bare metal thinking that they would be close enough that if I painted the not even close so I've got to go all the way down to bare metal on that one so I probably got to put like another hour into it and then I'm going to have to do the other wheel then I'm going to have to try again um I don't think I'm I don't think I'm riding the summer oh but maybe that's okay because I next summer it s it sucks it sucks cuz um Ivonne is finally taking some long overdue mat leave uh this summer so as
of last week last week or the week before so either no last week the beginning of last week she's not in office for the entire summer because she's still working I know I was giving her a hard time yesterday because she was like working too much she's she she agreed to work in uh a day a week but she's been doing more than that but any anyway okay the point is she's finally theoretically taking some long overdue mat Le because I mean you remember this back when back back when our firstborn was an infant we
wisely founded a company together and so she spent all the time that she had off from her job doing this other job and then had to go back to her old job and effectively have two jobs from then until like what like five years later or something how many years it was yeah somewhere in that neighborhood and then at every point where we had a kid she was working uh and like obviously like we couldn't pay her because she's not working or whatever but she had a lot of stuff that
if she didn't do it it would you know if she didn't spin those plates they would fall and break so so she did a lot of work even though she was also caring for an infant which is a full-time job um and so finally now that our you know now that our second is nearing the decade Mark um she's she's getting a summer off with the kids to to hang with kids and do kid things um so thank goodness for that that's uh that's amazing and I forget where I was going with this right she doesn't really want
my hair to be blonde I think was what I was talking about people are asking for mine as well and I'm I'm saying Valhalla for the company oh if they pay enough I'm down okay all right it's going to cost double it will look really bad on me it will it'll look atrocious oh you're going to look awful especially if you keep the beard yeah you're going to look like an idiot no one wants me to remove so it's probably going to stay on anyways oh I could just do both you can't dye it okay yeah no it's it's a
completely different composition of hair it doesn't take dye nearly as well like you can do it like you see people that have like you know the purple braid in the beard or whatever like you can do it but it's it's a lot more like pubes yeah you know where where it's that really wiry it's hair that you get when you go through puberty so it like literally is yeah so it's it's that really wiry hair and it just doesn't take dye nearly as well that makes sense I don't know what
will look stupider no if you try to dye it oh or if you just don't try cuz your head hair you're you're really blonde right so you're going to go you're going to be like like white blonde whereas I am kind of a dirty blonde um but I tend to go more of like a yellow and especially cuz blonde I more pigment in my hair my hair becomes a lot lighter when I spend more time in the Sun and based on my upcoming schedule I'm be spending a lot of time in the Sun so it's going to be
quite bright anyways oh you got some vacation coming up no I just have a lot of plans to be outside nice yeah it's going to be good nice yeah we're we're going to look like idiots with matching hair die job oh yeah would you wear the  if they pay triple is Dan gonna do it too is Dan talking about it wait he's talking about doing silver yeah you can't dye your hair silver Dan I was wondering like does it do we do a different color or is it both blonde oh it has to be blonde all right are you in
I mean it's it's hell yeah it's it's 1997  shells oh man we're going to have to do a special Edition uh like shirt or something like that polo shirt the bro fist shirt uh but like our hair's blond and oh but how do we integrate Dan we got to have Dan should I just be in the middle going like this wow and then  hm as I said I'm down I mean you saw I had a fist out right like what did you think was going  mean by the way by the way since we're getting all erotic right now anyway oh
wow yeah so so when I was when I was touching my my chest to kind of show the shirt I have boobies now I've been swimming no I've been swimming probably two of every 3 days for the last little bit last night I did a kilometer um which is not a ton but it's a lot more than not swimming for a kilometer yeah um and so I did um how do you okay just laps yeah yeah so every every length is about 13 M or something like that or whatever it works out to um so so one lap is 25 M and I go out of my way not
to push hard off the wall like I'll just position myself but then I'll like swim um check it out I got boobies yeah just a little bit I can visibly see you got to feel F so high I I don't know how yet  um oh maybe a little I think I can do it a little how do you not know to have flex your yeah there you go a little bit I've never had any muscle there chest muscle is weird cuz you don't actually really use it for like a ton of stuff you sure Zach use it for swimming I've been really sore dude yeah
yeah anyway honestly the that was confusing me too have you never tried to flex your pecs before I've never had pectoral muscles to speak be something guys back me up on this back me up in the chat if you don't have like if you're flat chested how do you Flex a muscle that is like so underdeveloped no idea how we don't know see that's exactly exactly what I'm talking about bringing in a bodybuilder teach lonus how to pose would be kind of sick if you did like bodybuilding poses for
the underwear shoots no hell yeah dude I have a limmit I absolutely have a limit it's surprising but it does exist um anyway yeah know the reason that I like really wanted to start swimming all the time was uh it was prompted by that injury that I got at softball night mhm cuz I've had these persistent uh rotator cuff here I've had some persistent shoulder injuries and so I really started doing it just more as like rehab yeah just working on all the different muscles that are so hard to use um
unless you really know what you're doing in the gym or if you're doing a really Dynamic activity like swimming uh so I was like okay well I'm just going to I'm just going to get in the pool and justify the bloody expense and all the work that this stupid thing has been um and so I was I was mostly just focused on like doing Different Strokes like range of motion and like moving around a lot and you know what it's been it's been better softball night the last softball night didn't injure myself felt
a pretty gooder I don't think I got a home run but I got a triple um and yeah yeah it's been it's been feeling good and then now all of a sudden I have booies which is like very weird for me because I've never really had them that I can remember like I was I was in really good shape in late high school when I was really into martial arts but I was super Lean Like I probably weighed even though I'm the same height now and I actually still fit into my uniform from when I was 16 which is pretty wild
that is kind of wild but I weighed probably 30 less pounds but mus dense yeah but I gain muscle I was no but that's the thing is back then I could do 50 consecutive push-ups now I couldn't even I could I could probably do 15 not 50 so I don't really know what's going on if your muscles in your legs it won't help you do push-ups and you haven't been training your chest you've been training badminton which   I mean I'm pretty sure you can block that with muscle yeah that's the other
thing too like uh when I was when I was 16 I was also doing all my lifeguarding training and stuff like I I should have been but you're saying that your pecs are getting stronger from swimming yeah so what I'm saying now is your your current muscle building activity is strengthening your legs mostly so if you're putting mass in your legs that's weight that you're pushing up when you're doing a push-up and you're not training your chest ever and you're trying to do 50 push-ups it's be hard
guess yeah I gu I just mean like back then I would have thought that I a crazy amount of training you could get back to 50 um yeah it probably wouldn't take me all that long but it hurts cuz I'm old and my shoulders are old I get weird yeah like when I do like I don't remember this work that out though it gets better with time the next batch of fan art is going to be epic oh my God you just have like huge chest I had a I had a thing where I've gotten to the point where when I get a chest pump from
going to the gym and doing chest day the seat belt I I can look down and there's a gap when the seat belt crosses my chest that was an interesting moment I was like whoa all right I don't know how to feel about that theoretically it's a good thing because it's a it's a muscle chest pump so like it's just it's just weird it's a weird moment all right uh what on Earth are we supposed to be talking about Luke  um let's see here nobody's buying co-pilot Plus for the AI despite Microsoft and qualcomm's
heavy marketing focus on AI features most consumers buying co-pilot plus laptops appear to be buying them for their competitive battery life users also don't find these laptops exclusive AI features like co-creator Windows Studio Effects and live captions with translation useful on a day-to-day basis further many popular applications like Adobe have simply decided not to adjust their AI features so they run locally as the vast majority of PCS sold this year will not be able to run those types of
things on device anyways so you'd be doing a bunch of development for a very small portion of  w i uh AI stuff is interesting AI stuff is quite powerful yes and and it's not necessarily beneficial when you just force feed it into every single thing that you make and the the bigger the bigger issue for me is just that it's um it's not integrated into most things if if that kind of makes sense like I can I can I can AI um you know uh track separation like some of the demos that uh that Qualcomm
is doing around these co-pilot plus PCS legitimately super cool that track isolation DJ thing that's awesome wild for whoever is doing their DJ work on a laptop and whoever uses that specific piece of software and whoever doesn't have access to a cleaner non AI way of isolating that track so we're just we're just looking at we're just looking at a very very small subset of users and and and you know what once that is more broadly supported in applications that people are going to
use which is only going to happen once every device can support it I could see that being part of someone's flow um and and like an you know an average user's flow and when I say average user I don't mean everybody I mean an average user who would need to do that so let's say I'm a I'm a street performer okay I do I I do uh performances of of mainstream music um at a train station and I play the guitar track myself okay super cool I can rip the guitar in real time essentially out of any track
that I want and you know infringement aside yeah that's super convenient yeah but until it's broadly supported on Hardware you're not going to get broad software support and until it's broadly supported in software you're not really going to get any kind of Market penetration so it's a really cool demo right now but I just don't see it I don't see it moving the needle Honestly though the bigger thing for me the reason that I highlighted this topic for the dock in the first
place was that I just don't see how after Qualcomm spent so much time talking about what a key point it was for snap dragon X that they had excellent battery life that it was a surprise to them that was number one that was the most that was the most important thing I mean everything about this platform that we've looked at has been something but battery life okay the performance is solid except when it's not but battery life yeah compatibility is a lot better but it's still spotty but battery life how
does the battery life compared to a Mac solid okay I was going to say that's the real fight here it's finally good yes does it go to sleep okay that unfortunately there's no like meaningful way to conclusively test that and it can be really inconsistent like one one laptop could and the other one wouldn't so this will be like we'll have to see with saturation and the same laptop might sleep perfectly today and then on Saturday I put it in my backpack and on Monday it's a furnace in there
and I take it out and the battery's dead and like I don't know yeah fair enough it yeah very very frustrating but everything we've talked about with this platform has been like yeah there's compromises but the battery life and I I think that I think that something that here hold on a second are we uh oh man what's the oh my goodness this is really embarrassing uh someone made a video about our um our Snapdragon video and I forget their name uh okay anyway uh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah uh anyway the point the point that I was trying to make is that when we were when we when we talked about the platform for us the battery life was a major major Focus because the vast majority of the time that people are using their computers they're doing something extremely light and essentially what we want to know is how much of a drain is the processor when you can't turn the screen off you can't turn the wireless connectivity off uh like how how much is that just having
the system powered on affected by the idle power consumption of the processor in it and as it turns out on these devices it's really really good and everything else is usable enough I mean it's not perfect um when we did our game stream we went through I think it is it a somewhere between 30 and 40 games I think we made it through a lot of games this a long stream it's like three or four hours uh but we made it through a lot of GES oh no Heavens know now some we knew weren't going to work but there
were lots of others that were broken in creative ways there was one where uh Spider-Man Spider-Man uh the hair physics were just wild every hair on only better modeled characters like main characters was like scking out and like physicing around like this like it was hilarious that's kind of fun um yeah that was that was pretty awesome um but you know our perspective on this product was that we understand that it's first gen we understand what people are buying for buying it for and no we don't think
that people are buying it to uh you know architect a building whatever yeah uh we we no we don't think that people are buying it to use specialized applications on we think that people are buying it to essentially do most of what they do in a web browser and get really really great battery life out of it and in that context it's a major success and honestly I think some of the negative discourse around the the Snapdragon X launch has been from Qualcomm just over promising yeah they should have just
said you know compatibility is still a challeng headstrong like really headstrong too much yeah and I do understand why they were confident it's a good product but just but but just letting other people beat the drum of positivity would have been better than doing it themselves that's I think the big mistake that they made if I could identify one at risk of sounding too positive to Apple um I think as well I think people were maybe a little bit more hopeful about this launch because the M
series uh like MacBooks that launch went so well it had issues yeah but it was really smooth it was really smooth but the expectations are so different like well what I'm saying is I think that set the expectations higher oh I just mean the expectations of a Mac User are so different like I could do a lot of what I need to do on a Mac by never stepping outside of first-party Apple software yeah and so that's a really it's a really different ecosystem and and I I use that word in a in a non-d
disparaging way it's a very different e ecosystem than what exists on Windows where you've got all these disperate developers and you've got all these kind of eras during which their applications were created all these expectations of support across different Hardware it's it's a real challenge honestly the fact maybe that's part of it too for me is the fact that it's as good as it is I'm just really impressed right cuz I I I I I didn't I didn't hope that windows on on arm would ever gain
traction but it's very clear that it's happening now I'm still holding out hope that that framework uh risk processor laptop is going to be  um we've got a really long topic kind of on the on the the the call out on our Snapdragon X Elite video and honestly kind of looking at a lot of it going like I don't think we need to delve into this go read the comment yeah there's um yeah there we we published a full response um on the video which has been posted on a couple of subreddits
including our own you guys can go check it out there um but there there is some discussion here you know there some of the discussion is like how much testing is enough to come to a conclusion um you know I wanted to include more in the video but the reason that we did include more was because the methodology wouldn't have been up to our standards um there were things that we tested that we didn't include because they weren't repeatable enough and it's a brand new platform and that comes with
challenges um so the the discussion question here is like should we should we include janky testing in our review videos if we disclaim them as such um like one of the things that I was upset about when I arrived on set because this was a rare video that because of other obligations was mostly worked on by other members of the team um usually I'm pretty deeply involved uh but on this one I arrived on set after having had conversations about how we were going to do it and I discovered
that we hadn't followed through on any kind of thermal testing and the answer that was given to me was well we don't have reliable diode data and I kind of went well what I would have liked to see is at least you know a thermal camera pointed at a tape strip across you know two price comparable performance comparable notebooks from qualcom and Intel or AMD uh where we kind of look at you know um surface temperature like is make it meaningful to me the user even if we can't draw a conclusion about
exactly what the thermal draw is or excuse me what the power draw is and therefore the thermal output um and that was something that you know there was some debate about by then it was it was sort of you know too late to do much  a mention if anything but you know that's something that you maybe we need to philosophically reexamine like are we willing to do kind of um janky janky tests as long as we say like look this is this is what they are and I I see it both ways like going back to the roots
of LT I don't know if you remember this video I'm pretty sure we worked on it together um but there was this uh screen protector film like a like a like a painton screen protector that claimed to create like a nano coating over the glass that made it scratch proof even though you painted it on and the test that we came up with um was like dragging it behind your bike yeah I dragged it down the street remember with the screen facing down on the phone uh behind my motorcycle I'm pretty sure I'm
running after you with a camera or something yeah yeah um and you know what that's not scientific at all but what was cool was we were able to pick it up and kind of scratch at the thing and go oh yeah there is a coding on here even though we couldn't see it and and you know it's something um but we've also kind of evolved beyond that and I can see the argument the other way that if we can't stand behind it especially in light of how how much scrutiny there has been on
us if we can't stand behind it 100% are we better off saying nothing but then we don't say anything and we get a attacked for hiding things think you are what are you been talking about I think you just need to make it clear what the like level of confidence is basically um yeah except the the top upvoted comment on the discussion around this is that our graphs are already unintelligible to the average person our cfts are just bar graphs if we start adding error bars like that's
thing they that bad that's no they're not that's the thing that very scientific-minded people don't realize sometimes I think is if you start asking asking for you know confidence intervals well okay to be clear I I think in order to do that it would have to appear very differently I don't think you would have to be a label on a graph I think you would you would have to like present the information not even on a graph necessarily to like communicate without words even but you should probably also
do it with words that this is not to the same level of of okay professionalism as the other information how much of our video which and like look I don't want to start publishing 60-minute video essays about the merits of some stupid processor you're the one that wanted the lab like we it's it's really interesting to me to see the way my words get twisted against me like we we strive to be entertaining tting things that doesn't mean that we're an entertainment Channel we're still a tech Channel where a lot
of people have unironically learned a lot about technology um but that doesn't mean that I'm going to compromise on making content that's good I don't know what you're talking about I'm entertained cuz to me it's an entertainment channel for anything to be good it has to be at least digestible it has to be over a certain bar of entertainment value um and so you know no I don't want to spend three minutes on disclaimers Luke sorry run John and float plane chat just said do the graph  [Laughter]
it it communicates pretty well but you could still you could even like do it digitally so that it's like fairly clean crayon but still make it obvious like this is It's supposed to look like a  um sorry you're like all eloquently talking about trying to communicate with an audience and the perception of the channel and stuff and I'm crayons I you all um I just I don't know yeah yeah I don't know cphon says the latest AMD video was one of the better videos I've seen I think I may have aged out of a lot of
the videos now still enjoy Wan show though um nice you know yeah I'm I'm glad you do um honestly that AMD video is not the kind of thing that I want to make though this this ryzen video the most recent one like I I am I'm tired of being angry yeah like maybe maybe in future we don't make that video I would like to I'd like to find a brighter side I'd like to you know what I want to finally do little Tech Shop of Horrors we've talked about this a lot of times why don't we like actually open an 
shop just just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do it people are going to troll you so hard we make videos it might be worth it might be good for Content but people are going to troll you so hard um I think that we'd probably compete with what's his name uh Keith from uh from black uh black lab this guy charged me so much money you can open how much of that stuff do you still have left do you have any of it left we still have all of it just put it in the [Laughter] store you have a storefront
already you don't even have to buy the convincingly Dusty old junk you have the convincingly Dusty old junk oh my god there you go there's your legitimacy I don't know man like I just I uh I want to reconnect with you know excitement and fun and like I'm just I'm tired of being I'm tired of being mad and cranky about you know this branding or that that FPS that's 6% lower I'm just it's so boring to me personally I find it incredibly exhausting any new thing that I get interested in I go to try to find
the you know the internet Community around this thing cuz I'm like looking for more information whatever and they're always just every single time it's just hatred and anger and I'm just like I don't want to be here anymore sucks I I I I I talked about this in writer meeting today and just like or I didn't talk about this specific part today but I've talked to the writers about this about just wanting to be an oasis of of positivity and optimism and we're not going to be dishonest
obviously if something's bad then we're going to say it's bad if you're reviewing something you got to be legit about it but I guess what I'm trying to say is I want to be more selective about what we cover and I want to cover things that I think are cool yeah nice yeah I think that'd be neat I'm done with that you got to be negative sometimes because like you said you can't be dishonest about things but uh I don't know I I find it exhausting um hate gets views people just the the
whole Doom scrambling nature of just like you go on the internet to get mad and stay mad it's just like I also I also think that that that cynicism is part of no no offense um to whoever said they had outgrown our videos I I think that cynicism is part of why you might feel that way like I one of my problems is I don't really I don't watch our Stu I think it makes it hard to I think it makes it hard to enjoy anything do you feel like that negativity is a is a theme on the channel right now I I don't watch I
don't know no but that's exactly it and I think that it's easy to but then is this is this really change  that I think that we can do more I guess is what I'm trying to say because even the things that you look at like what we've done over the last little bit like this this we did because we felt it was really important um AMD bucked a trend that has existed basically forever where the first number indicates the generation of the product that to me is unacceptable do you know
about this wait what no so their mobile chips will no longer use the first number to indicate how new the product is that will be the fourth number now yeah I don't like that yeah yeah that's worth making a video about that makes sense you still got to do that kind of stuff sometimes yeah but then this is just working with the kids to uh fix the gaming minivan this is checking out an ancient keyboard that uh we found a picture from the Chernobyl disaster that had this exact keyboard in it and
so Ariel from the lab like got it working again like he did with that weird Soviet Mouse nice um this is something maybe we just shouldn't have covered so it's a it it gets pretty deep into the Weeds on what a dual mode monitor is and maybe we should just leave that for someone else to explain because to me it's not that exciting I think that most people probably don't need it do do you know what it is it's basically a monitor with two IDs okay and the reason for that is that um
essentially as far as we can tell um no scaler can handle um 480 htz refreshes at 4K even at the panel level cuz like obviously no no input can handle that anyway so at the panel level they can't do it so it has to run in two different modes has to run in a 480 HZ 1080p mode or a 240 HZ 4K mode in order for both of them to work natively essentially and like yeah maybe that just maybe that just isn't 11 minutes and 46 seconds worth of interesting and we just shouldn't have 
um like this was fun just building the CEO computer with that like wild Sinister case this was really fun uh checking out this hard drive with 25 million computer virus on it the the why did you make me build this computer in that thumbnail looks like one of the toys from Toy Story that was like ripped apart and put together by that by that kid I don't know why I may me think of that but yeah I don't know I I think trying to bring positivity when you can is a nice thing
to do on the internet cuz it's just yeah see this is tough like unique username says that whole AMD video is the least interesting thing you uploaded on the main channel in recent months marketing is BS always has been always will so what well like awareness of a bad practice though I I respect making that video even if it doesn't perform that well I mean yeah fine but then so if nobody says that right like isn't that  me on like a very technical level it's just to like get more views but I don't
think we've ever seen it with that way and that's why you've always resisted VC funding um so that you can keep dictating what you do and I think what you would probably say you do is like entertaining education about computers and computer hardware and electronics igniting Sparks is the way that I like to is the way that I like to sort of um characterize it it's always fun when you go to like a show or convention or something and you're you're meeting audience members and they tell you about
how like you inspired them or your channel a lot of people tell me that the channel did I'm like yeah Co that makes sense um to like go to school for computer engineering software engineering whatever else it's like oh that's pretty cool yeah it was pretty cool meeting and munition and her being like yeah you like taught me how to build a computer I was like yeah like that's sick that's super cool that stuff super cool um be passionate about your interests and bring us along I mean yeah
maybe that's a maybe that's a mission statement for the channel from run Jun over on float plane I like that that's good good job Ron joh yeah like and you know what we've we've sidetracked some of theu that I'm really passionate about because various reasons it's a lot of work or we're not sure how many people are interested but like maybe I should just say you know what forget it we're making a video about stereoscopic 3D projection in 2024 you've always been on the 3D stuff look okay look
stop you caring you caring that much though in my opinion is a pretty good reason to do it I think here's why it's cool stop what  boy here's why it's cool okay 3D Blu-rays still get released for the yes yes they do what yes you can get like Despicable Me at least three uh hold on let's see Despicable Me for 3D or wait is that one not out yet yeah so you can get you can get the most recent Despicable Me in 3D Despicable Me 4 is probably coming in 3D according to this post on forum. blu-ray.com Despicable
me3 is from like 7 years ago okay okay hold on okay uh blue tyan said in PH chat if the host is interested people are way more likely to be interested um if you are interested in talking to somebody about it it's highly likely they will become IND I do generally agree with that one of the problems is getting people to click on it at all um okay new Blu-ray 3D releases this year a Creature from the Black Lagoon 3D came out in March of 2024 okay 3D Blu-rays are still coming
so there has to be some type of a market because technically some of them are being released yes um nice okay so that's that's something okay okay number two last year so not CES of this year but CES of the previous year we made a video that got buried because of some dispute between Asus and Nvidia over what could or couldn't be disclosed about the laptop let me just put it this way oh so it uh yeah anyway the laptop had a stereoscopic 3D screen on it and it was super super cool it was it was
the first justification that I've ever scene of a 4K screen on a laptop it used ey tracking to um change the perspective of every other eye so that every other line uh was going to the right and every other line was going to the left and it was Glasses free 3D um and it could like steer so you could move your head around and it wouldn't break the 3d effect it was really incredible anyway one of the demos that they were showing was like a middle wear of some sort like some some that you can run that converts
non-stereo 3D games to 3D and so what if you could build like a king tier  2024 okay all right well you know what whatever I'm doing it yeah do it I'm doing it I can already tell you sourcing a 3D compatible screen not easy these days sourcing the polarizing filters not easy these days getting a 3D compatible projector is pretty doable because pretty much any DLP will work pretty well unfortunately not my Epson LS1 12000 I have already tested it and this is going to be at least a two-part series darn it
because so I know I know AJ's in the chat I know today AJ we talked about many many many many things that we need to do but at the top of that list I think you need to make it so that uh flow plane live streaming is 3D compatible so that we can see how much we can make that cost okay and reason number three is that with VR headsets becoming somewhat mainstream is I believe there's going to be a 3D content Resurgence a 3D content Resurgence with iPhones being capable of
recording three I mean excuse me spatial video I think there's actually going to be a lot of content to watch there got him I didn't really get him he's not convinced but it'll be cool it'll be cool and I don't think I don't think we're going to what if we have like some form of like a uh a Time budget for like just passion project content every once in a while I just think it should just all be passion project right let's just do away with the stuff that's like boring yeah and so you know what this is
going to manifest as if a new CPU comes out and we don't care we're just not going to cover it yeah which is going to be I think a bit of an adjustment uh and we've already kind of done it if you think about it it wasn't really on purpose I think you started with gpus yeah Intel's 14th gen oh we just yeah didn't yeah we did a bunch of testing on it and in the long term we would love for the lab's website to have charts and everything so you can like know how it performs or
whatever um but it was pretty obviously just a 13th gen in 14th clothing and we so we did a bunch of testing on it and then it turned out that there was some kind of like micro code update or or the BIOS we were using on the on the particular board we used anyway we had to like retest so then we did that but then it was past the Embargo and then we were like do we even want to bother with this and while we were humming in hawing um we had the new data and then Intel released like some software utility that
like core steers and and improves gaming performance or something which was exclusive to that generation and was not going to go to 13th gen even though there was no architectural reason why they couldn't and then that came out and we were like okay so we're going to have to test this a third time for some boring video that no one cares about and then and then a little while later they made that application available to P gen processors in their own lineup so we would had to like go and retest those
and we were sitting here going does anyone forget it like yeah forget it um so yeah I think I think just a chart on a website is going to be the answer in the longer term and and you'll still see them appear in videos we needed the best CPU at you know 300 watts so or whatever or for like this game or this application or for this particular game and so that's why building a computer into a van again and the little man likes to play this particular game so this station needs to
be good at this yeah that sort of thing so you'll you'll still see it make its way into the content but I think that we're just going to we're going to stay focused on on what we actually want to do like okay I want to do a convection cooled computer cool yeah for the theater room I'd click on that immediately yeah sick so why am I not why are we spending a bunch of like you know Justin's time doing something no one cares about when instead we can like take that idea that someone had on
Reddit of like cooling a GPU with like a giant copper chunk which by the way isn't going to work um but like make a cooler for a GPU that like is like this wide and just takes passive air flow and just convection cools it that would be way better yeah yeah sweet yeah yeah speaking of the lab man it is pretty exciting to see it finally starting to come into its own there was a there was a Reddit thread just appreciating the lab um and the thing is that not everyone is going to agree with
every methodology which is why we have always said guys always said that you want multiple perspectives some people are going to look at our 720p YouTube endurance test and they're going to go well that's not representative and it's like well yeah it's representative of what we want to know which is in a best case scenario which is functionally like idling but you can't turn off any radios you can't turn off the screen everything's in motion uh what is the absolute longest that something could
last that's that's what we want to know so for what we want to know that's a good test but someone else might want to know something else which is why multiple perspectives are so important and why it's not just one single truth especially for can be as varied and complicated as a laptop exactly there so many different reasons why someone might care so this was a really cool thread to see from disaster 84 um Labs is pretty great um so they finally finally made their way over to the page
um and you know I was looking at it going I feel exactly the same way it is super cool to see content starting to regularly appear on the site not because millions of people are reading every one of these but because people are getting really important information we still haven't even technically like full launched the site this power supply um the power supplies that we're testing are alternating so you'll actually notice there's a pattern every other one is from like a like a a major brand and
every other one is from a brand that or or a model that appears to be selling very well based on the external data that we can glean from uh Marketplace websites like Amazon and New Egg and wherever else um so that's why you're seeing half of them be kind of random we have already found three power supplies that failed our testing outright across two different samples so this S one is another example um people are spending $100 on this power supply on NewEgg and Amazon both of them both of our units
failed during our 20° C ocp test if your overcurrent protection isn't working that's a big problem and so seeing the labs already starting to bring this information to people is so exciting to me can you go back to that s power supply yeah I was sitting here just rather surp I don't do product reviewing stuff anymore so I don't know but I I saw all the text under the bad and my eyes sucks so I couldn't read it but you were saying um it failed yeah I thought this was a SE Sonic po SP look
at the logo I know right you said Sama and I was like what yeah it makes more sense to me when you said that but this sketchy 80 plus Platinum looking 10 year warranty 10 warrant warant yeah so they kind of make it look like yeah right they make it look like a seic platinum the logos are like identical but reversed yeah that's that's rough man ridiculous yeah I don't even think it's reversed Casper Explorer goes versus I thought apparently it says Platinum 10 plus yeah whatever that means what oh no
10 year oh I don't no no no I don't know um here let me see what that's rough though yeah here here here here here so they put up they put like a platinum looking thing 10 year warranty next to the 80 plus gold yeah 80 plus gold is good yeah anyway um yeah Casper says I thought s  well uh that's the point that's the point of the lab that's the answer to why we're spending all this time building this thing I don't like that so we're going to we're going to we're going to keep doing it but I think I
want LT to be fun and you can get the bad news in a in a manageable bite-sized way that doesn't have to be what you like sit down on the couch and relax to  yeah yeah oh we're supposed to do some merch messages oh man we've got we've got some exciting stuff to tell you guys about store wise oh I see some of you found it there been some merch messages today neat uh wow wow exclusive lime day is coming uh you guys are going to want to sign up on the store go do it now uh up to 60% off select items every day
July 16th to 19th so that's coming next week guys sign up so you can get first dibs because a lot of these deals are going to be extremely limited quantities and based on how many people are on the newsletter already they're going to sell really really fast so make sure on it anyway we're previewing one of our lime Day deals uh you can see it in our favorites it's exclusive during the broadcast and maybe shortly afterward for early vaud viewers but we're doing a screwdriver bundle where you can get the
full-sized black screwdriver and the full-sized and the stubby sized black screwdriver I don't believe we have ever uh discounted these models before like this um for $30 off so you can go ahead and add that to cart and leave a merch message the way merch messages work and they are the way to interact with the WAN show we don't do super chats or twitch bits or anything like that you just add an item to your cart and you'll see a little box in your cart when we're live and you can
leave a merch message which will pop up down here or it'll go to producer Dan who will reply to it or forward it to someone internally who can answer your question or it'll go to me and Luke to talk about Dan do you want to show these fine folks how merch messages work sure absolutely let's see Dear Miss Sebastian and large friendly bear and bus bar uh sure any plans for water bottle lid with a relief valve so that we can chug with abandon without water spilling it on our 
yet let's see hey DL I started watching your ancient live streams archives and the very first Wan show lus said that sound cards are a must compared to motherboards onboard audio is this true for modern motherboards no nope are those the shortest two consecutive merch message answers we ow another one I have never I never know which way is going to go it's either going to be I I I've given you some that I think you're going to say no to and then you talk for 20 minutes and then
some other ones which I think are going to be bangers and then no I'll tell you what Dan yeah why don't you answer that last one is a sound card a must no doesn't all righty then see you later sh your airpods all I'll say about it is that I miss I miss it mattering yeah man 3D accelerated sound effect it was fun getting like Zonar cards and like I don't know it was cool and you could do things that were neat yeah um I don't know man you can still you can still get pretty into the
Weeds on USB dacks and amps and stuff if and I have a USB Dack if you're you know but like even those have gotten kind of boring like you can get something that's good enough you can get a good enough combo unit for 100 bucks and I feel like a lot of the advancement in The Last 5 Years anyway has been just like chasing new preferred tonalities as a like it's more fashion and less actually trying to achieve accuracy like everything post odac as far as I can tell is just like
or O2 or whatever it was that one that was like yeah this is good enough and it was like $130 or something like that and yes yes in our pursuit of perfection I'm sure there's stuff that's better now but I just don't care I'm still using my like Mayflower O2 yeah like 2013 yeah it works and it's fine "yep okay hey dll I recently hit 1,000" "sorry 100 100,000 subscribers on YouTube" but I'm worried about maintaining long-term success with my Channel or whether I should get a normal job after
I graduate University next year any advice it's I really wonder what they do it's hard um long-term success looks like a lot of different things to a lot "of different people at 100,000 Subs on" YouTube depending on what kind of content you do that is very easily monetizable to the point where you don't have to work another job if you don't want to I shouldn't say easily that is is possible um however what you have to consider is that in order to monetize a YouTube channel you are
effectively adding another job for every way that you intend to do that so people will tell you oh yeah you can sell merch if you just put your logo on a t-shirt that's not going to get you very far if you develop if you develop products and Market them and support them guess what you just started a company essentially right so um you've got to kind of ask yourself what the YouTube channel is to you is it a creative outlet and something that you you want to do for fun is it something that you that you
want to pour your life into you've already done the hardest part the first "100,000 subscribers is by far the" hardest part of what you're doing um but that doesn't mean that because you've done the hardest part you will m Ally have unlimited future success I I talk often about how everyone succumbs to the curve which is the waxing and waning of interest from the audience and sometimes it's you um sometimes you changed sometimes it's them sometimes they change sometimes it's factors beyond any 
um if you if you're in there's also niches like YouTube niches that you "could be in where 100,000 subscribers" will not sustain you because the cpms on it are incredibly low you won't get any sponsors on it etc etc but or there are other ones yeah like Finance YouTube apparently there's been a lot of controversy over there lately oh really I don't know it doesn't really surprise me all the YouTube any any anywhere you're making the kinds of cpms that I see like Finance tubers making whatever
service that is is making so much money that they got to be getting it from somewhere and it's probably the users yeah makes sense yeah that's that's reasonable um but yeah I I my favorite one is engaged enthusiastic professional Niche because when you combine those things that audience is like more likely to do things like external platform funding more likely to do things like merch P merch P purchasing tough day um and and also yeah like become a member of your channel like support your
channel directly so you could stay relatively small and as long as you're giving these people content that help their job or are just interesting to them um that's an audience that is more likely to support you the conversion rates and finances of some of these channels that fit that description are amazing when they're getting you know "around 100,000 subscribers but this is" paying them way more than a full-time job could at that time because because their Niche fits that little category
but never change your Niche to just chase money you have to do the thing that you're interested in and good at yeah I am aware of other verticals that pay far more than tech oh yeah why am I in Tech is that's what we do that's what I do it's like if I wasn't if I wasn't sitting here talking to Luke about what's happened in Tech this week on The W show we'd be hanging out at the office I don't know where would we work where where would we work that we would work together what's our hypothetical company
that we work at together today if it isn't this one huh it's a tough one is it that is actually a tough one have you thought about what you would do if it wasn't this uh well I mean there's there's the like what I would have done like I I I was interested in uh pursuing a career as a teacher until I dropped out of University and therefore that was not an option anymore so you you'd be in like you'd be like product management maybe I think that I could have gotten into into
a non um like noncertified teaching role of some I shouldn't say non-certified I mean like I have my certification to teach swimming lessons like I is that what you would have wanted to do at that point in time though um because that a thing you would would have been interested in pursuing in 2014 well the thing is we have to pick something that I'm interested in pursuing that isn't Tech and so the only thing I I lived and breathed oh wait so it can't be Tech at all I thought I thought it meant Tech
YouTube no no no no no it's not Tech then there's like no way like we're at some non-tech company like talking about the devel we're we're we're around the water cooler at some place I don't know I could easily still be I could easily still be at the pool maybe I'd be a supervisor maybe I maybe I would train lifeguards I I I could I could have seen myself be kind of Co just continuing cuz I think you would have liked that to I'm always looking to to move up and it was clear that they needed some help I
remember I remember doing my WSI training and having not have done that together having the um so WSI is water safety instructor so I was learning to be a swimming lessons instructor and I got into an argument with the not just the instructor of our course for some reason the one who teaches people to teach WSI was teaching us because she was being shadowed by a bunch of new WSI instructors so we had like the head honcho of like training WSI and I got into an argument with her because um she
she was saying cuz we did like a like this sounds so on brand so she did a demo for us that was intended to demonstrate how shocking it can be to uh be thrown into um an unfamiliar environment even if you functionally know how to deal with it and and the example was um ice water right which can cause you to forget to breathe uh it can cause uh muscle muscle tenseness and cramps um it can it can cause some real challenges if it's not something that you're ready for and you know it was
part of like a conversation on just like being ready for anything when you're uh and teaching people to kind of be ready for unfamiliar situations and um uh so she had us like plunge our our our our arms I think just like into ice water and um and she was like yeah and because of the ice um you know it's it's even colder than 0° and I was like um actually it's exactly 0 de and she was like no it's lower there's ice in it and I was like look I don't want to like I don't want to be that guy but I'm
in grade 10 science and it's definitely exactly 0 de and she basically like shut me down in front of the whole class and was like you're stupid and don't interrupt me when I am explaining important scientific Concepts and uh hey thanks Deanna um good job that's actually not how that works it was exactly 0 degrees but anyway the point is that I um it's it's not Sal water guys yeah no guys it was relaxed it was it was fresh water okay yeah um anyway the the point is that I I could have seen myself you know
after having an experience like that wanting to move up the ranks and like improve the quality of training so that it has accurate information extremely onraed like that wasn't that wasn't the that wasn't the only dumb thing um yeah oh my God G freak1 okay do you do you guys need a science class okay what is your consistency of brine remember they're  guys once it has reached equilibrium okay when there is a when there is a phase change okay until the until the substance has completely changed phase
and we're talking about water specifically in this case I'm not talking plasma or anything complicated okay we are talking gaseous solid uh liquid phase changes Okay so going between a solid and a liquid as it melts from solid to liquid it it is it is that that liquid is at a constant temperature and it is not until all the solid has become liquid that it can begin rising in temperature again I forget exactly the technical term for it but if you have a bucket of ice water it is at
zeroing degrees barring any salt or impurities or whatever the case may be yes the core of that ice cube could be lower than 0° and at the very surface of that water or at a point where you're touching the side of the bucket the water molecules nearest that could be a little higher than 0 de but by and large that heterogeneous mixture of water and ice is 0° if you don't think so it sucks to suck go test it yeah yeah you can fun little science experiment all right yeah jeez guys heterog genius
Elijah man I'm reminded of that awful video that we did where we tried to explain that when your CPU is running at a lower temperature that does not mean that your computer is kicking out less heat and just like how angry people were half of people were angry that I was explaining something that was so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] obvious and the other half were angry that I was saying that a lower temperature CPU means that it's the same amount of heat cuz they didn't understand  hard yeah 
cool now it's time to do the ton of feathers versus ton of Steel one yeah yeah exactly I fell for that one when I was in high school my Dad pulled that one on me he goes what's heavier a pound of feathers or a pound of bricks and I go pound of feathers or pound of bricks rather and he's like no they're both the pound dirt and I was like um uh but the air resist the packaging required to keep the feathers on the scale yeah exactly resulted in it weighing more lus hates hot dogs yeah exactly uh what are
we supposed to be doing oh right we did a couple of merch messages oh that would mean the fs are less yeah it doesn't it doesn't matter the scale says a pound and there's packaging around it oh my God it doesn't matter uh you got to about six minutes till sponsors you could do another quick toic to you Del M says the the best answer to that is the feathers because you have to live with the weight of what you did to all of those birds I think I've heard that before  brick no no no no no no no as a bird
lover he's very uncomfortable or not leave the bird alone you dunk them in the negative 1  water what if the water in the bucket was outside though you can have you can have negative 1° water yeah have you seen those uh those like bottles of water in the freezer that you bring out and then they freeze as soon as you disturb them yeah yeah typical engineering mindset answer tinan goes um that would be a horrible way to get feathers from a bird very inefficient have you have you not seen the the yeah
that's the problem tinan that's the problem with that well they have those  things no like like legitimately is that a thing yeah you get you get the feathers off of it wow it comes full circle yeah all right cool uh what are we oh yeah I wanted to talk about some pretty ex water bucket tumbling thing I wanted to talk about exciting things um okay uh lime days oh I oh appar Game Pass increase is that a exciting thing uh apparently have a couple more deals to preview oh uh 3D down jacket is going
to have a great deal during lime day we're also going to have an amazing bundle deal featuring the circuit desk pad uh right when lime day starts on Tuesday at 9:00 a.m. Pacific time you are not going to want to miss this one so if you're watching W show now you have a heads up it's going to be limited quantity so be ready the deals are going to rotate every day though so make sure you check back every day during the event um and sign up to be notified um oh Dan's going to put the QR code so you
guys can sign up to be notified okay the last thing is uh we have been working I have my mic muted I just make those sounds okay I said Boop Oh I thought everybody heard it so I didn't know don't laugh don't laugh at  mean so lime day don't miss it okay hold on hold on don't don't move the graphic don't move the graphic when they come back I want them to see the thing oh w guys are still up there in the corner  bit well cats out of the bag now there you go or should I say under the brick
did anyone see it they might not have seen it cat under the brick oh jeez I said under the Bri that's worse I thought that was an old but still checks out reference but all right I guess we have been working Dan you can cut to us on an anti-static PC Building mat for the past year in collaboration with Mod write the creators of the original and patented modm our goal was to provide a safe anti-static work surface um you know like the kind that everyone tells you you're supposed to
use but as a price that doesn't take away too much from your PC Building budget so with that being said we are going to be selling the LTT modmat for $59.99 it's 4T long by 2T wide so plenty of room for whatever you're working on it has visual references here um actually should we go let's go Linus Cam For A Change Is this a final version no do you want me to hold it up for you uh maybe uh okay uh tons of useful charts and info it also looks super cool here we're just going to go to the wide cam CU this
thing is enormous it's dual layered so the top layer is dissipative providing electrical isolation between any two points on the mat the bottom layer is more conductive allowing for dissipation to the Common Ground point which one right there and one in the top right it is heat resistant so bending tubes will be no problem here above it and it has a textured surface that prevents screws from sliding around while being easy to clean uh it has an anti-slip bottom but actually I want to back up and say easy
to clean again because this is one of the big big uh Innovations uh Luke go ahead and have a seat and Dan do you want to move the Luke cam to point at the table next to him where his headphones are um compared to competing products uh we are extremely proud of what we've managed to do with ease of cleaning and Luke's going to do a live demo which never goes badly on the W show where he is going to spill thermal paste on the modmat okay and successfully clean it up so Dan's going to aim at the table down
there and you're just going to kind of move your stuff get your get your stuff the heck out of the way uh there's there's a few changes um that we're going to be making to it so is this a final version though no we're adding some more elaboration to the screw guide that's something that a lot of people ask about it's like what screw do I use for this or for that so we've got little visual representations of all of them as well as what they're most commonly used for we've got thermal paste um stuff uh
layouts uh since since we did this one the ram guide that you guys are looking at that's right by my hand uh we you've already got the version that has LP Cam and cam 2 on it but we've added um separate ones for ECC oh NE for dims and so dims along with color coding where all the notches are we've got all the different m.2 sizes different radiator sizes different fan sizes uh the fan dots see there like the little guide for where you put it down those are colorcoded so that it's really clear
that you're lined up with the right ones on the new one we also have a fan thickness chart now that they aren't all 25 mm thick yes yes we've got the ethernet pinotes right I double checked that personally no I was looking at the texture um you can see it better in the in the like colorful printed Dan are you uh are you in position yeah okay where your finger is right there so Luke I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to make a mess you're going to glob it I'm going to make a mess oh boy do I get
isopropyl or something how am I supposed to clean this oh wow so you just you just missed oh wow I was going to say you just missed the CPU completely but then you also just rubbed it in there you go buddy have you guys done this um I haven't I can't believe you've done this okay actually can I have that cloth for a sec sure my finger has a lot of thermal compound on it now and I would like to type on my laptop here you go all right should I punch in a bit more sure maybe digitally yeah sure let's see
what I can do about that uh oh I see why Titan's in the chat today testing these was fun to be honest um yeah tinan tinan has done a lot of work on this project Tatiana uh did a lot of work determining exactly exactly uh the perfectest most bestest of materials uh for us to use I am uh I'm actually really really excited about this product it's finally an affordable whoops wrong one lot Cam that was so close I sorry sorry there you go okay you got to not switch it right sorry sorry sorry sorry well I was
trying to switch it to the one right as you were going for the first wipe I was on the wi okay go for it I guess away  camera yeah you're going to have to like you're going to have to work at it there's a lot there  this you better be able to clean it it might need more ISO yeah says you might need some more ISO I put a lot on yeah that was a you really messed up you dropped like a thread Ripper upside down look guys this wouldn't be this wouldn't be a live when show demo if I didn't make it like
way harder far worse than it had to be  it so we finalized the graphics probably let me think um two days ago I I went through and I did the last revision of um changes to I I think I found something that was not an error but a little bit hard to understand on the fan pin outs um and then revised some of the wording on the screw thread guide um we had to order a ddr5 uh ECC sodium or something like that I forget which one it was but there was something that we had to order uh in
order to like validate that the measurements were exactly perfect and then other than that I think we're we're in pretty good shape you you know you need to wipe that while it's wet right yeah yeah yeah yeah okay I mean you're like you let the whole thing evaporate before you even scrubbed it well you just do it why don't you do it why don't you do it properly you ever think of that no no it's it's dry you're just you're you're dry dry scrubbing yeah there you go okay that's a 
Luke I think I have like there was so much thermal paste and I'm having a hard time getting like even clean parts of this CL at this point oh man all right I think it's mostly gone though all right so guess what this is the part where I make make it even worse you know you know what's a real [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]   goodness well I've got some more isopropyl uh I don't even know if ISO is your best bet uh tinan would you even recommend ISO for liquid metal you try to wipe it straight off uh tinan says
the liquid metal is a pain in the butt I'm not going to put that much on this time nice I'm not going to put that much on I'm just going to put a little bit because realistically if you spilled liquid metal a lot of the time you would probably throw the the the needle back onto the syringe and try and try and suction it back up yeah which I have done on a number of occasions yeah all right here we go here we go here we go now if there was liquid metal in the bucket could the water have been
below Z degrees all right all   sorry well here I'll okay then I'll suck  can okay but like it you know it got on there and stuff so you know a when it was still a ball all there you go buddy so you guys are saying no no isopropyl for the liquid metal uh what did what did tinan say tinan knows tinan knows best what did tinan say he apparently said nothing meanwhile Elijah is talking about bathing in liquid metal good Lord I used IPA before isopropyl  right well here we go good luck Luke
what if I let it dry again no pressure but you know gigantic order for this is all hinging on your performance here oh cleaning the liquid metal off oh no that was too easy well here you can't you got to show to the camera I like think I got it uh oh all right oh there's a little dot left oh got it okay well that wasn't very much fun here's more wait wait wait wait wait let's verify verify oh no no there it's still on there no you're going to have to keep going he still got liquid metal got him
I started trying to wipe it and then there was like oh you should have got a lwig swipe bedet then I wonder if I just wiped poorly and wiped it back on that's a real possibility when you have that much thermal goop on your uh on your rag oh no I switch CLS oh did you do we have more than one yeah that's  smart I think we're good now though okay now what people are asking is okay but what about the print and this is where this is where I'm actually really impressed with um I've been wiping over
the print this whole time with the with the quality of this product check this out yeah lift it up a little bit more I'm trying to get like the good angle yeah I want them to see it cuz this this is I just wiped over this one right now quite a bit Yeah lift it up a bit more though like the yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah right there oh down there you go so yes that's where I've been actively cleaning if you're dedicated enough you can you can cause a little bit of damage to the print but it's
pretty impressive it can uh what it canst I think there's a little bit here there's a little bit yep oh it's also like scrubbing really hard y I know but but that's I mean we got to have realistic expectations it's still it's still printed um the liquid metal came off really easy yeah very the liquid metal honestly came off easier than the first amount of thermal paste but the first amount of thermal past was a lot very excited for this product uh it also lies flat really well uh we have to ship 
packaging oh yeah created by of course the one and only Sarah butt I assume I actually don't know that she worked on this packaging but I'm pretty sure she did because it looks really good so she either did it or um it was someone working with her under her uh supervision cuz it looks freaking awesome um comes apart like this automatic win don't all the designers do that woo do what work under her supervision um I think so yeah well I don't know if Lloyd technically does like he's he's
technically more senior than Sarah but they collaborate they work with each other I mean we're we're collaborative they're going to ship the other way so with the graphics inside but it still unrolls really well which was something that was really important to us because it's a major paino uh with other anti-static work surfaces oh the packaging was Gary wow he did a great job great looks really sharp Sarah almost certainly gave input because Gary definitely um Works under
under Sarah by the way looks fantastic shout out Shout Out Gary keeping our team in it at softball night the other night oh yeah yeah I uh Gary Gary's gonna be my first pick next time I'm uh next time I'm team captain I'm I'm I'm pretty I'm pretty impressed he's uh he's a player goes hard like I love it I respect it respect it El's offended Elijah's offended why not you I don't know Elijah maybe because you got two outs on your own team last time so we play we play kind of a
different format um how do you do that I I will explain I'll explain uh we play we play an unusual format where you pitch to your own team oh okay okay okay but we don't do we don't do strikes and balls or anything like that like it's a super friendly casual format where everyone on each side gets to bat you have a designated pitcher who basically just like tosses it to you but everybody gets only two pitches that's it it doesn't matter how good they were or how bad they were so it's in the interest of the
pitcher to pitch the easiest possible lob and it's in the interest of the batter to swing at every ball because you get only two pitches no that's it um so what's cool about the format is in a in it gives everybody an opportunity to bat every single inning it keeps things moving pretty quickly and you get a ton of offense so people aren't just like standing out bored in the in the field right um so anyway one of the sort of idiosyncrasies of this format which Chewy was the one who introduced me to
is that you have two pitchers on the mound because one person on the team of who's batting is throwing the ball but somebody still has to play the field position of pitcher in case somebody bunts or or kind of flubs it and it's too far from the catcher yeah so one of the rules then is that if the pitcher who's not playing defense right if the pitcher interferes with the ball the batter's out twice twice Elijah interfered with the ball and got his batter out over the course of a 4 inning game
however however In fairness to Elijah Sarah who was pitching for our team uh and throw in some Scorchers it turns out she has some softball experience um Sarah who was pitching for our team not only got one of our batters out she caught the ball like didn't just like get hit by it or whatever like Elijah got hit in the ankle by one of them or something like that Sarah like was like and caught it and we're like Sarah that's pretty good the reflexes were too strong I went and played once and I
actually really liked playing the neutral pitcher it was fun because like if you play it in a true way you are playing for the team that is batting and then the second the bat connects with the ball you're playing for the team in the field yeah that's wild so it was like kind of fun like really wanting them to hit it then the second they hit it you're like a I got to get it got to get them out well it's more fun to get them out if they hit it yeah exactly H oh no oh no oh shoot I didn't realize Chewy was
watching he's all upset that he's not first pick chewy you're good too but your batting's been kind of inconsistent lately I mine has two next Community review toxic I'm own that no I'm I'm own that oh dude dude dude no like I I I'm a pretty toxic competitor as you know yeah um I literally almost killed sherro from the sales team yep um y I was there you were there for that's right you were there for that so In fairness to me it was a good throw it was a great throw does the
quality of the throw Scale based on the person you're throwing it at like if you threw that at a four-year-old would it be a good throw are you calling sherat a four-year-old  Luke oh that's a not everyone's going to get that reference but that was pretty good the play was to home Okay In fairness to me it was a laser beam of a throw right at his chest yeah he's not a super experienced baseball player so his Instinct was to catch it with his throwing hand which did not have a glove on
it I think he did actually catch it though right uh no I think he dropped it he like like got it a lot but I think he actually didn't make the play ultimately um but it's a miracle that I didn't break his hand yes yeah anyway I I just I get I get amped up and I you know I was I was throwing for the out what can I say I can say about our sponsor uh yeah let's do sponsors thanks Dan uh the show is brought to you today by manscaped while you are keeping your Hedges trimmed beautifully in your

take care of plants few up with your daily nutrition okay sorry I'm going to have to do an aside here for a second hold on sorry Dan sorry Dan we're going back to the wide cam uh for my wedding my gift from my mother um was a uh I don't know it's a fig tree I think it is I think it's a fig tree anyway the point is it wasn't really one fig tree it was kind of two fig trees and what she had done is as they were young she had Twisted them together so that they grow together like this um when she and of
course it was you know like the two lives intertwined kind of thing right okay um yes that was my wedding gift for my parents a plant but that's a whole separate conversation the point is that when we received it it was about this tall and was kind of like twisted up and she was like oh yeah from the ground or the desk from from a pot pot that's like this that's on the desk yeah it's the it's the one that's by the kitchen table you know the one right talking for them oh got it got it but you know the one
okay so it was it was about it was about this tall maybe this tall and um now here we are um Ivon and I are I believe 13 Lucky 13 years into our marriage and it's about this tall every time I remember her telling us oh yeah as it continues to grow you should continue to twist it and uh every time she comes over I think she points out that it uh for it to keep growing uh we would have to water it and put it in a bigger pot yeah and every time I go yep oh yeah you know you could use your fancy home
automation thing to water that automatically sure could yeah just saying I like it the size it is I like it the brownish greenish color that it is I am not good at taking care of plants dang y'all been married a long time tell me about it poor Ivon my Grandpa gave me this aloe vera plant um like forever ago I can't I can't even remember when he got for me but it's it's ancient like it sat on the window sill above where my computer desk was when I lived in the split one half of
the basement Suite in the old office nice so like I had this with me in 2013 um and it's an aloe vera plant so they you know you don't need to water them that often uh that contributed to the already what you would probably expect is not amazing care that I would give a house plant y um by being like I probably don't need a water it's an Al plant it's fine uh so I would just like ignore it for huge periods of time and then somebody it genuinely wasn't me put like a box or
something in front of it uhhuh so it was now gone to me forever so I left it for a long time still lived somehow don't know how um it it has since gone through like a bunch of things that you would think it would not survive through and it just has survived through everything it even like I don't know what it's called but it created another one of itself but the original one didn't off so there's like two of them now and they're still both alive perfect it's crazy it's very like kind of thin you
heard it here first guys uh if you're a Luke aloe vera is the plant for you yeah pretty much yeah any who let's tell you about ag1 fill up your daily Nutri fuel up your daily nutrition with our sponsor ag1 all you need is one scoop a day and unlike other supplements that just cherry pick research on specific ingredients ag1 has solid backing from multiple studies on its whole formula these studies were done by Third parties in double blind environments as well as being Placebo controlled the results of
the studies are on their website so you can see the potential benefits of adding ag1 to your morning routine a few members of the lmg team have tried or even drink ag1 daily and if you try ag1 you will get a free one-year supply of vitamin D3 K2 and five free ag1 travel packs with your first purchase at drink a1.com wow the show is also brought to you by seic do you want a free PC too no how about you want to buy one with our sponsor cic who wrote this nonsense cic's Prime TX 1000 wat power supply
won't break a sweat in some of the most demanding gaming setups your power bill isn't getting any cheaper but thankfully the tx1000 has an 80 plus titanium rating which means less energy goes to waste that could even translate to a few extra bucks off your energy bill cic's power supplies are quiet and built to last and backed up with a 12year warranty let's go at least this particular model is actually I think they bumped them all okay I don't know the point is it's a better time than
ever to grab one of their power supplies as seic has been running several sales throughout the year so if you're building a new system and looking for a power supply you can rely on you can trust seic learn more about them at  into being a retail brand I remember when they did that and I was very happy cuz now I didn't have to Google which power supply on the Shelf was a SE save you the trouble like oh okay cool the one that says C Sonic on the front yeah is helpful all right what are
we supposed to be doing Dan oh I got some merch messages for you all right hit me can't wait to use these MCM stuff but I wanted to ask what that fluid was you guys were going to use for that submerged PC you were thinking of doing a few months back shoot I forget the one that we researched whether it was compatible with birds or not oh I don't remember the name of it I'm so sorry I don't remember um there's a bunch that are very good yeah there's actually a ton of options the only thing wrong with 
expensive I'm going to do a quick search in the email that I'm definitely not logged into and then uh if I don't find it then um then we don't have it Novac line yeah no I don't know I I don't know Noki might know yeah that's noac sounds right yeah noac sounds right cuz I think it's the like the old school one I don't think it's the one we talked about most recently I'm just not sure Elijah might know he has like an encyclopedic knowledge of every video we've ever done
it's funny people used to go to me when they like he doesn't know weren't sure oh he doesn't know all right never mind forget it okay we can move on sure getting ready for lime day Li is my wife wants to know what skincare mask you got done for yourself she thinks the results look pretty good keep up the good work hey hey hey hey hey hey whoo Irene said really good not pretty good Dan editorializing what's going on with that they uh they move around a little bit uhhuh sure have you not did you not
see that on your screens uh the one that I did was more PS 8 um  I not everyone that I've talked to who has tried it has been super pleased with it so your mileage may vary but yeah I'm  results and how about one more hey good merch # long shirts win for Luke aside from NASA and the like if you could do a video series on anything what would it be also hi VOD me I have an answer like for Luke and it'll be better than the answer Luke comes up with don't me toed I can type mine out and I you go
first or do you want to do it the other way around you're going to type yours  on I really wonder what his is the frustrating part is it is probably  do I just start going while you're still typing sure uh I I think I would enjoy doing like a micro style jobs series but it it wouldn't necessarily have to be like dirty jobs in particular I wouldn't be against doing that but it wouldn't have to be that but I I've always like when I go on vacation these days my favorite thing has been
to do stuff I don't want to explore cities I like doing stuff and uh there has been scenarios where I've had an opportunity to effectively like do someone's job with them for a couple days and that's actually been really cool so that' be fun okay I got a better series all right what is it uh Luke gets a detached home and does like a house tech Improvement series but it's like kind of janky budget stuff like they wait didn't they say it what Murphy style fold out gaming setups for lands
and stuff like that well that'd be pretty sick they're both good they both had good answers someone said micros Andy worker I don't know anything about the dude this is not a like man you can't do the like someone mentioned a thing and they are endorsing the thing thing on the internet I hate that cuz like I I haven't deeply researched every single thing I'm ever going to talk about I just mean the show I've watched it like twice I I don't know anyways um didn't didn't they say it was
supposed to not be Tech or whatever Oh I thought it was what did they say anything it could be about anything I win oh I just assumed it wasn't like what we literally do as a job oh all right anyway I think I think I think it would be a cool concept to do Tech improvements to Luke's new house where Luke actually has to like pay for what it is but what we contribute is like the labor oh that would actually be pretty l so that so that everything that we do has to be practical and
useful but it'll be done on a Luke budget that so I get to like basically troll you guys that would be sick that  probably very excited I don't know let's do one more here okay um what might be the most atrocious Tech that you see being used consistently on a day-to-day  exist oh man I feel like the troll response is like consoles but I like should not exist I can't think of too many things that shouldn't exist I mean I'm a I'm a firm believer that well okay not entirely but for the
most part I I believe that there's no such thing as a bad product just a bad price right like that at the right price anything can make sense um I mean I I hate seeing you know any device that ships with you know an out ofd insecure operating system on it so you know a lot of the a lot of like really cheap Android devices that are running ancient versions of Android I I that very much is used on a daily basis by many people and you mean like non- upgradable to a safe version yeah exactly so things like
uh we we did a whole video on those sketchy um like Android TV boxes and stuff like that that are running ancient versions of Android that probably have back doors and all kinds of phone home behaviors in them and people buy them because they want to watch pirated streams and stuff like that but what are they giving up we we don't even really know yeah yeah I was going to say computers thanks Dan they're evil really helpful you should probably find a different line of work if you don't want
to deal with computers evil I've spent my whole life trying to contain them hey um speaking of spending your whole life I've got an exciting project for us um one of the things one of the things that died during the flood of my server rack wait did I already talk about this last week uh did I talk about the eBay ups I don't think so no okay you talked about the story of the the thing dying so I shot the video this week with my my son actually was a helper uh tearing down and checking the
various systems for corrosion and I'm not going to spoil too much of the video other than to say that it's going to blow your mind and it raises more questions than it answers so make sure you watch it um but one of the things that died is the UPS at the bottom of the rack it's a 9x P5 something I don't "know it's some eaten 5,000 watt um" ups and I went on eBay to find out how much those are worth um because I hadn't looked at it in a while and I forgot yeah cool five grand that is unless you
can find a ship damaged one that got the absolute kicked out of it from some like you going to swap the chassis or something discount discount server equipment place and you make them a lowball offer  $300 what and then you use your good chassis yeah and you put nonwater damaged boards in it so Dan Do you want to build a UPS with me heck yeah let's do it all right that sounds a lot of fun yeah D Dan has so much work to do I'm going to save "$4,300 or" "$4,700 this does this does sound uh"
worthy of Dan time stay of the path says sounds dangerous AF why do you think I want Dan to help me that man he's going to make sure the Caps don't discharge themselves into my eyeballs I'll wear a red shirt it'll be fine oh no um don't do that Luke we could use this this is a um like an exercise in figuring out the entire process oh yeah Dan could participate look at this guy I don't even have to do task he does it himself double work double work more efficiency yes boss could I
have more work please please sir no you have to finish your first war before you  lick oh no oh no um you already missed the part where I sent a random email to James in the middle of the night pitching the video so you'll have to put that on your flowchart any oh God yeah okay will that come up in the writers meeting on Monday no is that when it would come up writers meetings are on Friday and are the reason I was late for w show today on Monday there one on Monday I don't know
what happens on Monday I work from home on Mondays isn't there one on Monday I don't know am I wrong Dan you move it from Monday to Friday I don't know maybe I'm just bugging you I no I I probably just don't know I I think at some point writer's meeting was on Mondays I think okay yeah I don't know Elijah would actually probably know better than me that meeting at the start of the chart do you know when that is nope okay uh I just know that it's the the first part okay yeah I if it happens on Friday
basic what I'm saying is would it wait to come up in that meeting um you've already made a Trello card for it maybe not necessarily if I'm just like this is green lit because procurement is buying this now there there should be a path for that actually because we we actually do want that to be able to be a thing because that will increase agility good you want to be able on the floor over there oh yeah I'm not saying necessarily do it now Crystal dou work I'm going to forget Crystal D work
during when says writers meetings have typically been Mondays who the devil are you I don't who is it Crystal d Fier 88 if you work here you need to reach out and get your account um badged so that people can yes know that um anyway on the subject of shooting with my son for that video which was a lot of fun um viewers and actually people internally have noticed and and commented to me about uh you know what's with Linus's kids being in the videos more recently um uh they
were all in the gaming minivan video and then my son was in the flooded server video um and someone on someone on staff asked me Point Blank like are you are you priming them to take over the family business is little man becoming big man yeah I um and the I I don't know it was an interesting question one that I have thought about in the past but honestly haven't really thought about in a while since they hadn't seemed that interested for a pretty long period yeah and the
answer is no uh I'm not a believer in um in the the Merit of nepotism uh I don't think that it is a particularly valuable thing what if one of them applied well then I would expect us to give them a fair shot like we would any other applicant um isn't that against the handbook is what against the handbook hiring family members oh that's interesting I think it's a team thing it might be it might be related yeah I know there's a lot of like a different department cares what what would your
would you be on the should be an accountant that' be fun I have no idea what team are you on are you on all of the teams I don't know I don't know I think I just sit on an island I think company structure-wise you're on an island yeah so I don't think I'm on any team yeah okay well so then I guess I don't count yeah I think I don't I don't know Technic I think technically like company structure treewise that is legitimate um you couldn't hire him to be a sea level that would be on your tree cuz
that's your like Department uh no I don't think it is I don't think any of the sea levels report to me they all report to yeah but you're in the other if you were on the writing team other writers might not report into you but you're on that team so what he's saying is you're on like the staff team I don't that might actually be legit no I think he's above everybody right cuz every Department reports but this this gets into the weird part of like is he two people yeah am I two people yeah cuz
he's the owner and he's one of the employes I report to Taran but Taran reports to ownership yeah anyway I don't know the point is don't know that um they have expressed a little bit more interest lately and it was super fun working on you know explaining um you know potential theories for how galvanic corrosion might occur in a closed loop where there's no obvious mixed Metals um it was cool kind of walking through the troubleshooting steps and um one of the things that people a lot of people
noticed on the minivan video was that kids um especially inquisitive ones open up opportunities for conversations that aren't always there if you don't have someone inexperienced who's who's who's there to ask the question it's funny because this is something that I've known for a long time I remember talking to um Seth C back when we did that build where I walked him through how to build a PC and and what I what I told him I don't remember if it was in the video or if it
was after the video but what I told him was I thought it was so cool that he was willing to be as someone with the kind of profile that he has right uh where anything he says or does can be misconstrued I told him I thought it was so cool that as someone with the profile that he has he was willing to put himself out there do something he has no experience with something ask stupid questions that other people are afraid to ask for fear of looking or sounding dumb and then absorb and learn and and
push himself to do it like um I remember it taking a lot longer or looked like it was going to take a lot longer than we had budgeted because he insisted on doing uh the AO mounting himself even though the whole thing was like like he was very protected on his side by I think as Sue sponsored it back then and they were like ready to LEAP in and do it for him if to make sure the product didn't look too bad or whatever right um but he like insisted on doing it himself and I just I thought that was
really cool because um a lot of people look up like it or not a lot of people look up to athletes as role models and I thought that he was modeling a really cool uh a cool really cool approach totally um but one of the things that was great for me co-hosting that video was that him asking questions gave me a reason to answer them it gave me an excuse to talk about things that I wouldn't have if I was just standing there by myself building a computer and the kids do a really good job of that
because they're naturally inquisitive they want to know what things are they want to know how they work and they give me a reason to talk about stuff that otherwise a really longtime viewer might kind of sit and go okay why is he explaining what an LTE Puck is right well I'm explaining because not everybody knows and it's a way to without irritating those people who already know what it is address the questions that realistically a lot of like kind of flyby viewers who aren't
immersed in this stuff are going to be thinking but not even realizing or not not not being willing to or being afraid to ask or um you know not wanting to deal with going and looking it up and ultimately finding the content less accessible so it's it's a really natural to De jargony things uh with that said there are challenges um shooting with the girls on the mini van video they're still a little young to be legitimately useful and helpful in anything um and you know my son to a degree is not as
autonomous as you know an adult would be like obviously I mostly work with grown-ups and you get kind of accustomed to okay go figure that out and they do because they're grown-ups um but it it's been kind of have you figured out sorry no go ahead have you figured out the like compensation stuff yeah oh yeah we we we pay the minimum wage we perfectly honest with you um but we pay them for the hours that they work and they're kids like realistically they're going to spend it on stupid bobles anyway so it
doesn't really matter like honestly my oh my daughter's we went to a glass blowing studio for an activity when we were down in Great Wolf Lodge and my daughters each spent like $45 on little glass mushrooms and I basically basically I we we believe in making mistakes on your own and so I pretty much sat them down I gave them a talk each individually um and I basically well individually because one of them did it in the first place and then we left and got lunch and the other one
wanted to go back and get one of the exact same thing probably just cuz her sister did it so little kid things right and adults um so I basically sat each one of them down and I gave them kind of a talk that went it's your money you have been given it in birthdays and red pocket and uh by working on videos very occasionally uh for doing chores it's a lot of money I explained about the exchange rate and how our dollars are not worth as much as American dollars I um talked through sort of how long it
takes to earn this much money versus how quickly we can spend it and you know what the Fulfillment we might get out of spending this money on this particular thing might be versus some other things that we could spend our money on and if that's um and if that's a sacrifice that we want to make because conceptually money doesn't mean anything to a little kid in you know single digits age bracket right um however I believe in it being your money not my money so if that's what you want to spend it on then
I I will facilitate that for you cuz they don't carry around bank cards so I have to do the a transaction and then just transfer it um so if if that's really what you want I'm not going to tell you no but what I will hope is that you will reflect on this purchase at some point once you see how much you do or don't make use of this glass mushroom um and you will that will impact your decision- making in the future one way or another was essentially the the kind of the conversation that I had with the with
the girls one of them hasn't even made it off of the an island since we unpacked from getting home um and I forget where I was going with this right right right so they're probably just going to waste it uh my son's actually a saver he doesn't he's like super not materialistic I don't he doesn't really spend money on anything so I don't know what his motivation is yeah his motivation is being based okay all right so he is Luke says Lieutenant  Elijah he should buy fortnite skins SLS
he actually was gifted um v-bucks that's what they're called right v-bucks he was he was gifted a v-bucks card um for a for a for a birthday or something at some point in the last year or so and I kind of talked to him about it I went okay so we know we don't buy v-bucks but if someone gives them to us like yeah I guess you can spend them if you want but did you ask for v-bucks for your birthday he goes no I didn't I go okay um and he goes also I tried to see if I could get a gift receipt but I couldn't
cuz gift cards I'm sure I'm sure someone somewhere has figured out a technique for trying to read what's on it and try to return it or whatever maybe it's impossible I don't know but um he did fully understand that v-bucks are stupid but he did spend like $50 worth of v-bucks because he couldn't yeah I know he couldn't return it and he didn't ask for it I'm like okay sure went up  sure ow oh my back is dead okay what are we supposed to be talking about Luke you want to pick a topic uh
sure this show even been about so far P I'm not sure I don't know all right Xbox game pass Oh Lordy Microsoft has announced both a price increase and a new tier structure for Xbox game pass alongside a uh okay alongside a $3 increase to Game Pass ultimate from $17 to $20 Microsoft has also removed day one access from game passes base tier now called standard really so right after announcing that all of those games they just had a huge event let's not forget this they just had a huge event very
recently within the last few weeks I think where they announced every single game that was announced in that event was like day one game pass and then they take it away got him that's that's a  yikes hold on and that's not even okay so they removed day one game pass from game pass's base tier called standard but standard isn't even the lowest tier anymore just keep going it's a mess dude just keep going just keep going that's rough uh Game Pass core's annual price will increase from $60 to
$75 um that also doesn't have day one access um though it cost Remains the Same for users who pay month to month don't forget that game pass core is not Game Pass standard and doesn't include the Game Pass catalog of games wait what does it do then Game Pass core is a limited catalog of 25 plus games member deals and discounts and online multiplayer online multiplayer okay got it um sheesh Gamers will no longer be able to use reward points to fund subscriptions I didn't know that was a thing I don't
know how you get Reward Points moving on uh in other reporting Xbox console sales are down 31% year toye according to the verge Xbox cloud gaming is only a few months away from allowing Gamers to stream their entire Xbox libraries uh you missed a Game Pass tier there's PC game pass for $1.99 a month which does not have online console multiplayer included because it's just included because of course it is it's just like game multiplayer like why do you need a subscription for that um it does not
have a limited catalog of 25 plus games on Console but it does have the PC library of The Game Pass catalog of of hundreds of games and day one game editions also my uh I Oh I thought there was a fifth one is isn't there also a fifth one you guys I had come across an article that was like yeah no there's there's like one more tier that has games on the console but doesn't include multiplayer so you would have to buy the console multiplayer game pass core separately can you get a refund cuz what
if what if you what if you watched that keynote watch them announce every single game is on Game Pass day one and then the tier that you're on just got Dame one gay pass removed from it I don't know that's this is great though goo ninja says I would be devastated if I cared Le seriously though Game Pass has been a good value in the past the price going up a bit does not change that it's still a pretty darn good value uh Game Pass core is looking like a terrible value and I guess that's part of the
point of all this yeah that's essentially they're trying to push everyone to Game Pass standard which includes online multiplayer which to me is kind of a basic of owning a game console I guess so basically how they afford to sell you a cheap computer I think they're trying to push people to Ultimate because standard won't have Day One games yeah I guess that's true so they're trying to push they're trying to make Game Pass core basically trash they're trying to make Game Pass
standard frustrating frustrating because everyone that you know your friends is playing a different game because they have day one access and then Game Pass ultimate is for $20 a month good Lord $240 a year is there a yearly plan play on Xbox it doesn't actually say it says yearly plan for core and then it doesn't say a yearly plan for any of the other ones oh no apparently they're closing the 360 store too man this is wild this is wild you know what unsubscribe to Game Pass subscribe to flow plane PC
game pass still gets Day One games for $12 oh did I not notice that PC game pass does but you can only use PC game pass on a PC so if you are a chump and give Microsoft your money for their gaming machine then they treat you like a chump who gave the money instead of treating you like a valued customer that should get good value seems stupid yeah it does but hey on Flow plane you can get Adam continuing the rant against Tech marketing so you get all the stuff that was not tight enough to make it
into the video uh you get a closer look at what we learned AB testing thumbnails you get Dan explains his new live feed camera every camera we use on set explained you can check out our cars and how we test materials at Creator Warehouse which probably I haven't actually watched this one yet but probably has some um nuggets that didn't make sense until you knew about the upcoming mod M oh interesting any what else we got what  today um let's see here ryzen 9000 yeah amd's ryzen 9000
Series processors arrived at retailers today ahead of the official launch sometime this month but in spite of promising leaks on their specs enthusiasm has been relatively muted considering that I didn't even know this happened uh yeah PC sales have been recovering from their post-pandemic slump but that doesn't appear to have translated into renewed excitement for major component launches yeah I mean considering the performance uplift and compared to you what we've grown
accustomed to getting over the last 5 to 10 years I am kind of Blown Away by how little buzz I've seen for ryzen 9000 and I think a big part of it is that by not launching with x3d versions out of the gate AMD is basically saying yeah Gamers need not apply and the Enthusiast segment and whether they game or not people who are really interested in gaming performance benchmarks are pretty much a circle yeah um and there's going to be professionals who need the IPC and 12 cores but don't
need gaming performance or the better power efficiency that we tend to see with the x3d profess processors and they'll you know pick up ryzen 9000 for their editing workstations except like not a super high-end workstation because they aren't going thread rer Pro so like you got you got some users in there for whom ryzen 9000 is going to make sense but for an architectural move you know where we're we're moving to Zen 5 and it seems like  um the hype level is just blowing me
away here like the like the the lack of the lack of hype and it kind of makes me worried like if amd's CPUs become not interesting what is there going to be left to be interested about from AMD because their gpus sure aren't lighting the world on fire right now are they just going to move entirely to Ai and data center and are we going to be left with nothing obviously that would be quite a few years off but like it's it almost feels like we're in this this negative feedback loop where they didn't
really give us anything to be excited about for a long time and I'm talking collectively The Big Three your Intel AMD and Nvidia actually you know what I'm going to include Microsoft in there because Microsoft dude Windows used to be it a new windows would move also used to be interesting but that's what I'm talking about so I'm going to say the big four didn't give us anything interesting so we got bored we got bored so you know sales of interesting things like something that
really stood out to me as interesting even if it was kind of stupid was that weird collab that Intel did with Cooler Master and EK where they made a pelti cooler for their high-end K series chips that didn't improve performance in anything but gaming where slightly higher boost clocks on a couple of cores was going to eek out a few percent more performance all for like 350 watts of extra power consumption or something like that was cool but it was sort of Too Little Too Late by that point so
we're kind of bored and and cynical and don't care anymore so then why would they bother to you know produce new products at this break neck speed especially as the cost of developing them goes up and up and up with each subsequent generation which makes us bored which makes them not bother which makes us bored which makes them not bother like are we just going to be is cloud gaming just the future whether we like it or not I think that's like the biggest thing that I hate about the direction of
tech right now but I do kind of feel like maybe yeah I hate it though this is why I keep pushing back against these uh all you can eat game Services because I think that's all going in that direction as well and it's just I distinctly remember us sorry I I also want to say something that I forgot to say about the Microsoft subscription tier increase thing is this is another reason we've seen this with streaming services we're seeing this with Game Pass it's so much better to just own
your stuff because you don't know when the term is going to be changed suddenly Disney Plus or whatever it's even called has updated their pricing a bunch of times and it's way more expensive than it was when you signed up and now you are going to unsubscribe and suddenly have access to none of it even though you paid for this thing over a while it's a easier thing to stomach on the month-to-month basis but over all you're gaining nothing yep you'll own nothing and be happy though yeah don't be
happy not with that be happy in general I distinctly remember us having this conversation and I think it was about Sixth Gen or something like that we were we were at the Langley house doing Wan show and we were in that stuffy bedroom and we were talking about the rumor at the time maybe it was fif gen I'm I'm not sure anymore it was one of the two and we were talking about the rumor at the time that intel was going to move to soldered CPUs on the motherboards so essentially you'd be you'd be locked in
and the only thing you'd be able to change was RAM and I don't even remember what either of our stances was on it but I remember the audience reaction was absolutely horrified at the end of DIY and at this idea that you would just buy CPU motherboard maybe even Ram maybe even storage just on a single prepack packaged pre-bought board at that spec off of the shelf and then what I guess throw it in a chassis that looks the way you like and you'd have expansion card still but that would be about it and not
fast forwarding to today when Apple's upgradable Mac is a shadow of its former self like it hardly even has any cards that are worth installing in it anymore now that you can't put gpus in it and the GPU is integrated into the S so uh looking at Qualcomm having absolutely no plans whatsoever as far as I can tell to do anything but completely soldered packages for what are now mobile chips but if they continue to be successful could conceivably make their way into a Mini PC and then a small form factor PC
and even a desktop I mean if the performance is there and you get GPU drivers for it who's to say that you wouldn't just buy a Snapdragon or moving you know even farther into the future a risk five Board of some sort that's a soldered a soldered CPU orc is it finally coming to pass are we are we is it just over the horizon now the end of swappable components on motherboards or I think laptops are leading the charge there absolutely like hardcore absolutely and laptop components have slowly but surely made
their way into desktop computers uh there was one that we were looking at in writer meeting recently and I'm not logged into Trello so I think it's going to be pretty hard for me to find this but it was like the smallest um water cooled desktop and the truth is it it doesn't yeah here it is here it is uh the Techno Mega mini mini gaming G1 here's an article from video cards and it's hard to get a sense of exactly how small this thing is so to give you guys an idea this is not a 120
mm fan I believe that is either an 80 or a 92 mm fan this thing is flipping tiny uh let me see if I can double check the size of the fan so no it doesn't say uh so don't don't quote me on that maybe it's a 120 mm fan either way the thing is extremely small uh GeForce RTX 4060 um the CPU is a cor9 13900 H oh a  chip RTX 460 water cooled not that that's going to achieve anything in particular uh but the point is that in our efforts to differentiate and you know build something that stands out
from all the other SE black boxes we're ending up with designs that are using more expensive less modular and sometimes less performant I mean especially cuz performance and price are sort of you know slide against each other right so um if I say more expensive that inherently means less performant at the same price but maybe the same performance at a higher price the point is that suboptimal right and people are buying these presumably uh yeah rest assured says mini Forum has motherboards with laptop
CPUs that are killing it yeah I I don't I'm not sure if I quite understand cuz if I didn't mind less performance wouldn't I be better off getting like a last gen thing but I guess some people some people will not do that efficiency is really important as well and yeah some people just straight up won't do that um saluna says considering how long my CPU lasts anytime I need a new CPU I need a new motherboard anyway so IMO it wouldn't matter much if they started being solder on but right but reverse
that considering how easily a motherboard can break wouldn't it be better to be able to take your CPU to a replacement motherboard modularity is good it's good but it costs  um and I just I just don't think there I don't foresee an outcome where they continue to want to invest in it because I mean look at look at  okay I'm just thinking back to uh like um uh level one Tex Wendell love wendle um level one Tex did a video this week about Intel's challenges with stability on the 139900 K and 14900 K and there
was that um that game development Studio that said that they're basically going all AMD because all the Intel CPU systems that they've had are crashing um and I I was thinking about that and thinking back to some instances in the past where there have been uh motherboards blowing up or CPUs failing because of mismatched capabilities with respect to the vrms on the motherboard and the power draw of the CPU in the socket and that's just one example um there's also the development of of of
sockets and looking looking at how challenging that is like derbauer has his um his uh super cool low press ilm um noctua has a solution involving I think they're just still using washers to to reduce the pressure on the CPU to keep it from uh to keep it from going concave um just just all of these things if I'm in  point probably most people are buying a you know a core i5 whatever K gaming CPU or i7 or I like there's thinking back to my days at NC you could count on one
hand the number of SKS that move in any appreciable volume and for the specialty ones like your your low power you know s skes or um I mean AMD doesn't really have too many like weird kitchy ones so on the Intel side where they have a much deeper product stack like your weird low power s ones well you would just expect a partner to go and develop a board around it and solder it to it and ship  um I'm worried we might be coming close to the end and I'm going to have to find
different Tech to be excited about and  well about servers yeah think servers will be the last to go I think servers are a big part of why we still have modularity yeah and I don't know how long they'll last I mean look at the way that uh Nvidia was allegedly pressuring Partners to buy the en entire cabinet from them top to bottom well if that was the case nothing would have to be modular anyway yeah that's true it could all be as integrated or not integrated as Nvidia
Dem fit and if you want it you'll buy it and if you don't buy it you're going to be behind the competition in this AI arms race that we're in right so no I don't think it's a given anymore but I do think that it's a big part of  it let's cover something else yeah let's find something fun um you have any announcements left are we good we're good yeah I think we're good on announcements that sucks BBS love burps the LT screwdriver burps burp burp oh what is this oh okay
here's your problem one second burp burp burp he works on other people's computers so often he said here's your problem burp when solving his own problem yeah amazing ads uh okay PC build with my talking parrot this is a six-minute video we're not going to play the whole thing because you guys are going to have to watch it on your own but I haven't gotten to I haven't gotten to try this yet or I haven't gotten to watch this yet but what I'm told is that at some point in this video uh the LTT
screwdriver is involved and a BB is involved with it with it um these guys look like an absolute trip these birds okay well that's not an LTT screwdriver I'm not surprised he's trying to be involved is there is there a time stamp I'm supposed to look at here hold on a second Apollo a pet African great parrot a link best known for his ability to recognize shapes colors and materials recently decided to help his humans assemble a new pc as a new PC Building assistant he made sure to test all the
tools and even performed a drop test on the LTT screwdriver he seemed to really love the sound of the ratchet mechanism that makes sense uh here we go okay I have some time stamps here we go here we go  uh oh that is amazing okay uh what what else we got uh here's a link to Apollo's  test nice drop oh that's super cute um what else we got here Apollo knows what screwdrivers are made of probably says like the materials probably bites it and then says the material yeah that's so cool yeah
wow that is super cool really cool we just smart look in general and they look like good trainer people I was I was about to say in general if someone were to say I'm G to get a parrot I would tell them to not be an idiot and leave it in the wild and don't you understand they live for like 30 plus years um you need to not do that think that was an African gr you you they often end up neglected and they don't get attention um 23 years Apollo here Apollo here seems to be getting a lot of attention
and interaction which is what they need they their flock animals right um so you're part of their flock you can't just peace out for days at a time like they they've got to yeah they got to they they got to have a community so uh that looked like a very happy group of people that seemed like yeah group people group of birds all having a good time they they seemed pretty into it the Birds um so I mean obviously you never know what things are like behind closed doors or whatever else but it's seemed
seemed pretty chill also LTD screwdriver made an appearance in a Corsair ad oh nice love to see it thanks Reddit for flagging that for us let's go uh that was really Jesus bacon all right sure username Jesus bacon so is that bacon given to you by Jesus or is it bacon made of Jesus what's he bacon is it a cake do you eat it during  breakfast all right we need to get off of this topic um do we just how long have we been live do we just do after dark so Ivon had an interesting pitch
and we shouldn't do it today but she noticed that other people are noting and she was kind of confused by how dark we are on lmg Clips sometimes and she said she thought it was kind of stupid which is fair fair so after dark is in name only her pitch was that we would do different colors on the background for after dark we would have a more like nighttime Vibe why she gets the big bucks we'd have like bright colors for regular wow wasn't that a you story a me yeah that's
why I get paid the big bu yeah I had a colleague at NC who definitely was earning pretty basic pay and was pretty much tolerated rather than um appreciated in the workplace and oh Dan is playing you're doing it now oh that's kind of funny red and blue for when it's live and then purple for sure I don't know yeah Twilight Sparkle wait what um the point is that uh this particular colleague um wouldn't let me go get my own thing even though it was right there and didn't matter um and it
was this like meaningless menial task where this particular person had been kind of shoveled away from HQ so they wouldn't interfere with anything and just on like inventory um of one of the retail stores and they like got so mad that their tupe was like moving around on their head and because I wanted to just like grab something off of a shelf and they were like no you can't do it I do it that's why the owner pays me the big bucks that's why Steve pays me the big bucks
just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you talking about um so so I used to be able to tell the story better with more details that were really funny um and so I told the story a handful of times to like other other managers once I was higher up in the company and I was like yeah yeah yeah he I remember this one time cuz we all this particular character was a character um and so so whether it was cadd and mean I'll let you guys judge it was caddy and it was probably caddy and mean it was caddy and mean whether it was
caty and mean we would swap stories sometimes about funny interactions that's not good that's not good that's not good should have done that I shouldn't have done that I wouldn't encourage that um but it became an inside joke anytime we would do the most menial [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to say that's why Steve pays me the big buck I just I remember like back in the day you say that all the time so I was like pretty sure it was a story the story the story was a lot fresher back then in my
mind uh and it's also become it's become kind of a tasteless thing for me to say since I do actually get paid well now whereas back when I was like getting paid like a rank and filer with everyone else around me it made a lot more sense for me to joke about not getting paid a lot and doing stupid [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] tasks so it just doesn't really work anymore yeah Elijah goes OMG is that why you say it yes apparently I've said it more recently than I realized yeah I probably shouldn't I
probably I probably just shouldn't I think it's tacky now probably yep you don't get to fit in anymore probably tacky for you yeah okay I don't really like say it what did I even just say it in response I don't remember but I oh I said that b of vongh oh yeah okay she also gets paid pretty well um I want gift cards in exchange for LTT backpacks that makes sense you technically do apparently uh this was posted um on the subreddit scammer pretends to be lonus willing to trade discounted LT backpacks for gift
cards even sent AI video of Linus as proof oh scammer spent 2 hours to finally get this receipt amazing finish the payment then we can chat here's the screenshot where amount paid $300 purchased gift card recipient lius not AI smiley face what the hell is this it's a screenshot of the purchase Mr lonus really funny I don't know what you're talking about lonus can I get that shout out now this is not a gift card you just playing with me man oh you are smart what game are you playing this
is amazing that is very good and I have intentionally not watched this yet so we all get to watch seriously we all get to  now oh wow it's both a little bit confusing are a little bit convincing but also clearly so off yeah his hair is too perfect no no that's my what that's my hair it's not messy enough no his his like skin and his hair also don't move together properly look at this eyeball or look at this Iris it's like over here it's like looking over this way the mouth movement is also very odd
yeah it's actually kind of funny how much of recognizing a person is their mannerisms yeah I also think that their face is probably actually this big like they probably have a wider face whereas on me this is just hair and I have a narrower face so it ends up looking really weird like the hair moves like flesh they're like super Frozen too like the rest of them doesn't move at all the shoulders don't even slightly adjust and why wouldn't they use like a low resolution crappy version of me why
would they make it look like I'm sitting in a portrait studio like why would I record that like the portrait studio is weird I don't know what you're saying in the clip but the portrait food uh I think it should have audio there should be a if you push the top right hand corner top right hand corner oh sure uh can do you want to listen to it uh yeah okay it is there uh give me one sec yeah oh okay yeah sure we can hear the Audio I think it's supposed to be this one play the terrible audio apparently it's
terrible audio tell me about yourself hiel very funny you think I'm a fake but I'm not hope this video proves I'm not got anything can hear it we can't DOI jur oh well that's okay I'm kind of over it f but I'm not hope this video proves yeah after dark uh yeah do we have any other major topics today is there anything else that we announced uh oh Lordy what did we announce oh no this is a good one stop killing games gains ground on official EU response so the background here if
you're not familiar is stop killing games is a movement aimed at restricting game publishers AB ility to render games unplayable after purchase they have petitioned the EU among others for new legislation regulating how and when Publishers can delist and sunset games in June stop killing games was officially registered by the European commission as a Citizens initiative now if organizers can collect a million statements of support from EU residents within the next year the EU government
will be legally obligated to make an official response this is very cool I think they'll get it too two members of the EU Parliament well if we can do anything about it yeah darn right they're going to get it they're only going to get it if you guys listening to this do sign don't hear me say like I think they'll get it and not do something yeah I'm saying I think they'll get it because I'm thinking that you will support it two members of the EU Parliament have submitted questions
to the European commission for Clarity on whether consumers should be protected from these kinds of publisher actions under existing EU law the commission's response basically boils down to it's possible but currently untested that if games ulas are unfair they might be unenforceable consumers should be compensated if a service or supply of a good is cut off before the end of its agreed contract however these kinds of decisions probably need to be made first by member States before EU Regulators
take action is the quote here uh the question of whether destroying games postp purchase is legal has reportedly been escalated to a high level in the French bureaucracy so this is pretty exciting I was worried this wouldn't gain any traction whatsoever but it seems like there's a little bit a little bit of snow just just a few flakes a few flakes of snow maybe moving maybe not rolling yet but moving is there um is there like a sign up form to sign this now or something I I I can't find anything
personally is there something we can direct people to uh I don't know tell you what uh we will find out um Dan if you don't mind making a note for Jessica we will find out for you guys for next week and we will Direct you to the right place because if we can get everyone who watches the W show who lives in the EU to sign up for this maybe we could even do another special uh early morning W show like a first thing Friday W show so we can catch more of them live call in yeah that'd be cool that'd be cool I'm
down I'm I'm excited this is great because realistically if they have to put in the work to hand over the the server tools to the community or you do whatever it is then they might as well just hand it over everywhere every region rather than just in the EU we see this over and over and over again where one large jurisdiction basically goes yeah you can't do that and they changed their behavior  excited um zombie blogs rise from the dead to commit plagiarism didn't we talk about
this oh we talked about sort of this last week not quite the unofficial Apple web blog which was closed by AOL back in 2015 has apparent or we blog whatever it is has apparently been revived as a platform for AI generated articles under the by line of its former writers the articles are blatantly plagiarized having barely been changed from the original Source likewise The Writer's bios and profile pictures are AI generated some of the stolen names have been changed to generic names after the
original writer threatened legal action the domain's new owner web orange limited doesn't appear to have also purchased the site sold content and instead claims to have had its staff meticulously rewrite that content based on archived versions available on archive.org web orange is apparently based out of Hong Kong and also owns a few other revived old sites such as ilounge which is also now posting lowquality AI generated articles under the supposed by line of human beings ah okay I think that's it other
than the FTC says most websites use dark patterns in a big surprise to everyone who's ever tried to unsubscribe from anything uh apparently that uh we don't have to get Jessica to do the work it's not live yet oh okay it's coming but it's not there yet and apparently Canada is doing this too maybe question mark well that would be exciting yeah I don't I I don't think we have notes on that necessarily but oh yeah if you go to stop killing games.com countries you can see the various flags and there's the
Canadian flag and you can sign the petition and do stuff like that very cool okay hey we can collapse things in the dock now so we should do that with any topics that we've already done that's going to make it way easier to process this thing oh I see yeah I've collapsed a bunch of stuff Boop PSA we've all been hacked um this will be another quick one both AT&amp;T and Ticket Master were um or several months ago hackers stole large amounts of data from both AT&amp;T and Ticket Master the
AT&amp;T reach is apparently extensive and affects nearly all of their customers as well as customers of other providers that use their Network nice the data doesn't include the content of calls and text but does include a large amount of call metadata AT&amp;T is reportedly working with the FBI to investigate the situation and The Ticket Master breach likely affects millions of its customers in an email Ticket Master sent out disclosing the breach I got one it claims the information may have included
Your Name basic contact information and payment card information such as encrypted credit card or debit card numbers and expiration dates both breaches are linked to cloud data company snowflake whose servers were compromised when somebody was too woke I guess I made up the last bit things got heated yikes should we move to after dark sure sure what do we want purple  purple I lost their name cuz this conversation was a long time ago but someone did point out in Phan chat that
purple might make it seem like twitch yeah do we care no all right I do think they might be uh on or something but sure there I think it's okay nice question for you there we go what's up why don't they just store people's names and email addresses encrypted why is anything stored plain text oh because they store the credit cards  maybe this is just me asking a dumb question but it just seems like it wouldn't be that hard for them to decrypt it when they access it just like
anything else uh it might be pretty annoying is accessible is it like yeah I don't know um how important is just the name I mean the name itself is not terribly important unless it's an Ashley Madison leak um but I would say the name in conjunction with any kind of contact information is going to at if nothing else increase the incidence of robocalls and spam lookups get really annoying like there's a lot of things on the company side that's it's like really annoying for um and honestly in in this might
piss off a lot of privacy people in my opinion it's all leaked already anyways that definitely made some people mad uh um I will be the voice of reason no that's a bad attitude and we I don't mean for everything in general you're saying just the name no no I'm not saying just I think it's a little unreasonable to say that we need to just encrypt literally everything all the time no but we could encrypt um we could in what I'm saying did Miss year I thought you just mentioned the name I
did but I meant the name in conjunction with anything else is a problem so sure you could have you could have one thing that is that is not encrypted but then to your point like how do you how do you search a database then that's really tough it gets pretty annoying um I I think there's like there's a there's an appropriate middle ground on this type of stuff um but like what all leaked what did they say leaked oh man uh for Ticket Master it was like names contact information and encrypted
credit card numbers so like if my contact information was also encrypted I  care like why why do they need to index my contact information other than to like Target me with ads or whatever which I honest L go yourself anyway like I just is there any reason not to just say look anything that could leak has to be enough of it has to be encrypted that you could not build an individual profile of a person you couldn't tie any one thing to anyone else I think a lot of it comes back down to it's expensive and
annoying um so it's like  sure but like couldn't you have elevated access machines possible just really  um need to decrypt everything else in this case I could be wrong here I don't  true you have the key exposing in use all the time yeah I don't know um that's true but it and maybe it would just you know make that particular machine a more enticing Target but like if you only have to harden a handful of targets versus if just like every CSR in the entire company has access to something like
it's I think it's just like this is information that's used to verify people all the time for a huge variety of reasons and stuff I think it's just really taxing on whatever service it is um and I'm not necessarily saying that makes it like a good thing but I I understand why that level of stuff is often not encrypted yeah or like okay here's an interesting one Top Gear 1224 in the chat says uh what about encrypting part of things like so so if you need to be able to search by email uh you could you
could encrypt um The Domain that would at least obfuscate things a little bit like could you could you have part of a text field be encrypted on your side two people have the same ones um well you're still only going to get a a handful of results like yeah you wouldn't be able to find an exact match or that's pretty annoying ah that is pretty annoying but they probably wouldn't have the same name it's really just pretty annoying yeah okay well I I'm just I'm just tired of this you
know yeah like oh no I I complet things the way they are isn't good completely agree carass I think that's what I'm going to say it is makes each data transaction take longer and over millions of users can really slow everything down this is a huge deal um and that's why I said cost more and be very annoying that's effectively what I meant Ticket Master can afford it they definitely can you know what Ticket Master yeah I just like anytime you add like if you add a single call to like
like a task that happens like a a bajillion times like there was an inefficiency we found in flow plane a while ago because um it would check if you could watch if I I I don't some something was configured incorrectly and honestly I'm going to tell the story wrong because I don't remember because it's been a long time but it was it was doing like way too many steps when it was checking if you could watch a video if I remember correctly it was like like a DRM check of some sort it was like can
you watch all of the videos and then it would it would I don't remember exactly what it did but it was really excessive whatever it did and there was a way easier way to simplify it and we did end up simplifying it but we were trying to figure out like like why are we having scaling issues with this one thing and we end up figuring out that like as as users were joining it wasn't like oh you increase it by a reasonable amount it was like oh every single time someone tries to play a video at all
there's like this massive amount of uh hits to the database all at the same time and it was like very unreasonable so you try to make those things more efficient um and it can be very annoying to not do thatass says I work with AWS and I'm always Under Pressure to reduce processing time and therefore costs yeah this is like this is a huge thing this is scary and Top Gear 1224 says plain text databases are cheap I once realized I could access the whole customer name email list and phone number for everyone
who ever called AT&amp;T back like 10 20 years yep oh my goodness yeah super normal all right Dan you want to hit us with some merch messages we just stop crying over here yeah I told you computers computers were a mistake yeah we shouldn't have tricked rocks into thinking it's all been downhill s let's see Talking of uh Stupid rocks uh lldd I have an older gen phone uh Samsung 10 plus S10 plus and I wanted to know on a scale of 1 to 10 how important are up-to-date security updates should I get
a new phone based solely on security and the minor speed bump well how about we do this I'm going to show Luke the phone that I'm still using that hasn't gotten a security update in I don't know two years and I'm going to see how much he freaks out okay that look on his face that's how important it is for you to update why do you do this to me I don't know I'm just a jerk I guess get a new phone I I want to it's a lot of work what if I just smashed it right now then no one would be able to tell the
difference I mean look at it this isn't dirt guys this is like shattered glass on the back um no I'd be pretty upset I think I have some pictures on here I haven't packed up okay so you didn't learn your lesson last time um about what backing things up I mean there's 43 pictures on it I think I'll be all right if I lose them yeah yeah I I I backed up smash backed up very recently that sounds like permission to me no no no look how look how cute this video is of my daughter
I'm showing off a little wolf she made out of Lego you wouldn't smash that no and if you said anything about smashing that oh in reference to a video of my daughter then we'd have be having a real conversation here I have too much respect for you nothing to do with me did you get it oh I get it yes I got it I got it Luke thank you and no playing doctor either oh oh where where are my sunglasses free mustache rides no you shaved yours off you're shooting bullets I got to he shooting 
true this is this is true look I was too vile okay it happens it happens oh man we're really after dark now so I'm sorry I'm sorry everyone it was about 4 days of not shaving over like uh a Friday I think I no Saturday Sunday oh yeah right when I went to Great Wolf Lun so I had a couple days off so I had like a 4-day not being at work and not painting anything and so I let it grow out and as I was shaving everything to to come into work I left the mustache and Yvonne came out of the
bathroom and I was like uh uh and she just kept walking no a so I did it I pitched it for you I pitched it for you I appreciate that yeah I I'm just interested cuz we'll never see mine I can't not have a beard it's just not allowed you can't no yeah I have to have a beard oh I see I see I see I see yeah that's fair that makes sense yeah go for it Dan Ola lld question for seor lonus have you looked into the growing Market of sleep focused earbuds recently thanks for the screwdriver
bundle going to be my new Aerospace maintenance toys sick um I have not every sleep focused earbud or sleep mask or like thing that goes over here and has speakers built into it that I've ever seen was less comfortable and often times as expensive or more expensive compared to just airpods and so I've just yet to discover  um yeah I've been having a lot of trouble with my airpods Pros lately though I have airpods Pros two pro twos and um I'm getting this weird issue when
connected to my PC where the volume just keeps cranking and then I like turn it down three notches and then it cranks again but the volume slider doesn't change so I turn it down a bit more and I get to the point where I'm at like one and it's too loud so I'm at one or zero and it's like okay thank you very much for that and then I'm having weird reception issues with them too which I never had before yeah I don't know man anyway Hi l DL looking forward to all three of your frosted tips question for
probably Luke what is your favorite app for counting macros or calories do you even count oh and lonus congrats on the boobies thank you I think it's called macro Factor um you're going to have to explain what a macro is to me I have no idea I just swim or badminton or whatever I just do stuff Adam got me on Mac profactor as well I don't know pretty good with my watch too yeah um so basically you can look for your like um protein carb and fat goals for a Day within a certain amount of calories then
you log the food that you eat throughout the day and when and you give it input on what level of exercise you're doing and it tries to balance your your calories and calories out to match whatever your goal is gaining weight losing weight maintaining whatever can I just eat when I'm hungry you might be able to all right cool right now I can't I'll get there cool have you heard that steveo from Jackass is fake boobs I mean I hardly think that that's even like noteworthy  that all right next mer merch message
sure uh hi dlll what does lmg Incorporated do for sustainability and what do you all think it will take for the corporations of the world to do their part in preserving the planet um hold on one sec uh I came up with the idea a few years ago to get a boob job and just film a bunch of legitimately funny hidden camera pranks with me in Disguise and then revealing who I actually am so he's aware of bodysuits right yeah like if you want to be in Disguise as someone with breasts you can just wear fake
breasts above your skin how do these people reach adulthood doesn't isn't that like finster's whole thing I don't know you got to commit to the bits uh  steo collab with fster I mean sure fster has real boobs now okay I don't know who's Finster it's a content creator I mean okay is there is there some context for this or like you know what it doesn't matter I'm they wore a suit thing a suit you were talking the bodysuit or whatever it's called they wore one of those for lots of years apparently they
have they have them actually know but oh they wore a suit thing for years okay sure what do you mean lonus is out of touch square I'm not a what I don't know I just I no I wasn't even didn't call you that I I explicitly said in the beginning of it that it like wasn't even shocking anymore yeah doesn't matter anyway apparently Finster uh has come out of as full trans now I didn't know but that's a thing I guess it sounds like we had some hints at the leading up to that maybe yeah okay makes
sense I don't know it just whatever point and laugh at the Boomers okay what's next uh sustainability what does lmgd do for sustainability and what do you think it will take for the corporations of the world to do their part preserving the planet uh I'm super anti-plastic we use as little plastic as humanly possible in the production of our products um I don't think you're ever going to stop people from like buying stuff so one of the things that we try to do whenever we
develop our products is make things that last for a really long time uh reduce is the first one um we are going to we have and continue to advocate for upgradable electronics repairable Electronics there's things that we're bad at um it I kind of had a realization that at the scale that we've reached the number of computer systems and the amount of stuff stuff that we leave on around here every when I tried to change that not even that long ago and he told me I couldn't cuz people
need to remote into their computers and I was like that seems excessive I don't remember the full context but depending on what we were talking about I could have conceivably said that we need to find another solution we were closing up after a wano and I was realizing how many people's computers were just on and I was like this seems crazy part of it is that I Fought the Battle a lot of times like I would literally go to someone's workstation that was just unlocked and on I'm pretty sure we could
win and I would set it to screen off the IT team is now powerful okay that's fair but I would set it to turn off and then like the next day I would see the same one on I'd be like what is going on here it would particularly happen with the ingest stations they would keep changing them back to never go to sleep and I'm like okay I get it if it goes to sleep during a transfer it might like cause an issue or something set like 4 hours or something then no transfer is going to
take four hours you can even do like  come in in the morning use it once it stays on for the rest of the day and shuts down at least it's going to shut  good hit me down we should do we we should and could do more and we'll we want to do more but I'm also not going to pretend to set like an arbitrary we're going to be carbon neutral by would like we're just going to we're going to do little things that we can we're going to make things that last and we're going to use less plastic yeah hi
all from Burn be which entities own all the cable that connects the world to the internet do they not stand in a position to make the best worst trained llm also come to Langley Ribfest owning the cable doesn't mean that you actually have any meaningful way of harvesting the data that is being transmitted on it a lot of it is encrypted and if you're not at an endpoint uh you essentially are not privy to what is passing through that cable necessarily so it's not really 
hey lonus as a serial snob what would be your top three underrated cereals um I wow I um okay cereals that are underrated I I don't know what Cals are underrated I don't I don't participate in the serial snob Community brand flakes I only brand buds are you a brand Enthusiast Dan I'm just thinking of things that people might not like that you may actually like um those those are the two serials that I like I'm not on r/ serial killers you know assuming that that was what
they would call A Serial Community yeah that got superb owl and type possible it's yeah that's what I would call it um so I I only drink I or drink I only eat like mainstream cereals from like you know kogs and posts and stuff like I'm I'm honestly not that much of a snob I just really appreciate okay I'm enough of a snob that I can tell the difference in like manufacturing tolerances from one batch to the next like when the boxes on the Shelf have all been gone and replaced by a new batch of Mini
Wheats like I can tell that the frosting consistency is lower and the ratio is off wow so I'm enough of a snob that I'm like that where I will literally stop eating cranberry almond crunch because it's too crunchy now and they they screwed up the like uh the final glazing or roasting component of it I don't know much about how it's made too crunchy I just know that Corn Pops when I was in grade eight were freaking awesome up here in Canada they're different from the US the US ones are still good um but
the Canadian ones were perfectly round never liked the US ones they're not round it's you get used to it though okay yeah they're they're good once you like if you were expecting like early 2000s Canadian Corn Pops the American ones would be sorely disappointing but if you compare the American ones to the atrocity that we have now oh no have you not eaten Corn Pops in the last 15 years oh they suck I had them when I was a kid yeah they suck they've gone through a number of phases so they were perfect
and then they did something I think it I think they um they changed the like the the sugar outer coating the crunchy coating and they would get soft like immediately and then they hard corrected the other way to the point where it was like chewing on a mouthful of broken when they used to like hurt the roof of your mouth yeah that was like Prime there was a time where they hurt too much after the time when they hurt a little and anyway they they B basically I haven't actually had them in a while
so it's possible they've dialed it back in and they're good now but man did they ever suck oh man honeynut Cheerios before post went all whole grain and everything dude as a kid I would that was my main line I would eat an entire box of Honey Nut Cheerios dry like I didn't even need milk man they were so good I was definitely into the having it with milk thing but but those were my those were my main line my mom used to buy those like super family packs nice so good nice yeah man Cheerios it it's
always been funny to me to see Marquez with his back in the day when he was living in his dorm and he had his little Cheerios box I was like you don't even know what good Cheerios taste like young man sad sad I weep for the youngers get to enjoy the high quality cereal of our youth if if there was if there was a petition that I could start bring back good cereal it would be it would be bring back white flour cereal just like post just stop just it it all it's all garbage and it's terrible for you anyway
there's your consumable for LTT store a good cereal yeah I don't I don't even think you're the cereal snob this could make sense this actually makes more sense than it has any right to I don't think we could make a cereal that would satisfy me whoa did you hear that crater Warehouse yeah no we we couldn't do it so I can tell you guys what I like I'm I'm a I'm a big Mini Wheats guy uh sometimes the frosting is not enough sometimes it's too heavy um but you pour like a third of a
bowl a little bit too much milk and like eat it fast and the the milk's got to be like like 3 3.25% or whatever no skim milk or anything like that because that's gross um but you get that you get that fatty milk in there like ice cold it's got to be as cold as possible and then I'll pour like another third of a bowl and then like another third of a bowl I would never pour a full bowl of Mini Wheats that's disgusting by the time you get to the end of it it's like it's not good yeah
you might as well have just gotten the big Shredded Wheat thing and then dumped some sugar in the milk like it's it's soggy it's a soggy mess um what I do like Triple Berry oatmeal crisp um I add extra cranberries like my own berries I I love dried like Crain um what are you reacting to Elijah said I use cream or water with cereal uh what that is genuinely offensive I have eaten Cheerios with water once when I was dead desperate it was horrible and Elijah doesn't know anything so there's
that those are like two sides of the absolute most ridiculous Spectrum I still I still love me some Honey Nut Cheerios Honey Nut Cheerios are still good even though they're not nearly as good as they used to be point of the milk isn't to wet it honeynut checks Honey Nut checks are a drug and my guilty pleasure like the worst of all the horrible sugar cereals that I eat n quick really it's I don't think I've ever had it so good make a cereal I didn't yeah it's little like
chocolate balls I assumed yeah it's kind of like it's kind of like if Corn Pops were smaller and chocolate and by the time there is so much chocolate flavor in them that by the time you're done the bowl especially if you do what I do and eat all the cereals out of it and then repour you are basically drinking chocolate milk that's pretty that's pretty good it's like the worst thing I I do not indulge that very often especially at my rapidly advancing age I like goolan crunch never heard of it yeah it's
good um used to be a Quaker Harvest crunch guy actually there that'll be that'll be my underrated cial and to your point Dan about bran M actually a raisin brand guy but same thing you got to pour small bulls but but a bow of raisin brand with the right uh oh okay with the right ratio of raisins actually pretty good nice I'm more into like musle style I've never tried Rees Puffs because I'm afraid that I'd never stop eating them you would never stop eating them y so I've I've actually never tried
them on purpose I refused to buy them yep I mean they're a dessert food I I like cereal for dessert sometimes yeah uh Noki "1,119 flow plane chat please mention W's" anniversary the 12th of July 2013 was the first W Show episode today is the exact same day 11 years later oh wow happy birthday wo neither of us had any idea you've you've grown just a smidge yeah apparently see because we got a oh you have a tumor now oh that took me a little bit all right get it is wait is is that implying danz or child  age
wow next first message I'm made of cellulos um let's see let's see let's see um hey lldd thanks for the screwdriver sale grabbed a few bit sets so it's less of a write-off Luke what is your favorite technology you have gotten  plane favorite tech I've gotten for float plane what does it mean I vote the work that they've done on the trans code stack I think that's the thing you think is does that count as getting yeah I think so getting through the work of people that work at flow plane oh that's how I
that's how I interpreted it okay yeah I think our trans code stack is pretty cool it is pretty cool I do like that it is very cool I'll go with that there's a lot of stuff though that was complicated still doing that um some of the kubernetes work that's been going on from Jonathan has been really sick um Jaden just whips out like he'll just J's whole thing recently seems to be like oh by the way I'm working on this thing kind of on the side every once in a while and I'm like oh that's neat and
then the next day he's like it's done like what okay cool good old Jaden thanks Jaden um yeah I don't know there's there's tons of if if we're talking about like our own contributions it's it's very wide reaching we've made a lot of different things um but yeah it's all very good hold on I've got one that's not a a merch message here in float plane chat from kren thoughts on the Samsung ring announcement um huh it's a ring that's only compatible with a Samsung phone yep
that's annoying so go [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yourself I guess it's $400 see you later uh question for lldd I just quit my job mid shift with no notice at a hospital after being there 2 months post College how would you handle being overworked and undertrained where do I go from here what was it like uh I don't know it depends if you like the thing I think like I enjoyed what we were doing so like it's probably what I would have wanted to do anyways yeah well okay so let's say you're
working at a hospital cleaning up PE and poo though yeah that's rough yeah um I think did they say they're just out of school was that right yeah yep that's tough because finding out after you finished a program that you don't want to do that job is a real bummer yeah especially um as far as I know basically all medical education that would land you in a hospital is really expensive um so I don't know that's tough I'm not I'm not sure what I would necessarily do or go from there oh hold on Porto says
it was not confirmed to only work on Samsung so hopefully that's not true in which case I'm um moderately glad that uh some people who want that product can have it nice it's out of water it's okay um yeah I don't know it's maybe it was that hospital maybe try to apply somewhere else but as far as my understanding goes working in a hospital is hectic and you're overworked and there's crazy hours and that's just sort of how it how it goes I I wish that wasn't the case that um for sure that
seems pretty not cool yeah beggy says we want more AJ on camera he knows his shiz um that was a fun video well I've been trying to convince AJ hey AJ hey AJ if you're watching this why don't you go on camera more yeah huh yeah you ever think of  right you we even saw he had he had one problem that he kept insisting was actually a core problem and then I really questioned him on it and we ended up Googling some things and figured out that maybe it's not as much of a core
problem as we thought it was AJ I didn't even think about that until right now we had a conversation about you moving here today and I didn't think about that okay this is getting dangerously close to an HR conversation on camera that's fair  company that's maybe not good uh please don't Zoo technically those people use the same HR resources that lmg has it's it's like actually F that's why it's umbrella HR right yeah um okay I can but AJ you should you should move here that would be very cool
yeah that' be very cool then you can  person okay both of you need to stop why am I the voice of reason oh man I need break sometimes um all right maybe T us up for another one okay sure uh you want to cover interesting things are there are things the audience might find interesting that you wouldn't cover because you don't find it interesting yourself yes um but I think chasing that has also led us to um cover things that we're just not as interested or passionate about so it's
finding a balance going to hurt yeah we  yeah hi dll I saw the new backpack that lonus was wearing in the Taiwan PC giveaway video is there an ETA on that and is it also affected by the same reasons that affected the Lux backpack there is no ETA but no it's not affected by the supplier relations challenges it's affected by um it not being very  I went are you texting me no oh hold on one of my Taiwan friends just sent me a video what is this oh no okay they just got married that's cool
congrats yeah tell them uh a sizable portion of the internet says congrats because I'm assuming they they will be doing this I think that's generally how that works couple's dinner next year yep  I've got do they know this is one interesting thing about lon's Badminton friends in Taiwan is they know him from badmington yeah like do they do they even realize this could be a thing that's happening right now um cuz you could send them a picture of chat where everyone's saying
congrats he does like a year and a bit ago um we like had dinner and and talk yeah we like talked and stuff yeah I'm I'm going to send him I'll send him a picture of chat right now cool here we  fun my live stream says congrats all right what else we got sure uh hiw wondering what's up with the headphones.com partnership with audio testing did the labs testing not work out did you find they were basically  um we are still working on internal testing we are always appreciative of
external Partners like headphones.com those guys are super cool I actually met one of those folks uh uh Buddy's name is Blaine he came up and shot a video with us at my house earlier this week we were trying out this wild Soundbar it's called the Nakamichi Dragon what a name "it's a $44,000 soundbar that's a that's" a large sum but it comes with surround speakers so it's not just a soundbar two subwoofers so it is not a soundbar and it weighs as much as a child uh it's
it's freaking crazy the complete package I think weighs about 160 pounds that's a very large child yeah well that that I meant the Soundbar weighs as much as a child okay yeah so it's it's pretty it's pretty cool and anyway they they came up to um to to work with us on it and U help with some recording and stuff so expect to see expect to see our audio coverage continue to evolve I guess at one time I was a child that weighed 160b but I was a fairly large child so that makes sense we're all still kids at
heart I was thinking back and I was like yeah I was a child and I weighed that much maybe that's not as crazy back in my day I was a child line is hilarious that was the Emoji that he sent me back for that yeah animation whatever they are I don't know what to call them yeah the reaction yeah cool couple more for you here best screwdrivers working on my JDM Subaru sg5 Forester with it right now nice Luke what cards what cars did you drift on your Japan trip oh no you don't remember cringe Nissan
Z was the one that I was drifting I'm  remember I know I know he just calls it the chaser um but that's the one that I was riding in that that Sam it was driving um is that the actual name of the I think so wow this looks Co sorry the Nissan Z this thing looks cool yeah sorry I'm just shopping right now for cars well I don't know no no no no no I'm just sure fine whatever I don't think it was like a new one to be clear no I'm no by shopping I mean I'm like looking like like I'm not I'm not buying a car I'm
just just looking hm would you use the word shopping if you had no intention to buy yeah window shopping window shopping all right uh but yeah the the cha it's actually called the Chaser the Toyota Chaser so I was right I just wasn't sure if that was what he called it and then I remember that was actually the model name I'm just I don't think we have Toyota Chasers here so I forgot um but yeah that was the one that I was a passenger in got it and then I actually drove the Z cool and it was fantastic very
cool hi guys do you see a problem with developers who perform well and do not want to advance positions I'm happy as a developer team lead uh about 9 years from retirement I'm annually pressured to set goals developer team lead is a developer who advanced their position just to be clear um but also no I don't think so not everyone wants to manage and that's fine I can understand why they pressure you to manage because finding developers who are willing to develop their management skills can be turns out
that's tough turns out that a lot of introverts find their way to development and a lot of people that started doing something as difficult as software development probably got into it because they want to do software development um and not necessarily because they want to manage so like this all this all makes sense to me um that being said there are some people that uh are on my team that I've kind of nudged to be like hey are you interested in that could be helpful um and they
have generally expressed that they are not uh there's someone in chat yeah elx as a Dev manager I want to go back to being a Dev yeah I'm not surprised um so I don't know for most people I would suggest to consider it just because it's a pretty desired position um but if you're not into managing people and you just want to keep doing development I there's a ton of respect on that you need really talented experienced developers to be leading things very often and I don't think that the end
scale of everything should be management um personally so that is what it is dll what are your thoughts on the current 13th and 14th gen Intel kks situation being far bigger than simple bios or micro code updates meaning the problem is baked in how does Intel solve this via recalls I think that they are up the creek without a paddle the fact that these chips are um what like you recall the chip and then what do they what does that person do with the rest of their system the fact that these top speec
chips are impacted while the lower down versions are not to me is indicative that Intel has pushed things too far what they can possibly do to get themselves out of this situation honestly I'm not I'm I am not sure obviously they need to replace every chip that dies um but I think that if you were to say something like every CPU that causes a system blue screen should be immediately R you'd be laughed out of town because there's so many factors that I think nailing this down to the CPU being the
defect is going to be really difficult and confusing for a lot of end users so how do they solve this I mean some kind of recall mechanism seems like it's going to be necessary at some point here unless they can figure out a way to fix this  um this is uh yeah this is a big this is a big challenge begy says begy says they could take the Apple route and ignore the issue I don't know if they're going to be able to I I think they will you think so I do that's what I suspect they're going to do there's a
lot of loud noise being made there's a lot of loud noise being made in an extremely small teacup that's fair to in the in the grand scheme of things Intel could just stop making K chips Al together tomorrow and it wouldn't really matter it would be would be a notable item on their quarterly investment call um and they would say yeah we've made some divestment from the sort of Enthusiast overclockable we're focusing on Enterprise more stock go up we're yeah we're focusing on we're focusing on uh
you know AI PCS through our tier one  it's it's rough not the greatest time to be a PC person that's what I think is going to happen and um oh you think they're going to stop making kchips no no I I think I think that they would do that before recalling all of two generations of kchips yeah I think they'd just be like screw it forget it I don't think we'll see a recall I also think a recall would honestly piss people off because um they built a computer around this thing it would also draw way more
attention to it than probably it would ever have any chance of getting through just us talking about about it um uh other Tech channels talking about it talking about hopefully Wendell's recent dive  it Intel has a pretty big problem on level one text from wend two days ago you want to check it out go uh go watch it also this is like a minor aside but W's hosting in this video is also fantastic I just want to say that yeah love wendle fantastic video and last one I've got for you
tonight Aloha lldd I recently moved to Hawaii as my partner got stationed in Pearl Harbor from the Navy my tower is still Mainland and I'm worried it w survive the shipping you should be any tips Mahalo take the GPU out yeah that's a big one we actually did a whole video on this  oh apparently Jay's two cents also did a video on it but I'm going to link you to this one  him and I think that's pretty much it we will see you guys again next week same bad time same bad Channel enjoy your
screwdrivers a bunch of you bought gift cards this week although that makes sense cuz lime Day is coming up so you're just buying gift cards yeah I I see you  strategic did you say your bit yeah oh bye happy anniversary everyone yeah
