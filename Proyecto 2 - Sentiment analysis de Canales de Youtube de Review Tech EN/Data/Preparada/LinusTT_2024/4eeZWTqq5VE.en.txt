you could be in a dollar store a pharmacy or maybe you just wandered a little too far from the vegetable aisle and someone's going to be trying to sell you an RGB keyboard or a gaming headset and it turns out that even hardware stores these days have a pretty decent selection once you sift through all the cordless drills and lumber so if you're a father whose family was brainwashed by big power tool into believing you wanted one of these for your last birthday you might have some unused
store credit to spend on a different kind of Hardware which raises the question what can you get from the local home desperate or its online counterpart to trick out your gaming setup a lot it turns out if you're inventive inventive like this totally original segue to our sponsor Ridge they've recently launched some out of this world NASA branded wallets and key cases one of the designs even glows in the dark can you do that check them out using the link in the description the most obvious PC related
items that you might expect to find are going to be desks and chairs and you won't be disappointed that is unless you look a little closer they sell many different combos for one convenient price like this uh 48 in Black computer desk and black plus pink massage recliner chair but well there's no charitable way to put this I'm afraid so yeah these combos from costway are seemingly all rebrands of Alibaba specials with gimmicks like head headr speakers and led piping accents let's take a look at it oh wow I
mean that's kind of cool but the fact that they edited out the brand name on the website is kind of telling um oh I was going to say it looks rather okay although it's a bit on kind of the smaller side compared to what you might think from the pictures but then I touched it it's not really an add aesque style chair you can't even shove it around but o oh it's  here oh my God it vibrates I can't really tell what the plus minus buttons are supposed to be doing or the up Arrow it just
stopped oh it's different kinds of pulses so yeah the massage feature is kind of great as a marketing gimmick but the massage aers or I mean vibrators realistically are only in the lumbar pillow here which conveniently is impossible to reposition or remove so in summary if you're in the market for a massage chair that includes back pain as a feature gyx has got you covered the really bizarre part though is even if the manufacturer doesn't know Home Depot should know that this isn't a desk chair
it uh it gets worse as it says on the script here don't let the faux carbon fiber fool you here folks oh no this desk makes the chair looks strong and competent by comparison oh wow okay the cup holder and oh headphone Mount kind of nice touches but other than that my friends oh wow we're looking at a pile of hollow metal and MDF that is held together with nothing more than poorly threaded hex screws and hope and once again there's more wrong with it than just the build
quality like look at the depth of this monitor shelf how am I supposed to put any Modern Display on this thing do do you want to know what we paid for it oh God I guess the desk and the chair are currently $320 that is far more than I would pay for those and we had to pay somebody to drive down to the United States to grab it and bring it back up and we had to pay for gas to match the look we've gone with the Apex Pro skeleton carbon fiber case from alpha cool that feels really bad or rather the case
itself feels great it's carbon fiber and machined aluminum but after Alpha cool generously provided it for the video it feels insulting to them to pair it with this awful desk the last major issue is that the desk and the chair are at two completely different heights so you'll either need to lift your chair which I remind you came with the desk up to match the height or you'll have to lower your desk somehow maybe with a hacksaw from the Home Depot or or what about this Nifty after market keyboard tray
due to the Cross brace that supports the top of the desk which I was kind of surprised to see we had to use some scrap pieces of wood to mount it but with this attached and this led desk mat to hide the spot where uh we accidentally drilled a little bit too far into the MDF we can now use our keyboard at a much more reasonable height oh I mean adjustable height oh what keyboard you ask originally we tried to get our hands on one of the mechanical keyboards that's listed on the Home Depot website but
they didn't seem to have any in stock when we went to make the purchase so instead oh thank you we got this iive 3in one pack with a keyboard mouse and headset you like 3D games well how do you like 6D games before we power everything up I assume this power strip came from the Home Depot yes it's even their commercial electric brand this is one of the things I actually would trust from what we purchased I assume we chose this particular one for its RGB effect oh there it is okay I mean yeah sure
that's kind of cool it's got the little Keyhole mounting thing so it'll be compatible with our cable management from LTT store.com so yeah you just unscrew it and then you've got this weird flared thing at the top here so you stick that into the keyhole slide it in and then  twist and that's it once I'm in this set man my back hurts yep like already yep I'm I'm shocked like I have spent extended periods of time sitting on a wooden box or on a bucket for shoots and I don't think I've
experienced this kind of like sharp back pain who knows though maybe the quality of these peripherals will make up for it oh wow this mouse is terrible I don't even have to whip it that hard to completely lose tracking oh my God I suck I can't hit anything you guys have seen me play FPS before I'm not this bad I swear it to you probably the most interesting thing about the peripherals is none of what I've talked about so far but rather when we look at them in USB device treeviewer we can see
that and this was for the keyboard right yes it was made at least in part by woi semico a brand that appears to be a subsidiary of CR micro a company that is primarily owned by the government of China I guess CCP officials really like drum and bass or at least half of it I don't know about drum they've got a lot of bass to their social credit they are pretty comfortable for a pair of really really cheap headphones we did buy another pair of headphones that just were the worst feeling so we went with
these but actually you want to try those second that second pair of headphones sure don't have to talk about it at all past the feeling of it but oh they're on  oh saved it the good news is even if we had broken this monitor we had the solution ready to go cuz frankly the ergonomics were not great the way it was that's why we picked up this PR mounts monitor arm wow I just about hit myself in the face with it because I was expecting it to be a lot heavier to its credit it's pretty easy to set up and
has reasonable cable routing built into it and supports monitors up to 32 in and 17 lb which should be perfect for this 27in Sansui monitor it's only 1080p which is not great considering the price but it has a 100 HZ refresh rate which also isn't great considering the price Tanner what is the price uh we paid 230 for it but if we had have bought it on Amazon it would have been uh 100 cool also I couldn't help noticing that there's a bit of Leverage on that yeah I'm afraid to let go uh this
actually might be a good time to introduce the speakers because the speakers have a nice little feature where they will help keep this up are they a counterweight not so much a counterweight as it is a loadbearing cardboard box if we can just there it doesn't quite fit uh I need shims should be able to just fit in there okay am I the only one confused by this first things first the volume control is on the subwoofer which is not normal and then second of all these speakers fire backwards that is correct
yes no that's not correct uh but the  the only difference that I can detect from turning the bass knob all the way left and all the way right is that this box vibrates more or less this is as loud as they get I have it maxed both on the speakers and in Windows it sounds so much better over here than it does over there it almost gives it a sense of like spatial though no I mean there's no accuracy to it obviously but it know kind of sounds like it's all around you cuz that's where it is instead of
pointing at you so this monitor claims 72% coverage of the ntsc color gamut that checks out I don't remember the last time I saw a modern monitor that was this unsaturated especially an IPS panel and 100 HZ is definitely better than 60 HZ at a low enough price I could see this monitor being a pretty okay choice at $220 it's horrible able the mouse is bothering me a little less oh if that's bothering you you should try out this oh the goal mut tree wearable pointing device Mouse okay hold on a
second what Hope Depot carries this after pairing to the gold Moon Mouse yam I am treated to this little what are these called again infrared trackers or something like that I I forget how these work I've always referred to them just as as BlackBerry trackpads I mean you know what that's fair yeah you got a little little trackpad thing here and then you got some buttons I guess for like web browsing web browsing or just general Mouse features I mean you've got right click middle click scroll up
scroll down yeah this is pretty usable can I game with it though oh yeah yeah yeah here we go let's go eat it for all its imperfections uh we did have some difficulty pairing it to a new device when it was in range of the old one it would just automatically connect every time with no obvious way to repair it to something new this is not nearly as crud as pretty much everything else that we've touched today I would say this is pretty usable if you had a situation that merited it this is not
one of them you know it's a funny thing how each individual piece of this is functionally manufactured garbage and yet when you put the whole thing together you almost end up with a hole that's greater than the sum of its parts it's kind of like a jury rigged scorpion chair maybe we should do a repeat of that experiment where we have someone use it for a month odds are they need a better webcam and oh yeah he's way ahead of me and a wow Monster Cable still exists 4K 60fps for gaming streaming vlogging and
social media this packaging is writing some checks that uh I sincerely that this webcam is going to be able to cash you know when your brand was already built on builing people out of way more money than your product's worth it's kind of impressive when you can take it to another level like this how is this managing to be out of focus right now and it's about to get better because I have the Audio Technica atg M1 USB sure it's not the best mic that you can get and not even the best mic that
you can get for $50 but I expect it to be a lot better than any of the other mics connected to this system Tanner would you mind let's get our game on Gamers oh that is permanently destroyed huh well I take back everything nice I ever said about the mounted there's no obvious other place to grab on to to adjust it like I'm pretty sure you're supposed to grab this dialog subtract at sub narrator window heading level sketch I don't think the computer likes when you do that so this is MDF and these are just
