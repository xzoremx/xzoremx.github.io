all right who's getting roasted today I've done my staff other influencers I've even done you guys me that's right we're flipping the script today the employees will be roasting you and the rest of the leadership team what like our home setups yeah but oh boy I guess this is where we find out what you really think of us this might be hard to watch hard to watch everyone loves a good oldfashioned punching up or in your case you know punching down that's like actually it's clean but it lacks RZ you're like
the head of Creator Warehouse cable manage all right well uh sit back relax and enjoy watching me get burned and watch me burn this segue to our sponsor MSI put on your aame thanks to their Crystal Clear 49in QD OLED monitor with its 0.3 gray to gr response time and 144 HZ refresh rate you can check it out using our Link in the video  I'm Nolan and my boss's boss is Colton but it used to be Nick what's the hardest part of working with Colton today he disappeared halfway through the
day I he just went home um to work to work from home to work from home would you say that you admire or fear your boss more I've never seen him get agitated at like somebody who he's managing I've seen him get agitated about like outside sources here in my garage you know what I value more than baller setups knowledge chill ones oh the chair I had a $179 Amazon Basics chair that I bought that why what a hypocrite he reviews chairs and this is what he uses you trust this guy I've got the Razer Viper
mini SC which I love I probably paid too much for it but great he used a $400 Mouse to place ball Gates 3 that's crazy CL built it for me to Portico some of the keys don't work but it's pretty good love that what do you think he uses that bin for spatoon what is the shoo on the inside of his case oh Colton you moved which means you had the opportunity to clean it those AO cables look so old that they're going to like burst and water damage his PC why would you ever submit this to be showing
off to someone his external hard drive is just sitting there like it's not plugged in if this is actually like wood with an epoxy pour that is look at the design in the epox oh that's super cool bro I like the arst KE Eevee that's cute I love that cute it's cool it's cute okay yeah we get it mhm it's the only thing he has to be proud of of the setup yeah oh let me show you 10 pictures of my keyboard that doesn't work properly yeah that looks a little sad that's like a computer desk chair yeah it's true
yeah I can't imagine sliding back and forth and then it go so it's only like what 20 steps if you want a game there's room man move the speakers is that not a box for cables yeah it sure is you're making good use of that thing oh come on it's right there like just put it here there's not many cables but you can see every one of them you know what I mean so like I give it a 6.5 it's nothing special but it's good and I'm going to give it a six I give it a a legitimate 6.9 it's not a seven I give it a six the
chair for me just ruins it way too much our boss is James if I had to describe James in one word it would be uh driven extraverted handsome wonderful you're such a brown noose he's like um randomly like freakishly athletic you turn your back at a writer quarterly get together and he's like doing a cartwheel and like a dive roll on the grass I don't know if James wants me to tell this story but I still think it's really funny and so I messaged him I said hey I'm going to
flex the last 15 minutes tomorrow I will be going to the vet appointment to put down my cat James replied Flex isn't allowed in such small increments I believe it has to be an hour can you do an adjusted shift and I said okay that works for me there are definitely days where like I can tell he's like more upset because he's just busy if I had to fight him I fear Him yeah like socially I admire him o okay I'm sensing a theme here very dark and Moody that carpet though but I
definitely want to lie down on it you know really oh yeah don't you do you still want to lay on this carpet no not anymore is it just not against the wall no he wants it on the carpet or something James is the kind of guy who cares about scratching his floor I'm worried I see the computer I wonder if it's on the carpet on the bottom right dude again with the chair James is someone who's all about like Ergo and posture and you have this no desk pad or mouse pad whatsoever is a little concerning to me
is little fingerprints from the dust is that a scale what is he measuring under his desk why there though hey he got let's go so that this could just blow out the picture okay I get it it's a bright light James what is he playing playing clean your goddamn desktop holy probably 90% of this are Chrome links you're a psycho what is this this this this this use a fter I guarantee you he sits at this desk maybe 1 hour a week look in the bottom right corner yeah he hasn't even activated windows for for this
monitor this mouse is there's a there's a mismatch here if it works it works you know you got to stop stop defending people no no no I'm saying it's it's it's it's goofy but you know this is roasting our managers and you're just like yeah I don't want to get fired so he just doesn't care unless he has to maybe he has to work from home for some reason we know the rest of it the whole theater banging he's got he's got the the I think he gets points huge SVS sub doesn't it look a little bit like it's
from the bathroom of a clover something like that what do you rate his it's the lowest yet wa I mean there's no mouse pad and the chair I can't imagine sitting that it's a 4.8 if you just switched the mouse out for almost anything else I would probably bump it up a whole point uh I got to go five five yeah this is pretty bad I think this is worse than Colton's I think this is I think it's is seven this is luses you can watch a million videos on this it's nice this is definitely the
cleanest one it's the cleanest because he didn't assemble most of I think the way he has the basement laid out is sick a huge inspiration for my upgrade about putting all my machines in a server rack was because he had done it like eight years ago in his old house I love I love this Vibe I mean there's so much stupid stuff about this the fact that it's in another room the fact that like maybe every four months we have to go over there and fix it for him also has not activated Windows that's the secret Labs
chair we have at work that I hate with all my heart and soul sorry I'm too short for it and so my legs don't like bend around the seat so it's not secret Labs don't cancel me we have this horrible culture here where nobody actually cable manages anything I edited the video where they set this up rough boss man you you made Cable Management products MCM LT store.com this guy Scrolls Facebook Marketplace as a hobby he Scrolls it as a job every time I go into a script review he's like oh just wait I have you
seen this thing on Facebook Market Place I'm like no lus I have to work today like you can't tell especially if for hidden in behind the TV I know that it can be this is mounted to the unit yeah what lonus did what video did yeah I we'll rate it the highest so far at 88 because you spent too much money still because all the employees you had to hire to actually do this for you I'll give it a nine nine we pour so much of our resources into it better be a 10 okay it's like a seven I would enjoy
it's clean but it lacks Riz our boss is Nick my boss's boss is Nick H working for Nick he is uh super hardworking and everything that he does making sure that we're able to launch all the products that we do sometimes he's like missing Mia but you know that's Nick he's just running around everywhere doing a lot of things for CW lmg what's the thing about working with Nick that's the hardest sometimes he shares a different perspective on things there's some fashion projects like Zip
off shorts like he's like oh my God guys need these and I'm like I get it for the guys who go fishing but maybe sometimes for the rest of the audience I'm like hm that might be something that we need to mul over a little bit more instead of like like going for it the hardest part for me of working with Nick is convincing him he's wrong sometimes wow browsing the Reddit so he really hates his mental health wait how many those excels actually yeah holy crap nail clippers oh he's got a plank
glass it's already up there for me I love it I wonder what stream is he watching he's watching virtual that's pretty cool you know I give him points for that that looks a lot like a passport put it somewhere else your first B baby that's so cute oh my God yeah and doesn't the baby look like that Meme as well the like the brother ew you're like the head of Creator Warehouse cable manage this is going to be a tripping Hazard soon for the baby what is this duct the head my god get yourself some
new ones no hey at least it's black I think the funniest thing is that all of our bosses are so godamn cheap seriously hello one RGB thing the face of your demons oh my God dust P totally can yeah these are the desks we have at work I bet you he got these desks for free 100% do a bit more cleaning but he's a busy dad totally fair totally fair do you have to have it shining like that at an angle get storage units and put all of your stuff in the drawer uh ugly ass dbrand skin um on the laptop all the
sponsors today D Brand's got some good looking stuff but I hate it this looks like the best chair out of the lot so far even though it sucks so you do have storage you just don't use it oh he's got the Lululemon hat cuzz if it's not LT he's in Lululemon this one ah yeah yeah yeah oh he's got other so many this is at like iight for him up here that's what you see so you just like don't notice this take take two seconds just just just just just tight just tidy it up oh so then like this is like the Zoom
meeting background right yeah that looks good I'd rate this setup a 6.5 s out of 10 actually um just based on the the Shelf here and the mess those are easy fixes four dang to be fair do you know what I'd rate my setup like a three or a two like I don't my setup sucks dang I'm giving this a seven oh wa okay I think that huh I like a livable ah no you know what I'm giving it a six and a half now that I think about it a little bit more okay Taran a lot of cables why does this give me like college Vibes super
off-centered monitor super offset photo the other way cable management is awful that's the big takeaway from this is that people just don't really about their cable management at all oh my God colle Potter's got goals yeah his goals are to Cable manage his setup yeah holy crap you can tell he's old holy why do you proudly have this on display is that a ruler underneath what are you measuring at your desk Taran is that Skype yeah that is Skype why I have not seen one of these things in like
forever but I'm sure PE people in the comments will be like oh I use this on the regular what are you talking about what is that Wilson gets a little bit annoyed kicks the volleyball what is he kicking it at just the wall if this power supply has its fan down it's I'll give this one a 5.5 clean it up a bit make it look a little bit more updated not like from college maybe a six and a half I'll give him an extra half point a five cuz it's not nothing centered that's not centered okay sure
I'll go six our boss is edel what's it like to work for edzel it's a very intense experience sometimes I feel like as a general everything here happens incredibly quickly how would you describe edzel in one word have you met  brick yeah solid guy to this day I have not seen the man eat a full meal I can agree that yeah I've never seen him eat anything would you say that you admire or fear edel Moore oh definitely fear are they the only two op op by default I'm like an anxious person M I fear
Nicole more than Ed when somebody has a thing for knives you'd walk into the editing day all you hear was knives opening and closing wow that's a lot of super glue his man just huffing glue and doing knife tricks at his desk all day there's a lot of clutter but it's not like gross clutter like it's giving he just uses his space a lot how high is he sitting like the bottom of that top monitor is De cut off that that this second speaker placement oh my God it is centered like behind the monitor
please I like the whole yeah the set up there you know what I mean oh this is Vancouver after the big one holy crap he's missing his entire like back panel why did you even B look at how bad this is okay so he does have a 3D printed GPU Mount M so it is a little bit supported that's that's good what would you rate this one a five oh really I'd go higher I was going to go a seven Hi I can't see his chair respect where it's du he did not clean up the photo to try and look good that's
true he just said this is me baby I give it a three ooh this gets like an eight what yeah I don't know I'm like K got 6 and a half from me he could tied you up a bit more and Nicole what do you like so much about this and eight a pretty high score I want everything at my fingertips this is practicality at its best my bosses Luke he's kind of scary like he'll he'll be like cuz he's so busy he doesn't have time to like schedule some of his meetings so he's like come out to the
conference room now and I'm like okay and I go up I'm like oh no am I in trouble he's like so how's it going and I'm like I both fear and respect him man the bezels on that right monitor are chunky this is like line of setup what with a soul is this just someone who cleaned before taking the photos though oh for sure yeah okay yeah also with the exact same wallpaper like repeated I don't know why that freaks me out wo this is different this is different I was hoping to find something to roast
you for because we went pretty hard on our viewers in the roasting viewers setup this looks good though it is nice oh also based you can't even get that at Canada so he definitely stole that from the office keyboard looks cute and the uh Artisan on the keyboard matches the deskpad and his PC which is pretty cool their setups really Vibe with each other like if you go back and look at the backgrounds they're both like green it matches the energy of the room there's like the plant there's the lamp I bet he
can oneand that water bottle which is not easy if you want to do the oneand challenge go to LTG store.com and pick yourself up a Chun bottle it's  full the power stand who's that man that's how I want my beard to be it's just like hair just all like the extension all the way around you know is that crooked oh oh orientation of the couch to the TV yeah it's not right who sits like that maybe it fit the space but then they realize that there was the heater there and they didn't they can't
put you don't want to put your couch right in front of your electric heater that's like actually criminal I can definitely tell like where their priorities are it's like gaming first everything else second cuz they've even sacrificed their kitchen island for the PC setup it's the best yet absolutely if you know you're not going to go outside this is fine I'm still going to give it 9 out of 10 I mean this is like an 8.9 for me yeah oh this is a nine for sure eight and a half just because of like
the thoughtfulness of the space and also just like the overall Vibes being really cozy and comfy like is it the most like super instagrammable like Luke's setup is an 8.5 out of 10 for me Luke's setups just for the PCS mhm is a 10 out of 10 for me the couch and TV on its own I would give it like a four out of 10 teren I think shocked me the most just because CEO is maybe just a title you expect like pristine desk that cable management sucked I think my opinion of Taran has like changed quite a bit not
quite a bit but it it is I did not expect this from Taran Colton's I I expected maybe we just don't know Taran enough Taran you want to go for lunch damn it I same I the exact same thing no I asked first I asked first no no no mebe I can't believe they're my superiors no I'm joking no no I don't think I would be able to guess it if I didn't see the name oh yeah for sure but I would not edel I yeah okay I'd guess edil yeah they all look like normal people's desks and like except for the one that's
except for luses yeah but I already knew what luses looked like yeah all right you guys got us pretty good but I will say you forgot to give the people something very important this segue to our sponsor delete me are you fed up with all those scam calls like no Randy I don't want to buy a vacation package for 400 especially at 7:00 a.m. in the morning I'd like to stay home in bed please if you're ever wondering how your information got leaked in the first place it's probably thanks to one of
