show we've got a great great show lined up for you guys today only the best show for you guys I forget what our headline topic is but Amazon is going to be taking on shien and teu with a new sub20 Amazon haul also our headline topic I am less stupid than some people think I am I didn't say by no I didn't say by much oh yeah I didn't say by much just less just less uh new business apparently pretty cool what else we got going on this week uh if you go to websites on boxes it might be a good or
bad week for you depends on what you think about certain websites uh I'm going to leave that as vague as it is the wicked thing oh I mean it's in it's in main news topics I know but there's literally only really we're getting pornographic within the first minute of two things in main news topics going to take both of them okay told them it was a good show it's not necessarily bad it's just a news topic hot take we're not saying the matter is good or bad all right just what else we got
let's get the intro going geez and this is this is I think objectively bad Sony employees allegedly selling personal data of  way to go Luke the show is brought to you today by Squarespace Ridge rocket money and of course our chair partner secret lab our laptop partner LG and our rap partner dbrand uh why don't we jump into not our headline topic oh and why don't we talk about the channel hiatus from this week yeah we should probably get that uh kicked out as as quickly as possible I want to preface this by
saying that we will not and have not and are not going to be commenting on anything to do with Personnel changes here at the company that is our policy and that's the way it's going to be so with that in mind then um I've got a a small FAQ that I can go through with you guys and that is about all we're going to be able to say about it so one what happened this week um we put three channels on Hiatus Tech quickie game link and Mac address um for the past year and a half uh ever since sort of
our our week of reflection uh we've had extensive discussions about ways that we can improve our operations and function more smoothly as a company we've spent that time working through operational and communication challenges that we've faced realistically since our hyper growth period from about 2020 to 2022 2023 and even before that um we've learned a lot during this time and we feel that refocusing and refreshing is the best path forward for the long-term success of the company and even those
channels um two what do you have planned for these channels uh the Hiatus is to allow our team to evaluate and refocus uh three is lmg becoming evil and corporate um and the answer here is if anything I think a little bit of corporate responsibility is long overdue um some business management experience was brought in for a good reason I mean we we brought Taran in to kind of take a look at things so that we would actually have a full-time CEO instead of a like when I have time for it CEO we did all
of that before uh the August controversy last year uh we did it for a good reason uh We've allowed unsustainable business practices to carry on for far too long in our past and this has caused significant issues to morale to growth to audience sentiment um that are just they're they're they're unacceptable and uh we we need to streamline things uh number four is can we give suggestions about what we want to see happen on these channels in the future and the answer is totally uh acceptable places
for that would be the lench tips.com Forum uh we'd love to see the yeah we'd love to see your suggestions on the subreddit as well but it's a little more ephemeral you know harder to deal with a little harder for us to track down in the future uh but the LTT Forum would be would be the best part and that's it that's all I have to say about that yeah why don't we jump right into oh man what do you want to do oh my business yeah my business isn't stupid one of the top comments on just
about every video about smash Champs the the the badminton gym SL Lan gaming center is is that really like is that a business like is that a thing like what what to be fair I think you have even said publicly in the past that you don't suspect it's going to be like a super profitable Endeavor you just kind of want it to pay for itself yeah yeah yeah yeah but I I I had a high degree of confidence that it would do that yes and it seems like that confidence has not been echoed by members of the community
one of the top comments is also that it seems very cheap uh well we'll talk about that we'll talk about we'll talk about that but first a quick review of Smash chams minus' new badminton facility from Mark makes jet leg games sorry what's that now it's not that quick oh yeah it's really not that quick a short summary that you have to scroll through made the drive today to give it a to give it a try my usual spots were full there's a soft opening so you can register for a drop in session uh I
booked online and paid with their system okay I worried based on pictures that parking would be an issue but the lot was huge so that was no issue drop in was $12 which seem seems pricey but you get 3 hours at Prime Time and the courts are super cheap the courts are way nicer uh the videos they posted don't do it justice it's beautiful and bright the change room especially stood out to me the courts were fantastic comfortable bright without lights in your eyes and easy to see the shuttle in lines I felt
like I played a lot better defense than normal this may have had an effect on that who knows actually it's probably more to do with the high ceilings but we can talk about that some other time uh apparently the delay for opening was some kind of manufact in defect on the courts um it seems fine but hey good job committing to the highest standards and blah blah blah how drop in works the Pro Shop seemed fine the pricing isn't anything special yeah fair enough uh all in all I was very impressed and I would
love to make it a regular location but uh it's far for me so okay y fair enough uh yeah so that was pretty cool pretty cool to see we haven't opened up reviews on Google Maps yet I read this whole thing so I thought it was cool as well cuz we're not open yet we're still soft open um and I don't think anyone I don't think it's really occurred to anyone to leave a review on Facebook um but yeah it's it's exciting to see it not you know be totally uh totally totally dunked on I think the team's been
working really hard I think they've been doing a really great job and uh it's worth noting that any comments on pricing ignore because this is soft opening pricing uh and I don't know that it will remain exactly the way that it is in the longer term yeah um random comment on the like I feel like I played defense better thing if you feel like you're in a better environment you'll often Placebo yourself into doing better so like that is potentially even a thing even if we're not accounting for the high
ceiling that probably isn't it though so most of the centers in Richmond have lower ceilings and the impact that that has on the game is it speeds it up and the reason for that is twofold one is that when you lift up and when you clear when you hit all the way to the back line um you are hitting lower so it's a shorter time for the opponent to react and hit it back so it speeds up the game that way and then the other impact is that it changes the angle of the shuttle so that you are far more likely to
strike the cork directly so you think he was playing better defense because shots were going like all the way to the roof hold on hold on I'll get to that okay so it it changes the angle that the shuttle will uh that your racket will impact the shuttle so you hit the cork first instead of it dropping straight down and hitting the feathers and then the cork which absorbs some of the power so what happens is if you have a higher ceiling people are more likely to hit it up
higher giving you more time to get into position to defend and then the other impact is that it is more likely to be falling straight down making it more difficult for your opponent to generate power interesting so your defense is probably better because you can see better because you have more time and because your opponent is having a harder time time generating power now your opponent having a harder time generating power does not mean that like our facility is bad cuz the ceilings are too
high it means the other ones are too low and people are more easily generating too much power um in fact for international play uh you should have a ceiling height of at least 32 feet which is about uh I think it's what is the smash one I forget we're 32 feet yeah so um so yeah pretty cool very excited um all right I think it's time though for us to change the subject to talking about Elijah week and we have a special guest here on the W show the one the only David Ivonne oh we both went for the same
joke nice do we yeah is there a mic or am I just supposed to walk on wait yeah does he have a mic there is holy crap oh look at that soft opening you say wow what soft opening about Bon s yeah but you're going to I was just read com been six seconds you're going to make you're going to make a soft opening while you got this joke while you got this in your hand at least use two hard one Topic's on brand is his mic on I mean does it matter it is but you guys can't hear give me one sec no that's
fine that's fine it's got to get it's got to get warmed up just give them a minute so what are we uh we're ining Elijah week right no not the top Elijah you're going to get I need to talk to Ariana after this going to hate everybody or everybody's going to hate you no they love you no they don't they'll hate me for telling you not to rub it actually did you know the uh what did you know the trailer for Elijah week has the most dislikes what really out of all the other wow what a polarizing figure he is
I think it was because we kind of like everyone was wanting Sarah week after she did that pumpkin carving stream and then the next announcement being my week everyone was like no so it's not that you're unpopular it's just that you're less popular correct all right cool that's okay so yeah Elijah week happened there's three videos up on float plane you can go watch right now oh it's it happened yeah it already happened apparently they're having me after cuz if I went before it would probably you
know make people unsubscribe so they wanted to at least let it finish before um but you can meet the team which is me that's hi I'm here there was another one which was me showcasing my very first script this script I did not get hired because of I want to I haven't watched this yet but I want to watch this the upload what do you mean by that so I applied for the writing position back in late 2021 oh you didn't work here in late 2021 correct I worked here in 2023 so either I missed the email like for a
whole year or yeah awkward yeah was really bad my bad um I okay just quick introduction I un ironically and if you're out there sorry I unironically had someone respond to an email from me from 2019 which was progressing them to the next stage of the interview process with the things that they needed to give me for that step no note of like sorry this is so many years late or anything just here you go and I was like I mean they got your attention that's in I don't I'm not hiring that
role anymore yeah but if you were we have a great person in there I'm very happy with how that person's been doing I just it's like I it actually blew my mind I I I sat there looking at it for like an embarrassingly long period of time trying to figure out like did I do something wrong like is this actually am I reading something is this a newer email it's like you've been married your for years you have like three children and this like guy you asked to prom is like yo hey let's go I am so down to go
to prom with you this isn't happening anymore this is over any oh that's great and also you horribly like oh my God man attending the 20-year reunion I got to tell you some people like man do they ever do they ever age on like a very graceful curve and then man some people it's just like hit a wall it's a yeah that's that's rough that's rough I'm I'm I'm sorry for you my 10 reion is next year I'm scared to go are you going definitely not so he's too cool to go we discussed this last
week I just I'd be too famous you know see this is what I'm talking about oh my god that hurt me to say I'm sorry this is what I'm talking about do you think reunions like that are of diminished value now that we have like highly connected social media cuz I think so now that like Facebook is a thing I don't think I've always thought that the idea of reunion from people from high school is useless because if I wanted to stay friends with you I would have stayed friends with you too cool like no
I I don't know I was friends with no one in high school so like why do I want to go back to a bunch of people bullied me like I don't it's also kind of fair if that's your experience no he's above it I am he's risen he's like the  anyways uh the last video on Elijah week was Creator versus Super Fan cringe cringe name we both said it was cringe when we started filming nice um Sammy definitely stacked the questions in Linus's favor no he didn't even but if you haven't gone and watched it you should still go
he didn't even I love this look on your face the confidence of you and me being  it feels like it's just a random slide from the video I think all three them are just random slides from the video are you going to explain what Creator versus Super Fan even is or you just going to leave them that figured out no basically um what happened was based on the Sam upgrade video we did a couple months ago there was one snippet in that video where lonus mentioned that I have an encyclopedic knowledge of LT and
everything and like our videos I've been surprised by this a few times no but but it's it's a thing it's actually like it's a thing Jam today yeah and I got an answer tell you what tell you what why don't you come on my podcast and instead of me talking you talk that sounds good it is Elijah week I that's a pretty good point no no no I was I was no I was trying to I was trying to I was trying to pump you up I was trying to fluck your it's like high school again what's going
on what's up talking bad about me no one's talking bad about you Sammy you're doing great yeah we're not talking bad about you right now not right now that was before you're doing great um go watch the fight okay I'm I'm working anyway what I was going to say was and why are you here there's literally been times when we've been looking for like a prop or like a a product and Elijah will be like yeah there's that video like 2 years ago where you guys used it and we like go
and it's like still there like that has actually happened so so his his knowledge of our videos is actually unsurpassed or at least that was the theory yes where where does your encyclopedic knowledge begin oo I would say Langley house I watched during NC days but I would say I mean you were like nine yeah exactly so I would say that I was became kind of a hardcore just watching LTT every day when you guys were in the Langley house that was a very based period of time to
be watching every day I remember when you guys passed a million everyone agrees that the content was better then and has only been downhill since then 100% whole room water Coen too let's do it I mean who even are these like ancillary characters we have now what the is an Elijah I remember when in the Langley house we we started he's a prophet for the first time and it was like controversial we did what sorry we started videos for the first time oh I know super controversial
you know what sucks about that though I used to be like so good at ad libing and I suck now like I have to do multiple takes of things I used to have some of that that's for that's for losers because of uh hosting live at shows and now I don't have it anym yeah dude it's it is it's a thing that you can practice and you can get really really good at like the whole getting a product briefing on something and being like okay shut up turning to the camera and nailing it like and then doing like
eight more of them in the same day yeah you can practice it but if you don't practice it it doesn't matter how good you are it doesn't matter how experienced you are it is not like riding a bike yeah okay Elijah could do it someday maybe I'll ride a bike that was no I was alluding to that you don't know how to ride a bike wear helmet oh yeah well that was actually Up For Debate being the third video on Elijah week I had pitched backflip tutorial Colton had denied that uh yeah which
why did you even ask Colton I didn't I asked I asked Sammy and I I said we should beg for forgiveness instead of asking permission absolutely not what if what if they went to like a gymnastics center I don't care look he's talked about this publicly already so I'm not disclosing personal medical information that he hasn't already put on the internet for some reason Elijah has had half a dozen concussions which is bad literally the last one had to relearn his own birthday I'm dude listen I'm
building so when I say back flips it is coming from an extremely serious place and I am I am saying that is not happening at work or for work or for clo on my watch I'm building resistance though the more concussions you have not how it works F news that's obviously fake news don't believe that please for the love please very much the opposite really so when I'm talking about this and I'm like no Elijah is not allowed to do back flips it's not a meme I'm not meing I'm 100%
serious but no but yeah I mean why was  trailer I don't think he to be fair I didn't know Sammy recorded that I didn't know that he was putting it in that video saw it dad my dad had a he had a thing that he used to say to me okay and I'm probably revealing more about my childhood than I ever have before but he used to say you're cruising for a Bruisin what does that mean can you show us I'll let you figure it out Dan cover the camera oh God so uh anyways no back flips oh no l is please don't get blood
on the set do you know how hard it is to get blood out of this carpet I mean look since we're being very honest right now why don't we just reveal why we have a rap sponsor for the show oh yeah to cover the table oh just in case something gets this would probably make it easier to clean too I don't know about that but I'm assuming D br's skins clean very easily  cloth over a thousand men tested man hours tested fortunately fortunately no one's seeing this because everyone's
watching the Jake Paul versus Mike Tyson fight because otherwise we are so cancelled right now well they'll watch the VOD so we're we're screwed either way we can delete the VOD we're good no that's true we can do that no it goes up I was actually asked to come on here not only to promote uh Elijah week but apparently talk about one of the topics oh did you want to talk about it why' you pick that one I have a screenshot from James that says am I allowed to say the p word like corn oh am I allowed to say
that um of course you picked that one okay I'll say yeah because of course he did no I didn't I gu's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] degenerate no no no listen listen listen listen it's literally he's he's owned it to the point now where we can't even criticize him for it anymore I already forgot about that whole topic so I was really trying to be like what one would he have picked I no I sent I sent James a couple and I was like here's the ones that like I'm fine and comfortable talking about on on stream and he said
how about we go with seafood he said pick the corn one that's on that's on brand for Elijah you can say prawn prawn okay we'll go with seafood sure so this is a very seafoody topic um why don't I do just the talking points and then we'll open it up to discussion I'm sure you'll have some thoughts react oh the oh I know about it the original article is from The Verge also CNBC basically this has been reported on Wicked originally a Broadway musical by the way excellent so good is getting a
theatrical release on November 22nd toy company Mattel released a variety of dolls and other toys which pun intended were for purchase in stores and online retailers on the packaging was a link to a website www. please don't go there right now especially not at work or if you're in a family setting uh well you know what I'll just say this www.the nameof theh show.com I'm just going to not say it which led to uh not um not the show well it's a show of sorts a different show a seafood show um
don't link it in chat mik stop it you guys I've got it on my third monitor stop to be fair I did fact check this at work so sorry Luke um just wanted to I was joking wait did you actually no of course not I'm not psycho so the link  was I will not the intended link shut up shut up shut up the intended link was wicked movie.com so that one we can check okay we're going to go don't share the screen just in case we're going to go to Wicked movie. and hopefully nothing bad will
happen Okay we're good all right okay Wicked movie.com November 22nd everything is okay and we're still live on Twitch Mattel has since apologized for this and removed the toys from online storefronts quote parents are advised that the misprinted incorrect website is not appropriate for children or Elijah the sorry I added the last bit however the removal of the toys didn't stop scalping from trying to buy what remained on physical shelves flipping  "$2,100 to be fair I don't know if any"
sold yet let's open up let's open up for discussion here um our first discussion question is do you think this type of thing happens often in media and we just don't hear about it necessarily EG phone numbers addresses or or other uh you know placeholder info or or or supposedly fake info do you think this happens all the time I actually put a note in there this happened in one of our videos where we we had put a placehold or something is this the encyclopedia knowledge thing or
were you a part of it I was a part of it and it became a big thing after what was this I'm not going to say the exact video because I don't want people to try to Archive like go back and find it or whatever but there was an address in a video that we had put that was supposed to be fake like a 1 2 3 4 fake Street except fake street is an ual it ended up being a real place and we we didn't realize it until a day later because someone had left a comment it was one comment on the video like no one else
had decided to go check this and we did check it but we must have either misspelled it or got it wrong or something but then all of a sudden I get a message that said is this an issue and  probably it was some random address you got to you got to just use uh 1600 Pennsylvania the like White House address yeah my my my official address on Netflix is still the White House really I I wouldn't be surprised if they mail like pamphlet things addressed to me at the white house every once in a
while I I I and the the thing is I haven't only done that on Netflix there's some sites that'll automatically block it if they see that but that's been on a bunch of sites so that like they almost certainly have speaking of the White House that's another famous example of uh the importance of top level domains oh yeah do you not know about this one it's white house.gov yeah that's that's the right one yeah don't don't go to any other tldd someone linked it is it bad oh yeah yeah please
remove it well it it was it they said it used to be yeah it used to be it used to be you're getting close it used to be a seafood website W there's a lot of them out there well seafood's very popular oh most of the internet is seafood I hear the fourth most visited website is a seafood website is it it's it's it's in the top 10 I know it Peak at four at one point that's that's a little TGA Friday's unlimited shrimp and I know in the top 20 there's like three or four that would be a really interesting dive
actually what happened to the internet during Co like how did people change how they use the internet when they were all stuck at home there is an amazing we could have a whole series we could call it divers and look into the things that happened on the internet Seafood divers trends there's an amazing graph for twitch when Co happened dur twitch it's like oh yeah we're slowly growing and then April like just like DED it was insane yeah but yeah do you think this happens in any
other media though can you think of any other examples like uh I've heard of this type of thing happening before um but I don't I don't have examples off the top of my head I don't know if this one is true but um apparently uh there was a tip line that the the US military published it was accidentally like a like a a pay per minute phone line uh I I have not validated that but it it wouldn't really surprise me that much because a lot of those uh high-priced like 1 1800 like paid numbers were that
so if you were to accidentally typo it uh it would be pretty easy for it to be one of those um okay and then going into question two though what do you think how long do people have to hold on to these domains or phone numbers yeah so that was my discussion question that I that I put in because in some cases it can be uh a situation where you you publish printed materials so whether it's on a package for a product or whether it's on a pamphlet or whether it's on who knows a sticker like it
doesn't matter um I come across all the time whenever we look at anything retro like like games for example Nintendo helplines they'll have help support lines they'll have websites how long is like the statute of limitations for having to having to keep paying for that domain I mean not every website can be freaking spacejam.com okay Space Jam uhoh uh oh what's going to load is this the White House no way you told me to not go to it and you went to it yeah I said not to I said I went
to.org Space Jam is spacejam.com is down  no way it like tried to redirect me to Space Jam new Legacy like the like the new one I didn't know that spacejam.com was down you got to go to spacejam.com 1996 oh that sucks it does kind of suck cuz did did they do a new movie or something yeah they Legacy yeah yeah apparently it was like not very good but like realistically was the original one really good I don't know I didn't I didn't rewatch it in my in my Nostalgia glasses it's good don't worry Luke I'm
with you but I'm not going to rewatch it just in case it's actually garbage honestly don't even know I I don't think I've seen the whole first one seen it great but it hasn't held up in my opinion yeah all right um so yeah so how how long should they be responsible for continuing to pay the renewal fees for a domain would you have to just like pay up front for that whole time or something to like prove that you're actually going to do it cuz you can buy 100-year domains right like I understand
it's expensive and especially if you're getting like I don't know x.com because that's going to cost a million dollars or whatever but at that point if you're launching some big product and getting a new uh new domain name for it you should buy a 100 years sure but why should you have to do that we don't I don't even yeah we don't we have we've had domains  on oh yeah we apparently still have this um when I was doing an EV I had so many questions about that D um this is
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] your wallet.com which we included in one of our videos uh ages ago as so many questions whoops hold on did I what just happened okay H yeah there we go okay it's working now so this was included in one of our videos like a bazillion years ago and is just a simple little game uh where you dodge the expensive products uh there's razor laptops hey why does your why does the money spent go up even if you don't touch the product uh I don't know you're just spending money
because we live in a society yeah your wallet right okay so it's like rent and yeah so it's razor laptops iPhones and red cameras that just come flying out of nowhere and you have to try to dodge genely really hard oh it's it's super hard it's easier on a bigger screen you're also on a trackpad and I'm on a trackpad so but some of them some of them come in they they they those red cameras come in hot brother they they comeing in real hot and I think the red camera Target you so
you have to be constantly moving if you  dodge oh god um so like this is a this is a question that I legitimately have how long do I have to keep paying for this stupid domain because we made a video with this joke in it like these are iPhone 7S or something like this is from like seven years ago we should make a mirror of LTD store.com where everything's just like 10 times the price and then just redirect that to it see if anyone buy anything can the going forward cuz if someone that would help
cover our our like old domains and like there's there's lots of domains that we've bought over the years cuz we've like I don't know thought like did we buy makeup for bros.com I think so I think we might have bought that at some point cuz I thought it'd be like a cool Channel idea like 12 years ago like like men's makeup tips and stuff cuz men's makeup was totally becoming a thing yeah um we bought uh uh adequate um adequate video service yeah we bought adate vide service.com I remember some videos where
you jokingly said a URL and then at the end of the video I hear you go please go buy that right now and then I went to it and it just redirects to LTT store so like every time you crack a joke and I think part of it also let some of those go over the years sure but I think part of it also though is like if you do say that or claim it and then people who trust you are trying to go to them in the case Wicked you don't want it to be malicious you don't want it to go to something you also don't want someone to
be able to get it and and set up a site that looks like yours yeah that's one of the reasons that we've stopped Ming on like coming up with domain names on the show because people would buy them and it became like a thing and they would redirect them to LTT store or to the for or whatevering that we would say that it did that yep and then conceivably I don't think anyone ever did this not that I'm aware of but conceivably after we talk about it they could I know of a singular bad example you do okay so so
they could they could take that domain and they could they could use it to harvest data they could redirect it to somewhere malicious um and we would be we would be we would feel bad about it whether we're responsible for that or not I don't know I'm not a lawyer and you're not a cop so who knows but but but I but I'd feel hurt in my feelings these so we don't so we don't do that anymore that's fair all right well someone just said where is it one sec someone just said adequate service.com should redirect a
flow plane it does and that one we own so it's fine and I don't think we're going to get rid of that one because I keep telling Luke that I want I I've wanted it for years to be like something that if people dug deep enough into float plan's sort of workings they could like find it does it actually like run any Services right now remember this I think at one point we like thought about it I don't remember if we actually did it or not okay I still want it to yeah that's FL adequate video [Laughter]
service old joke but it checks out well cool okay is this he wanting to leave I don't know if I'm suppos I feel like I'm like Elijah's dad he's trying to get off the phone well I don't want I don't want to overstay my welcome I'll stay here all day if you guys need me to I just don't want to overstay my welcome sounds good okay bye okay I had to change because of him we were wearing the exact same clothes oh oh wow really you had a red sweater and we we both had the cargo pants oh wow
what sweater are you wearing the oh I actually don't know the name really I just got get given to me okay it's like a tell you what Elijah it's like a um what's on the front of it a plant a tree okay and what's it made of wires okay try again try again cables try again both technically correct thanks Dan starts with a C well cables starts with C CI it starts with a K does not Circ there you go so it's a what yeah it's a tree that's made of circuits okay try it in the other order it's a circuit that's
made to look like a tree okay now reduce now shorten it it's a circuit that looks like a tree reduce  tree that's so good it's good so yeah we were we were accidental twins today we even are both wearing black shoes with white Souls I can't get my leg that high yeah which is why I don't let him do back flips oh my God so I can do a backflip I believe you I don't wish for you to show me no I don't want you to show me okay you can that's on the under table camera for bye bye was a pleasure
where do I put this just on the ground floor matt man says OMG Elijah I want wanteded to believe he was being deliberately obtuse I don't know sometimes the brain just doesn't do stuff muted who's muted which one were muted you're not he's a cute a okay get out of here I'm reping that go go watch your fight I'm reporting that oh no small angle all right want to One V one me umy wallet.com oh wow um Dan do you want to set a timer uh yeah sure I wonder if I still feel this is going to be really hard on
track I wonder if I still have that timer for the wheel of paint okay no hold on we'll have to start at the same time but yeah you can warm up get warmed up get warmed up can I do this as an overlay they we're doing this oh no oh no it starts to go off the rails so fast Okay one minute timer oh dude he's got it look at look at is that a one minute timer a two minute timer you could just time it on your phone are you ready okay so we'll we'll press F5 to start yeah and then can you show our
screens uh do you have that power you might need a seig what camera are you on right now you can also just switch between us we go layers and then we go dude if you just stand in one spot you spend a lot of money uh yeah the reds man the Reds the reds are pretty they're pretty brutal they they're going to get you those Reds they they add up real fast okay that looks good enough to me it's so hard on the trackpad oh look at this guy he's such a sweaty gamer that he has to wipe his hands off before he plays
yeah literal sweaty gamer yeah all right let's do this thing I I hadn't I hadn't thought about this site in so long what's hosting it I don't know I mean you tell me I think this is like way pre the infra team it's probably on like some Jake thing you think so probably oh that actually kind of makes sense that's hilarious well who even made this game I have no idea I don't remember anymore I don't think it was my group are you sure I I immediately started questioning that in my head when it came up on
screen but I I don't I actually I actually don't remember this was so long ago some Jake thing ouch that's not an ouch yeah he just has a lot of different things I can't really like Define it who can keep track of it uh okay Dan that's that's good enough just set a timer on your phone it's fine no you just have to call it and then it counts down see oh brilliant it's countdown that's what you wanted right yeah brilliant okay ready yeah yeah 3 2 1 F5 here we go here we go
here oh God oh God I got hit by I got hit by Two Reds already dude I am like done I don't think I I will never  this you can't you can't hang out at the edges you got oh I got hit by another red I'm dodging I'm dipping I'm weaving I'm trying I'm making oh no oh my god look guys this is way way harder oh shoot it's way harder than it looks I think I was doing better before I was competing okay hold on I'm 20 seconds oh crap that's so long no okay okay shoot Focus I'm pretty sure he's crushing me
oh my God two more iPhones 10 seconds two more iPhones another razor blade oh oh oh my goodness I had three three RED cameras come for me two one and the wheelers look "$300,000 spent to Linus's 930,000 I got" hit by so many RED cameras all right you can get rid of that H that's going to take like half an hour sorry GG oh yeah that makes sense uh okay I'm going to just yeah cool there we go now I can close that uh what are what are we supposed to be talking about let's talk about announcements
what even is this show I can't even tell anymore it doesn't matter does it like was less than 50k for so long yeah I was killing it for a while and then I started getting smacked those red cameras dude they come out of nowhere so brutal they're so fast and they crank your score up so much anyways um gg gg brother GG indeed um yeah we're doing announcements yeah let do it merch did you just call the merch messages merch oh we're doing merch messages we're doing merch messes okay
explain merch messages do we get here's a question before we do that do we get a new name for it what I'm not even part of that team I'm kind of tired of it being called merch that makes sense what do you what you call bonus spin items uh oh yeah what do you guys call the bonus bin items again that's an internal name we don't we we don't need talk something toally stupid I want the merch messes fre free item upsell or something free upsell it's the fuss the free upsell shelf that's an internal
name okay I want merch messages to sound like that um oh man yeah okay so what are what are other competing products upell message you got you got super chats that's what YouTube calls them you've got twitch bits or cheers or they've got like a billion different ways you can throw money at additional live order comment what is that a l o c uh yeah that's really not rolling off the tongue Dan yeah that was the point um Money Talks Money Talk Money Talks yeah it's it's not bad um super
bits parasocial message super parasocial message is pretty funny super bits is pretty funny send me a PM like which which one of you is going to sue us we took half of both of you okay totally changing the subject object why did we stop calling them PMS why are they DMS because they aren't always direct one to one but they're always private what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I don't understand it group chats I'm a boomer and still call them the M pretty often or no you're converted no no I I was just
thinking about it too much P's pretty often I think sometimes it also mut it again I need to fix something what's going on got them okay well whatever matters on the context like in video games I still call them Whispers right cool uh apparently it's fixed now but like I bet you if I was on Twitter I would call it a DM because everyone calls it DMS on Twitter yeah so I think it's the the context of the platform and you never say like like slide into your PMS that's a little
weird yeah it sounds like slide into your night which I mean realistically is probably a similar inent um but feel like if you're on the if you're on the Forum you call it private messages if you're on Twitter you call it DMS if you're in a video game you call it Whispers functionally they're all the same thing pretty much anyway ex Whispers but um handy daily deliverables HDD the acronym is good but the soy yeah the alliteration of merch messages is really good I mean okay would it satisfy
you if we just changed it to merchandise messages like cuz merch is just short for merchandise perch messages I'm tired of the like perch messages yeah like purchase ch ch mes so now they're PMS t e r c h yeah you send us a PM a  message I don't know I forever calling them additional live purchase I keep reading threads where someone's like oh like I bought the screwdriver and it's like the best screwdriver I've ever used and I'm totally converted so surprised considering it's YouTuber merch and I'm
just like ah yeah I know it's painful because that's for a lot of people the foot that we have in the door to get them to try it I instead of it just being a good product yeah and then everyone's is like it's good for being a they'll say in the same grouping of text they'll say like this is the best one ever and it's good for being a merch product and those things sound so different they're separate they are really very different things I don't know I bet it wouldn't even take me that long to find uh to
find a comment like that like that yeah they're all over the place uh cuz I don't necessarily think that people understand what the takeaway from that is for like us you know what I mean um I don't know I think I'm just kind of over it at this point I mean I'm uh no I'm not like I get it but I also just um swag chats swag is worse in this context oh swag stuff we all get means just like garbage AliExpress stuff that is rebranded it's like a lot worse we can leave it it's just I don't
know I just I want Creator Warehouse to be able to break out of the the bubble um that they get put in with a lot of other Creator merch well what's really frustrating for me is that that um if they don't belong there if more people used Creator Warehouse then more merch would be merchandise instead of being merch um but I mean realistically I say that but we have to open the doors we don't really have the capacity to take on uh other creators anyway like we still have we still have a lot to learn
some of them want it I know real bad I know poor Luke every time he tries to pitch float plane to a Creator they're like okay neat but um by the way what about that other thing you guys do can I get in on that and it's like um I think that the and I also just I think the Creator Warehouse model is inherently incompatible with a lot of creators I have Tri because it's not merch I don't know if I had this conversation with you but the most recent one that we had that conversation with which they they're
theoretically joining flane as well but they are also having this conversation I I tried to like talk them down actively this time I was like I wonder what that'll be so I started going over like all the the I don't know if I want to say downsides all the difficulties of doing it the way that we do yeah where you have to like hold inventory and pay for things up front with no net terms and like all it's a hyper risky oh no I totally understand want to do it that way sounds good no
problem and threw out a number of like yeah I expect like getting inventory for this stuff would like cost about this amount and I was like Wow yep that sounds probably about accurate including like R&amp;D involved and everything else it's like okay this is uh sounds good I think a a really positive example of a similar thing I've been looking for a screwdriver like this one for years I don't care about this being a YouTuber product it's something special do yourself a favor and pick up one or two
yeah like I don't I don't mind it in that context I agree but there's absolutely ones like said not usually like that I think that's okay that's okay I mean yeah I with how long shop Talk Shop talk oh shop talk no that has a super negative connotation um it sound it the flow is good and as much as like you know I never shy away from an inuendo like our verified actual gamer program you're banned from like saying saying AC yeah you have to you have to say the full name verified
actual gamer shop Talk Shop talk yeah well it's like locker room talk like oh yeah like it the the like is that a thing just the boys you know kind of yeah I think it I think it has a pretty I think it has kind of a toxic connotation person probably just disconnected from this I don't know I've never heard of it um just go dumb with it and call them PE PE poo poos I mean honestly purchase PMS you know PPS all right I got a big PP here from uh no maybe not purchase merch no it can't say merch oh right
right right right right um additional live purchase comment we're not doing that Dan stop trying to make Conrad's in chat I'm so down replacing all the coffee with PE PE poo poos now why is my dashboard changing she like the reply button just says poop man I love I love no JS reply and then you you pee it for us to reply I see here people here saying uh talking shop means something else entirely that's M liper 89 that's totally fine that's totally fine I mean other than that people like often don't
like it because you're supposed to be in a social context and your talking shop like that's that's usually the context that I hear that in uh can we not talk shop right now like like yeah yeah that's talking shop which never bothers me but um I understand yeah most people don't like their jobs Luke It's my job is my whole life so I literally don't that's why it doesn't bother I never really turn off so have other things to talk to people about and realistically because of my job it's
usually what people want to talk to me about anyway so what is the point of me even like do people want to hear about my cats I mean some do but like tone down the parasocial relationship okay like a a lot of people ask about my birds too yeah yeah that's true and and I don't actually have a problem with that I like talking about my cats but I just mean usually when I run into someone at a social function they're like okay whose dad are you like you know which which sniveling you know
snot-nosed crying creature you know belongs to you know came out of or or into you know your various guy or lady parts right like it's it's basically which Critter is yours essentially um and and then they're like okay yeah so like what do you do and I'm like oh I I usually I try to not and I try to say I I work in Media or I take I make videos say I do Tech yeah okay that's more true for you than it is for me I try to give a true answer that doesn't sort of I make them
pry on paper sort of oh what do you mean then I'll be like oh okay I'm I I make YouTube videos and I'm pretty sure you're still actually a CEO yeah technically I might technically still be more than one CEO I'm not sure oh cuz don't don't forget about all the companies that like are not like the normal companies okay but you're a CEO of a company that has employees yeah yeah I know yeah yeah I'm technically still the CEO of float plane but that is such hor [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] so I remember when you
told me one day that it was going to be  sure I mean look if you want the promotion go talk to my boss no it's fine I don't really care I just do all the things yeah pretty much pretty much um call them product placements hm that's kind of interesting because they buy a product they Place their message product placements yeah that's not bad I always like alliteration PPS yeah so does pp is super unbrand think I was talking to somebody else about that today cuz I'm deploying this thing but it's for
production and it's going into production so it's the production production and then we have LTX Expo which is the lonus tech expo Expo we whale Land We hosted a land event land event yeah the whale land event that's pretty good too right so this one's pretty good too uh RAM random audience message that's the one I just reacted to that's not bad pretty good I kind of like that one you can say Ram me Dad and then and then we could stop letting we  all right I think that's enough show for
me for today it was so fast it's been a really nice Friday I had a great week you can't go off camera after he says that you can't go off camera to where he is also off  noop subscribe now for only $15.99 per month oh no when are we starting when are we starting only pls.com again yeah not today cuz we had to people making those links I'm not blushing you're blushing I think we do only ples I don't remember I'm pretty sure we own only pl we we probably did but don't go check yeah
don't check um oh my goodness uh sorry it just it just blurted out it was so fast yeah I didn't have time for my brain to think about that sorry that's how sometimes a lot of the best BL will calm down soon yeah okay can we get through some pees L do not own only planes so okay I think that was because we decided we were going to call it something else oh yeah that's right we did that cuz it's kind of a terrible name yeah I mean yeah it makes absolutely no sense not at all yeah um
what what are we supposed to be talking about right now you're supposed to explain what a merch message is oh right yeah and then we read one uh merch messages are the way to interact with the show um actually no I'm going to I'm going to call them product purchases or product product check out chats I like checkout chats a lot oo checkout check chat and Conrad coined it I'm sold it's almost like having you know people who you pay and who are smart and who like do things for a living techn is better
than just listening to your audience he also named it fuss um that's a good name shut up free upsell shelf yeah that's not as good I mean but that I mean that's that's the thing internal name you only I'm an endless defender of names being basically whatever you want as long as you can differentiate between what the things are and fuss has always been very clear on for our team so it's been fine it's not clear it's going to stay F so dumb it's never Chang okay check out chats okay check out chats uh
so if you want to send a checkout chat all you've got to do is uh go to LTT store.com so instead of doing super chats or twitch bits or anything like that where you throw money at your screen you get nothing in return we have checkout chats so you go to LTT store.com add something to your cart oh cart chats maybe I don't know and the point is it's in the cart not the checkout which is part of the checkout doesn't matter the point is process when we're live there will be a box in the
cart you fill that out and it'll go to producer Dan I still like check out chat's better it'll go to producer Dan who will pop it down there uh like if you have a shout out for your mom or you know your brother or whatever if it's your birthday something cool like that uh Dan will forward it to someone internal who can answer your question question sometimes Dan will answer questions himself and other times he will curate your check out chats oh we  seers it's not always wcho um sometimes
he will Cur at your checkout chats and he will give them to us so that I can say Ram me Dan  will people are saying that we should we should keep the out in the acronym check out chats M okay why oh stop I'm saying people are saying that I'm not I'm not I'm not saying that myself the the some of the the people have been saying that and then if we have like a checkout chat counter then we could spell it with a K yes like is that is that really where you're going with not me should I just
should I just stop leaving any ambiguity  Dan me I've had a lot of practice over the last year so uh yeah um all right I've got an additional live purchase comment also known as a checkout chat also known as a merch message here from Thomas uh sorry no not from Thomas somebody else uh hello Dan and the photon reflectors I used your AI support bot last week was that in response to the secret shopper video or in the works longer kudos for including I need a person is escape
hatch that's a that's a dashboard thing from them but I think it was in the works for a lot longer I I had heard about it yeah way long time ago basically I think if you go back to the W show where chat GPT like went public beta or whatever um I think we probably talked about like support chat Bots being becoming way better and we probably like talked about it on that show or shortly after that yeah I think they had been kind of riffing on the idea for a while I'm I'm 99% C and
that's that's just the creative Warehouse team working with um their their customer support tool provider um yeah and how about what are there really that Dan are there really that no I just have backlog today okay there's still like 30 in income he's been busy ramming there's been a lot of  okay do you want another one yeah I mean I don't know hey W DL is it likely that the commuter you're not too tired no no I I can go all night just get some water I'm used to doing this  easy I hate when T out of
words who. DL is it likely that the commuter backpack will launch Before    okay uh I think the hope is to launch it before the end of the year but I think the odds of you getting one before Christmas are basically zero that's that's what I'll that's I'll say with confidence so it launch a little bit too late for shipping to be able to line up I think so it might even be launching after Christmas shirts yet no it's dude do you have any idea how long production and shipping takes I don't care I just
want it I don't want I don't want to think I want work that way this is the whole want it Luke this is the whole thing where our model like doesn't work for Creator merch because we're just if something goes out of stock if we Gap out on something we're out of it for like 4 months we don't we're not just buying Fruit of the Loom T-shirts from some local distribution warehouse like we we make stuff the worst part of this is that I I I was like I feel like I have a dealer and now I'm in like forms of
withdrawal because now I I only have two shirts the first hit was free and now I put on any other shirt at all and I'm just like wow this is notably inadequate where is my proper shirt but then doing laundry like literally every day cuz I only have one short SLE when I don't want to wear long sleeves every other day so doing laundry literally every day for a shirt gets a little nuts by the way before any of you try to solve his problem Oh and send him a shirt I thank you so much for the
thought I appreciate the gesture the person who it was very kind who bought some of our tall shirts packaged them back up from overseas and sent them back to Luke overseas shipping and everything Unfortunately they were not Luke size and also you don't have to do that he gets as much merch as he wants it's fine did you send them back I haven't yet but I will be okay yeah super nice thought but um don't do that he's he's just whining I appreciate the concern he doesn't actually want anyone to solve
his problem yeah part part have a type part of I'm kidding part of I'm trying to Hype the shirts because I want them to keep doing well because I have a personal vested interest in the tall shirts doing well because if the tall shirt's doing well there's a higher chance that we'll do more colors more colors like so like I want to keep kind of reminding people that they exist and they're awesome yeah we're on it because it's good for me yeah we're on it we're on it and I I think genuinely a lot of
people that don't really fit in normal shirts very well don't even necessarily know that there's like an alternative yeah to like having their belly poke out every time they lift up their arms honestly yeah so yeah um all right should we anouncement yeah should we do announcements finally uh yeah let's do that announcing Black Friday Cyber Monday 9000 it's our big freaking Black Friday and Cyber Monday event not only are we going to have some big freaking deals on some of our most popular
products that are going to be happening all week I heard that LTT store is working with some of our partners to deliver some big freaking bundles that will include some really cool Tech okay I found out about one of these bundles literally on set earlier as I was doing the read for it and I kid you not I didn't fake this I'm not that good of an actor I was like is that right because it is an absolutely smoking deal I I had a colleague I had a colleague back at NC that used to refer refer to Deals of

really in the rain did they really when they did the toe I wasn't there for the towing stuff did they did they really the window open in the rain uh okay H we uh oh shoot okay um uh anyway uh okay anyway it's um yeah it's uh it's a me and me and Dan video and Dan talks about the cool PA system that uh that we implemented in in the land Center SL Badminton Center and it's going to be really useful for both L and badminton so I'm pretty pretty excited and it's it's it's cooler tech
than it sounds like all right is this movie Magic you didn't even see it happen you didn't see it get towed I did see it get towed but not when I was filming that shot oh yeah cuz that would have been like kind of a hassle because it was like out on the street and the audio terrible and stuff a whole thing but yeah no I was I was there when they tow it it's pretty funny sorry sorry I was there I saw the tow Tru pull in but then I was like having a meeting did they not actually
like take it they just like moved it for a shot yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah um okay look it's a Dan remember that one time when you had to undo all of the audio stuff and then redo it again and then undo it and then redo it again was that fun Dan where on Earth was that oh that was like the first one the first one we did last week no for the the All Hands oh God did you I blocked that out that was so stressful you did an inside out too and just like Boop just throw that into the
void no that was brutal um but it it worked I guess someone said uh Shyer is a bad word just FYI is it I'm not aware of it someone else posted the definition it's considered a negative slaying term that can be offensive and derogatory but used to describe someone who's unethical dishonest or unscrupulous especially in the practice of law politics or economics for example you might call a used car salesperson a Shyer if they tell you a car is one price but the fine print reveals a higher price like I'm
not aware that it has any kind of like like racial or gender or like whatever um connotation so I was I don't know that it does yeah I don't I don't think so not that not that I'm aware of I mean there's always new there's always new words that I you know finding out for the first time have some kind of connotation like I had no idea that you know the function someone in chat said it's anti-semite but there's there's a there's a link on law.com that I mean currently goes to a 404 page but it says
it's not it's not a 44 page anymore I'm not I'm not aware of that being that so if it is I had no idea I mean dude there's there's at a certain point like there's all kinds of stuff that I just I just like don't know like I okay you know the the the main selling point of our screwdriver I had no idea that that in the context of something that's like shoddily done had like a like a super can I say it maybe just don't but I had no idea that it had this like super racial undertones in certain context
yeah so I knew it yeah okay we use that word here to describe like something that's kind of shoddy like shanty town and are like cobbled together uh um and then uh we we used it in a video at some point to describe something Alex made you know um and people were like like really upset about like have no idea it's so I don't know I don't think I'm just getting old I maybe it's a combination okay I I'll I'll concede that it might be a combination but things just actually
move too fast these days and there's too many words and too many things to keep track of it's like actually difficult it is it is legitimately difficult I I and at a certain point you got to just I try my best yeah um you got to understand that not everyone's going to know the like weird secret alternative hidden meaning of every single weird random word like I don't know some there's there's you got to understand intention behind certain things you know I don't know I think you're asking a lot I think

on topics I you certainly aren't talking   H more topics sure oh yeah get us out of here Sony employees talk about that one sure Sony employees allegedly selling personal data of users in a recent 23 minute Instagram video Guinness record holding trophy Hunter hakum has claimed that his user data was sold on telegram's black market by Sony "employees hakum has over 207,000" trophies including 7311 platinums wow that's a lot there's a note here I'm going to read it for btim
these are not my words dumb PS Fanboy David I think David actually wrote that so I just that's why I'm saying it uh "has less than 3,000 total trophies and" three platinums for reference wow whoa so buddy has literally as far am i reading this "correctly 7311 platinums means I 2,000" times the number of platinum trophies as dumb PlayStation Fanboy David yeah a little bit more is am I correct Platinum means you you got every trophy for the game I think they're just some of the harder
trophies okay um and a platinum trophy might also include get every other trophy I'm sorry I I I don't know because digital trophies for playing a game are not real Awards hot take cont I think some of them can be fun to go after I I didn't say they're not fun but games are meant to be fun and if it isn't fun then [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it challenge can be fun sure I'm I'm sorry I'm I I I am oh boy should we just move on there are more important I feel that there are more important things to feel a sense of
achievement over are you being that  kid maybe a little bit maybe a little bit but um touch grass that kid though seemed to kind of have his life together other than being really good at Tetris so you don't know that hakum doesn't no no I'm just speaking generally hakum might totally have his life together yeah I'm just saying Tetris kid I wouldn't have said that about Tetris kid because I think there was additional context that the reporter was ignoring like apparently he had like
good grades and like like it was was an active kid who was just really really really freaking good at Tetris so I don't know anyways the trouble started when his uh hak's PSN account or Playstation network account got banned in September while trying to recover his account he got messages with screenshots from a good Saudi guy what no I think it's Saudi but sure Saudi sure uh showing that hak's personal data and PlayStation account info was being leaked on telegram the same Source also
claimed that the accounts had acquired the info by bribing Sony employees although most of the evidence in the video was blurred to protect hakum it's probably good um it does include a screenshot of one of the offending seller accounts using an email with the official poliany polyon polyon polyon po poony I believe it's how it's pronounced poony the Studio I don't know uh digital domain maker of Grand Turismo okay sure uh he then started getting calls from one scammer using multiple numbers who
claimed to be from Sony's customer service but would eventually ask for hak's credit card number around the time he got answers from the real Sony who claimed the original ban was due to suspicious activity on his account such as having multiple PlayStation devices in different locations uh it's possible he had people helping him get trophies oh which is against the TOs as well as popping Platinum trophies after just seconds of gameplay this is possible both by playing trophy farming games
what uh or when Auto popping by loading a 100% PS4 save into a PS5 game or a 100% save into the save game from a different region what okay uh so okay can I go  point none of this is real none of this is going to get you girls uh really there might be one PlayStation trophies there might even be two tell you what some could say possibly three you go find them I could go as far as this box right here next week someone might step up someone might step up a girl they might who would be like
wow you you you you slide up next to her "at the bar you pull out I got 7,3" platinums and Playstation check my PSN and she's like damn can I go back to your house to see them maybe really maybe really maybe there's a lot of people out there you don't know someone in chat says it shows   continue uh where even was I after two weeks he  cheat uh well I don't know because the the story is claiming that on her cuz you've got no time cuz you're busy playing PlayStation go ahead it's a
pretty good argument um after two weeks he was informed his account would be reinstated after 45 days with strict uh censorship but then there's a note here saying that I think he means monitoring which makes sense well PL  Digger you guys are great you guys are great why did I ever look at the other chats okay go ahead sorry sorry sorry although he wasn't informed at the time he had been taken off the press list don't know what that means uh I wish there was uh more concrete or verifiable
proof of the data leaker being a Sony employee as uh I think this is Riley this text in the dock yeah um as personally I don't think the presented evidence is sufficient to be 100% damning definitely spooky though and I mean I would agree with that statement anyway the other part of this this is just kind of one example of how your personal data is not really that safe um we've seen other examples of this in the past I mean uh Tesla employees famously were swapping uh videos uh that were recorded on
people's Teslas um if you put personal information on the Internet it's not safe well I mean yeah but there's certain stuff that people have an expectation should be safe um an another another example that was given was um someone trying to and and I have no verification of this whatsoever uh but someone trying to find out if someone was cheating on them and trying to find an employee to give them access to the account to the email account by bribing them um conceivably there are reasons
that certain departments within a company could have access to just about anything like any Department that's in charge for example of monitoring for um child sexual abuse material C Sam could conceivably have access to just about any DM or PM or email or whatever the  be pretty crazy by the way rest assured says [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] me in the ass messages tried to get him tried to get him I was saving that you're a little a little bit too late dang it um I'll get him someday I'm going to get him
someday all down his shirt it's been a long time but I don't want to bet against that I'm going to get  that go back to your show I'm going to leave now before I get Beat to Death  close my goodness uh there are discussion questions sure um if tofa wasn't a thing do you think you could hack into other hosts accounts and steal their info um hosts yes accounts like you mean like our like like our hosts I'm assuming he means this is a WoW comment I'm assuming he means like us oh yes
um yeah I mean pretty pretty easily honestly honest without tofa like I have for instance I mean am I allowed to use every tool at my disposal I mean I think so cuz like I can access it's acquirable by in fact I think all three of us have access to the surveillance cameras so all I would have to do is contrive some situation okay set up where I have you log into your account sitting like close enough to a camera and I I can just like see your password I'm not going to go over all the reasons
why but literally any account you have  easy and like these ones and I have literally gained unauthorized access to Luke's accounts before I made a joke the other day you remember that uh when literally logged into one of your accounts or one of your computers I believe it fully and I was just like you were like huh and I was like yeah I like guessed your password and you were right the the other day I was making a joke about um like uh anyways I was making a joke that the
conclusion was that like someone would need to be able to access the stuff on my desktop um and someone made the comment of like how would we get in I  password so so yeah you already have it to like some of my stuff yeah so it's it's one of those things where like the the the easiest way into someone's account is is obviously social engineering and the better you know someone the more easily you can social engineer them do you know how do you know how quickly and easily I could
social engineer Luke to type in like a dozen of his passwords all I'd have to do is is go get an OMG cable put a keyboard in front of them and be like okay let's do like a typing challenge test but but I don't want it to be random things I don't want it to be random things so like okay I'll tell you what just like leave the dock as it is but like type your your most common like type your type your keeper password and type type this and type that i' I'd probably sniff that out that's a little
bit too I could come up with find something come than that but like realistically if you have physical access to someone I could just put an OMG cable on his keyboard and then eventually I would find everything yeah I mean it said host right so I mean these have a lot of like extensions and stuff I'm sure you could get you something under the table for never really notice for sure 100% yeah that's why I was so confident of media like we have physical access to each other's
computers yeah so easy like it's over I can see all of your cables from my desk yeah right yeah super easy yeah y it is what it is uh the next one is what can we do to protect our info against such vulnerabilities as Bad actors within a corporation not much um don't don't share passwords across sites try to try to like lower the the impact of the potential damage use use autofill autofill is better than typing in passwords because it closes the vulnerability to a key logger or to an
OMG cable it's still not perfect but it helps a lot helps a ton no but it helps uh yeah and uh rer rer says air gap you can't air gap nothing is air gapped not really yeah well I mean yes but no yeah but yeah but also cuz there's ways to deal with things when they're air gapped as well I I I I've talked about this before people disagree with me that's fine I I hate that we use the term airgap for things that aren't quite literally air gapped drives me nuts there's a there's a
company that makes uh Network equipment pulls it out that like physically disconnects the port it's pretty crazy um over the management interface um and like I I was like does this really need to exist and then I was like yeah depending on what the level of security that's required is yeah I I I I could see I could see an administrator being able to literally remotely disconnect any port yeah I could see that having a  value anyways moving on we got more stuff yeah what what are we talking
about um an Intel AMD merger is an idea that was reportedly floated by the US Commerce Department um our headline says it might be less outlandish than it seems but um I actually strongly disagree I think it's I think it's pretty um I think it's pretty outlandish I also think that the rumors of Intel's demise are um have been grossly uh exaggerated over the last little while like I think it's more a very serious difficult to properly recover from trip not a fall yeah I Intel is not Intel's
not like going out of business tomorrow also my understanding of they got free coffee now yeah also my understanding of the whole like x86 licens is that actually oh I don't know if if intel and AMD both agreed yeah I guess there's no third party that would step in and say no also just as consumers we don't want this having literally only one x86 company also I just don't see the synergies like AMD has their own designs their own Jam Their Own Drum that they're marching to
right now they are they're a fabulous company and they're they're killing it at that doing better and Intel for all of their challenges with it over the last few years is a Fab Company and um that is that is their competitive Advantage if they can if they can regain it um and I just I just don't I don't see what they would uh I don't see what they would need from each other necessarily even um it is worth pointing out that this sort of thing has happened in the past I think this is from the
digi Times article uh Lockheed and Martin Marietta were merged during the Cold War JP Morgan Chase acquired be Sterns in 2008 um in 1968 the US government encouraged Pennsylvania Railroad and New York Central Railroad to merge um that I I don't I don't know if I'm convinced any of those things were better for consumers in any way so let's not route for this I guess would be all I have to say about that but um generally less competition is bad yeah there is immense endless proof of this yeah you don't want
consolidation  cool nice speaking of uh highly Consolidated uh companies and integrated companies Amazon is apparently taking on Shen and teu with a new sub $20 Amazon Hall it's a mobile it's mobile only okay that completely kills like my plan for this for wano the only reason this is in the dock is because I was like LC and I should shop for LS what am I looking at is that a phone on a dock that is capturable by the stream I think I think Dan's away for a second but I that's set
up for something else but I think we could oh cool okay well yeah anyway I had wanted us to or maybe that is set up for this I'd wanted us to shop well Dan's not there Luke he's not there who are you talking to you're like looking past the camera at Dan he's literally not there you can see he's not there yeah he's he's there in our hearts though um anyway he'll come back he'll come back uh so it's a mobile only shopping experience can we just call it a his mic is still on I just kicked it
by accident oh no just because we can hear it doesn't mean oh okay okay okay uh hey Dan what's this phone for oh that's for a segment oh so it is for this oh sick what a guy bad bad no it's cool Oh no you're good okay so we're going to we're going to shop do you have to do anything phone is this all right watch me hack oh there was there was some reason watch me hack into this phone Dan explained and and hacked he's Elite he's in the Gibson Elite hacker uh okay cool so does it have the does it
have the shop on it yeah I'll do the thing oh I mean well I I could have hacked it I could have hacked it yeah can it yeah probably okay we got go to Luke's laptop oh oh oh that's cool and now it's Mouse now it's a wait now it's a what now now it's a mouse deck cuz I couldn't find the iPhone oh we're using decks laptop okay what yeah Luke's laptop what's on what's supposed to happen to Luke's lap oh brilli should be in Google at the bottom genius okay so you mean Chrome or oh oh
I understand oh that's funky yeah okay hey there we go we're on mobile but also not mobile okay so it's it's Amazon Halls uh Amazon Hall way to go Dan uh okay as modern retail points out Hall is already inundated with misleading AI images on product pages this program marks a strategic shift for Amazon as it directly competes with platforms like Sheen and tenu in the cheap junk Market Amazon Halls focus on lowcost Goods raises concerns about product quality sustainability and ethical sourcing yeah
I mean if those weren't already concerns for you on Amazon um I think a lot of people will say that they care about that and then they'll go to a website to buy something and be like that's expensive and then go to something like xen or teu or something like that and be like oh wow I'm going to buy that I suddenly don't care dude the number of people that virtue signal to me about all kinds of stuff and then immediately you're going to be like $4 for a little mini broom what a ripoff I could get it
for two it's like well yeah like anyway uh Luke laptop so it's important until it affects my wallet okay so what are we what are we looking what are we looking at here this is a little bit I traino Vision not going to lie um Dan how much do you know about about decks is there a this don't know I couldn't like figure it out in time unfortunately um okay well what's this let's let's look at some stuff this is mobile only which is why we're on Deck really don't think it's a shoe Luke and it's probably
designed for phones not for 16 by9 monitor yeah I mean that makes sense what was it what was this product it say it says below the picture did I just add this to cart it says below the picture above the color selections above the what what are you talking about oh shoelaces for athletic boot shoelaces for men and women one pair okay well where's the price where's even the price for it is the price in the bottom right down are we are we covering the price I forgot yeah maybe you are we requesting a

AI images yet I mean this is just badly photoshopped like that person is clearly not standing in that room expect it to be better if it was an AI image Jordan said that you have to select one for a price you have to select one go back up I thought we did but didn't I select one yeah are we on a product p yeah I'm on a product page right you got to select a variant oh okay this one what what no no no no I figured it out I figured it out this one okay double tap to zoom nope
not necessary this is a picture viewer almost certainly you need to go back yeah go back oh okay and down just a little more yeah a little more there you go pick a size pick a variant I thought size size oh my God okay so a medium okay cool where's the price where's the where's the bloody price down a bit more grass green more like green uh did it say unavailable go back up oh up up oh my goodness look at this guy's biceps ripped dang go back up dang wait how but how is his shoulder so small good how
can he have biceps this big and a shoulder like that shoulder no I don't I don't I don't buy it Egyptian cable L raises okay what is this no those are awful so free shipping on free shipping on $25 what am I even I feel like I feel like we may need to just use the mobile app version of this I'm going to try to verify so wait it's an app I can't go to a website it is only a website it seems to be it's only a website it's only a website okay what is it called but it's only mobile Amazon
Hall yes is there a way to force is is there a way to force the browser to open the M version I have absolutely no idea uh you might be able to try the um the Kebab menu top right I can't see it because of the two to three more topics thing oh okay so I can't I can't oh hello sorry okay cool so no this is mobile site but but we could call for desktop site so I'm looking on I think it's just amazon.com now I'm looking on my phone too and I also do do not see price this just Amazon actually

ah okay long story but I do not have the 2fa for my Amazon account so I cannot log in was that taken away from you were you a bad boy no I just don't have it cuz Ivon has it okay yeah well we both use the same account and only one of us has our phone number on it so there you go I mean there's solutions to that yeah but I don't care yeah cuz like whatever Fair fair enough who cares it's an Amazon account uh apparently you can use the whole app but yeah we're trying to show it to you guys so we want
to use the site I could sign into it but like I don't really want to sign into my personal Amazon account don't I don't blame you um so cool kuichi says you can borrow mine nice uh you know what I don't know if I care anymore yeah cool nice I think I'm over it um so Amazon Halls everyone yay thanks Dan um I thought when you had the whole rig it was an app okay no that's why I had to do the whole rig cuz it's just a bloody website but you could just request anyways whatever it's
fine what okay whatever I only learned I learned about this 20 minutes before the show started you know what I'm just going to show people how it works cuz it is actually like that's probably a really good idea okay do some learning for this traffic fire who I didn't mean to do that okay if you have 12 and then click on this little oh I already did it so if you have 12 and then there's oh hide the merch message at the top there we go this little button right here that shows like a
laptop and a phone if you click on that you can get different you know responsive design Dimensions so now it thinks I'm on a phone right so you can view and experience websites potentially your own website if you're trying to do development in different formats different screen sizes stuff like that so you can you know you don't have to own every single version of every single crazy stupid Android phone um also I just noticed this what is that I don't know but it's cute that's
awesome anyways that that is actually like a cool fairly handy thing if you didn't know about that it's kind of neat all right uh speaking of things we didn't know about we have talked a couple of times about the Sydney Island deer cull on the W show yeah and I received an email this long wow about our discussion apparently I was very wrong and misled um okay and I did click this link and I spent probably about an hour uh poking about on it and it is less far less stupid um
than we have been led to believe and led you to believe so am open to mind being changed I have a hard time believing that but I am I am open to facts so what uh what we talked about was there's this island that has an invasive species of deer and um we were laughing about how the Canadian government has apparently hired uh International helicopter Hunters to come in shoot them and we kind of talked about how Hunters would have paid to to hunt those deer and etc etc etc um and there are a lot of
reasons that I wouldn't have considered for why that is not actually a real solution um so one of them is that it they have attempted that multiple times and the problems with the solution of just having Hunters call them is that they don't get everything and whenever they don't get everything the population bounces back pops right back up not only that but when that population bounces back um it is every single time a more difficult population to call because what Theus what the population there has
learned is that during hunting season or during hunting activities There Are Places on the island which is populated by humans There Are Places on the island that they can go where they cannot be hunted safely by recreational hunters and they will camp out there they will hide there they'll wait there and they'll just wait it out closer to people I'm assuming because you can't shoot closer to residential areas um so they'll hide there they'll hide in areas that are extremely how does extremely
difficult to access on foot which is where the helicopters come in got um and basically what I was what I was not aware of and what uh I have now had my mind opened to is that rage bait headlines like that rarely tell the complete story in response to your question before the show did it really need to be like a culling company from New Zealand coming across the entire half of the freaking world to come do it well they did a bidding process and they won the bid it was that simple that
decision so they were looking for someone who was qualified in this type of call they put out a bid and that company won the bid so that's why I thought it okay and one of my problems here is I'm getting a lot of uh my information from like random sources that I've come across here there I thought it like didn't work very well and they only got like 80 of them or something uh so I think it's uh don't quote me on this but I think it might have actually been paused for now like I
don't know if I don't know if this actually paused now but as far as my understanding goes that that is because of the fencing killing deer that they didn't want to was like non-invasive deer or something I think it's completely unrelated to so it is possible that this won't work but when we were laughing about this on the W show and we were like here's all the other things they could have tried they have okay they have tried that's fair enough I still massively question the whole helicopter
approach so apparently there are parts of this island that are extremely that part is interesting to me inhospitable to human traversal yeah you don't want to be like hanging off a cliff trying to shoot a deer but deer can access them yeah um so there's an entire there's an entire Parks Canada like micro site about this whole thing what's the issue what's been done what have we tried uh for literally 40 years uh we've tried hunting and culling and etc etc etc um eradication a globally proven
conservation method why here's the timeline why are we doing this um here's a huge FAQ um that is a lot I spent a lot of time reading it um it may not work it may not be excellent use of funds it's not obviously stupid either uh see I think my biggest problem was the use of funds made it seem stupid sure um like this this is the I think the specific article that I had found y so like I don't know and that's you know what that's fair enough maybe it didn't work and maybe it turned out to be
stupid I don't know but it was not their  yeah I don't think I said it was their first choice no no we didn't but they're basically it's not just a completely irrational completely stupid thing either so all I'm saying is that the truth is often nuanced and rarely just yeah I do know that some of the prices that were thrown out were wrong because the that wasn't the co that wasn't the cost of like the helicopter shooting people that was the cost of the entire project which as it tends to go
with government stuff included a lot of other things um not not just you know the helicopter crew it involved like a huge amount of steps of the process dealing with things in a trillion different ways um so the the like millions of dollars number I think is I don't know if I would necessarily say inflated but I think when people were describing the project they were only describing the helicopter part and then putting the dollar value on which I might have also done um so it makes it
sound like that was just for the the helicopter portion which I don't think is true I think there was like paying native tribes and and doing a variety of other things wow apparently Netflix video quality is like all over the place right now is is the main event happening now is it's being streamed on Netflix yeah I thought it was a Netflix deal oh wow um has Netflix ever had a fight before I don't know I mean Netflix does all kinds of stuff so who knows I don't know um see people are saying not yet oh it's
the women's fight now well I mean that is the only real fight like an actual Main Event that's apparently like an important fight oh okay yeah the like like actual like legit Fighters and you know stuff fight uh yeah quality is uh quality is apparently terrible yeah minus likes cat fights confirmed no no I don't I I'm not really I'm not really like a Combat Sports Watcher um but I know that Andrew is uh I really liked watching one of them is Irish um and I also know that um you know
apparently this is this has been the whole the whole circus show that is accompanying you know this this women's fight uh has been very helpful in promoting women's boxing so okay I think that's really cool um sure so that's where I'm at on that I liked watching GSP because it felt very technical um that kind of got me interested in Jiu-Jitsu that was a big a big thing that led me into starting to actually train Jiu-Jitsu was like seeing like oh this is this is like I don't know anyways doesn't really
matter I watched a sick like half hour um YouTube documentary on this guy okay he is an incredible story um I again like I'm not into Combat Sports I don't really care uh but Butterbean is like officially my hero oh it's Butterbean okay yeah I didn't recognize him immed um so it's one of those things where like I can I can definitely appreciate certain characters or Styles and I can definitely get behind like an underdog nobody story and stuff like that but it's not um I don't know it's
not it's not like my thing I don't follow I don't follow it closely or anything like that wow empo nor 47 says Netflix won't even load Midwest us I mean that's the thing I think people don't I I think people for the most most part don't understand what a fine Balancing Act infrastructure is it's also streaming they do a lot of OD like how like how how razor thin the margins are in this industry in some ways and how how hard fought the efficiencies you gain are and how um how dialed in in
tuned your uh your architecture is for your your anticipated look for your typical use case like like like langly man said langly PC has 4K Netflix so it's probably not a origin issue it's probably more of an edge issue yeah so it could be that where you are all of a sudden there's like a dis a huge influx of Netflix users for example taking it down possibly that's crazy that's genuinely pretty crazy that Netflix is struggling under this that's that's pretty wild yeah but but also it
surprises me and also doesn't mhm because that's a thing you see like some big game will come out and like oh oh my God everyone like half of the Eastern Seaboard is like internet speed is slowed to a crawl like it these things do happen not often anymore and and credit to the folks who who design and maintain these systems but it's a thing guys yeah and like like L said live live was tough live sucks so much harder like yeah I I you know I I paid for sportset when uh during the playoffs last year
and like yeah I I was freaking annoyed that the video quality was so crap kind of like and that wasn't do the player suck too I remember like yeah I don't remember especially for like how much well one of the details was that you figured out how to Pirate streams just exploiting their player so that's one thing um that sucks about it like we literally have better DRM than Roger Sports which is pretty embarrassing I learned so much about online video from doing that oh yeah yeah yeah I wanted to
try to steal it for from my own platform and then you can just do that for everyone else's this well you learn pretty funny um anyway like I remember being annoyed about it but on the flip side I mean for how much they're charging I should definitely have gotten better video quality but but on the flip side I do understand that streaming videoos really freaking hard it's tough um all right what what what are we supposed to be talking about right now um oh the EU fined meta nearly 800
million euro over Facebook Marketplace uh they're saying they violated EU antitrust Rules by tying Facebook Marketplace to their social network Facebook which gives Marketplace an unfair advantage over rival classified ad Services the EC also found that meta exploited data gathered from Facebook users to benefit Marketplace further solidifying marketplace's position and hampering competition this includes using personal data to display personalized ads on Marketplace that
makes sense the EC asserts that met is anti-competitive behavior limits choice and innovation in the online classified Market that consumers face fewer options and potentially higher prices I I will I I will say before there was like a bunch of options and now everyone just uses Facebook Marketplace but what I will say is I use Facebook Marketplace because it is way better than everything that came before everything before was pretty much terrible text on a page and sites the
integration with Facebook and tying it to a real identity and a real user account where you can like rate someone's transaction and it like appears on their real like actual identity assuming that they are using a real account there's obviously fake accounts but I'd like to think I can tell the difference pretty easily that is a fundamental what I just you were talking about how they kind of crappy sites and this stat has just always flored me they make that much 50 employees annual revenue 694
million they just rake it in and always have and then just you know what should we do with the website I don't know just make it I love Craig a tech site with HTML links Google should have stay as it's so basic I love it you you back off my Craig cist Craigslist is a is a stunning company in website that just people don't really think about and and they don't even have like sex work anymore yeah that was a thing wasn't it oh 100% that was the only reason Craig list existed I don't know as far as I
could tell yeah it began in 1995 so it's been running for 29 years Revenue 660 million wow okay crazy absolutely crazy um just one of those companies that yeah doesn't get talked about a lot and just Raks it in anyways sorry okay um cool so anywh who um yeah so I I I I don't know on the one hand yeah they're they're right from an antitrust standpoint they're like 100% right um and and I wish that other jurisdictions enforced antitrust the way the EU has started cracking down on it
it would absolutely be a good thing don't have much hope for the next little while as far as that goes but hey Lena KH we we're rooting for you over here please hold on yeah um I know there's nothing you can really do about it but please from my point of view at least for now until Facebook abuses their position Facebook Marketplace has been a very good disruptor I love Facebook Marketplace I think there's things that they could do better what's the differentiating things
that you like I like that it's tied to an actual ual profile that you maintain and care about that is a reflection of your personal image I think that improves accountability um compared to the number of times I've been ghosted on something like Craigslist um I like you ever try to sniff out if an account is real or not M I like that I like that messaging is integrated MH that's super convenient it's it's on an app that I already have on my phone and already use so another
layer of convenience Craigs this emails are a little Annoying mhm um and and the fact that so many people don't include any way to reliably contact them um like people don't like putting a phone number on Craigslist for obvious reasons but if you don't have a phone number I mean the best you can hope for is maybe 24-hour return round trip times for communication it's not fast enough so I like the immediacy of arranging things I like that uh maps and locations are just integrated into the platform people
people have to say where stuff is on Craigslist but it's not validated in any way whereas Facebook it's just it's like your location that you've selected at some point and it's just like part of the whole listing uh is is my understanding I'm actually not sure about that last one but everything else that I've said I are things that I love about Facebook Market Marketplace the instant messaging makes trolling people that post things for free or a dollar and actually want it for a lot more very
fun I'd love to see Facebook crack down on that I'd love the ability to report Anyone who puts a price that isn't the actual price um but that's probably the only area where I would like to see them innovate where it would be a meaning change and then at that point it would be basically perfect for me I I wouldn't need anything else I know they're a sponsor but like they're not sponsoring this um I think they're pretty much just doing computers and stuff Java but Java seems pretty
good yeah they only do computer hardware though and not that's a little limiting not everything that I buy and sell trade computer hardware is computer hardware but I had like for scrab War I had a genuinely good experience what's cool about Jawa is because it's so focused on computer Ware you can have like filters and you can have you can have it's more like a shopping experience for used for used hardware and there is absolutely a place for stuff like that but when it
comes to just random stuff I need like scrap wood yeah yeah that's got to be hyper local too yeah exactly Facebook Marketplace is the solution for that yeah valve no I know the valve one I talk about that on on wench all the time valve's like the most profitable company there is per employee um bu East one says that stuff's annoying on sites like Zillow 2 no I don't want to see a listing for a brand new home for Z show me real shpping is so archaic it just sucks as far as I can tell terrible as
far as I can tell the powers that be um like it that way they absolutely like it that way because they want their commission and they want to be as necessary as possible for as long as possible Y and I'm not like this is not like just some conspiracy theorist stuff like or anything like that this is just looking at the money following the money seeing where it goes and why and going oh okay it is in literally no no one who's in a position of power has any motivation whatsoever to make this a smoother easier
experience all that would do is make it so that they circumvent you yes that's it so why do that yep CU a lot of these sites like they they do even have ways to circumvent having a purchasing realtor because there's ways to directly connect to the selling realtor um but you know yeah yeah no I want to talk about skey Realtors I'll be right back uh sure uh I drank too much water I'll talk about an amazing topic while you're gone uh Pizza Huts Pizza warmer warm pizza with PS5 exhaust I don't want
to miss that one fine fine do it without me I can go to another one no do it do it uh yeah the pizza warmer is a 3D printable device oh so it's just a box that channels air okay I mean that makes sense it's a 3D printable device I don't know if you want to put your food on 3D printed uh 3D prints are food safe exactly one time because the small pores trap bacteria and you cannot clean them can you just put a plate in this thing maybe that would probably would you want to
heat up a thing that goes around food that is 3D printed that should be I mean we're already full of microplastics anyway shove more in there why not let's go we're able to extrude more out to make more pizza boxes I don't know uh generally uh uh who knows I want to see the microplastics I want macro Plastics in my system check I'm not a not a doctor of pizza science anyways while it's designed to keep Pizza Warm uh yeah macro Plastics yeah thanks using the ps5s exhaust heat there are concerns
about its ability to heat evenly additionally placing a plastic the main concern a plastic device near a heat Source raises safety concerns and obstructing the console's air flow could cause overheating the the PS5 heating box does not heat very easily 8 out of 10 on tech radar I was messaged this internally by a writer a writer who is highly capable in my opinion of making a sick version of pizza heater version 2 and I I I I'm sure I came across sarcastic and I was mostly but I
exclusive I hope that they take up the banner I've always wanted to like we could unironically go back and make one that's actually way overbuilt and super sick most of the people here could have that done in like 20 there's so many people here now that could do that minutes I don't even mean 3D printing though like Make It Sick yeah no I mean like do the design for a sick one yeah yeah yeah we have so many and we have every single tool people now yeah so like I I think it would be Wicked if we
were just like you know what we're going to go back to this project that was genuinely terrible make it really good I mean like there was the there was the car they did a car I mean done so many things I don't know it's such a weird marketing as far as I can tell if like whisper project ideas near Sebastian things just happen um he's already texted me a couple times like oh it's got an aluminum trays you're not like eating the pizza off of the uh the plastic I didn't realize it
sits on top when when I read this topic originally I was imagining top yeah I was imagining that it was like a tube that kind of came out of the back of the Play Station and then like wrapped around into a box but no it seems to sit on top maybe we should click on the link and show people hold on I know how to host a show sometimes wow the bare minimum wait it does sit on top what are you talking about no no no that's what it actually does I thought it was like a tube out the back but I don't own a side
of the PS5 PS5 has a giant fan hole in the side of it yeah that dbrand made some plates to expose they P I expected yeah so it goes all the way around it oh that's fine yeah it doesn't look like it Heats very easly a garbage product pulling inspiration from Pizza Hut Red Roof the lid seamlessly opens like a laptop for easy pizza access those things don't line up what what Pizza Hut what Pizza Hut roofs easily seamlessly open I also keep my pizza in laptops designed to snugly affix to the
top of your gaming console they don't want to say PS4 or PS5 with a tray that fits several slices it won't go anywhere and you won't have to either oh God channeling Warth from the gaming console's warm air pipe straight to your pizza slices science and engineering for the greater good great pizza maybe this timeline is okay I like this a lot this is an all right part of it this is this makes everything okay I feel much more like secure as a person now can you approve a project for us doing I don't
have to be involved at all I feel so validated by the uh PS5 warming thing by the way not a stupid idea just bad execu  never I never pitched a heater okay what do you want I I think people at the company should actually make one that's like sick we should do it we have we have abundance of talent in that realm at this point we do it take a lot of design time I absolutely think we should do it we should do it it' be sick I'd be so down yeah we'd have to figure out whatever the most like efficient way of
capturing the heat is totally it should be like overly scientifically over C analysis we would do flow calculations we could play around with the fan Curves in the system to make sure that like our our Target temperature is like as hot as possible so basically we' we'd basically run we'd run it at idle or we'd run it fanless when it's at idle so that we could keep so we could keep the actual temperature of the CPU as high as possible yeah dude I would be I would be super down I think it's
sick I think it's sick you could probably even like work with Pizza Hut like imagine getting Pizza Hut to sponsor it and you just make like the the PC version yeah you're into reaching out to Brands and things now I'd be kind of sick actually like unironically be kind of sick to work with Pizza Hut on this do it I don't know if I certainly wouldn't work with Pizza Hut um why you don't like their Pizza do you I don't know when the last time I had it I have no idea yeah I just think they have a funny
Red Hat it opens like a laptop yeah Pizza Hut is like not good pizza okay I mean I guess it doesn't really matter is there a a pizza chain that would have you know money to do sponsorship that does good pizza I I like Panago is Panago Canadian only though I think so pretty sure pretty sure it's Canadian company oh okay well let's see at least it was when I worked there what what just what just happened I tried to tried to load this site and it what just happened okay I'm trying to go to
okay contact us okay man remember when companies used to have and about us and it like said where they were based and stuff yo they're from abbottford no way what the first three stores for Peno Pizza opened in abbottford in 1986  panagis two for one pizza place I remember when it was called Panagopoulos well apparently the the actual name was panagis 2 for one pizza place and then it changed to Panagopoulos Pizza place and then it later changed to panagis so you probably
saw it then yeah and then it shortened to Panago that's crazy I didn't know about any of the previous names before Pano I had no idea they were just a local company crazy the headquarters is down the road from 7 Oaks Mall okay well there you go so probably not Pano I mean I don't think they are now I think they're like Nationwide now but yeah I don't think they're outside of Canada all right then they've always been pretty solid I don't know maybe it doesn't matter I don't think that pizza has to
be something that I like personally endorse it's just literally a a a warm object to keep warm so maybe maybe I don't care that much okay so business team if you're watching this I'm open to working with whoever as far as the pizza goes and it's not like I have to saying fingering is good it's okay you're saying their Pizza is being kept warm like it doesn't collaborate with pizza pizza uh their Pizza can serve as both a construction material and content yeah okay is pizza pizza also Canadian I've
never had pizza pizza uh it used to be called Little Caesars oh what right really no I think it's a sub separ a separate brand I think I thought that well that was their slogan Little Caesar's Pizza that was like their thing Pizza Pizza wasn't it Caesar was American though I know but we had it here but Pizza Pizza is a Canadian brand oh it is yeah oh never mind I know this apparently not the same thing Pizza Pizza is east coast wait it's separate they're different okay I don't know
Little Caesars used to have pizza pizza as they're like jingle you know I only know that pizza pizza is a Canadian brand because of because of baby no money I was trying to figure out like how do I know this even though I've never been there that's why brilliant yeah uh all right cool yeah pizza pizza was just a slogan okay well it shows you what I know um speaking of things that I know I gave bad advice for washing the backpack um in 2022 someone asked on the Forum if the LT backpack was washer safe
and uh lonus replied in the thread saying it's probably fine anything with lots of little hanging pieces should be placed in a mesh bag before putting in the washing machine this is as much for the safety of your washing machine as the Garment I don't think we officially advertise our bag as washing machine safe but I'd be blown away if anything bad happened if you run it on cold do not put it in the dryer turns out hey not sure if Nick has already messaged you about this but can we please delete
this comment from lonus ASAP context customer followed this recommendation to disastrous results um you just scroll down and there's the photo turns out it wasn't fine it's weird to me that it it only really seems to have happened in that one spot like the rest of it looks I don't know how I don't know how that would have happened yeah me neither but but um anyway we only recommend spot cleaning machine washing is not recommended the bulkiness of the backpack is likely to lead to it
being damaged in the spin cycle or something like that um so you can mix water with a small amount of laundry detergent use that to dampen a watch cloth and wipe clean then allow it to air dry by placing it upside down in a well ventilated space um I am blown away that something bad happened to it but um and like that we did replace the backpack so not specific of an area and like trust me bro I will give you good advice or I will replace your backpack yeah whoops yeah pretty funny um I wonder if
what happened to that is the same thing that happened to one of my shoes where you know how you know how washers have those like the arm things panels to help mix up the clothing um one of my shoes got stuck in between the sidewall and one of the the whatever you want to call them so like maybe the bag got like stuck in there or something I have no idea cuz that is weird and very oddly specific I'm not sure how that happen but anyways anyway trust me bro guaranteed to the rescue Apex Legends OverWatch and
fortnite all launch classic modes as Gamers play the same games over and over and over and over a recent study found that while the console and PC games Market grew by 2.6% in 2023 90% of new game Revenue belonged to just 43 titles most of which were live service games so if you were wondering why live service games are everywhere like a cancer that's why this is why it's Gamers fault five games accounted for 27% of all play time it's only Gamer's fault fortnite Roblox League of Legends Minecraft and GTA
5 50% of time spent playing new games a maximum of 2 years old was on sequels like EA Sports FC uh FIFA they lost like Ling deal haha Nick plof apparently worked on this one NBA 2K and Call of Duty Apex OverWatch and fortnite all came out over 5 years ago and are still going strong Apex sees about 18 million active players monthly OverWatch 2 sees about 6.4 million daily not on Steam apparently everyone hates it there uh fortnite sees about 3 million daily I have a really hard time
believing OverWatch 2 is bigger than fortnite by over double yeah I have a  fortnite.gg um that's a 24-hour Peak like just in the last 24 hours so I'm sure they've had uh yeah they they've definitely had bigger Peaks um the point is just millions of players playing these old games remasters and remakes also incredibly popular Warcraft 3 reforged was recently updated actually I'm really excited about this one uh Warcraft 3 reforged got a 2.0 uh you can toggle between the old and new graphics
and it apparently like tries to fix a bunch the issues and this was released alongside remastered Warcraft 1 and Warcraft 2 I kind of want to buy it it's like 40 bucks I don't know if I really want to give blizzard Activision money but I really want it I tried to dig out my old Warcraft 3 disc and I like I still have my key but I lost my disc sure and but I have it in I have it in a like a file type that no I no longer have any way to like Mount to anything and I'm just like I don't know buy it
demon tools demon tools anyway Diablo I resurrected GTA Trilogy was recently updated to fix a lot of issues multiple years later Horizon zero Dawn remastered why nick plof uh Resident Evil 123 is weird it's Final Fantasy 7 remake uh don't forget about the pixel remasters of the earlier Final Fantasy games that Luke is never going to get around to playing will anyway the point is it's it's a very it's a very long list recent  remasters um what is is basically our discussion question is there are plenty
of games that needed remaster zero da was not one of them what is the deal  suck okay another reason new AAA games are expensive while free-to-play games are free a lot of these games are free to play not all of them are but it's free to play a game you already bought like Minecraft for example my issue isn't at all with the play time my issue I think is with the revenue being so concentrated on live service 90% of new game Revenue were 43 titles most of which were live service games
that's the that's the part that stands out to me if you're still playing a live service game 5 years later are you really playing the same game though I mean the fact that they had to release classic modes at all sort of suggests that or acknowledges I kind of do agree with that that the game has changed enough and and that's their whole model right is to keep keep taking that money that they're making and putting it into new content that keeps engage now that can obviously manifest in sort of um
negative ways manipulative ways um but on paper the idea is not that crazy it's almost like episodic gaming but more money and more effective I guess yeah and to be clear like you know if you if you play some free game a ton spending an amount of money on that game  is comparative ly worth the time that you spent on it in order to reward the dev I don't think is NE necessarily bad but I also know people personally that like back in 2015 had spent over two grand on League of Legends it's just
like bro Avon Fox relax makes a really good point here intellectual lockin once you put that much time into getting good leaving the game feels like waste of time and it's not fun to suck I think that's part of it and I I think I think it's not fun to suck and people are so sweaty these days like wow I like genuinely spending your evening just sitting in an aim trainer all night is not a thing that anyone would have done when we were growing up and if you did people would have shamed
you like there were custom maps and stuff for things like counter- strike or whatever um but that was abnormal that was something that like people who want to go pro do or something that was not something that average Gamers would do most the custom Maxs for cter strike were like Warcraft 3 mod so you would get like lightning bolts that go along with your M4 shots and stuff like it was I I don't know it was a totally different no I mean they were like aim oriented I know I know I'm just saying
like now a lot of them are like that back then they were weird little fun games like that's not I don't know man that's not fun to me that's like another job yeah I tried it once and was like mm- I'll just be worse I guess okay crazy crazy side side tangent or not tangent but a bit of a reach here sure are we attaching more importance to our accomplishment in our Hobbies because  work are we looking for fulfillment somewhere so likely that it's frustrating I can't I couldn't prove
this I think that's right though I mean there's been there's been so much commentary about how there's no real progression you can't not only is there no real progression in your work you're not going to be able to progress in financially in your personal life you can't afford to buy a home for example you can't afford to buy or really own anything so is this like people who dress up their dogs and stuff because they can't AFF kids it's something to be able to measure it's something to be
able to grow and be good at achieve it's an achievement yeah um maybe Definitely Maybe I know like there's this there's the whole mail pattern anxiety thing I don't know enough about this I might say something wrong go figure it out yourself yeah go watch a different podcast if you want to hear knowledgeable people yeah the W show is the W show it's always going to be the W  ramming um that we know about U the whole mail pattern anxiety thing is that uh and again please go
look this up don't take me at my word but um uh average male anxiety and average female anxiety are different things obviously there's there's CR crossover whatever blah blah blah um but a lot of men tend to get anxiety spikes because of not being able to enact positive change um if they feel like they can't improve their their environment if they can't improve their work if they if they don't have agency to to try to drive things forward Rob dog here says what am I actually even achieving in my 40-hour
work week my hobbies I do much better yeah and that's a huge problem for a lot of people they they have I don't know what they're called like ghost jobs or  thing I don't know it sounds pretty likely sounds pretty likely to me especially with how seriously people approach it cuz that's the biggest change that I've noticed yeah it's like you could try to be good but you were playing a game now it's you're trying to be good and it's like life or death like I was lucky you know I um I happened
it's not like I planned to work at a company where progression was possible like I got a little lucky I worked hard I I earned my promotions obviously but what I was lucky in being able to do was having the opportunity to earn a promotion that's not always possible yeah whether you have an obstructionist boss or whether you just have a corporate structure or a union structure that does that rewards time you know rather than might also just be nowhere up to go yeah yeah yeah or you're or
you're in a company so you you can be in a company that's either too big or too small to properly recognize you know the exceptional work you're doing there can be a a thousand reasons why career progression is not is not a thing um but um and so I I I don't I don't relate to this but I can understand it if that makes sense like what would I have spent my energy on if every day I clocked in did the same damn thing and clocked out I'd want to achieve something I'd want to feel like I had power over
something but like for me my my job is what gives me fulfillment but I also have the privilege of having a job that can give me fulfillment and I do think I think that is a notable not necessarily very common privilege at this point no I I I I see that and I do think that there's a push and a pull I do think that part of it is a structural problem and I do think that part of it is an attitude problem I think that there are there it's a spectrum there's going to be cases where
it's 100% on the structure of this organization I I I know people in my personal life that I've talked to about their work life and they'll complain about how they they can't progress and then they'll also talk to me about the stuff that they do at work and I'm like and there are situations where it's 100% % cuz you're phoning it in but I think as is almost always the case the truth probably lies somewhere in between yeah for most people um but yeah it's just it's it's made gaming kind of not
fun for me to be honest with you because I don't have time to be sweaty and I don't have the wherewithal to be sweaty it's also I mean we've talked about this extensively on W show but the cheating problem is crazy now shroud was fairly recently quoted saying that he thinks in random pickup games on counter strikes in count in Counter Strike um the the chance that you have a cheater in your lobby is essentially 100% really we we know that effectively to be true with tarov yeah it's like if
you're playing a shooter game you're going to have cheaters all over the place um it's like cheater be cheated essentially at that point then like it gets which is sad pretty brutal that's like that's a completely sad State of Affairs I used to love playing online Shooters and like you you always knew that was a that that had been a problem since when we were kids but it was I don't think I was just naive to it I think it was way more blatant you were either very obviously cheating or you
weren't and now it's like a lot of the cheats are a lot more subtle it's like okay you better situational awareness yeah you can't you can't catch that on a killcam and people are like kind of trained on trying to hide it now um like it's it's and and the barrier of Entry doesn't exist exist yeah I don't even remember the last time a major streamer got caught cheating oh there's which given how many of them got caught cheating in the old days or maybe it just doesn't make headlines anymore yeah no seriously
there's there's a YouTuber that has a a series that has very many episodes in it that is just streamers getting caught  um yeah sad it's rough well I think it's time for darn Clara dude how is it that Dan leaves for like 30 seconds every time we actually need him today yeah um okay well why don't we kill time while we wait for when after dark people are talking about Netflix being like is there any other topic we need to go over no I don't think so the onion one nah I'm over it um I just thought it was
funny yeah and but it's it's apparently sort of unresolved now so we'll let that  how are you guys doing how are you doing I'm all right ankles how long do you think it'll be uh I sprained my ankle at this doof's party um I blame you I Blame You fair enough um basically what happened was I used to play paintball all the time and a bit of an itch for me yeah it was fun I well it was complicated I made I made a concerted effort to have fun it had it had I go ahead public paintball fields i'
I've always had a problem this one had more than I've had before uh in one game I not even speaking for lius who had a worse experience than I did I had to replace my my uh you call them markers I had to replace my my gun my marker um three separate times in one game that's a little bit of a lot yeah especially for how long um I was waiting for I I had to replace my marker five times across two two matches and I didn't even and I could have replaced it more times for the issues that I was
having just like sputtering oh yeah I mean I had that constantly I didn't have a single gun that actually worked properly but you know the worst that I would usually have was like every third trigger pull it would actually shoot and then it's like okay I'll just shoot more in the first round the like the second round of the speedball map yes um I like coordinated with my team I was like okay you and me are going to go this way hard we're going to like draw their fire and
we're basically just going to like lay down cover and you guys are going to go this way my marker didn't fire one ball if this might this might Pat you on the back too much but I saw that movement happen and I knew it was you cuz like we've played a lot of we we've played paintball together before but we've also played a lot of video games so I know the type of like strategizing that lus will do and I saw like one person hang back at a barrel which I guess was you and I saw saw I
think three or four different people like launch up one side all at the exact same side I'm like that's not normal human movement that was a plan I'm pretty sure I know who did that so the problem is that because I was shooting blanks you know in more ways than one yeah there was no reason for anybody to duck because there was no actual paint Landing anywhere near themap lit me up we did start noticing on other maps that even if you're G the fact that when you get to this level
strategizing you know it's kind of bad but uh we noticed that even uh even if your gun stopped functioning it would still make the noise and you'd get the like puff of like kind of smokey so people would fake I ran out of ammo yeah people would fake and out it didn't work when I was on that first map people figured out that I wasn't firing anything I I the first map it was I would have lit up like between four and six people like I I was they they were wide open because everyone was looking at my guys that
were running it was just stacked oil barrels so on the first map people were ducking away more from the sound of the paintballs hitting the the empty drums on the future maps that wasn't a thing yes so it was more effective later on yeah but but I would have been able to keep everyone's head down and I would have been able to hit like half a dozen people but because I wasn't firing a single shot instead everyone's like uh and so all these like pubs at the field are like they were they were pretty bad
and I got up dude I got I got obliterated I got team killed on that map because I was I was so far up on one of the sides trying to get far enough up that I could like uh shoot you guys broadside basically um and I was I was on the side of the barrels because that was actually more defense than being behind them now so I was on the side of the barrel and I I saw one of you but I had to get back around to get an angle so I come back around and my chest is facing back at us and just square right
in the middle nice and I was like what they were literally at the first Barrel next to the spawn never moved ever I had one opportunity to shoot someone the whole game and it was me okay um so anyway back to the story I used to play all the time and uh I would just play in whatever like ratty shoes I didn't care about destroying so I never had any traction specifically the organizer of this party uh bless her by the way um put in the thing hey make sure you wear hiking boots do this do
that and I was like oh I always like I never take my hiking boots for paintball that obviously makes sense I should just put on my hiking boots um so I brought them anyway on the second map I was like trying to do a push I was trying to grab a couple of the noobs that had barely fired a shot because they just hung around at the spawn and I'll talk about why that is especially stupid at this place and a little bit uh but they just hung around at the spawn and I was like okay come on let's go let's push okay
you guys are with me let's go let's go let's go let's go and so I was like trying to get up ahead of them so that I could kind of cover them to get into a position that would be moderately useful and I went sliding into cover except I was wearing hiking boots instead of just garbage shoes sudden traction yeah so man I immediately knew that I was very hurt um so that's that's why dbrand has all those videos of me hobbling around their facility with a cane uh because I at that point thought it was probably a
grade 2 sprain I think now it's just a really bad grade one um I was on the badon court last night so this is about a week later and I would describe my strength as about 30% and my range of motion is 100% with only a little bit of pain but if I try to actually put any load on it it's probably like a four out of 10 like it's it's still pretty painful I have a tournament coming up so I'm super especially not stoked because I was wanting to be like training a few times a week like get getting some last minute
you know feel in um and now I'm just upset pretty much anyway let's talk about why this field is trash and um I'll be naming names because I'm actually super mad yeah why know let's do it um boom get roasted some some of the ways in which Delta Force paintball in Maple Ridge is trash uh are sub are subjective so um it's here hold on let's let's get let's get the right location here um Delta Force in Canada hold on what what is this Calgary okay here we go the website  paintball.com big because of rifle
rounds yeah but but uh standard paintballs are 68 Cal so quite a bit larger now the benefit of 50 cal is that it's friendlier for like children um and people who are um so that's good it makes it a little bit easier to go do your like stag or corporate event or whatever else there um but it comes with some very objective problems um so one of them is that because they have less Mass um they don't carry in a straight line for as long yeah wow they were inaccurate well there's multiple issues there yeah so
okay sure let's let's talk about the inaccuracy so they're inaccurate and here are the other contributing factors to the inaccuracy um I don't I don't know how good the Regulators are but none of our air tanks were full so they were they were kind of like they were fullish um the barrels are garbage on those rental markers which is pretty typical but they were garbage rental marker barrels and then number three is as far as I could tell looking at their their prep area their process for like for maintenance
and cleaning was to like hose things down essentially um then like they they'd use a dirty Barrel squeegee and be like okay you're good to go they actually got mad at me for taking my Barrel off being like this is wet they're like no it's not I'm like bro quite bro it's it's wet there's absolutely no possibility whatsoever of a paintball coming out of this going in a straight line line has got in trouble yeah snipped out was like don't take the BR out um so so they're so they're
inaccurate problem number two is that they because they have less momentum inertia kinetic energy let's go with that because they're carrying less kinetic energy but they have the same thickness of shell with less overall weight and a higher shell to goo ratio they're far less likely to break when they hit you so in many cases they can actually end up hurting more one one of the maps uh the actually the most fun map that we had I didn't really like the game modes that we did it felt designed
to well I can get into that expend your paintballs but anyway um one of the maps was a they call it capure the flag but it really raise the flag so you had to pull on a rope and raise a flag um and one of the the ladies that wasn't in our group ran up to the flag and started pulling it up my brother just shot a million times and she was like reacting to all the shots but the paintballs weren't breaking and the field rules were if the paintball doesn't break you're not out so she got shot a ton of
times and it probably hurt quite a bit but we like won the round cuz the bballs didn't break my brother was just like what anyways for context they were on different teams yeah um okay so that's that's issue number two with 50 cal issue number three is is kind of tied into what Luke just said where the game modes appeared to be designed to make you expend as much paint as possible so they did like constant respawning over longer rounds um they part of this is just new player
Behavior so I can't really blame the field for it but they have you so far away with this paint that is inaccurate and doesn't break that you because you're a novice player and you don't understand you have to get closer to actually get get a kill it was also difficult because I find the the 50 cal it was really hard to tell on the first map the speedball map you could kind of tell if you were hitting because you could hear it hit the drums but it's so hard to see like normal paintball
whatever normal to me paintball you can see a big Mark I can also noral I can also often see the projectile I feel like like I can tell if I'm firing properly with the 50 cal I couldn't tell if I was hitting or not so I had to kind of like shoot at someone for a little while then like no okay I think they're out of range and then move closer um so so now problem number three is that you can fit so many paintballs into your into your Hopper that it's easy to just like use everything without
really thinking about it but that's that's as much a you know a player issue as it is anything else my my let's call this my real number three is that because 50 cal is a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] standard that nobody uses except crappy uh fields for like crappy rental markers there's a handful of conversion kits that I'm aware of but for the most part none of the custom decent equipment and I don't even mean high-end stuff like I never had a high-end marker I have an A5 it's just like a a a beater
Huck it into the back of the car like drop it in the mud and pull it out wipe it down and keep going marker um tman yeah tipan A5 um no decent marker is available in 50 cal no decent barrels are available in 50 cal so I do understand why Fields want to disincentivize these like gravy seals from showing up at the field with their fully auto that can be very annoying their fully auto markers their crew of everybody in you know camo Head To Toe with a case of paint each and just
like light everybody up like that's not fun for new players it kind of destroys the balance of the game I I 100 100% get that but the flip side is I can't even use anything that fires reliably because like I had my A5 in my trunk literally can't even use it because of their garbage field and their garbage 50 cal markers so so those are my issues with 50 cal my issues with the field are many they do have pricing on their website you can you can see if you go into pricing you can uh hold on hello there's
probably a lot of people on it right now yeah so there's uh there's there's okay hold on so we've got packages so you can have a look at adult paintball prices prices so you can see uh here's your $ 1999 admission includes four to five action-packed games and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah uh oh packages on the day oh you can get the recruit pack Commando pack Black Ops pack pack shows you all the things you get gloves greenard blah blah blah gets all this stuff sorry what a half case for $60 Canadian
dollars yeah they don't they they warn you they tell you on the day remember I was with a group and a lot of people will be I mean so I was there with a group so they tell you on the day believe it happened I didn't hear it the paint is it costs more after after your first round you got to buy your package ahead of time but what they don't tell you is that everyone in your group has to buy the same package so if not everybody wants a Black Ops pack with a thousand paintballs
um TS basically 500 rounds sounds like a ton until your guns are incredibly recruit pack yeah until your guns are incredibly inaccurate and they have no range so you're like test firing 80% of your rounds and your guns are incredibly inist % but a lot and your guns are incredibly inconsistent so you can't actually tell if they're even working or not half the time so you end up overfiring a ton and I'm going to get to the very worst part so the paint is ludicrously expensive which again I actually do
understand the argument that I've heard for expensive paint at friendlier Fields is that if you have those guys with their fully auto markers showing up and essentially playing speedball with TR to Nerf them a little bit with fish in a barrel you're you're basically trying to make it so it's like nickel nickel so it it makes people theoretically conserve conserve ammunition and it makes those like speedballer guys avoid those fields which is a more Noob friend environment or more intermediate friendly
environment so different fields are tailored to different groups and there will be days at some of the good Fields I doubt Delta Force does this but there will be days at some of the good Fields where it'll be like a bring your own gun only day and the paint's cheaper for example yeah yeah yeah yeah um so I so I'm on board with that but $160 plus tax so the the total charge to my credit card was $180 for a thousand rounds is utterly ludicrous it's crazy pricing ludicrous they couldn't even give me a
full case for that they gave me half a case um and like there's a bunch of stuff that comes with it if you buy ahead of time and if you buy it after the fact you just get the paint and then you go holy crap that's expensive then they throw in like a couple little random little extra things like here is for um here's for "context here's a 2,000 count case of" marblizer from Empire which I don't know if this is premium paint it probably isn't but I recognize the brand I haven't really played in a long time so
whatever the point is $65 so the markup on their cheap ass 50 cal remember less paint even the markup on their cheap ass 50 cal compared to Badlands is what what's the math on this so it' be like $32.50 for a th at Badlands so they're essentially charging me what does that work out to like five times the price ridiculous almost exactly and I haven't even told you guys the worst part um they don't count head shots yeah that is beyond a shadow of a doubt designed to make it so that you just are plink
plink plink wasting pains at each other because because marker shots count but head shot and they didn't even mention that I had to ask yeah yeah head shots do not count 75% of the exposed opponent is their head all you see is a hopper a barrel which you're not hitting with these useless markers yeah definitely not and their head yeah so pretty much also the the safety never go there the safety presentation sales pitch I don't remember anything that was about safety other than head shot don't count and
then and I don't think I'm exaggerating this time 80% of it was a sales pitch or more crazy crazy crazy crazy that being said and I was also due to no uh positives of the field itself I had a pretty great time yeah yeah I had fun paintball is just fun running around a field with an objective is fun I got pretty mad about the number of times that my marker didn't work and I had just bought a case of paint for the group so I had just spent like almost $200 um and I sat out for probably a
third of that round um actually probably more just like waiting around for like a replacement Mark cuz so many people were getting Replacements so I walked off I was basically like look I think that I should get a I should get a partial refund with all due respect uh this is you couldn't even play you only get three rounds you can't play this is this is ridiculous um I've had to replace my marker five times over one and a half rounds at this point cuz I I walked off during the middle of the second round I
was like this is ridiculous um and also I had hurt my ankle so I was like I yeah I I I think I should get a partial refund like I'm done um and it wasn't even my money for the refund like it would have gone to the organizer who bless her did an amazing job of putting together an extremely special party for luk which was really cool genuinely really freaking cool um yeah so so anyway and they were basically just like no we're not interested they they blamed it on the weather after buying the
expensive case and I have played plenty in adverse weather conditions if your markers are maintained properly and not complete garbage in the first place they will operate just fine on a misty day like we had like yeah if you don't clean or dry anything yeah obviously like you know balls are going to curve or whatever else but the way the guns were not firing at all or they were sputtering and you'd [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] them back and there's just like so much paint casing just like caked into these things that
you can't even you can't even properly pull the bolt all the way back or it'll go all the way back and it'll get wedged there and stuff like it's just poor maintenance don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] tell me that it's because it's misting and also if it's misting in Vancouver that's a pretty normal condition so you should probably account for it so yeah I uh I left them in AB absolutely scathing review on Google Maps and uh you Delta Force paintball there's also I don't know if
you were there when we figured this out but a bunch of the Google reviews talk about how they uh incentivize leaving festar reviews yeah they have no like access to free water on site they don't have running water and they'll give you bottled water if you leave a festar review right in front of them yeah so some of the negative reviews point that out they're like don't believe the festar reviews they tried to get us to give them a positive review by like essentially bribing us with free water
yeah cuz like I've I haven't gone paintballing very much but i' I've gone some amount of times probably half the amount of times I've gone I've been with lonus um but I haven't had a field experience that bad before so I was stunned when I saw the rating was so high and then somebody in the group found that they had uh yeah there there was a bunch of a bunch of the low rating reviews were like I saw someone leaving a fstar review because of getting a free ball of water or or whatever else um which is
like ridiculous cuz it's effectively a paid review at that point um yeah anyways apparently the fight's starting so should we just give up on retaining people on W show at this point 830 probably 8:30 yeah I gotta get so in one minute oh yeah right okay Dan do you have any merch messages for us to kind of blow through here yeah sure uh let me do the after dark way you get in position there heck yeah uh greetings dll waiting for cargo pants to come back in 32 I was wondering why LTT on the
YouTube mobile app has picture and picture without a premium membership can't do this on any other YouTube channel apparently it was like a pilot program that they applied to our Channel or something that's what I that's what I saw on Reddit I don't actually know anything about this I don't remember anything so there you go by the way I got you something me yeah your sweater what is this oh my God this is  suck oh nice nice these coffeezilla uh shirts arrived a thousand
years ago they've just been sitting on set and they've just been sitting on the set I keep forgetting to bring them out um so this was from the speaking of the Paul Brothers um this is funding coffeezilla um legal battle with which which Paul is he fighting with uh I think it's Logan Paul coffeezilla yeah Logan Paul yeah it's Logan Paul so the the one that isn't fighting Mike Tyson so um there you go and it says um I used to like coffeezilla until he investigated me which I thought was pretty funny because
he actually did upload an investigation  I went to Micro Center recently and I noticed that the OLED monitors looked much worse than the OLED TVs I see on display at Costco is this a Windows issue or OLED panels just that different it's probably a Windows HDR issue um OLED monitor should look pretty good might might have been a Content issue as well not everyone setting up a retail display knows what the crap they're doing longtime listener first time merch messager I don't think we're calling
them that anymore but okay how has your experience been maintaining both a forum versus a Discord server what led to the creation of the LTT Discord we don't  server to my knowledge um I prefer forums I never really go on the Discord but I still use  Forum I've been on the Discord a couple times I think I don't know it just kind of moves too fast for me I'm there's the float plane chat on the Discord so I lurk that um but I am I'm tradition a lurker like ocn back in the day ncx
forums back in the day all that kind of stuff I didn't really post much just kind of hung around longtime listener  Cocker love it thanks full plan chat there one of the chats of all time hey the genius the bird Whisperer and lius got to butter up the curator how well it worked no I hate that uh to lus genius bird whis do you really just reheat your family's Friday night dinner when w goes really long um I mean Friday I'm never there for dinner so realistically that's one of the
nights that they have something I don't like so I'll just like have breakfast cereal for dinner or I'll make I'll make like a I'll make like a a tray of like cheese Triscuits I have food prep so I go to the fridge and go uh into microwave 3 minutes eat cottage cheese um I think I'd rather die than eat cottage cheese cottage cheese chicken it actually has the consistency of vomit and I can't I can't abide it what's the name of bok choy cottage cheese chicken rice Frank's Red terrible add the Frank's Red good
huh interesting hi LL and Dan it's the day of my cousin's wedding and I got a cold just to mess with my day what's the most inconvenient time you've gotten sick at the wedding reception right now it's a hoot inconvenient the most recent scrapyard Wars oh yeah that was super inconvenient that sucked inconvenient time I've gotten sick uh wasn't I sick at LTX once I'm not sure I don't remember I just uh I don't have time to be sick so it's um like I usually just work through
it um I did take a sick day this week but that's pretty like one that is pretty unusual Monday um does that even count if it was Monday yeah Monday is my work from home day but I was supposed to be in office this Monday I think no no I no I was at debrand this Monday I was in Toronto this Monday and I was uh still not feeling 100% but I just yeah like yeah uh no it was last Friday and I just still came in for wano so oh yeah yeah I think that was it or maybe it was Thursday I don't know the point is
um inconvenience sickness there's some really funny videos I think there's like an Asus monitor video from years and years ago where like my voice is like super low like frog croaky uh I missed a shoot on Thursday that's what that's what it was last week I missed a shoot on Thursday because I was sick and we've actually got a clip of me calling in sick ivonne's got her phone next to me my voice is hilarious like it's one of those situations where when you call in sick you call and you say hello and your
boss is like oh you're sick see you in a bit yeah yeah like I sounded horrible it it was a different era you know pre-o was actually a very different time it's hard to reframe and remember what things were like so I'm just prefacing it with that but at one of the packs easts I was sick uh and I didn't know about you know syrup at that time and I don't think you know I had enough to do anything like that but I had uh Buckley oh boy and oh candy little uh sugar candy o-ring looking things and
before every major take I would take some buley and an O-ring and then I'd just go for it and I was just one-shotting every single video so every major take was essentially a whole video and then we would we would go to the next one and then like I couldn't talk and then I would take some some buley and eat the gummy so that I could get rid of the like cringe basically and then just send it and do another video we got we we did basically crazy yeah I don't think it was enough to like
actually do anything wow cuz I was just taking like little little bits I don't enough um years later I heard about that and was like huh that's just what you did I wonder if that affected me um I again I don't think it was actually enough to to really do anything you need very specific brands of Cody and sort of uh but you like I don't know anything about this shut up you couldn't understand me talking and I had to host videos and there wasn't really another solution I wasn't going to not host the
videos so it was like okay we're just doing it trying to think what's like a crazy thing I've missed because of being sick but nothing comes to mind I also just have a mind like a Civ so who knows for certain things hey everyone my company is currently running an insane cost Savings Program and cut our Microsoft Office licenses to browser use only what are your thoughts on cost savings that result in unproductivity well they aren't really cost savings then are they yeah you're shifting
expenses um I mean it is a big decrease in cost but it's a big decrease in cost of like 10 bucks a person so per month yeah and it so so it depends on like what you're doing um it also depend like not to call you out in certain cases it could be a user issue where like the browser thing might be fine now if you're doing advanced stuff with Excel that is not true the local version just is better um so I don't know for for you maybe it is actually nerfing you but you know I think sometimes people just hate
change and there's a significantly cheaper way to do certain things and sometimes you just got to kind of catch up I think both can be true um yeah I can also understand like if an employer is better to cut office than to cut exactly if they're having a really hard time making ends meet for a while and they're like well then you might want to be pretty supportive of the cost-saving measures that are that don't involve people yeah so like try to make it work that's all I can really say hi dll I just built an
mff PC with a BTF motherboard there are very few cases and even fewer motherboards that support this standard what do you all think about the BTF standard is it a dead Tech I hope it's not dead I think it's kind of cool um it seems to be more of a thing in China than it is in North America but um I yeah I guess we'll I guess the only only time will tell the good news is that if you buy a case um most of the ones that I've seen that are back to front compatible with the rear connectors like
on the back side uh are also compatible with regular boards so you can build a BTF system now and then you can just put a regular motherboard in your case if it doesn't end up being a thing so it's it's something that doesn't really cost anything to buy into other than just that it limits your case  though what's up with sorry what's up with all these one-time drops recently like the dip die hoodie not having restocks um also any plans to do Classic t-shirts again I don't know I think we
uh I think we struggle sometimes especially with a perel to um to turn one time Buy into run rate business and uh I think part of the problem has been that our skew mix got too broad for a while there uh part of the problem is that we still have a lot to learn about marketing that isn't just leveraging our social channels and our YouTube channels um but the reality of it is those items that we sell through and then don't restock we don't restock because they just don't have the demand to sustain
another order at the at the large minimum order quantity is I think people underestimate how many of something you have to order when you're not just like paying slave wages to some poor teu schlub um to to to effectively like carbon copy one-offs you know like uh we can't just make 30 of something we we "have to make 3,000 of something so if if" it takes us 5 months to move through  hi lldd I think I remember Luke mentioning the possibility of a Creator Warehouse gym bag any updates on whether
this is still in he said he wanted one uh we are not working on that right now why not um because we can only so many things Dan fine it's fine uh Hey lldd as long as you spend all your time working on tall shirts uh hey lldd my work did a team building exercise and got me thinking what's the most surprising thing you've learned about yourself since starting LTT and how has it impacted your choices from for the brand we're approaching we're not that far away it's not that close but we're not that far
away from this being half of our lives so almost everything yeah I mean most of my adult life is lonus Media Group now yeah yeah yeah yeah you know it's kind of crazy to think about it that way but it's totally true more than half of my life is Ivon era and more than half of my adult life is lmg era so um you had a career level job before this I didn't even this is my first career level job this is technically my first job out of postsecondary I think it's kind of cool that we think of it as
a career level job now you know that wasn't how we felt about it in the early days that is very true um that's an achievement unlocked I suppose yeah man what did we what did we  ourselves I had to I had a a lot of growing up to do me too that was that was a big thing for me I I had to kind of like tear down a version of myself and sort of rebuild yeah CU I was like certain ways that I'm like reacting to things certain ways that I'm dealing with certain problems are just like not cool like I need to
fix this and that was not the easiest thing in the world but I I think I more or less did it um and that was largely driven by work to be honest I've definitely made observations but I don't know how many of them I didn't know because to Luke's point I had a job before like I even had like a somewhat of a leadership position  um I've definitely had a lot of things confirmed I have I I don't suffer fools well I uh I'm can be a bit of a control freak those two things are pretty related both
of those though that wasn't a learning experience like a lot of the reason that we started lmg I didn't want to work for someone who wasn't um you a mentor and didn't I believe have the capacity to be a mentor um someone said you've previous previously shared that you get hype about big challenges yeah but I already knew that yeah um yeah he definitely knew that like a lot of core parts of who I am already already knew like I I would like to think that by the time you hit your 20s you kind of know who you
are as a person I've some in some ways learned to be way more patient and keep my cards closer to my chest but in other ways I've completely lost my patience because I've just seen everything so many times like like I can in in ways that only business owners can understand I have seen I have seen so many train wrecks that the second the locomotive goes on the rails I know what's going to happen and it can be very frustrating for me to watch everybody else go let's see how it plays out
um you know you and and pay is Nature's teacher right so so I you need to let it happen I've learned these lessons through pain and I understand that the only way other people can properly learn them is through pain um but it it can be  just listen um but it doesn't work that way people have to learn for themselves and and it's literally a management tactic where you have to kind of pick your battles there where if if you think okay I am 99% sure this is going to fail
they really want to try it I don't think the impact on this is going to be super big okay and and what's really frustrating though is like as a business owner right is that their fail pain is not real it's just like oh I am I am I am moral sad it didn't hit their wallet you know they take home the same pay that day in a lot of cases um it's also the equal and opposite of that though is when they have huge successes it also doesn't hit their wall yeah that's true I mean that's that's the dynamic right that's
why that's why a lot of people decide to take the paycheck and why fewer people decide to take the entrepreneurial path insulated from the ups and downs yep not entirely yeah but dayto day yeah in a in  way next sure thing hey D y'all got me buying hoodies every week let's go uh the phone pocket is so nice who had LT came up with it and and what other neat features have you creators come up with and uh their dishwasher is still broken apparently oh you should probably spend
money on your dishwasher instead of an $80 hoodie but um how are they going to wash $60 hoodie and a $20 t-shirt sorry sorry uh I don't remember um H Nick would probably remember but there is absolutely no way that he is doing anything other than watching the fight right now and he does not want to talk to me right now that's true so um true I don't know it was lonus we're gonna say it I think it might have been me but I'm not 100% did the original land hoodie have it were we inspired
from that no okay I don't know I could be wrong I'm not sure I could be wrong I you know what I I don't remember it might have been me it might have been Nick it might have been Lloyd it might have been just something we saw somewhere I'm not sure howdy D faithful VOD listener here I'm repainting my room soon and I'd like to know how you do edges you said before that tape just slows you down I'm curious how a master like you does it I'm not a master I'm just I have a reasonably Steady Hand and an ounce of
common sense that's painting and highly opinionated painting is not rocket surgery um basically you dip about this deep into the paint you whack it against the sides of the can it's called bang loading um don't worry about it I'm saying nothing you hold it like a pencil okay so not like this this like this and then uh you should be using a I think it's called a sash brush so basically where it's like uh where it goes down but it's angled at the bottom and so you the the very
longest part is the part that does the finest Edge and then you use the the shorter part to kind of put on the bulk of it and then you just paint a paint a straight line uh I think the brush is something that I'd been missing for a long time I didn't realize that there was a specific kind of angled brush that really helps with that oh yeah yeah that's good advice if you try and do that with just like a blunt Square brush you you're you're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like you can't
Edge like that tools really help yes um and last one I got for you now hey dlll I live in the US and need to upgrade my GPU with the looming potential tariffs "do you all think I should get the 4,000" series on Black Friday or still wait for "the 5,000 series literally green lit" that video concept today we're going to have a full video coming on that I think Elijah is working on it that's all I got well then we'll see you again next week same B Time same bad Channel you going
to go watch the fight at the watch party oh no you can't you got to go do bird medicine Dan you going to watch the fight uh no maybe are they upstairs maybe oh they're in lab yeah they're in lab cool y'all go say hi all right uh good luck everyone see you again next week same bad time same bad Channel bye apparently the an is starting right now oh wow literally starting right now
