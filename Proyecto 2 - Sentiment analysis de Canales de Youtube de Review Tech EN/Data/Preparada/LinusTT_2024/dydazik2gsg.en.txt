2001 was a busy year Apple was popping off Napster and Sega meanwhile threw in their respective towels we got three new game consoles one from a brand new Challenger scientists found this little guy and America had her worst day ever and for those of us who still remember all of that Windows XP holds a special place in our hearts but was it really that good or was it just better than the Millennium Edition and Vista dumpster fires that book ended it to find out we gathered some of our young and young at
heart friends to see if they could navigate Microsoft's most iconic Windows ever there's lots more where that came from but before we get to it there's one more thing that came out in 2001 this segue well not this one exactly one like it wa does this thing even work not even a little we're still going to get to our sponsor though hetner with their new Singapore location het's gdpr compliant high performance Cloud servers are now lowering latency on a global scale check
out their metered pay as you go options using our link down below Windows XP was chalk full of important Milestones it was the first consumer version of Windows to be based on the more stable NT Kel it was the first to require Microsoft product activation online and it was the first major overhaul of the start menu since it was introduced back in Windows 95 it was also the first Windows to use graphical effects like Alpha compositing and drop Shadows to pretty up the interface and it
introduced clear type for better readability on LCD displays which were just starting to approach affordability for the home user there were also big changes to the control panel Windows Explorer networks and internet connectivity multilanguage support and multimedia tools many of which have changed a fair bit since then so let's see if our test subjects are able to navigate our challenges I'm Katie and I'm 18 years old I am McIntyre and I am 17 years old ah hi I'm Elijah Junior
writer here I am 26 years old and I have actually never used Windows XP I've never even used Windows 7 whoa Windows XP is running on this display man I haven't used this since like 2001 I remember it was uh my favorite operating system all the way until probably Windows 10 you know the funny thing is it actually looks really alike like Windows hasn't actually changed all that much WoW the local area connection with the little two like monitors or whatever oh my God I forgot all about this stuff
oh my God is the control panel the good one oh I can't search anymore no I have to actually hit the search button I want you to set up the screen saver where is it can I search for it try what was it called again probably pictures oh gosh this is bad oh my oh my gosh it's right there oh that one for sure oh that oh my God I forgot about all the screen savers oh where's the like pipes 3D pipes [Applause] yeah all right well properties obviously desktop screen saver wait does this have
the the pipes hell yeah there you go it has been applied so I think the first person to go to properties to do that oh where did everyone else go everyone El  the dog I forgot about the dog I remember Merlin yeah Merlin was dope who else Courtney Earl I don't remember Courtney or Earl I mostly just remember Merlin and Rover uh 100% using Merlin switch why didn't he switch oh he's going away and then he comes in what an animation oh my God uh probably my favorite thing that I used to do in XP
was turn everything off so that I could get higher FPS in halflife and Counter  I took it sweet time all right my CD's in now we need to open it does this thing even open I don't think I've ever even touched one of these things I'm trying not to break it I have no clue okay now it's I've just gotten a bunch of options of different audio I can play the audio copy it play it from different I think apps I think I don't know how to do it no there's no copy just this is enable and disable selected tracks is
there anything C right um oh yeah copy music oh there okay oh this will be easy I want track one and I want track six and I want track nine let's do one and 24 wait now the 24 is gone okay this makes no sense okay now they're all gone now they're all unchecked what oh I can hear it it's oh the high pitch is actually really annoying it's doing a some sort of coil wine of some sort well it sounds like coil wine I don't know it's actually coil wine but like it it's that type of sound is it
done holy crap this takes forever I could probably Google this CD faster on YouTube go to a youtube. mpp3 ripper don't do that by the way and then rip it faster than this this is crazy hey I got my my three songs all right good work now I want you to make an audio CD with those tracks insert blank SE okay well conveniently there there's a BL CD right here why are you so BR on it it's a CD they're they scratch like these do they oh okay now it's copying to the CD nice first one's
done this is mine here you go there we go did you do I I did 15 and 16 okay so oh yeah yes sweet I got my own CD now right just clicking your drags no it's not click and drag oh copy insert blank CD I  closer huh they look the exact same what do you mean look closer at the drives one says LG one says DVD is it because this one says SEC your disc or super multi yeah the super multi is what you're after okay copy holy this is the fast version that's crazy to me dude this would drive
me like if my Windows 10 or Windows 11 computer was acting this slow I would immediately be reinstalling I'd be like something's wrong I forgot how long you'd put a CD in and you'd like rip it and then you'd walk away for a while cuz it actually takes some time what a process we just don't even do this anymore wow I get to open it I get the  sheesh "amazing smells like 2,000 baby which" one's what it should say on them select the programs you want to install I see it okay okay oh there it
goes it's installing oh insert Microsoft Suite disc 2 and then why do it ask me to do dis 2 I yeah back in the day and this is after floppies too cuz you used to have to do this with floppies as well where you'd get like a stack of floppies and then you'd install them dis by dis and then CDs came out and they could hold a lot more information and that was great but you still had to do a lot of things one by one I remember installing Diablo I and you could skip part of the install but you wouldn't get the
cinematics cuz they were all on like dis 3 or whatever all right let's see if this just Auto launches it did setup wow this may take several minutes that's very true it would take even longer if it was on a hard drive with which  then all programs holy crap this is the worst organization I've ever seen in my  life could not find streets and trips on this machine oh disc on this machine oh do I need to oh okay what the hell is the point of installing the program if I have to reinsert the disc
anyways so it'll install what it needs  oh is that just because like people didn't have hard drives like big enough back then probably a lot ofes yeah okay we did it wait how do I oh God I just H oh I can search lonus no that wouldn't work cuz it's what's our address right here would be the office that doesn't look anymore yeah it does not look like this I found the office let's go all right now let's doc Linus his exact address is I want to go to cheatcc.com cheat Cod Central because
back then you could actually cheat in video games without like hacking wow member of the week this guy I don't know who he is but sure oh my God GameCube free CCC email DVD PlayStation codes you go to codes and you'd find codes and you'd enter them in you'd have to search by oh my God you'd search be like I want to play I want the crash band cheat codes and then you scroll down oh yeah cool borders 4 man this sucks is this because we're using web archive or is this how long it would
take to load a website back then little call Little okay there's an Athlon xp800 is that oh and a motherboard so that's a combo 160 CAD for a motherboard CPU combo that's pretty good A Broadband   dollars uh do you want to not be able to install the newest Call of Duty here's $140 have a good day that's crazy you play a lot of pitball nope played once in an arcade machine in a bowling alley but that's about it this was like the hot new game that came out with this version of Windows Bas yeah that's pretty
sad yeah it's I got a new computer you want to play play Pinball with me here we go he was right here or is this a  her I'm right where the arrow oh yeah now I hit her my bad yo GTA 3 no max pain I love Max pain yo I want what's this monitor is it 1920 yeah hell yeah I want anti aling off yeah High settings everything's on high let's see how this game runs baby oh dude this is like 30 60 oh God my frames  one such a cool game dude this game is sick man it makes me respect where we're at now for operating
systems I think like even even just the simple things like hitting windows and search or the load times for things you know as much as I reminisce and like to think I miss XP it's really easy to just fly through Windows 11 there's a lot of like submenus that I originally was like oh why' they get rid of all these but once you get used to it it's so much faster looking back then Windows XP really was a huge step in the path toward modern Windows 95 and '98 deserve some credit
they had vastly more usable interfaces than what came before them but they did nothing to solve the issues that were inherent with the dos-based reality that was behind behind the curtains 2000 addressed a lot of the stability and security concerns thanks to its business grade NT kernel but it was only intended for business users and was priced to match so it fell to XP to bring those benefits to the average user and aside from just stability there are glimpses of the future all over Windows XP the
start menu moved away from the monolithic all programs list in favor of highlighting your most used app it had improved search meaning you didn't have to go digging for things quite so often and it had improved networking and internet features that were Central to ushering in the always connected world we live in now where most of what we do on a computer is in a web browser say with Wikipedia rather than loaded onto our machine with a disc like uh Microsoft and Carta speaking of
mind-blowing things this will probably blow our younger viewers minds but thumbnails slideshows and the task pain those didn't exist before Windows XP and while auto run wasn't new there was finally enough functionality in the operating system and bundled apps for it to be genuinely useful as we saw in our music ripping and our disc burning challenges so XP you know what you stood up to the test of time even if your usability could have been a little better just like this segue could have
been a little better to our sponsor aonis managing your organization's it can be quite difficult if you don't have a clear view of what's going on it can almost feel like playing whack-a-mole but you're blindfolded and you're driving a car and the volume is cranked to the max you guys get the point but with acronis cyber protect you get a combination of security backup and Recovery that are all bundled into one easyto use AI enhanced platform that reduces your Reliance on Central it you
