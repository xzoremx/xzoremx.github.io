did you know that North Korea made a clone console of the Nintendo Wii and did you know ladies and gentlemen that we got [Applause] him wait what is Unos and why is everything in Chinese instead of Korean Dancing with the Stars Frozen NBA actually that last one kind of makes sense but the rest of this is very confusing what exactly makes this console North Korean are North Korean games unique or are they just same same but different what I know is unique is the segue to our sponsor hetner hetner
offers gdpr compliant high performance Cloud servers which consists of OnDemand cloud computing platforms and apis on a metered pay as you go basis don't miss out and use code lt24 at the link down  off North Korea might not immediately spring to mind when you think of gaming or even technology for that matter but the hermit Kingdom surprisingly has a fair bit of history in the space in 2012 British travel company Coro tours commissioned nootch information technology to make a game to promote
their packages of tours of the dprk the result was a title called Pyongyang racer a flash game that plays a little bit like Crazy Taxi if there were no people no money and barely any cars on the road you basically collect barrels of oil and try not to crash that's it that's the whole game pongyang racer time let's go game rules do not hit cars or Vans if you hit 10 Vehicles you will be stopped for bad driving are you kidding me huh am I supposed to be able to tell where the people that I'm supposed to 
up what if you drive on the grass you immediately die okay what what is this I collected a barrel of oil okay what if I hit a car are these other cars even moving are they just stationary on the road it's like the only purpose of this game is to reinforce that you better stay in line or the experience is over do you pick people up I don't even understand what's happening right now drive straight on don't stare at me I'm on duty well where is she am I supposed to pick her
up I can't even approach a driveway is that because that build is like a building people are not allowed to go to or what yeah this is enough weirdness for me I think I expected to play a lot more but I think I'm done here it's creepy it's kind of like that footage we saw recently of North Korea there's no traffic lights there's no other cars on the road you're just by yourself in a weird Stepford Wives two perfect City despite what Wikipedia might say that is not the first and last of North Korea or
even nootch games in 20 2007 they were contracted by rert Murdoch's news Corp to assist in the production of java based flip phone games the big Labowski bowling and Menin black alien assault they're also rumored to have worked on a Wii game of some sort shortly afterward though we don't know for sure if it was for an actual Nintendo console or if it was more like this first up then is bowling which oh okay it's meant to be oriented this way when you navigate the menu there's no crowds cheering since
not your decadent capitalist bowling wait do I get to yeah it's got to go through it's everything in this has unskippable cut scenes I can't explain why got it we only got one remote working so unfortunately Tanner can't join me oh okay I can be either of these mes I love the frame rate on everything in this what is that like 18 frames per second oh if you're lucky this really is just an outright clone of of Wee bowling isn't it pretty much wow and the physics is just as good
which is not a compliment oh wow they give you a zoomed in view you basically can't miss so you know how you say you basically can't miss yeah on this next shot I want you to do something a little different okay I want you to move your character all the way over to the right and when you throw the ball I want you to hook far to your left okay wait that's as far as I can go yep uh okay now hook far to the left and that's a strike every time oh I wi this will get you right on your way to
the perfect game of 270 points um you mean 300 oh 270 you do not get those extra two balls in the 10th Frame do they not have bowling in North Korea like they don't know how the rules work or what the only place that you can really find a lot of video games in North Korea is the bowling alley ironically uh okay I'm actually a little surprised at how not that bad it is yeah a lot of it is look at that it had that disco bowling lighting effects and everything overall the games lack maybe
a little bit of Polish but they're not what you'd consider to be complete an utter shovel wear every time they're getting close but I want to try the badminton game yeah go for it okay this looks like it could be fun oh it's really too bad we didn't get the second controller working do we have a second controller but it just we have a second controller the dongle got lost in my pile of dongles at some point and I think fell off the table oh okay it's  disappointing okay the um presses are very much just
suggestions yeah why am I hitting it to the back right every time stop oh my God how about anywhere other than there please oh For the Love of All that is good there is no strategy here whatsoever as far as I can tell that is the case with a lot of these games if if you're dependent on the gyro it's going to let you down this would be exhausting to play again with a little bit more polish this could actually be fun somebody put some work into this yeah I may or may not
have used a number of work hours playing this it's fun it really is you tried the badminton one specifically this was the first game I played because it's badminton and I know what company I work for it's actually fun whoa oh okay it has Mouse pointer support in like their fake Wii yeah that's actually not bad and this one doesn't require that you have I an IR bar so cuz it's just purely gyro yeah exactly oh my God that yoga game who is that flexible where are her hips the one leg looks
like it's coming out of the other leg oh my god oh it's really too bad we didn't get the dance mat with this yeah I would not want to play Twister with her so the only thing we can say for sure is that we don't know for sure what games North Koreans have or haven't worked on sanctions against the country mean that Services purchased from them are often brokered through middlemen or even entire middle companies in places like China or Hong Kong and in some Industries these workarounds are a
particularly Open Secret pyongyang's animation Powerhouse Studio has been around since 1957 is estimated to have 900 employees and has worked on French animated series like the ranch Spain's cursed Titanic movie Stanley's Mighty 7 and even The Simpsons Movie they're even rumored to have worked on some Disney films like The Lion King which could explain this scene where the Dust In The Sky appears to spell s k yes I'm choosing to believe it's a if I'm going to have a conspiracy theory it's going
to be the deepest one with all that said the games on this version of this console probably didn't come from North Korea in the initial 2019 news release about the Moren bong game console posted on this recently defunct propaganda news Outlet the logo on the front doesn't quite match up to what we got that's in Korean this is in Chinese though if you kind of cross your eyes a little bit and try to make out what the pixels are the Korean seems to roughly match up with the hul for Mor bong while the Chinese
logo here reads Xiao Wang better known outside of China as subar oh I know subar that's right they made that z+ console that we reviewed back in 2019 and outside of that they actually have a fairly storied past they began producing famicom clones in the early 1990s and within a few years they were the most popular famic clone brand in China and the second most popular in Russia with a contract to manufacture Russia's most popular famic con console the dendi they also had a pretty recognizable spokesman
Jackie Chan who I will be channeling in this next segment wait does it use the camera it does why would it even need that if it's got a gyro well because it shows you on the screen and then you can be in the game no yeah okay I guess you don't even need this but here you go this is such a high quality camera what just happened I think we might have accidentally selected something um uh wait oh wait I don't even need the controller then no oh okay you you can hit the multiple times by the way oh 
sick you know it works surprisingly okayish yeah now imagine if the camera were better on this yeah if it wasn't like 15 frames per second that's actually kind of a cool game it's like if the connect was a piece of sh as opposed to what got him this would actually be really fun with a competitive mode like I I would I would play this I'd play this with my kids oh that's interesting if you look closely at the oranges you can actually see where the model is glued together oh yeah at
that oh actually that one too it looks I think we can see it on all of them so yeah three sections on each one okay we lost coming back to sar's role in all of this it's not the logo on the front that makes a console it's the software and subar has their hands in that as well have you ever used one of those consoles with the 500 in1 Game cartridges only to discover that they're filled with weird dakes re Sprites or sequels to games that have no business existing well that probably came from subar frequent
collaborator and possible parent company Ying since 1993 Ying science and technology company has produced such legally dubious titles as super contra 7 tunnel Warfare and Pokemon Gold ish a fun fact by the way in 2001 they were involved in a copyright infringement lawsuit as the plaintiff and one oh China you're so silly anyway sometime in the late 2000s they ditched the famicom to focus primarily on making games for subar various wi clones what exactly are these wi clones LTD screwdriver drum 
please wow and and congratulations if you guessed old Android TV box with a camera you win the circuit board printing suggests it was manufactured in May of 2014 it uses a rock chip processor 512 Megs of ram 8 gigs of storage and well it's about as simple as any old Android TV box and like most Android TV boxes it runs Android or at least sort of it does unun OS was the original name for alios alibaba's version of Android and as for the games well why don't we try comparing some
Ying titles to the games that eventually found their way into North Korea this game is interesting okay this is the correct version of table tennis that we want this red court is seen in one of the ads that was posted to Ari rang Miri for the North Korean Wei so this is a game that would have theoretically gone to North Korea uh it's a tutorial right off the bat everything is unskippable wow that controller is not the same as my controller they did have a couple oh wao that's a wi controller with one
button no no that's not a Wii controller there's still four buttons down in the bottom yeah so it's somewhere in between cuz it's got the d-pad markings on it but it's only got a single button here so it could be that that is an early mockup or it could be one of the varieties of this that subar released because they did have a number of them on the market sorry are I'm good get in the game sorry it's a skill issue so basically all this thing has in it is just an accelerometer and like no gyro I
guess just are you moving it great okay then only the game the actual device does this is essentially an air mouse you can take the dongle from this and plug it into a computer and it will be detected as a standard hit device you can immediately start using it as an air mouse so if you wanted to use this with a Wii Emulator you absolutely could oh that's super cool there's concrete evidence then that Ying made at least some of the games that were promoted in advertisements for our North Korean Wii
here table tennis for sure is a match the rest are not so clear this next image appears to show some kind of running game on a mat we're not sure which one or if it's a real game at all we do subar did sell several dance mats that pair with their we clones from a company called blavor but this looks less like a game peripheral and more like a solar panel on the floor which kind of checks out given what blavor is up to these days um it is possible though that it's real and it was just
designed so simply to allow for assembly within a North Korean Factory something that Pyongyang has been doing with Android phones for over a decade the final image from arang Mii is maybe the most ambiguous but also the most interesting it prominently announces educational kids games with a number of examples and of the 20 pixels that are not obscured by The Watermark we can make out two big Clues the first is this raccoon dog looking character that appears to be interacting with a piece
of paper on the ground this is likely neoguri the main character of clever raccoon dog one of North Korea's most popular cartoons If This Were a device solely made for children clever raccoon dog might be the extent of the local cartoon properties used but two space is over we can see what very much looks like the lead character of the much more dark and gritty series The Boy General North Korea has three very popular cartoons in its history and if two out of three are featured it's a safe
assumption that there were plans for a game based around the dark gritty War drama squirrel and Hedgehog top of a few murky details about a squirrel and Hedgehog mobile game from 2018 called Brave Soldier there have been some photos posted to the fandom Wiki depicting gameplay and Pitch meetings for rail gun shooter arcade game supposedly for use in the golden Lane Bowling Alley attached to the Yang gako Hotel the primary hotel that foreign tourists tend to get placed in but why
make a one-off arcade machine of your most popular series only to show it to foreigners who might confuse it for a Sonic the Hedgehog knockoff which by the way it isn't in fact squirrel and Hedgehog predate Sonic by well over a decade a fact that makes more sense when you have the context of North Korea's media industry between the late 1960s and the 1980s Kim Jong eel's first major role in the dprk government was creating film and television for use's propaganda he famously kidnapped South Korean
actress Choy Yuni and her husband director Shin sang A for eight years in order to make this happen but when he wasn't using human trafficking victims to make anti-japanese shame pieces he pushed for a variety of cartoons to be created almost all of them involving talking animals making Kim Jong ill effectively then history's most despotic furry in the Years following his death production of these cartoons slowed significantly where they used to produce one to two episodes a year squirrel and
Hedgehog hasn't seen a new episode enter production since Kim jong-il's death and there's been virtually no new or continued Productions of SEC properties in that time as far as we know the only exception to this seems to have been Kim jong-un's favorite show the boy general which got a reboot in 2015 nearly 20 years after originally going off the air the reboot lasted 50 episodes and concluded in 2019 right around the time this wi clone was announced see we got there eventually let's try another game
all right there were a couple other ones that caught my eye I thought I saw a curling game yep let's see if there's actual differences in how hard you go cuz this would be the first game that managed to like that's not a bad little like Village thing they made If This Were paired with wonderful gameplay all of this would be easily forgiven I noticed the word if there every one of these games has a little caveat to it okay all right let's part of the Journey of Discovery all right okay so I hold the D button
short what just happened uh push push do that and now it's going to go all the way down you can actually see on the right side that's going to tell you how far that shot is going to go and if you wave back and forth It's it'll sweep and normally that will will actually uh fill up a little bit more oh I see okay I haven't figured out how to get it to properly curl yeah but I know that you can at least go over to this left and right like you wouldn't bowling okay well that was a bad shot I I going
to put it right on the button no no they're going to completely Miss just like me okay well hey at least we both suck see it filling up filling up push forward I overshot it again didn't I damn it hey you're still in the area you can't tell from the physics at all like it's it's not slowing down dude it just moves at a constant rate like that looks like it I keep thinking oh it's almost slowed down oh wow it just lands exactly where you get it see I thought it'd be like we golf where it like goes to there
but then there's some fudge Factor but no it's just just press it right when the thing all we've got is four more minutes left why don't we get out of this game and I believe it's I believe it's darts I I want to show darts unskippable cut scene okay now hold on just to gosh Dar oh oh okay so you just so you just have to get it in the right  then what just happened well there's gravity so you're aing what's the point of the freaking Target then well I don't  then o that was actually really close
yeah that that was much closer than I got it yesterday and then it well leaves my thing in the same spot so  just what was that too hard dude not cool it it gets more frustrating though because you're playing 500 right yeah and even if you get the exact correct amount of points it'll still tell you you're wrong I could not get this game to finish coming back to our wordy history lesson that I assure you does have a point in January 2020 all the borders of North Korea closed and in the past four
years no one has legally come in or out not even Dennis Rodman the US Treasury has begun imposing sanctions on companies found to be working with North Korea even for animation and at the start of 2024 Kim Jong-un began shutting down radio stations TV broadcasts and websites that served as a link between the dprk and the rest of the world he made the unprecedented statement that a unified Korea would be impossible so whether the North Korean version of this console ever got made or whether our
title is total clickbait may never be known instead with willingness to Outsource it work to North Korea at an all-time low it appears that whatever sector workers might have worked on this or in the past worked on wh hat IT services have shifted to botnet creation and ransomware taxs on hospitals for Bitcoin as for subar unfortunately both they and whing seem to have succumbed to the pandemic subor is adamant that they are not dead yet but Ying's website s it is essentially gone with only a file
