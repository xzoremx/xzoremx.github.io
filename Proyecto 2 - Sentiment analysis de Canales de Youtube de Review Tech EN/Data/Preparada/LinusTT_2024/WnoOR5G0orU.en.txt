Windows finally has good battery life let me show you this is the Asus VI book S15 and it hasn't advertised 18 hours of battery life when normal Windows laptops like this in the past would have Max 15 hours probably less than 10 how did they do that because it is powered by a Snapdragon X Series chip which is super power efficient you can add all of that power with the new co-pilot plus and it is freaking nuts how long this thing can last and this isn't the only laptop that
now boasts full day full night battery life clearly there's loads of buyin from lots of the industry so if these are as power efficient as advertised we're going to see way more Windows laptop that you can trust to last all day while being much more capable for AI related tasks and application and these will be hitting shelves on June 18th AKA today thanks to qualcon for sponsoring this video
