when redditor cinam Minon posted that his soon Tobe ex-wife flight tested his gaming PC from their third party balcony I knew I had to step in not to fix their relationship that is way above my pay grade but rather to see if anything from the ruined rig could be salvaged I also saw an opportunity to do a bit of Investigation see I've seen my fair share of damaged PCS and I've also seen my fair share of Internet sub stories and when I saw the single picture that he posted of the aftermath
it definitely raised some questions for me you guys see this right around the edges of the frame the case itself doesn't appear to be that mangled compared to the damage that we're seeing inside so I think there's a possibility that cinnam is more of a CRI trying to capitalize on internet charity to get a new pc a ploy that is already worked if indeed it is a ploy star Forge sent him a pretty Nic looking system to replace this one so all that's left is to see just how much water his
story holds and to find out what if anything can be salvaged from this wreckage oh look at this there's one thing that survived the impact this segue to our sponsor Jawa offset the cost of your new pc upgrade by trading in your old GPU or CPU to Jawa check out their Link in the video description and use code trade up 10 to get an additional $10 on top of your base offer obviously my first question is why I mean clearly there are some relationship problems or a she wouldn't be a soon
Tobe exwife and B his PC would still be in one piece but what's the specifics of the story here well what he told us is he approached his wife about getting a divorce and said basically that all he wanted was the PC that was the wrong thing to say and yada yada yada PC flies off the third floor and into the ground okay well obviously nothing's going to go great from that height but surprisingly as I mentioned before the case after touching some grass is in pretty good condition now he claims he
has done nothing to the PC since then other than pack it up and ship it to us which by the way was not a simple matter DHL was not cool about shipping broken Hardware they've seen this movie before and don't want to be involved they've had situations in the past where people have intentionally shipped broken stuff and then tried to come back and claim damages and get the insurance money right okay well enough Ado let's do this all right get it that was terrible AA where did this come from uh Lithuania
oh Lord how much did we pay to get broken computer parts here probably too much oh that's not a good sign the wrong angle yeah he worked as a tech before so you can take his word for it not scientist but you not supposed to go in there like that oh hey he wrote a little note for us oh yeah good luck do not check the homework folder yeah yeah yeah I I I get it I that is one thing he's legitimately hoping to get back is some of the data that's on the drive here which before looking at it I think is a
pretty good chance your face there's all kinds of stuff falling at the bottom here your face does not indicate agreement not so much well honestly I think the drive is probably okay but we'll see oh jeez maybe not I'm feeling a little better about his story dirt was involved uh-huh I think we can both agree it probably did get thrown off a balcony yeah I would agree with that what it looks like happened was a lot of the impact was born right here and went kind of straight into this
vertical piece so it didn't deform as much as if it had well a hit concrete yeah or B hit a corner that was not as enforced this this glass this is glass too that's a miracle that that survived like if it had hit this side first oh these feet are just gone gone well that makes sense right because if it hit here and then tumbled yeah then who knows right all bets are off the fact that the glass is still intact dude the last time we looked at one of these systems we managed to salvage a surprising amount
of stuff from it I don't think we're going to have the same kind of luck that's not a good bend one thing that gives me a little bit of Hope for maybe the motherboard maybe is that it's not full-sized ATX it's matx so even though this tray is bent the motherboard itself is not not quite that bad you know what I'm betting that power supply is still good it's just kind of barely mangled I think the power supply stands a chance too but I haven't looked at the other side yet yeah we probably
should no put put it back your sure it didn't come from Italy I don't get it oh wow how did that cooler bend that much it's got a lot of inertia and heat pipes right like you can you can bend them by hand that's true six at a time or whatever that wouldn't be easy but the number of G's that this was under yeah it's a lot wow it broke the uh Power connectors what oh no way I've never seen that one before I've seen PCI slots ripped apart I've seen actually I've never seen a card this
mangled but I've seen coolers like this I have never seen the inside of the pcie power connector broken I want to get this power supply out okay the Peel's still on it oh yeah it's like new post this on Facebook Marketplace Peel's still on yeah can you imagine how mad she she must have been to do this I got to wonder bro there's always two sides to every story yeah what did you do I mean maybe you did nothing maybe like you never know you never know but maybe you were the like saint of love and
kindness in this relationship but she clearly was not into that all right power button hit it I mean the lights turned on that's a good sign just because the system fires up though that's true does not mean that this fan for example will still spin within the mangled frame you can see she ain't she ain't true anymore so we're playing some Crisis 3 here boys and I don't see that fan moving Jordan it twitch dude I believe you but this is totally cool still though so I don't see it mov it  move smells
fine wow okay oh yeah you're definitely doing some work now I think I'm ready to call this a pass yeah that seems to be fine I just got a power supply for the low price of what we pay 200 bucks is all right let's see if I got anything else let's look at the cooler here next sure even if the cooler survived would I really want to use it now well that's only a month old as a matter of fact really he was having trouble I was kind of doing some deep dive on his Reddit here and he was having trouble with heat
and they recommended he get this new cooler for his CPU it may have fixed the problem but uh he ran into some other trouble that's still good you can bend that back should we try stick it in the vice or something or like yeah that's not good anymore oh she's Twisted brother she's Twisted no no no no I believe we can fix this I believe we can fix this we're going to the workshop all right which way am I going you're lifting up  that okay I mean it's getting better it's an improvement  go
ah I say we put it on our bench I think she's going to work just fine while Jordan's salvaging the brackets I realized we left our game running so all I got to do is fire up Hardware info and we can get a before temp with an AMD stock cooler because at the end of the day just because it functions at all doesn't mean it's worth installing if it's no better than the stock cooler so right now we're running at 44Â° with a maximum of 48 let's see if this does any better I need some fans right well I
have this one okay she's a little unbalanced hold on maybe we can fix that though so all we have to do is give her the old amputation there all right if you didn't look that close you'd think oh yeah they bent some fins when they were installing it dude she's looking good beautiful she's looking good that one's less beautiful you won't when she's in motion you won't even see it oh dude I'm stoked I'm stoked on this I think I I think I got a $200 power supply cooler bundle there you go that's
pretty good maybe more maybe get some Ram oh dude wow oh dude we're like yeah all right we fixed the cooler we're Geniuses well I agree with you on one of those points which one I'll leave it you to decide all right I want to see his CPU all right oo 5600 x yep dude if I got a free 5600 x and a power supply and a cooler this is starting to look like a pretty good value yeah what's a 5600 x worth these days got to be like at least 80 bucks dude dude the yeah these are worth like
70 80 bucks I'm feeling pretty good right about now should we go for Ram at the same time let's go for Ram at the same time I think it's a pretty safe bet nothing touched it it doesn't have a scratch on it I say this Ram Works what do we get all right 32 gigs dude the manufacturing date on this is October of last year this is only one year old memory it's probably newer than ours ours is from January this year oh well okay got them give me my odds on the motherboard 50/50
50% you saw the state of that thing that GPU got ripped out of it brother look at it now though man it's like it's pretty flat got it now yeah it's kind of like uh like there's some pin damage and stuff here but it's not like it's bad it's like seeing a dead person and they just kind of look Serene like they're sleeping you know oh no no I think we might be done Bud oh no yeah we're screwed never mind well we're going to try it anyway we're going to try it anyway but that's up okay CPU and RAM
confirmed good jeez I got a deal buddy oh my goodness this screw oh wow that's really uh she's not coming out I think she's cross threaded in the first place I think this may have been an inexpertly assembled system that one's cross threaded the standoff came out well there's different types of screws in every freaking hole here yeah so hold on a second hold on a second that may have been damaged beforehand see have a look at this this is like mangled and that would have been an installation this
actually Jordan Jordan buddy that's me I don't think any of the traces are actually broken no way look at the hang on glasses off glasses the glasses are coming off the some real Tech shit's Happening Now boys the glasses are [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] off yeah those are good wow dude and like you saw you saw how like bent and mangled it looked it's frowning now a little not much I've seen way worse post you know what probably saved it Jordan what probably saved it is the corner it hit
on okay so if we look right the back corner here there's your initial impact so if it had gone down this way yeah it would have ripped this pcie slot open this way but the weight was on here but the weight was on there the weight came down toward the board and this is one of those metal reinforced slots which I always thought was just complete marketing nonsense right we did see with post Nord that did break but speaking of armored and reinforced once again component armor comes to the
rescue I think this SSD is going to be totally fine I don't see why not because of that heat spreader I want to I want to pop it out anyway let's have a look at it okay she looks fine good she looks fine she's only a 512 gig drive but hey still I'll take it dude this might work and also even if those traces that are a little bit mangled are dead cuz there's one that looks like it might be broken even if they're dead Jordan This is literally a segmented off part of the PCB that just handles onboard
sound yeah so we could still just use the audio off of our HDMI port plug into the headphone jack on our monitor we're using a USB microphone anyway we're good to go yeah there's no way Jordan I don't even see any lights on this is all of his stuff except for the video card right now yes okay conductive on the oxide code shut holy crap we got a light shut up you have got to be fing kidding me hold on she's off she's back on holy crap no I know I know I think she's I
think she's memory training holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I think oh my goodness I cannot believe that works no way also are you a filthy cheater oh my what does cheat engine do maybe it's perfectly innocent Hold On tool design to help you modify single player games without an internet connection you can make them harder or easier I think this might be okay give him a pass I think this might be okay I just wasn't familiar with the tool it didn't have a great sounding name In fairness to me I'm not going to dig any
deeper than this I'm not I don't want to see your homework folder whatever you're using microt torent for hear me out now it's time for the final boss how do you want to tackle this should we take the cooler off try to straighten the cooler try to straighten the GPU and reassemble yeah okay okay let's do it let's do it I think it's worth the try I mean dude  on that's my IO plate that'll buff out there's definitely at least this one connect oh it's okay uh well that it's
not quick grounded anymore but you know that might slide back in there hold one oh let's see if that's a non-essential one he sent over this handy dandy reference sheet so so just a second here yeah we don't even need that one that's a secondary HDMI all right let's freaking go that one doesn't even work if you use the DVI connector anyway okay all right I don't like this severe Bend that's a bad place for a Bend to happen right down the memory here because these uh these BGA chips um they're soldered
down to the board and those solder joints can be quite brittle actually here's what I'm thinking okay is we just Chuck it in the slot and I just like put my finger on it and see if the GPU warms up okay if it does we kind of try to bend it a little and we try and put the cooler back on okay okay is the power supply on no okay do it it's warm but not like hot VGA light's still on though going what the hell have you done to me I think she's but I don't think she's going to be able
to do it I think we do have to give her a little Bend yeah the safer way to do this would be to at the very least have the card like warmed up a little bit when we do it so it's not so brittle but realistically we have so little to lose that I think we're just going to kind of go for it here dude if this thing fires up I actually think I might just retire there's no mountain left to climb anymore I could never achieve greater okay dude that's pretty flat whoa you're right that's not whoa dude dude that to
go man dude that's not nearly as bad that's way better try it okay no no no no no no no I'm going to straight I'm going to straighten this I'm going to straighten this and put it back on yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah no no that's the play that's the play trust me trust me all right trust me bro guarantee a quality here I do want to have this on it this time if we can what's the dealio here though uh mainly your copper in here is bent to hell okay this right here is exactly what
makes our Precision screwdriver pretty special because unlike other multibits they have a longer blade so you can reach just a little bit farther into things without hitting the uh The Wider part of the blade there we go so unfortunately this is a really nicely built card and this is an aluminum shroud which means that um it's not just going to kind of spring back into shape it doesn't have that kind of memory but it's malleable oh man this is this will  though hi how you doing over there good
how you doing you know what how's the video card I think what I would like to do is do a quick Testo on this before we put the fan on before we fight with that thing yeah okay here we go at this point no matter the outcome this is a Triumph okay so she's off now and she's going to try again she's not going to try again she's just off I'm going to try again yeah yep it's almost like you shouldn't throw your computer off of a third story balcony it's almost like you should do the segue to our
