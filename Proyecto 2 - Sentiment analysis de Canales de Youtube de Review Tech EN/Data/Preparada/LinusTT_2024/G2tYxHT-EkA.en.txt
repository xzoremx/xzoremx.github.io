what's up everyone and welcome to the W show we've got a great show lined up for you guys today I forget what the title of the video is so I guess I'll leave that one for Luke you're going to buy a friend or something yeah yeah I could use a friend right now and I can buy one and hang it around my neck forever oh super weird I'll always be with you uh oh this is great news remember we said it was going to be a good news W show well I've got lots of good news I can buy friends and online
Market places are responsible for selling dangerous third party products that is so cool the inic awesome might be still going but maybe less than stuff what else we got today I'm sure there's going to be some bad sides of that but we'll we'll talk about it in a second uh can the EU save video games a few weeks ago the EU registered stop destroying video games as a citizen initiative and we'll talk about how that works how you can maybe help it things like that later um also skill-based 
better I don't know I didn't think I  it the show is brought to you today by manscaped one password and moose end not to be confused with moose end which would be a Moose's rump ah yes also our chair uh chair partner which support our rumps thank you very much thank you for tying that all back together professionals really appreciate you Luke buy a friend a new AI company called friend wants to solve the scourge of loneliness get this with technology it's a wearable necklace that 
companion have you seen this Luke have you heard about this oh yeah I sure have the wearer can speak or even message the friend device over Bluetooth and the AI will respond over text the AI may also listen in and comment on whatever is currently going on in the user's immediate environment however any data collected is only stored locally hm I mean until they update the TOs I don't know or get acquired yeah unlike the R1 so that's from rabbit and the Humane pin this friend only costs around $100 and
requires no Cellular Connection as it uses Bluetooth so at least I don't have to buy a subscription to this friend yeah is there no subscription I don't know there might be a subscri I mean does it matter kind of because if there isn't a subscription then it's like almost more of a sign that it is definitely dude this is like if I was this is like if I was telling you look it's a there's there's a cockroach salad company right and you're just like oh but but there's no subscription who cares it doesn't
matter it's irrelevant what is this oh that's probably one of is that coming through there's there's a motorbiking trend going around me lawn La yeah they're doing some uh yard work outside either way the friend company raised Two and A half million dollar from investors giving them a valuation of I I forget exactly was what it was I think it was somewhere in the neighborhood of like tens of uh tens of millions of dollars or something like that but this is great the company has
reportedly spent $1.8 million of this money on buying the domain friend.com hot take probably best move they could have done really I don't think you could have possibly possibly gotten the news out about this device to as many people as they did if they didn't blow 1.8 million on a domain I mean it's the only reason I'm talking about it yep and it's the only reason anyone's talking about it so they're idiots because like a fox as far as my understanding goes they have
enthusiastically embraced everyone just trashing them for the domain and like spread the news more huh I think it might have literally been like part of the plan there's no there's you can't count of but it could be of a Savvy response to going I mean the that they didn't hide it already I guess is the fact that after buying that domain yeah uh outside of what they've or including what they've raised they had what 500 600 "$700,000 left they had to make a" device produce the device or maybe just
not I mean have they actually have they done more than show a prototype yet h i mean here let's have a you know what screw it I'm going to I'm going to buy into it I'm no I think you were vulnerable there's a difference oh my gosh friend not imaginary wait what no I think it's imaginary this looks pretty imaginary to me right now that digitals digital that's a that's a shell with a wire on it that's not that looks like the thing Ursula kept Ariel's voice in in The Little Mermaid that's not wait what this
is have they have they shown anything talk pause read Dan how bad is our audio probably uh okay do you do you want to ask them if they need to do that this has never happened why is this happening at 600 p.m. on a Friday I know right it's like guys I will personally cover your overtime for you to not do this right now um anyway the point is here's the product Luke and I couldn't help noticing this really doesn't look that much like the one that the guy was wearing what's included in the Box white
case USB bu right now when does it ship no no it's pre-order it's pre-order I see I I you know what I think this might just be I don't know what it is I I actually don't know what it is Luke this is start shipping I mean they're not even close to done this is four months this is 4 to 7 months from now this is basically a Kickstarter but without even the safety net of kickstarters terms is there basically any I mean no but terms and conditions like what what like look you you spent
you won't give you your money back this is great you spent a fortune on friend.com but you Incorporated your company as my tab AI Inc what even what the what even is this that's interesting we operate the website as well the blah blah blah legal terms collectively blah blah blah close Confidant for everyday life we will provide you notice of any scheduled changes intended for 18 year we recommend you print a copy of these legal you print a copy of these legal terms for your record hold on
uh-huh well wait this constitutes a legally binding agreement agreement to what hold on not there's no there's nothing to agree to here is this just a meme this has got to be this has got to be just a joke so I found my tab. a yeah which leads to a personal companion thing this is like the worst website there's a pre-order button you click it it goes to stripe check out says no longer taking orders this looks like the same thing though so they pivoted but it looks like the same
product interes can can we is that  okay this is this is Wild is there a plan to talk about donut media today what would we talk about I don't know I  today I'm really more interested in the uh I'm really more interested in the friend.com mystery because I'm finding it extremely fascinating James  whoa  okay wow that's huge here it is goose Auto Works wait this is a month ago though I think that's why I left donut  all right I'm James and I'm leaving donut he was a super nice guy I uh Goose
Auto Works is different yeah I I I really enjoyed working with the whole team down there um when I went down to collab with donut yeah he seemed super cool so uh hey yeah from everything I know about him which is that I think he seemed super cool when I met him and as far as I know he hasn't had a pedo Scandal yet um seems like we should be with YouTubers these days it just seems like we should be giving him our support you know building up the non pedo YouTuber Community thank
you thank you for going above and  guess oh man apparently there's other friend uh AI necklaces in development so here's oh my God this is called based Hardware or is this the wait what what am I man he looks like the age of person that would be starting based hardware.com I I I have no idea what I'm looking at right now I don't know if this is if this is uh a promotional video for this product oh yeah okay look you can you can order now friend devkit only $69 okay come on there's no way these people aren't
meing there there's no way this cannot be real based Hardware pre-order now for $69 shut up I just want to know if anyone has like ever shipped any of this stuff no there's no way is it just like a Bluetooth dongle on a necklace essentially yeah and and unless there's a subscription there's no way they're going to be able to accar langage model running data somewhere unless grock gr not going to help you out that much if you need a friend though it might be based and edgy um but I don't know if it would be
ultimately helpful anyway our discussion question here is is this actually a good way to deal with loneliness and you know what as much as um as much as this might come across as a bit of a copout I have to confess that I don't necessarily feel that qualified to uh to talk about this um it's been it's been really um it's been really eye openening seeing how many people commented on the video earlier this week where I talked about the passing of my sister Emma um it's been it's been really eye-opening to see
how many I mean and it makes sense right like every human dies so therefore every human experiences loss right um but it's it it's been it's been incredible to see you know how much empathy there's been from the community it's been um it's been incredible to hear people's stories and I have read a lot of them I can't reply to all of them but as you guys know I read a lot of YouTube comments um and it's been it's been incredible sort of reading about people's people's journey through loss and you know what
it's meant to them what's helped them and the really sad ones are the ones where people are talking about you know not having a Support Network and and and you know urging me to you know make sure that I'm using mine and I'll tell you like I I have been using mine I've leaned on uh my family my friends my wife who is also family but for some reason when you say family a lot of people don't necessarily know that you mean my wife you know like it's I think bloodline yeah yeah exactly um and uh
and so I guess what I'm trying to get at here is I I don't actually I don't feel qualified to talk about if this is actually a good way to deal with loneliness so uh if anyone in the audience is kind of looking at a product like this and going you know what that would actually be really helpful to me or I I could I I could see this being a stepping stone to learning to talk about my feelings better like I I kind of I kind of want to hear from you guys because um I I don't I don't know like I I
wouldn't use this but I also have the privilege of having the best like counselor slash companion slri on the face of the Earth Ivonne and and I also have Luke I knew you were talking about the whole time when you did the lean over G I was like what are you doing I was just messing with them oh okay I I I do think I mean there's a they they they call the loneliness epidemic right like this is a huge thing right now as if I remember correctly the average adult male has 0.5
friends or something like it's it's less than one is what I remember um and that has got to be kind of rough a question I would pose for you is you said I wouldn't use something like this I have a great companion if you were stuck in a like basically like an isolation room like maybe you did one of those like uh Mars experiment things I would I would talk to my necklace yeah I think I would too I would and maybe and maybe you're right maybe the answer is as simple as that if I was isolated enough would I
resort to this and there's no question I mean humans need contact and I think that we would accept fake contact before we would accept no contact and no interaction with if I'm being totally real if I'm by myself I already talk to myself a lot yeah so I don't think it's going to be really that different if the thing replies yeah but then what happens when it deflates [Laughter] well yeah people people like if you leave someone alone in room for they're going to personify like practic anything
they can CU humans just do be like that um I could see people getting use out of it I think you should really try to not allow it to replace or stop direct human interaction yeah but if there isn't any I I feel like something's probably better than nothing yeah but is this are we accepting a crutch ConEd what we should have is a splint and a cast you know like we are we putting ourselves in a position where we're we're making the journey ultimately more difficult by by putting this
uh this fake um this this fake interaction into our lives and Avon just commented and it's probably very true it just like hurts to even read but he said abandoned elderly May benefit yeah it's like yeah probably yep because it's it's one of those situations where like if if you're only social inter action ever is care workers coming in and like dropping your food off and leaving immediately because they "have 10,000 other things to take care of" um yeah you might it just that sucks but
like it's probably real speaking of things that are probably real and ultimately where we're headed uh long Linus in float plane chat says can we skip friend and just get to robotic wuss yeah that's coming for sure yeah well that's that's not phrasing I didn't mean it I didn't I didn't intend it is what I meant that's  sorry okay all right um what I was trying to say is that's not coming eventually it's  now I mean you can already you can already interact have versions of it
don't they yeah exactly like you can interact with an AI uh like an AI voice of like some twitch streamers and stuff like that so yeah yeah this is totally thing it's just a matter of when Real Dolls are going to integrate it right like it's some form of collaboration or something or just do it themselves yep it's not the only thing they're going to do themselves dang it we're going to get them someday gentlemen we're 17 minutes into the show we made it past what is the YouTube's thing like minutes or
something hey 17 minutes in is pretty  record oh no what what are we supposed to do but not in age oh whoa next topic okay move right on uh what are our other headline topics today I don't even know what that means I'm just terrified of it skill-based matchmaking is just playing better in response to discourse condemning skills-based matchmaking Activision has released a 25-page white paper revealing a secret experiment where they massively reduced the impact of skill in
matchmaking for half of Modern Warfare 3 players in North America according to their results around 90% of players had lower overall play time and were more likely to quit during matches with only the most skilled of players being unaffected by the change now hold on because I want to back up and say other than reading the words together in the order they're in I don't actually know exactly what skills based matchmakings in this context I got you and why anybody would be upset about it sure hit
me so uh completely non skills-based matchmaking it's not really matchmaking but like completely non would just be like Pub servers back in the day you have a dedicated server list you jump into whatever server is there you're playing with those players complet matchmaking version of that would just be filling random lobbies with people automatically but based onif nothing yeah yeah exactly first and first out um skills based matchmaking would be that you would have some type of like MMR a
matchmaking ranking um and in this case it would probably be hidden so you don't necessarily know what your matchmaking ranking is but it's going to match you up with people that are similar to your ranking as best as it can okay so then followup question um who the actual donkey thinks that skills-based matchmaking is a bad idea I think like like is this not complet like is this controversial Like I Do Is this a there people there are I don't know if it's I don't know if it's a hot
take uh for the actual average person necessarily but there is definitely a loud amount of people that uh don't like skills-based matchmaking I know that for what reason exactly I don't know necessarily I can think of like I think it would be maybe hard unless the matchmaking rank that you have is public uhhuh which I know some people don't like that because then they feel like they're constantly playing ranked which you technically are yeah you just don't know that um but unless it's public to
me a negative feeling that could come from it is that you feel like you're constantly on this treadmill of skill where you never really feel like you're getting that much better compared to other people because the game is constantly pairing you with people that are of the same goodness I guess right so by So What by their logic anyone should be allowed to be in the Olympic freestyle swimming finals and if someone if one person happens to be really good then like and one person can barely swim
that's like are you entertained by this like sorry what I do think every Olympics should have like an army of like J gim Bobs uh that are just like average dudes and they just show them alongside the Olympians to like show The Gap I would I would actually like I I know this is not an original idea people have been saying this for years I would love it if it happened cuz like you see these people perform and you're like that's cool but like I maybe this is some sport I've never seen before um or
like I never really understood the Gap like you see someone dive and they have like three droplets come out of the water like I don't is that good and then you see some like random dude just flop it's like a huge wave and you're like okay so there's actually like there's there's difficulty here that I think that would be fantastic but anyways I don't really get the argument I prefer match and the thing is I honestly speaking like I I to me this is so um and I'm so sorry if it I sound like such an
sometimes because some well no sometimes things just seem really obvious to me and then I say like isn't this obvious and then people are like wow lonus is mean that wasn't obvious I there are there are things about uh skill B based matchmaking that makes things less interesting to me personally for sure but well hold on hold on hold on let me back up for a second cuz I like I okay I I maybe and maybe part of it is just my lived experiences that make this obvious to me there's uh there's a a local
badminton tournament it's called badmo and they usually do about two to four tournaments a year and that's what I signed up for when I did my very first badminton competition and they had their their Gamers they're memers there it's a young group that runs it and so the way that they divided their brackets uh was blue shell Red Shell and green shell and the description was blue shell is for competitive players at a very high level uh like if you've ever competed provincially or nationally basically
this is Mario Kart you should be in here yeah exactly uh Red Shell was if you if you play play regularly and and compete hard and green shell was for if you are just getting into the sport and you're looking for a friendly competition I signed up for green shell because that was a description of me I I was playing every every week but you know I'd only really been doing it for 6 months to a year something like that I showed up for my first match got absolutely wrecked by someone who was
sandbagging in a lower tier and I guess for me what I realized from that experience was that that's not fun I didn't have fun did they have fun  would would okay here here's a good example would Magnus Carlson have fun like destroying my son at chess have you seen some of his like he puts a blindfold on and then plays five people at the same time that's totally different so sick no I know I know CU I'm I'm talking about I'm talking about in what is supposed to be I think he' be
really Bor a level match I'm sure it would be and if he did get some kind of perverse pleasure out of that I doubt it would we think that that's cool or admirable no would it be fun for I mean if he and I'm not talking about him taking the time to give a tutorial on you know what he was doing and why and that's I'm talking in competition because we're talking about this in a Competitive Gaming context right where people are competing to win how could anyone look at that and go
yes that is good and honorable and enjoyable and I have I have always said and this a lot of this was inspired by my experience in that first tournament where someone who had absolutely no right to be in green shell but it was self assessed right so they just decided that they were going to be green shell because they want a metal essentially right is that metal valuable I mean we mock participation trophies but you're basically self opting into a participation trophy for yourself by
like competing in the kids League like what's wrong with you I think you have some I think you have some long-term resentment over this uh this particular occasion well it's not it's not the resentment it's a desire to fix it like I will tell people I will tell people all the time I would rather lose a match 2523 then then win you want good games 214 yeah someone tried to bring up uh fast Philly said some people do love that stuff remember tarov and I don't necessarily think that's true for tarov
I understand what you're trying to get at but like when I used to play if you could tell like you can you can see and tarov the level of the person that you took down um and if they were a low-l player I wouldn't necessarily automatically do this but I would if they were a lowle player i' would look at the kit that they brought in and be like is this a low-l player who's played a lot but just they didn't go super hard this season or is this actually a new player and if it was a new player I'd
throw all their stuff in a bush so they get it back in Insurance cuz like I don't I'm not like super proud of that W you know yeah but I I think sometimes like some things that I do like about not skill-based matchmaking is like if if I think about playing TF2 mostly most of these are going to come from TF2 but I think about playing TF2 back in the day especially with really big Lobby games it's like a five versus five I I can't think of many scenarios where I liked non-skill based matchmaking but
big Lobby games you'd find like the one good person on the other team and even if you weren't doing that well trying to like hunt that person down had a very deep level of satisfaction to it like maybe I'm not doing that great in the game but if I can impact this game by taking down their star player every once in a while through like certain weird type of gameplay then that's like really fun to me I think there's emergent types of gameplay I think there's emergent interactions that
happen from mixing pot instead of skill-based matchmaking and I think there's a little bit of forever treadmill that comes from skill-based matchmaking um that I think might be result like part of this story is that 90% of over of players had a lower overall play time when it wasn't skill-based matchmaking and I don't know personally that all of that is just because they enjoyed the game more I I would say that as much as I do think skill-based matchmaking is in general better um I suspect some of that
increased play time is because of the forever treadmill of I'm always slightly behind sure you never had a game where you were number one you never like these things didn't really happen because the game is designed to not really allow that to happen um sure so I don't know I understand why some people might think it's negative personally I think overall it is more positive I do see a lot of people talking about how like what if I you know just want to relax and play a game
for fun without trying too hard and it's like right but the issue is that you're playing a competitive game so the other team they don't have the luxury of deciding oh I'm down I'll just try and win um and so it's not about you it's about everybody having an opportunity to win and that that to me I mean that's the very that's that's the the foundational core of competition if there's if one side decides who's going to win would would you would you tune into a sporting event like I think
that's why the TF2 examples stand out to me is because as much as I am definitely try Harding cuz I sort of do that all the time and everything but in TF2 it is much more of like an arcade game with a huge Lobby because I'm used to like 16 versus 16 arcade style gameplay and then that that's where you're going to get a lot more of those emergent cases where you can like head hunt the top players and all other yeah and but in TF2 just through the sheer law of numbers unless
people are being complete You Know Jack yeah and it's going to average out a lot better it will it the chances of it averaging out it's also a more chaotic game there is absolutely skill in Team Fortress 2 totally but there's also absolutely stepping on uh uh a bomb just because you know it was was flung across the map like it's like it happens right and so I think that I think that TF2 is is an example of a game where as long as people are not mal iously intentionally
stacking the teams then it's not nearly as much of an issue but honestly I'm so glad you brought that up because we all know that team stacking is a dick thing to do and essentially when you argue against skills-based matchmaking you're saying well I should be allowed to be on a stacked team yeah I don't feel like it happened that much in TF2 though I I I think across the board I don't love it but in certain games like in COD does make sense yeah yeah I I I don't think there's a very good argument against
skillbase matchmaking and CAU but I do think there's other games where it's genuinely fun there's no way that I would play Halo infinite without skills based matchmaking it' be a complete waste of time a top level player is on such a different level that they would just wipe the other team grab the flag drop it wipe them when they respawn and carry it back like it's just it's not are they having fun and if they are like what's wrong with them you know um I'm sorry I I I definitely see
how there are how there are formats where where skills based matchmaking might not make that much sense I mean even okay coming back to Halo infinite the one semi competitive game I guess I play that actually has uh what's what MMR I guess is what our play what what's the player uh ranking uh it like it depends sort of on how it's being handled but if you say MMR most people know what you mean yeah so so it's probably the one game I play these days that has like a persistent MMR that chases
you across all the different formats but if you're playing big Team Battle yeah I could see them playing a little faster and looser with it yeah uh cuz things are just sort of generally more chaotic but if you're playing like a 4v4 format one person being out of whack completely destroys the gameplay experience for everyone including themselves whether they realize it or not the the I I just thought of another argument that might come up for the anti-skill based matchmaking crowd is is is that some
games do lock you out from being able to play with your friends if there's too much of a gap um I know that used to be a thing and that's a bummer but like the answer to that is just allowing user servers right like the answer to that is not to not have an MMR and not have skills based matchmaking in my opinion that combination of dedicated user servers and skill-based matchmaking is the absolute prime that's the way to go and I'm not saying I'm not saying you shouldn't be allowed to play with your
friends or you shouldn't be allowed to I mean uh Luke and Joe and I would uh would Lobby up with my son when he he's getting kind of sweaty actually I was going to say he's probably better now every time I play with him he's a little better I know but we would Lobby up with him and we would know that we're going to have to carry him and that you know the matchmaking is going to be a little bit weird because I'm going to go probably well I'm I'm all over the place I'll be anywhere yeah I'll be anywhere
from like sub one: one to like 4 to one depending on how things are going for me anyway genuinely pretty confusing doesn't matter the the point is that Luke and Joe are both really good I'm this X Factor and then my son's was going to go like you know one and 15 or whatever so we we knew that was going to happen um and and and I would never argue that you shouldn't be allowed to play the game you want to play it but there's a time and a place and you have to understand why these systems are in
place and that it's not about you it's about it's about creating an environment where everybody has a fair chance to win and bad skill Bas ranking yeah that sucks yeah like if you've got if you've got skills based matchmaking and you're being dumped time and time again into matches where you are getting absolutely just destroyed um there I mean it could be one of two problems it could be that their their skills based ranking system is not very good or it could be three problems it could be that
the servers are really light and that they just don't have a lot of options for matching things up but problem number three is that you could have run into three holes who are playing on Smurf accounts and are ruining the system for everyone yeah so to me the I mean the problem so often is not the game but the gamers yeah yeah um I think if everyone in good faith engages in like a skills based matchmaking system I think it can work really well I think you especially run into trouble if people are not um I
don't know man I feel like I'm going to end up like lit up on r/ COD or something like that over this but I've had worse maybe there's parts of the argument that we don't know I don't know but it it seems pretty straightforward to me I don't know what my something I like so if if there if there isn't dedicated servers and you're still just using matchmaking on both sides something I like is when there's when there's ranked and the rank is very much in your face and when there isn't
ranked and it's skill it's still skill-based matchmaking I prefer it if you can find it if it's possible yep sure don't don't show the up and down after every game don't make it a center feature thing but if I can like go into my profile and find it somewhere that's kind of cool because like for me it's I would like to know if I'm getting better if that makes sense yeah and I mean for me I I I did find it frustrating that when I was when I signed up for playing ranked you know
that because when I was in that mood I was playing ranked but when I signed up for quick play or whatever else it turned out I was playing ranked as well like I think a lot of this could be solved by these companies just having a separate game mode that is skills based ranking or not skills based ranking I mean providing player choice is never a bad option but what I suspect that people would discover is these high skilled players that want to go dunon noobs in the not skills based ranking
mode are going to discover that none of those people want to be in there with them like I used to sweat super hard in League of Legends and something that I would do is in the non-ranked mode um is that a thing pretty sure that's the thing am I tripping no yeah there there's yeah there's ranked and not ranked okay it's been a long time I haven't cared about league in like a decade um but when I used to sweat in League I would only play very specific characters in ranked and I would try
really hard yeah and then in not ranked maybe sometimes I'd play those characters but I wouldn't really be trying as hard or I'd be experimenting with new item builds or something usually I'd be doing something that wasn't exactly the same as what I'd be doing at ranked trying a new item build trying a new opener trying new laning partners trying a new Lane even um maybe even going as far as trying entirely new characters like I don't want to be evaluated at the same level as I was in
ranked um so I do appreciate that as well who's your main uh I used to call her Ashy and then I heard people that run the game say her name and now it's Ash apparently oh and that's fine oh oh man Luke that's a silent E I liked E I liked ashy more I prefer that name ashy y all right y fun fact it's my little brother's nickname as a like small small child oh cool yeah um anywh who what are we supposed to be doing Dan he's not paying attention I am I just have my mic muted
in here for the he was cutting the grass you could hear him that was Dan out there my extra job mowing the lawn he's he's got to pick up some side hustles you know lmg doesn't pay like it used to yeah uh we can do merch messages in 10 minutes so you could do another topic up to you sure let's do another topic what about this one Speaking of Dan sure go for it I didn't even look at what you clicked on uh do your invoice Dan oh yes uh okay so we talked about this previous L on the show Dan has not invoiced me
correctly for the help with the memorial for my sister so I have put a note in the show today Dan needs to make the invoice and send it to me now or I will not proceed with the show okay I'll wait Luke you can talk but I will not participate in the show until Dan is done sending me a proper invoice uh what do I go talk about I I'm CH 5609 says value yourself properly Dan sent me an invoice for the help that he gave me that was not enough and so I have informed him that he will send me a
bigger invoice and I talked about this on the show a week ago or two weeks ago I have since then sent him three follow-ups and he has not returned an invoice to me to be fair it was on my personal email yes which is extremely reasonable but I guess I just don't check it enough I I don't think that was the reason dude I like never check my personal email it's like a problem actually oh yeah my personal email is just like delivery notifications like I yeah I I basically don't have a personal email
which could be a problem someday if I ever just don't work here anymore get fired or something like there you go that's sent he promises that I have proper invoice I sent you a proper invoice once this is a larger number money for a different rate card but sure whatever whatever dude fine I I I don't know if I'm offended that you thought that I would give you a good rate or something just because I don't know I don't know man there no Dan look I don't mean any offense by it what I mean is that people
should be valued for the look Mark tried to comp me for the uh for the um H H what was it for the compilation from from that one for the second we had to do a uh harrowing experience we had to do a second Memorial because my grandparents couldn't make it to the first one and there was a whole bunch of family drama around that anyway the point is uh we had a compilation which by the way the footage from the first one turned out great thank you very much Dan and Brandon our old camera editor
our camera editor our old camera guy actually helped with it as well so they both helped put the whole thing together for me um anyway Mark tried to comp me on the compilation that he did for that and I'm having the same argument with him him I can't leverage stopping the show until he comp you you did let me put it this way let me put it hold on I haven't even looked at this number this is this is pretty funny to observe because uh makes me feel bad I think I think Dan is genuinely
frustrated I am I I I don't know I like he specifically said you know don't give me a good rate because so I just gave him the rate card for the work that I did well and now he's like it's wrong give me the different rate card so now I feel bad and I'm getting called out publicly on it and I've been stewing on this no we need to have a conversation because I think I believe very strongly that you are undervaluing your time that's what that is my for that service that you bought from
me no no no because because the the reason you can do that service is all the is all the wealth of experience that you have like yeah you didn't do that much but other people couldn't do it I guess yeah no yes yes you it's important even this I don't think the hour count is right but that's okay you sent it to me in a sheet so I can just edit it oh my God this guy all right that's good enough at least I'm on a Google sheet and as far as I can tell I have sharing privileges on it so I'll deal with 
chat oh my God I'm quitting freelancing these clients are awful they either don't or they're like I I can't I don't understand what a tip is just pay me in cash it's like say 5%  government oh no oh boy uh I have an update while we're in the announcement section I have an update love you you too on the uh the video we did where we reviewed people's setups internally oh yeah uh I went to go actually buy Nolan a monitor but he has two sick new ones already that monitor was just like a
bait was he meing on us his other monitors were like flood damaged so he borrowed that monitor from a friend it was his lunch back I want his $10 Uber e gift card back he was waiting for his like flood damage insurance and then just balled out and bought two sick  well I mean I was legitimately going to buy him a monitor yeah whatever excuse you give yourself it wasn't I was I was literally shopping for one he was going to he would have done it he would have got you a birthday present wow he
thought of it and everything wow I can't fight this it's indefensible man speaking of the number of people that were upset about the prize being lunch in the form of a $10 Uber Eats gift card even though we like we altered the headline yeah I mean it was the priz there is no priz it's just a funny video but the it was crowd it was crowd we actually had the unaltered headline and then it like changed it was a he haahha is is joke is joke he's funny he's funny he's so funny hurts me you know what doesn't
hurt merch messages let's do some merch messages the way to interact with the show is of course merch messages don't don't leave a super chat or a twitch bit leave a merch message go to LTT store.com we've got all kinds of great products for you to check out over there including our new chroma t-shirt it's inspired by the chromaticity diagram one of the best tools to represent the range of colors visible to the human eye why wear one color when you can wear all of them and black like always it's printed
on our custom LTT blanks that are soft cozy and Shrink resistant we also are calling out even though there is no  anything yes you going to put it on yeah it's going to take a while though because buttons it's a it's a it's a paradigm that I've never really fully wrapped my head around it's like a shirt that takes several times longer to put on because it has buttons in the front but you know what you can't argue with the look we're also promoting the macad dress Oxford it's designed to be a fun
and versatile shirt that you can dress up or down inspired by the shirt that our host Jonathan Horst actually wore in the very first macad dress video the fabric comes with a little bit of stretch for added comfort and has a little macad dress logo embroidered on the corner of the shirt pocket I was going to figure that out I I I would have realized here we go yes I am one of those monsters who only partway unbuttons it and then slips it over the top I hate this I feel I feel I bet you
don't even own cuff links I haven't even seen anybody call me out yet but I feel called out oh yeah looks good on you though thank you of course it does a nice  see yeah what do you what what do you guys what do you guys want from me okay what do you guys want and anyway the reason we're featuring this one is not for any reason other than that Maria who worked on the photos for it was really proud of the photo shoot that they did and um really wanted us to feature the pictures on the show because we didn't
do it before that's super cute they're great photos she has really been stepping up her game yeah the product photos are doing doing very well oh yeah outstanding look at this how cute is this no way I think they're in the same place that we did the photo shoot for the photography challenge that little like walking path near the office yeah yeah yeah yeah oh well I don't know whatever where Colton has the yeah where Colton's pregnant or James is pregnant one of them is pregnant I think I think
James is posing as Colton's partner and Colton is pregnant yeah yeah fantastic and for those of you who don't know there are both standard and Tall sizes what what no way what oh wait oh oh well apparently they've been popular small tall unavailable we might have uh we might have some lanky tiny Boys in our community I want to see an LT like vest to go along with it as well anyway to um to leave a merch message all you got to do is add an item to your cart leave a merch message and check out and it'll go
to producer Dan who will I inv bitterly complain about just you know wanting to be valued for his work or whatever um he'll forward it to someone internally or reply to it himself pop it up at the bottom like this or he will curate it for me and Luke to respond to why don't we do a couple curated ones to show the people how it works sure let's see hey LD question for lonus after getting handson with the Zotac gaming zone are there any features that you think would make you switch to that from the Ally I
mean the fact that it is the only non steam deck that has um I if I recall correct man I I don't want to say the wrong thing so I'm just going to I'm just going to double check and make sure that it's the right one that I remember I believe it comes with dual trackpads though yeah if I recall correctly it's the only non steam deck handheld that has dual trackpads so if you wanted the improved performance of the Z1 extreme compared to the steam deck which is a significant uplift um but you
wanted dual track pads then this kind of seems like the only game in town everything else about it seemed pretty fine I guess um but I think that is their most obvious um that's their most obvious selling point uh the adjustable triggers is kind kind of cool personally I don't use them uh but this really opens up different gaming experiences that with dual joysticks is not necessarily possible I know it's a bit of a dead meme but um Civ having touchpads like that is a lot
nicer comp mean people love civiliz I just mean like we've been saying that for like eight years or something oh sure it's always been the example for like oh this would be cool oh I can use this steam controller from like what what was like 2015 or whatever so I can play Civ on my couch like it's been the same example the whole time wow people are super called out ker is like I'm playing Civ right now yeah that's cool how dare you good I I added the last part he he felt it though hit me Dan
hello guys a month or two ago Raspberry Pi went public many worry that they will now become like any other greedy corporate company what are your thoughts I would be lying if I wasn't a bit worried that is sort of the point honestly speaking I have been I I've been kind of observing that the Raspberry Pi Foundation already wasn't really doing Raspberry Pi Foundation things like it and you know what I'm sure that there are factors that I'm not aware of I don't have any insight or knowledge here or anything
like that but the fact that it has been so difficult to get a Raspberry Pi like a first party Raspberry Pi at MSRP for for so long um to me is just a clear indication that they don't they don't want to make enough of them at the super low price um like I If it was if it was over the course of the you know silicon shortage during the pandemic or if it was for a short period of time um apparently it hasn't been hard to get an MSRP Pi for over a year so okay the sold out for most selling
selling yeah I I don't know it's also been a huge known problem of Raspberry Pi since like basically launched and they' launched in 2012 so like okay them just solving it in the last years well yes and no I mean they have had valid reasons for a lot of that time so all all I can really say is it seemed to me that they were operating less like a a not for proit foundation and more like just a company that makes little computers for a long time um I had yeah go ahead the second you go public you're
you're beholden to whatever shareholder owns the most shares so like I don't know um Mad Max Gyver says they sold them to Industry and Professionals in priority as far as I know yeah see like I said these are all things that I that I I don't have any insid or knowledge for I I I don't I I don't really I don't know a ton about it other than to say that they are split now between Raspberry Pi Foundation and then like Raspberry Pi the company and I forget what the exact naming is or exact
breakdown is um and the only reason to do that would be to pursue profit for the sake of your corporate shareholders so I can absolutely see why you would be concerned because basically going public and being beholden to shareholders seems like a downhill slide every time it happens um with that said I mean there's no reason to say that a company couldn't be terrible because of private Equity holders like oh yeah absolutely just because you don't go public doesn't mean you're a good company um it might it
might even like mean the opposite you want to be able to do more things in the shade apparently Sony is a major stakeholder okay well that's fun uh this link has a locator for raspberry pies at MSRP rpy locator.com uh all right so pshop us and pshop Califor California Canada are both in stock what  mean add the cart yeah in stock so there you go maybe everything's fine at least  H me with one more Dan oh yeah sure sure uh let's have a look hey Bo Luke and Daisy thoughts on how to get change in a
niche duopoly I work in radiotherapy physics and choice is cheap vers cheap and bad versus expensive and good how to  little wow you want me to solve yeah like antitrust issues good luck bro um got this you have 180 characters go uh yeah um Good Luck everybody I um send them words of encouragement you know while you're at it you want to solve capitalism yeah uh hunger uh I I I appreciate the the desire um but I don't think there's really anything you can do uh cheap isn't going to be
incentivized by they're they're both really not really going to be incentivized by anything other than profit if you can convince cheap they'll get more of the market if they make their things better um sure but they're probably getting their Market by being affordable yeah and they're and and that's probably affecting their R&amp;D  um and in you know a field like radio therapy I I I I I I don't think that you necessarily want to um you know encourage the use of the one that you know is
bad you know just so that they can get more Revenue yeah um so that's that's real tough that's real tough okay uh why don't we do another topic Luke do you want to pick one sure yeah hopefully you know something how about some good news can the EU save video o yeah this is exciting a few weeks ago the EU registered stop destroying video games as a Citizens initiative a petition that EU citizens can go sign onto if they want an official response from the EU government the initiative is
part of Ross Scott's stop killing games movement and it aims to prevent Publishers from remotely rendering games unplayable when they decide to discontinue support this week the petition opened for online signatures its organizers will have a year to collect at least a million signatures which I'm fairly sure they will do but they'll only do so if you go sign it so please do so right now uh they will also have to hit a minimum number of signatures from citizens within seven EU
countries um all 1 million signatures can't just come from one country for example um however these thresholds are relatively low like I'm posting I'm posting the link in all the various chats everywhere where people watch The W show now is a really good time if you are a citizen of any of these places to head over there and register this is this is kind of it's kind of important I mean in the grand scheme of things no you know it's not that important but for as Gamers um if
we want to have any chance of preserving the gaming experiences that we're having right now before they all just get sunset by the developers or maybe more likely the Publishers um you got to get on this because this is is the most momentum we've ever had by a country mile oh yeah yeah yeah so I dropped links in all the chats guys uh do what you can to spread the word like if you know even one person in Bulgaria uh G get them get them to register uh to to issue a statement of
support uh it'll help a bit which is all we can really hope for uh is that it no uh this week the petition opened for online signatures its organizers will have a year to collect those signatures oh I already said that b the petition doesn't ensure legal action but it will obligate political leaders in the EU to respond to the issue very interesting uh Alexander asks if there's an update on the backpack zipper replacement actually there is I got a whole I got a whole timeline for
it uh basically we have already done priority ones where people contacted us saying that it's broken and then then the rest of them are going out in waves  quicker here we go here we go shipping waves and scheduling so wave one is complete um wave two is oh wait no Wave 1 will be complete by September 9th wave two will be complete so this will be another "5,000 to 10,000 units this will be" complete by the end of September wave three should be complete in early October wave four should be complete by
end of October and wave five should be complete in November so we should have all of them out by November yay finally the end of this epic Saga you're still dealing with that asks Scrappy DP yeah so it turns out um "when you sell 40,000 of something with a" defective something on it and there's four of them on each one and you need to make "160,000 replacement defective things um" might take a sec It Takes a Minute um we basically metal right yeah they're made of titanium yeah so we basically like
developed a product um that we don't sell that we just send to people who got a bad product um as you can imagine we're a little put out by the whole thing given that the Carabiner was developed by our backpack partner so we're like super not stoked on all that but I mean we're we're committed to doing the right thing even if it takes us a minute uh we want to do it right the last thing we wanted to do was send out something that was just going to fail again so uh yeah we're we're still
dealing with it but uh hey we're dealing with it so can't yeah I know I'll leave that actually so cool uh speaking of things that should potentially be dealing with a recall hey why don't we talk about Intel this week uh Intel has extended warranties on on 13th and 14th gen CPUs which is good but that is about the only good news coming out of Intel this week um for one thing and this is funny this I was chatting with Wendell from level one Tex and he pointed out something that wouldn't have even
occurred to me since I haven't worked in in the in the retail bis for a while um so you can buy Intel CPUs uh Trey or or OEM and generally speaking for end users it doesn't make a ton of sense to do that because the savings are really small if you're just buying one trade chip there have been times when buying an oem CPU or like a try CPU has been a hack to save a significant amount of money uh like I remember back in the um back in the Athlon XP days you could pick up these um these mobile like two
2500 Plus mobile chips that were were only available as as a tray part and they were significantly less expensive and they were rumored to be better bined than the Desktop 2500 pluses and the only drawback was they didn't come with a heat sink and they only came with a one-year warranty instead of a three-year warranty you might see where I'm going with this with warranty differences yeah so anyone who's buying these 13th and 14th gen chips in bulk might be buying them OEM in order to
save on the cost of the cooler and you know shipping the Box around because they just they come in a tray they literally come in a tray if you buy enough of them um they are not getting the warranty extension oh so they're just left with oh and the funny thing about it to me is that seems unwise the difference in price at least everywhere I'd ever seen it and maybe there's a bigger difference if you're negotiating this directly with Intel or whatever but the difference in price that I had seen
over the years did not really justify the difference in warranty coverage to me like it seems like Intel could probably afford based on what people are paying for these things to just extend the warranty for them as well but currently it does not look like Intel is planning to extend the warranty of OEM parts at least unless I unless I hear uh otherwise so that's some bad news and it gets even worse this week Intel announced "15,000 layoffs and I've got to say um I" don't think that number is actually
fully up to date because uh yeah really the Scuttle butt in the office this morning uh yeah it's it's gone up uh Intel said says it will cut around1 "19,000 jobs as it aims to save $10"  year they also are apparently canceling anything non-essential in order to cut costs uh Intel's stock recently hit a 50-year low and this is why I don't give Financial advice um and this follows two consecutive quarters of financial losses it is unclear how well the company will shoulder the cost of Outsourcing its
upcoming lunar Lake chips so Intel has traditionally enjoyed very good margins on their silicon products because they do their fabrication inh house but they have chips coming that are not fabricated by Intel's own Fab I still believe in Pat Ginger's Vision if he does get a chance to execute on it of turning Intel into a Fab Company as well as a chip company I still think that's uh maybe at this point the only path forward for them but my goodness has  week sorry uh yeah what are you looking
at I don't know all the history behind that yet behind this yet but of course Wall Street bets has some some epicness oh yeah looks like someone dropped 700k on Intel like right then and it has a "current return of minus 200,000 man I've" seen some wild lost porn over there well I've seen a lot worse than this but just like this is on topic that's all that's pretty rough though pretty rough um also on the subject of Intel's CPU wos uh in response to our video summarized in the
current situation with unexpected degradation on 13th and 14th gen CPUs on Tech quickie uh some commenters felt that the video included out-of-date explanations and unnecessarily placed blame on Intel's motherboard Partners um and our discussion question here is this is a perfect example of why we introduced our new bad faith comment policies across the Forum and YouTube comments um ironically Reddit seems to be kind of self- moderating at this point so we haven't made any changes
there um but wow wait good job rdit I know right but guys the number of people commenting on that video talking about how level one TX has covered this so much better and we're ignorant and whatever else wend from level one Tex literally collaborated on the video literally proofed the script so you can argue with the tech quickie video but if you are you're arguing with Wendell and you might be right and I mean his video might be better might not be better I don't know
or it might it might have it might cover it from a different angle totally um we've always said you should watch with breadth you should get opinions from different areas absolutely I love watching um but at the end of the day the view the video is getting like dislike bombed essentially um and it really does feel like we've reached just this Tipping Point of Ridiculousness where whatever we say is wrong because we said it and it has nothing to do with where we sourced the
information or how accurate it is um but we collaborated not just with Wendell from level one TCH but we also worked extensively with um Kel from Falcon Northwest who has been working on this in the background for much longer than you guys have been aware of it or other members of the tech media have been aware of it and has uh actually provided some really cool insights into how this whole thing has devolved to the point that it's reached now so um I don't know I guess good job outing
yourself as someone who didn't watch the whole video or who's just not really open to anything we say um conveniently um that makes it really easy for us to call the herd see you  oh I guess I never really I never really said what I was talking about so on the on the community posts feature of YouTube we put our kind of we formalized our sort of bad faith commenting policy and chewy actually asked me to give some examples of you know what exactly that means because a lot of people are
concerned that it means that you're not allowed to leave um any feedback that's critical of of us or our videos and that is absolutely not the case uh so what I'm going to do is I'm going to dig into the thread that I have with our Forum moderators where we kind of discussed this roll out with them and I'm going to dig up some of the examples of what this would be and I'm not going to like harp on people leaving mean comments or whatever this isn't going to be one of those but I want to give people some
reassurance that this this isn't like oh you can't say you disagree you absolutely can I mean that's how we learn that's how we get better that's absolutely valuable to us but we can't have people just making stuff up and then presenting it as fact and then allowing that misinformation to Fester within our own Community there's nothing we can do about what takes place elsewhere but we are absolutely not going to allow it in our own Community um so one example that I'll give now is
anyone who said that our PS portal video was sponsored that's it you're gone you're done you're out it wasn't it just wasn't you don't get to say something that isn't true on our platform you don't get to just make it up and then be mad about it it's not that's not a right that you have I'm afraid uh Luke do you want to do a topic real quick while I get signed into the forum because I'm not signed into the forum on this computer sure which probably makes sense because I
probably shouldn't be but now I will be but now you're signed into everything else bad anyways so it doesn't really matter  um researchers find and stop potential stalking vulnerabilities in dating apps Belgian researchers found that several popular dating apps including Bumble grinder and hinge all have had the same vulnerability sorry all had the same vulnerability that could have been used to find the near exact location of another user oh dude so much for the all positive W show this is like the worst
thing ever that's rough these problems have since been fixed however following researchers um following researchers reaching out to these companies oh so it was fixed afterwards I mean that's not too surprising uh the vulnerability required no hacking knowledge o instead a malicious person could use the proximity tracker in the app to triangulate another user's position simply by moving in small increments until they are no longer listed I guarantee you people did that that's like the most obvious thing in
the world oh yeah so they could just triangulate someone's position by just moving around make sure they're on the edge of your detection bubble and then go around and you find exact yeah that's that's apparently it was accurate to within about 2 m so they're not obfuscating the  yikes according to researchers this would be enough information to estimate users location within a few yards yeah uh the apps fixed these issues by making coordinates less precise uh though rounding up by through rounding up by
three decimal places okay um why do you need to know even like I don't even really get it like shouldn't you just be able to tell if they're in literally like this the city yeah that should be enough that should be enough Luke you're a developer wouldn't it just be easier to just go like oh here's their GPS location we'll just stick that in our thing instead of like extrapolating any data from that sure but like don't do that yeah but it was easy you're right it's just frustrating
oh okay the discussion questions are probably already I don't know why is it so hard for people making these tools to Fore all the potential and malicious uses because there isn't any funding behind doing that um and how often are we just reproducing the same mistakes without realizing it um constantly yeah  um ah I mean I don't expect them to come up with every malicious way that someone can use a tool right like you can't you can't predict all the awful ways that someone could name someone else with a
hammer and that doesn't mean that we shouldn't have hammers and that doesn't mean that we should blame the inventor of the hammer but this getting the location of people on dating apps seems like it probably should have been something they thought of maybe an option someone was like uh being that grinder is for hookups uh across town can be a deal breaker it's like okay well that should be an optin at the very least right like it it's either shouldn't be a thing at all and should
still just be like a city or whatever Tokyo is a city okay so a district I don't know something big like I I don't think this is uh super complicated um but it should be either a vague area some large area of some kind uh that you wouldn't be able to pinpoint someone within or if you like very explicitly said like make me findable like maybe you're at like a a a festival of some sort and you like want people to come up and say hi like sure why not but yeah Kristen said as a woman it's a
really scary thought yeah that makes sense I I I think it's extremely reasonable for that to be a very scary  all right um I'm going to get through this as quickly as we can just so that people have some examples of what we mean sure so here's a comment where someone accuses us of dragging our our an LT video out past the 10-minute Mark so that we can um so we can milk more ads out of it more YouTube ads out of it that's awesome so the issue here is that it's not even 10 minutes anymore um I
forget what the limit is because um we don't have mid roll ads on LTT so there's two problems um yeah you don't again so you don't get to make up a problem and then be mad about it um this kind of this kind of weird projection is another example of something that's just not going to pass anymore um so this is I think this was on might have been the building oh shoot I had meant to sensor usernames well whatever they've been in both so far Oh I thought it wasn't in the first one it
was whoops oh well they'll get over it um so this I think was on the building the CEO PC like the like that the the the co-host was like scared of me or something and I'm just I'm sitting here going what are you even what are you even talking about um let's see oh man yeah this one this one's a doozy so this is on the we tried 5G blocking paint video um this guy might have eat eaten the paint this Canadian company that makes this paint also sells a shield to put under your laptop because all laptop
computers emit EMF and continuous exposure has the potential to cause serious health problems such as sterility in men blah blah blah uh blah blah they also sell shielded hoodies ball caps Bush Hats boxers uh etc etc etc oddly the children's items are t-shirts no lotions or goggles either this is my last visit to LT yes you are judged by The Company You Keep were you like making fun of it yeah nice and so there's people that are worried that we're going to uh there's people that are worried that just like
jokes are going to get caught by this you know bad faith U policy I could understand that and I understand that but this isn't about that this is this is people who have such a have such a a sour position on us and our content that they weren't even willing to pause for a second and go this seems so ridiculous that maybe I'm the one who misunderstood the  um so that's that's it guys that that's all I have to say about that well I like used to be against against moderation um
and these days I'm I'm not because I think the internet has never been as  did did these comments have traction uh or did you just find them by reading every single comment on the it doesn't matter anymore um because what I've actually found is that I don't mean in as a resistance to doing the thing to be clear mostly just curiosity some of them some of them do most of them don't yeah okay and so because it's a very vocal small minority um it's it's actually hasn't been a ton of work to
clean things up a fair bit but we also just it's really funny because um I saw some people kind of criticizing us for the new policy and I saw some people who get it because they're like look the only reason you know about this is because they're telling you yeah once again lmg's transparency bites them in the butt because you wouldn't even be having this conversation because you'd be Shadow band um if they didn't tell you in advance so it's been on a very small scale up until now but we're
announcing it formally so people understand if you're going to comment that we missed something in a video you better make bloody well sure that you watched the video don't comment that we missed an important point if you watched the first 30 seconds and I'm not saying you have to watch the whole video you don't but don't come in guns blazing that's  ask all right let's go what do you want to talk about next Dan what are we supposed to  about um oh YouTube continuing the ad blocker arms
race users of various ad blockers have reported seeing blank black screens on YouTube videos which linger for 5 to 20 seconds before the video plays it is speculated that these are ads that have been partially blocked and a possible sign of the serers side ad injection technology that YouTube is reportedly working on our discussion question here actually let's get to the discussion question in a minute here's what I want to know why exactly would you see a black screen if the video if the ad is
embedded within the video stream itself How could an ad blocker block it but not block it do you have any kind of deeper understanding of how that would happen not really to be honest T Lewis in chat in flo plane chat says yeah I got I got the black screen refreshing the page works but it's weird it makes it go away as in you don't get the black screen anymore and the video just I'm not sure what they mean by refreshing  works uh kig says I had those happened a while ago but they
stopped I I have so there's some comments coming in on the comment moderation thing and I just instead of typing this out because technically it's an assumption I'll just ask you live um I think people are overestimating how often these actions will be taken how often do you think these actions are taken um I would say on a given video probably 5 to 10 people are going to end up with a ban how many comments are on a given  thousands over time I expect the numbers to go way down pretty rapidly there's
there's I can't we talked about on W show it was some study that like um Bad actors in in things like uh forums and and things like that it's it's a very very small number of individuals that cause a very huge portion of the disruption yep so hopefully it won't be very much yeah pretty much I found when when moderating communities that like you deal with some edge cases and then generally it's mostly fine um the smaller the community the easier it is so there's definitely
going to be some challenges but yes um I'm I'm not I'm not too worried about it uh okay what was the main topic we were on I derailed us too much um users have reported seeing blank black screens on YouTube videos I don't know how that would work how could YouTube manage to serve a a long black video sequence but not the ad yeah yeah that's odd block blocking it or not like it to my previous interpretation of it was kind of like a yes or no type of situation um so yeah I'm not really sure
I'm not sure how that works I wonder if if YouTube has like a fail state where if it doesn't have a certain amount of data it just pushes through this like yeah black video I have no idea interesting not sure we've got a video coming as part of degoogle your life part two we'll be talking about ad blocking uh we'll be talking about uh in particular on YouTube because I think for our audience YouTube is going to be one of the biggest challenges for deg Googling their life um in the first in
the first episode I think we got into uh like web browser uh DNS and the second one we go man we go deep uh so password managers um trying to think what else is in it yeah so for those of you waiting gole your life part two is shot now and Emily has been working her way through the guidance for it this week uh should be coming in fact it may even be on the schedule now I think it's at a stage of completion that it may be scheduled let me have a quick look here oh speaking of things that are scheduled
though scrapyard Wars part two is up on float plane yeah uh no it's not scheduled yet um the reviews are in people are flipping loving it I'm so excited I'm so glad we waited a week and let them let them cook uh it's got a whatever this works out to 50 to one like dislike ratio or something like that people are absolutely loving it ah best format on the internet let's go uh so we're going to have uh this will be up on YouTube on Tuesday and we're going to be trying to do early access for
scrapyard Wars throughout the series over on float plane.com so that's lm. g/ floatplane if you want to sign up and get more scrapyard Wars you haven't watched it yet no where the title so the title is It's not cheating it's strategy read the title yeah so uh what what it wasn't my team that said that that's all I have to say well it might have been my team yeah yeah there's only two teams yeah there's two teams yeah might have been my team yeah  okay do I spoil anything should I spoil anything no
okay don't spoil anything okay I'm you know what I'm not gonna I'm not going to spoil anything I'm not going to spoil anything also you don't want to talk about it too much cuz we might do a like commentary reaction streaming thing that's true yeah what I know what I know for sure is that you already know about anything that I did in fact you knew at the time so it couldn't be that bad so it's just strategy and if you don't like it I mean there's always the option of getting
good yeah okay okay okay yeah this isn't the finale so it doesn't even tell you anything that might or might not happen in the in the days cuz I think this only goes up to partway through day two of the challenge so there's there's lots more scrapyard Wars to go I think they they were pushing initially for three episodes and after David and I looked at everything that happened we were like no this is four no it it took place over only 3 days dude in the last like I didn't we
nope yeah there's I can't talk about it it's so frustrating I know I know it was cuz I was just going to mention something that happened in content that isn't even available anywhere yet flow plane so it's like okay yeah I need to not do that it would have been pretty vague but still it's just not worth it I'll tell you what I'll tell you guys one thing you guys already saw Elijah's haircut in episode one um there was a float plane challenge where they asked "for um 3,000 likes 3,000 likes on a" float plane
exclusive yeah and if that happened Luke would work on Elijah's body hair again yeah they did it today so if if you're on float plane you can look forward to that exclusive um Luke gave Elijah a slit an eyebrow slit yeah it's just quite a way to say it yeah he gave him an eyebrow slit yeah um Luke okay they didn't give me the right tools you did a great job they didn't give me the right tools All Things Considered like the fact that you are a monkey I was not to working on hair why does this keep
in the last like two months I've done three things with other people's hair I don't think I've ever done anything with anyone else's hair ever before that time yeah we know what is happening we know why does this keep happening you know if that video gets "like 4,000 likes he might let me do" carving oh no and I could put a star onto his head oh no I he has not committed to this I'm just saying he might oh man okay he might be willing any and maybe this time I'll get the the proper equipment this is great 
sweetie oh no okay uh Dan what are what are we doing D derky also said do you really want his wife to divorce him uh she's still with him at this point I think they're probably good yeah if if she if she hasn't seen anything yet like with his Bell Deli merch at this point then uh wait what was I saying if she if if she hasn't seen anything to scare her off yet I don't think it's going to happen now yeah like some minor haircut changes one other small scrapyard Wars announcement our season partner Jawa has

wait oh it's still going the Box breaks wait no I don't think it is still going it look like oh it's just flashing and my brain was like no that was it that's all it can do optical illusion um we need to fix this oh it lagged out on my end don't worry  oh man I want to play my back ano's good oh my back I'm dying okay okay what the hell is going on oh yeah uh the the the merch messages yeah what even is the show today my job  know I am not doing good uh let's see hey lldd I wanted to ask lonus how do
you find fulfillment and satisfaction in life and your career working in such a quick moving and competitive industry how can you be happy with enough well then you should ask me that wow they wanted to ask me but I I they didn't so now I I'm sorry that's another pet peeve don't really feel hey can I can I ask you a question you just  consent um anyway working in such a quick moving competitive industry um you know what I think that I think that over the years I have come around to that
infinite growth is neither uh possible nor is It ultimately fulfilling anyway and um I think that over time I've actually developed a much healthier relationship with business growth than I think I had before um it was probably around the time that we rejected the offer to buy the company that I kind of looked at it and went well if the goal was to win capitalism then that was it that was that was my shot that was definitely it yeah that was the chance right so one capitalism not that you
haven't really already but so I had to kind of I had to kind of decide right and what I ultimately fell back on was the same thing that um that I realized when I did the 10 million subscribers stream and decided that the only way to be happy continuing doing this is if I was doing it because I wanted to do it and so that's why I'm doing it um I don't I don't really I don't really see a path to that changing I mean there's absolutely things that are frustrating there's absolutely things
that I I mean I I messaged Luke the other day did I send you a screenshot where I like circled uh where I cired a bunch of videos that were performing well maybe maybe I didn't actually send this to you I think so but I took a I took a screenshot earlier this week where I circled the videos that were performing well over the last 60 seconds I know we talked about this I don't know if it you actually technically sent me a screenshot but you would have screen shared or something we we definitely
talked about it yeah no here it is this is not the circled version this is the unaltered version but I I looked at a like a last 60 Minutes um real time View and um one of them was our most recent release number two was our second most recent release number three was our third most recent release number four was the WAN show from that week so far so good then it goes completely off the rails number five was a YouTube short from January number six was the WAN show from computex of the previous year
number scrapyard Wars number eight is building a PC in a random Tech Mall both of which kind of make sense those those have staying power then there's a another ancient short Dan's Cable Management one which was also recent then there's an old short then there's a new short then there's a live stream I pray this computer sucks because I'm going to sell it for a dollar a live stream VOD from that's old over a year ago then two more ancient W shows ancient W shows have some like
really weird how can there ever be what did it work out to four streams no no yeah no five stream vods four of which are W shows that are the most viewed videos in a given hour it's like the most Evergreen stuff is the stuff that should be the least Evergreen yeah it it's actually genuinely completely backwards and the reason I'm talking about this right now is you know you ask this fast pacing fast-paced you know frustrating competitive industry it's like yeah because a lot of the time the signals
that we get for what to keep doing they don't make any sense they're not actionable you know YouTube will tell us they tell us make good videos and we're like okay and then we'll make something that gets a 99% like dislike ratio and and has higher than average clickthrough and for views it'll perform like garbage and you're like okay well okay maybe there is just no audience for this but it kind of seems a lot to me like you just like didn't put this in front of anybody because the
clickthrough is good and the retention is good and the like dislike ratio is good and the comments are good every signal I have says it's good but then I'm getting a bunch of views on an old live full 4our live stream one that has like no current relevance at all nothing like the the the year plus old W show it was crazy for me when I would leave autoplay on on YouTube and it would start playing an old W show VOD I've shown this to a bunch of people actually have I talked this about this on Wow
before all the broken old wow vods yeah I've talk to you about this right so old wano vods most of them are actually functionally broken no I don't know about most but definitely some are I I mean the last time I tried to do this I looked up I think wow 2014 and just clicked on the first one that came up and it was broken yes that's super random chance but if it's old enough it I think can we talk for a moment about just how broken searches on YouTube right now sorry this is an impromptu
topic here but I have not been able to find anything at all on YouTube something that was frustrating for for me even is we we just talked about uh Pumphrey leaving donut yeah and I tried to look up his channel yeah maybe it'll come up now no it's just like I show speed stuff okay that's not even the bigger issue to me here it is hold on hold on hold on no that's really good that's really good but hold on hold on here's my bigger issue I'm searching for lus w show Paul because I know when we
had Paul on as a guest that one's corrupted so I wanted to show you guys okay finds a channel fair enough okay this channel is Live uh I love that you guys took the thumbnail today while I was just in doing my pre when show vegging on my phone um anywh who okay some Community posts what does that have to do with Paul or wo absolutely I'm sure would have put his name in the in the title back then okay here's a w show from a week ago here is a flipping ad sponsor that oh you know what you know what no no hold
on hold on okay on this account I probably haven't but on my account I have dismissed This Global coin Network like plus I've dismissed this so many times I've been like uh-uh no no no no no no no uh okay okay wait why do you don't you have YouTube premium on your personal account uh no my work account oh yep uh okay okay keep going okay here it is here it is guest Paul Paul wow lonus so we had to go this far to find the only thing that matches this okay we get the channel this is fine oh my God
another ad we get another Paul W show something another thing fine that one's fine okay but here's my problem depending on what you look for you might get two or three results then you get people also what people also I'm not I am looking for something right now I am not looking for people also watch Lego car racing whatever like yeah there's W shows in here but these are not the ones I'm looking for they have nothing to do with my search query and then it gets worse there's
like just random for you and then this one drives me crazy previously watched this one often shows up this one often I wonder if that's a shows up like as the as the probably the third header and there'll be a bunch of them and I'm like ah previously watched okay fine fair enough right because as it happens I am looking for a video I've previously watched but don't just pick a random video I previously watched pick one that has something to do with my search query yeah yeah yeah yeah anyway the point of
this was that I wanted to show you guys uh what a corrupted old L show looks like yeah it's a it's a bit of a trip oh hey look it's hacksmith hacksmith I wonder if eight sleep um paid him for this I hope so why do you say that um I we've run into some issues recently with former sponsors using our likeness I don't know that eight sleep was one of them um but we have run into some issues is this one not broken oh wow it's either this is the Chris Prill one this isn't oh shoot
I clicked the wrong did I click the wrong thing oh yeah I did I totally clicked wrong okay here we go I'm pretty sure this one's broken remember razor comms heck yeah oh no this I remember when someone disconnected from Razer commoms and it kept playing the audio even though they weren't even connected to the service anymore that was crazy we had to get in contact with them and tell them because you could like hear them talking to people in the background it was not good
dude are the old land shows fixed cuz I think we did I think we did flag this to YouTube at some point so it's possible that they've gone in and they've actually fixed this problem that would be pretty cool I did show a YouTube person at open sace so oh  happened all right well Luke's going to try and look for one of those in the meantime I am going to find merch messages right aren't we oh is that what we're supposed to be doing boom boom that was quick boom Get Wrecked lus wow
that's what they look like you look good what happened to you you used to be so transparent and uh glowing you had a youthful glow you uh not so much yeah no I you quite genuinely look like you're covered in mud yeah I was actually kind of thinking like Undead oh yeah yeah yeah yeah I think I've got a bit of an undead Vibe over here Y what messes me up is people these days go to like massive lengths to get this effect oh really yeah it's actually really cool what you can do when you uh like data MH stuff
like this this would be so hard to do on purpose yeah and have it look this good like this is sick like music video level that's amazing uh all right cool yeah and like there's there's tons of these old Way shows and they recommend these all the time and there's even like every once in a while you look in the comments yeah okay I look in the comments right now and this is from 2 years ago but still top tier YouTube recommendation this W show is from 10 years ago why is there a bunch of comments with upvotes
and replies from two years ago every once in a while I'll see like I'll I'll see bumps on videos that's why I like to look at that uh 60-minute view yeah because it will if I see the most Oddball stuff that's where I see the weirdest stuff sometimes it makes sense like the build with my sister spiked after I talked about my sister passing away it different sister different sister but people were searching for Lina's sister apparently um and then oh this is this is a weird one whatever
like AI fueled site this is had an article about my sister passing away um that I found today because I'm going to an event where I needed to submit a picture for a badge sure and as a joke I wanted to put that weird um uh like what what am I I'm like a I'm like a like a a uh oh man I'm going to I'm going to have to see if I can I'm going to have to see if I can find it it's like the the Linus the anime Linus yeah this one oh okay yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so I was like I I bet they wouldn't mind if
I put that on a badge at an event so sure so I was looking for the full quality the full quality of this and as I was scrolling just scrolling scrolling scrolling I came across a link to this article like their SEO is strong enough that I was searching for lonus cartoon girl or something I forget what it was and and I came across an article about my sister's passing and so I um it had a picture of my younger sister but then in the AI presumably AI generated article it talked about how it was my older sister
who was not a public figure and never appeared on camera oh so like had the yeah yeah so like I left a comment on the I left a comment on the article I'm like I think it's pretty misleading have a picture of the wrong sister on this I don't think anyone's ever going to come across this article I don't think anybody's going to moderate these comments but like wow that machine moves so fast dude I couldn't even believe it anyway I'm super excited to have that picture on my
uh on my event badge They didn't accept it the first time I sent it and I was like oh yeah okay that kind of makes sense but their reason for not accepting it was that the file size wasn't big enough so I was like okay uh ultimately what I ended up doing is just changing it to a bit map and sending it again I was like okay this is over a Meg is this good enough they're like yep cool cuz I had just snipped it and sent it as just like a PNG I it's printing on a badge who cares it's going to be like this big M
anyway I love arbitrary arbitrary rules for things I love breaking them I still have that art as my desktop background with the three of us every once in a while it like almost jump scares me cuz it's my desktop background at work so normally all the screens are covered yeah okay and then every once a while I like move something I'm like oh yeah oh yeah that not weird um okay Dan hit me hi sen and NAD have you considered using water level sensors in your reservoirs for your water Loops 
H I have also considered uh I actually just remembered this I've talked to Jake about it but um I've also considered taking the taking the the toilet water level float that we have in the one in the server room out because if I had had one of those and had a leak it would have kept dumping water into it so uh we we have like a whole room water cooling system here at the office as well that helps cool our server room um and in order to make sure that we never have to top it up it's got like a toilet float
in it and it's hooked up to Plumbing um yeah so we should not do that I'd rather lose a pump than man it's so cool just like randomly finding things out about this company yeah I know right is this the first time you heard of it stop hearing things oh yeah I never heard of that before yeah cool yeah that's wild I mean it probably won't leak that's plumbed up to those um but man would it be sick if it did it's plumbed up to those those APC show up to work on Monday it's just like oh man it's weird
that there's like water coming out of the front of the building wonder what's causing that yeah dog I don't know man you guys wouldn't like it as much if we did everything properly I do agree with that actually like wholeheartedly you got to kind of cowboy things every once in a while yeah it's it's it's more fun I got a lot of good theories by the way from the community on what's going on with the corrosion that I was getting in my loop I saw there was some pretty cool comments on that there's some stuff
that's not right um I saw someone asking in chat on asks what about the fuel hoses are they using steel mesh reinforcement no saw that one it's it's it's not metal whatever it is it's some kind of string of some sort and I believe we actually sourced that tubing from a water cooling supplier even though it is fuel line hose clearly they validated it at some point I think I think it was a a good comment though cuz like it was something to check yes good idea something to
there was a lot of good comments where it was like okay that's actually pretty quick and easy to to verify um but probably isn't the case but we could look the one that seems the most likely is that there's a grounding issue and some kind of current is Flowing which would mean that it's not galvanic corrosion but it would be electrolytic corrosion so if there's two devices that are not that are improperly grounded through the loop they could be there could be some kind of current flow
that makes would that make the hey there's corrosion clearly on the inlet here but not the outlet of the same thing would that make that make sense if one of the end was it it would be the nearest thing possibly interesting um this is way out of my realm of understanding but it sounds cool yeah that that's the one that makes the most sense to me and uh is also the easiest to execute I mean in the longer term what I really want is for all the systems to be air cooled anyway and just
have to have a water door um so I maybe the better thing for us to do is just move to the next phase anyway because sooner than you had intended yeah yeah it was always it was always meant to be a stepping stone to doing something bigger and more better so maybe we should just do that I really like those types of systems the the next  yeah you should just you just fully immerse everything no they already tried to do that and it  well you know what you guys just do the show you turn to the wash that was
pretty good sorry that was pretty good thank you for the set up oh man that was  crying oh man okay um this is really short no that was covered as a topic he didn't minimize he's supposed to minimize it no nobody's been minimizing them oh no um I'll save that one for when he's back how about one for you Luke this might be interesting for you to Target I work in Canadian broadcast media how can I convince the higher-ups that avoiding YouTube twitch or other streaming sites is unhealthy for the
industry's future I'm bashing my head to get them to try it oh that's a good question and probably a very tough situation that you're in um I've tried to talk to those type of people before what where am I here I've tried to talk to those type of people before and they can be quite stiff on  um can you say the exact job again do you still have it yep yeah um Canadian broadcast media Canadian broadcast media yeah I mean I could I could I don't know exactly where you're at within that um
if it's something like news I would point to examples of news organizations in the States going on YouTube and finding very extreme success um I would talk about how like the the Youth of today isn't necessarily listening to radio because you could be talking about broadcast in in the radio sense um or watching traditional TV channels as much anymore so if you want to hit the Youth of Canada because they're probably more interested in Canadian specific viewership considering it's Canadian
broadcasting you got to go where the people are um which are a lot of these web platforms also some of these web platforms have um like I don't remember what the section's called but often if if there does happen to be something interesting happening in in Canadian news or Canadian politics or something and I go on YouTube YouTube will put those types of things in my in my feed there's a little section of like happening near you or something like that I don't remember exactly what it's called when I
looked in the account here there there isn't one but it's the account for the show so it probably doesn't really have a location or maybe it's located for America or something like that but yeah I mean I would I would point at other examples other success stories of other comparable media that are doing the same thing um I would Express the ability to hit a wider audience within Canada um and and hopefully find some way to prove that it's not really that hard to do because I don't think it would be it's
not like it's going to cost extra money right no it's just another like upload step and uploading to web is honestly pretty simple these days so I absolutely think you should do it yeah I think that sounds reasonable yeah Ma the genius said it's not CBC or Radio Canada because they already have YouTube yeah I knew that um I'm not 100% sure what they're talking about that's why I was that's why I was they said Canadian broadcast media not necessarily the Canadian broadcast Corporation yeah
it's just it's pretty broad we have quite a few mhm um what are the what would be the CBC would that be called like the flag carrying like I know you have flag air the flagbearer corporation flag bearer media thing I don't know do they have I think the CBC also has a YouTube channel um probably yeah CBC new wait CBC the national CBC News YouTube channel they uploaded 18 hours ago  it the national massive BC Landslide prompts flood fears people are watching live is this literally just the news the
TV show but it's on YouTube huh I knew TV shows put up clips and stuff I didn't think they just put up like an actual like this is the TV show but it's on YouTube makes sense I mean you can rent movies on YouTube yeah I just I haven't personally seen this before this is just cbc's the national but it's just live streamed oh okay this is a live stream right now oh weird it's son a VOD what is uh what is that called uh play out you know that term Luke yeah it's it's just just play out but one of
the channels is YouTube totally I'm just surprised that's all because I don't I don't think I've seen this before God I haven't thought about play out in years now I do not miss broadcast media topic now that you're back hexos update sure trass has launched its powered by tras initiative where it will partner with various companies to create tailored storage solutions for specific use cases and industries its first partner in this initiative is ashte the creators of hexos which is intended to make setting
up a Home Server simple and accessible for users without it admin skills ashtech has ALS or just people that don't want to deal with it um ashtech has also launched a Blog with their first article explaining how hexos works very basically hexos is built on top of trass and provides a simplified UI and guidance for setting up a home server that server can be set up using off-the-shelf server Hardware custom Ware or even recycled PCS Robbie from nas Compares is collecting questions for
an upcoming Q&amp;A with John pazo of e which should probably film and launch sometime next week current plan is August the 9th and LT viewers can post questions for Robbie uh here and then I guess we'll link this oh no it's a YouTube Community post yeah that makes it easier they can find it on their own um the hexos beta is expected to launch in the third quarter this year and anyone interested can sign up for updates on their website do they have a pricing model yet they have some
proposals um so just so bringing you guys up to speed this is the the nas operating system that um is being has been founded by a couple of former unraid employees who um came to me and we're basically like okay here's what we want to do I was like oh so muted muted muted uh getting you guys up to speed uh hexos is the brainchild of a couple of former unraid employees who came to me after their split and basically we like okay here's what we want to do and I was like oh okay so all the stuff that I've
been asking you guys to do for years um but like you're going to do it this time and they're like yes and I was like all right and they were like but we need money and I was like okay so I am invested in hexo um and I I really hope it works but if it doesn't well hey it was the friends we made along the way yeah uh I I really do hope so I I do believe that even though traz Wizards uh will often be a little gatekeeper about tunaz and say well if you don't like tunaz then get
good at tunaz um but I I do think that traz is incredibly powerful um It's amazing And it no is not easy for people to use I actually sent I sent John an email today that's that's John from from uh htech I sent him an email today I was like I found a customer in the wild um it doesn't happen that often because not that many people post you know very specifically that they're looking for hexos but um I found one on our Forum here it is hi guys I'm an idiot that they can't help but Break Stuff on my Nas I'm
running true Nas I recently switched over to this Dro tried to set up Plex it's broken um yep basically oh wow you replied already too uh yeah basically a prime prime candidate cuz man when you screw up traz if you don't really know what you're doing you're better off just reformatting yeah and a lot of people probably do y and just don't talk about it I'm really excited about it but just being transparent with everyone I'm always slightly skeptical skeptical until I see how you how you making that money
you know yeah I think I am the weirdest early investor yeah here's small pile of money please leave me alone see you later yeah they offered me a board seat I was like oh God no yeah get me out of here I don't want that please just do good job yeah just try to not suck yeah yeah do your best I mostly just want the product yeah yeah exactly I just want it I just want it to be easy I don't at the end of the day I don't want to go home and deal with like some never stupid like Arcane permissions issue uh did I
ever tell you that that's the issue I was having with Plex it was something to do with one of my VMS which is actually hosted on another machine altogether one of my VMS um when it copied data onto the nas which was on a different machine um the data wouldn't copy with the same permissions so my Plex like Docker or app or whatever it is I don't think it's Docker but my Plex app wouldn't have read permissions to that file even though it had read permissions to that directory and
like I I had the hht guys just fix it for me cuz I was like I don't want to do this um it would have taken me hours to go in and command line figure it out wait you had them fix it for you yeah  trz wow well I mean John's also a bro so like did you up did you reup your investment no no no no whatever no John would have John would have done it for me anyway I'm serious he's he's awesome sounds like you're abusing this relationship I'm not abusing anything I'm not abusing anything tra to board
seat for tech support yeah exactly oh that's fine that might be fair enough yeah exactly all right exactly I'm pretty I am pretty low maintenance I just don't want you to misuse JN I I'm fighting for JN here I am I am not and if I am misusing it it's coming at the cost to his family not to the cost of the product cuz he did it on the weekend it's uh it's Market exploration you know and they did actually learn useful things yeah did did John send up did did did John did John send a proper invoice no I don't
need an invoice from him they learned they actually did learn things because it was a really weird Edge case you know how I'm the master of edge cases MH edging you know I was trying to I was thinking it too I'm going to get him I'm going to get course I was one of these  him oh boy all right what do you all want but yes I do I do know that given our our uh the current state of our password manager um did you even read my report what are we going to do what do we do I did but I don't know
I I think that we should just have Flo plane just write internal tools we're thinking about doing it for that that other one I don't want to talk about this but you know what I mean yeah like we literally just might I think I think I can't think of something better I think there should be like a genuine discussion about just 100% custom because our Edge case is here lonus is the master and all of his employees are too of of finding just these really weird use cases for like
every tool available the one thing that I'm talking about I genuinely think we are going to have to make our own cuz they're like they all suck everything sucks yeah it's crazy this I'm we're not talking about the password manager to be I know I know John from ashte actually emailed me a couple hours ago um we were discussing uh pricing um oh cool I'm just going to tell you guys I'm going to I'm going to publicly put pressure on him I'm going to tell you guys that I I'm leaning on them to have a Perpetual
license option oh dude if they have a Perpetual license option I will almost certainly be like a first minute buyer it won't be cheap but they will have a perpet but if I get my way they'll have a Perpetual option for like the like the best tier I want to make sure they're compensated properly I don't mind spending some money on this product it sounds like a if it fulfills the things that they say it's going to fulfill it sounds it's going to be a fantastic product it may not be possible I don't
want another subscription some of what they're doing like especially okay if they offered cloud backup or something oh well there's not going to be AET or maybe it's an Adder for that or whatever whatever the point is some stuff may not be possible with a onetime fee yeah you can't you can't do service things but what I am what I am pushing for is that the the the highest tier of ownership of the product should be available as a Perpetual license even if they are going like everyone does towards a
subscription model for most people unless it includes things like offsite Beck you have to that has to be a subscription anyway so we were going back and forth about this and um one of this is just the last line of his email which I think is great he goes great input as always looking forward to seeing you on W show tonight and how much do I need to give you to dye your  [Laughter] dot oh man anyway zorg 666 in chat said I'd pay like $400 for a Perpetual license to that interesting good market research
sample size of one but good market research person said 300 to 400 kind of why I like VX interesting it's perpetual yeah not cheap right but it's reasonably cheap for what it is but it's you get two years of updates right that's one way that I've seen companies gate it  yeah I mean I'd be I'd be pretty happy with that I think they're I think they're being pretty that seems pretty reasonable to I being pretty reasonable like I'm probably going to want the the but especially with the
upper one on there like yeah dude yeah so I'm pretty I'm pretty excited I um it's been really hard to have a solid recommendation when creators come to us and they're like yeah we need to solve our story we have everything everything's on external hard drives and I'm like you're recommending that they need to ask you questions forever yeah which is like H I don't want to recommend getting good yeah cuz they don't why they got other things to do they do other stuff they're trying to
grow their channels they're trying to do whatever they don't want to learn this freaking thing but I also don't want them to be stuck with the limitations of something like a sonology NZ right like "why are we paying $1,000 for a freaking" adom okay they're not adom anymore but that but basically on that on that level you know it's frustrating like from my point especially if you live somewhere where power is relatively affordable your NZ should basically just be your old
computer or your two computers old ago like it there's no reason to be using super powerful Hardware unless you know you need it yeah now they're using cerons apparently I love how many times Intel has killed Celeron dude Pentium too not Pentium 2 Pentium as well the number of times they've killed Pentium and then just been like oh right except for the pentiums we still have don't worry about it I mean it might be actually dead now  mean uncomfortable laughter yeah is Mark
Zuckerberg a drug dealer no background on this back in March the Wall Street Journal reported that meta was under federal investigation in the United States for running ads on behalf of upand cominging young entrepreneurs AKA illicit drug deal in July the Wall Street Jour Journal Journal has reviewed meta ad platform and found they are still serving dozens of ads steering users toward online marketplaces for illegal drugs leveling up nice further a review of meta's AD Library between March and June by
industry Watchdog the tech transparency project found over 450 similar ads many were quite open about their products showing photos of prescription drug bottles piles of pills or even bricks of cocaine at least one showed a Razer Blade and yellow powder spelling out DMT wow the use of photos is most likely to avoid text based machine moderation which meta has increasingly relied upon following significant layoffs to its human moderation teams our discussion question here is does meta not deal with this
because they don't want to or because they can't and I think we all know the answer to that I'm sure they could if they wanted to they're perfectly profit but it's better for shareholders if they just use  cool nice speaking of AI fan Letters by Google AI causing anger an ad for Google Gemini has sparked an unexpected amount of passion because it depicts a loving father asking an AI to create a draft letter for his daughter to send to an  I hate that so much while some have
criticized the ad for promoting laziness and inauthenticity others have argued that this is a relatively defensible use case where the AI creates a draft that is then personalized so the look on your face is so great it's just so disappointing cuz that's s like if you think about that type of person like this Olympic Athlete receiving a letter from someone's daughter who's you know watching them do something great and then potentially inspiring them to to take very life-altering choices to do something
really cool with their life and if you think about the letter that they would like to receive it's probably kind of junky kid writing with spelling mistakes and maybe a little drawing at the bottom or whatever it's not it's not chat GPT output garbage it's like this is this is totally this is a terrible use case uh others have argued this relatively defensible use case um if you're like super lame maybe uh like I don't know like uh yeah using AI as a like an intro inspiration for
something that you end up doing in a unique way sure and this is like the lamest version of that tell me this would you be mad if they used an AI to translate it say this letter was to an athlete who spoke a different language I'm not saying they are I'm just say both okay like sure for your convenience I have included an AI translation of my daughter's letter I'm just trying to think if there's any kind of if there's any way I can break down this wall here that I think seems completely fine though mhm
like just here you go now you don't have to like Google translate take a photo of it you can just what if the workflow went like this the daughter tells the dad uh What She Likes about the athlete the dad pumps it into a a large language model it's kind of spit something out he kind of reads it to her and then she she without copying it word for word kind of like you know writes it down or something yeah like it like is is there if you add another layer of human translation to the the help from the AI
drafting the letter does that help in your mind or like what like what if it's not obvious the authentic junky words of some kid cuz that's what's happening and that's cool a good thing it doesn't need altering in it's in its own right in my opinion that is perfection the flaws that are included with the bad writing with the spelling mistakes with the improper sentences all that kind of stuff that is the Perfection of this particular item I think only ways that it should be altered is to
improve potential issues with like you said translation because it's the Olympics it's all these different countries there's very likely language barriers which is fine I'm not arguing with you I'm just I I I wanted to try to I wanted to try to poke holes in it you know yeah like see if there's see if there's an doing I'm it's fine I just I just this is such just it's such an annoying because like I think I think one of the biggest people's biggest frustrations with the
AI stuff going on right now is instead of uh automating and removing uh annoying frustrating just just work like repetitive work it's not cleaning my dishes yet it's not doing my laundry yet it's not doing those types of things it's making art it's writing it's doing the things that humans like like to do generally which is annoying and then you're applying that all of that frustration of everything that's been happening replacing artists and musicians and writers instead of doing
my laundry you're taking that whole concept and you boiling it down to like this this pure form of of Adoration of a child being impressed by someone at the peak of humanity um and you're going like let's replace that with Sam alman's wet dream and it's just it's  annoyed hii in float plane chat has been asking like every 10 minutes how do I like my new framework I am currently undergoing the Qualcomm Snapdragon challenge that video is coming out soon but I am not using a framework laptop
right now uh investment disclosure I uh  and okay you know what I'm not going to  okay ah anyway oh that wasn't the point   demo give it a sec I think that Luke doesn't like laundry I mean no I I think any form of like you have to do it every day or or not every day but you have to do it very often task and there's no there's no like I'm sure someone does but I seriously doubt many people glean genuine enjoyment from just like doing the laundry okay here's my demo so just 
um okay so how long has it been doing stuff so I have 67% battery life right now in the past it would always just be zero because it would just like turn on in my backpack and it oh my current laptop is like that yeah I had a I had a one-on-one with someone that lasted for an hour all I had open was Google Docs and I just typed into it didn't load videos or anything like that and it was near dead by the time I was done my laptop's getting a little old dude I had OBS running for screen recording and uh
or no sorry um no no sorry I had uh teams I had a video meeting going in teams and I got a notification that my battery life was critical and it had entered power saving mode or whatever and like I don't know how long later but basically I just kept going in my video meeting and then I just hung around and did some more work and I looked at it and I still had like 9% battery left like oh yeah that's pretty sick amazing like on on any machine that I ever had before that being in a video call would
have just crushed oh yeah what remaining I I'd have been like hey I got to go pretty soon I got a critical battery Waring no I'm I'm I'm loving it uh yeah  lot sorry who does laundry once a month pop gear float plane chat you've been outed you need to do your laundry more often that's a lot of 30 at at a at a minimum 30 pairs of socks 30 pieces of underwear I just throw them out and get new ones from M te store that's what you should do too just wear them once and then buy more of
them I would never actually lonus would be very against that yes I would bu against that you would that's what I do with my water bottles oh it's dirty just just go take another one Kat said have you seen technology connections dishwasher video and yeah and and I know a lot of people liked that but I can understand someone wanting to do something well or be informed on how to do something that they have to do all the time I don't think that means that they enjoy it I don't think I don't yeah are we
talking about the one where he said we're all doing the soap wrong yeah I think so I think I watched that one yeah yeah these great videos yeah they're all good but that doesn't mean that I want to use my dishwasher anymore than I have to yeah but you want to use it right right yeah you're going to which that's those those are different things I want a dishwasher so badly would help me do the dishes more Mr memester says Bernie formerly from Rooster Teeth said his success was
measured by being able to wear a different pair of socks every day of the year and never washing them I I don't I don't consider that success I just why is that a good thing I just consider that waste imagine you get to the end of the year and then you have to watch 365 or more pairs of socks it's like cool I don't what what did you bet the socks are so small they just go with everything else you don't like washing the socks has never been an additional burden but you'd never do a  
god oh man too bad he wasn't taking a drink yeah you probably would have got me with that one oh you heard it here first folks it doesn't fit in a  why uh topic I'm looking for one right now ratings.com has published the results of an accelerated longevity test "where they ran 100 TVs for over 10,000" hours this is roughly equivalent to typical use for an American family over the course of 6 years it should be noted that that's not quite true running something continuously is not
necessarily the same as having multiple power on and power off Cycles over a more extended period of time but if anything it should be an advantage for the TVs that they were run continuously instead of being cycled because thermal Cycles can be quite quite hard on electronics one consistent result from their testing was that thin edgelit TVs were the most prone to failure and had significantly worse longevity than other LCD TVs this is a quote ulate TVs are inherently prone to durability issues
including warped reflector sheets cracked light guide plates and burnt out LEDs due to concentrated heat uh I'm not going to give you guys too many more details on this because my point is not for you guys to uh not go watch their video my point instead is for you guys to go watch their video because this was one of the most interesting investigations that I've seen into consumer technology in quite some time I think they did an outstanding job of it and once you are aware of it you're
going to see the issues that they identified everywhere in your daily life uh the site is ratings.com which for some stupid reason is spelled RT N gs.com I guess they didn't have um what what $1.8 million to spend on a decent domain which I mean at that point time I understand it fair enough and respect it that's that's a joke from earlier on the show if someone from ratings is watching calm down um man this looks some of the okay no actually you got to go I won't you got
to go watch the video but some of the I'm only seconds in some of the footage from this is wild you should go watch it yeah go check that out uh basically if you want to have better longevity though if you insist on not watching it uh the tldr is if you want a better a longer lasting TV you should go for something with full array local Demming instead of being edgit and um and and they also talk about how there isn't really much of a cost advantage to Edge lighting my
understanding is it used to be that that was quite a bit cheaper but these days it's not it's more about making the display thinner so those thinner EDG lit displays have issues um with longevity very cool this is some more good news well okay that wasn't really good news but this is good news online marketplaces according to a US court or the US consumer product safety commission um online marketplaces are resp responsible for Dangerous products listed by Third parties this is awesome
yes finally someone saying hey hello wait maybe well we'll get to it if if you're selling it under your site under your name you have to deal with it like you can't just be like oh I don't know someone else put it there so the US consumer product safety commission has decided that Amazon has a duty to issue a recall for "400,000 potentially dangerous products" sold by thirdparty vendors on its platform between 2018 and 20121 including highly flammable children's pajamas faulty carbon monoxide detectors
and unsafe hair dryers that could cause electrocution while Amazon did message these customers the cpsc says it did not use the word recall and downplayed the severity of the risk saying that the products may fail to meet Federal standards and could potentially pose a risk Amazon says its actions were sufficient and it will appeal the ruling but I want to see this go all the way to the end I want sites to be responsible for the products that they list because when I buy something from a supposedly
trusted site like Amazon used to be or you know Costco I would say still fairly is now although have they gone Marketplace yet I actually don't know  Marketplace I'm looking let me know guys yeah best buying Walmart have I I have a I wonder what you think about this because I've had this idea no they haven't that I don't think you should be able to sit on the line I think you should have to be a Marketplace and not sell your own things just facilitate the sale of other people's stuff or be your own
store because this whole like I go on Amazon and I it's yes they say it but it's not like iny face that I'm buying from somewhere else I go on New Egg it's not in your face that you're buying from somewhere else like with us for example you can buy a Jerry RG everything knife or or one of lewig bedet but it's coming from us you deal with our customer service it's it's we're going to warranty it in fair to them you do deal with their customer service and you do deal with them for warranty Amazon
warranty mhm so if we if we sell we sell some stuff on Amazon don't we only within a certain period but yes people can absolutely return our water bottle or screwdriver to Amazon if that's where they bought it oh interesting in fact I still don't like it I think you should be one or the other in fact these marketplaces leveraging their position as the only access that sellers have to to their customer base um has led to a pretty interesting situation for teu teu I always forget how it's pronounced I'm
so sorry I don't care so people are like attacking me for saying it wrong I don't chop there I don't see their ads if I do I ignore them I'm sorry I don't know team whatever it is apparently they had um protests at their headquarters uh this was a day ago um their sellers are revolting against fines withheld pay and uh situations where customers are are claiming uh warranty issues and team is basically going okay yeah no problem here's your refund and don't bother sending the product back and
these Marketplace sellers are like yo I uh I need I want that back if they're know if if it's broken or whatever like I I need to look at it if if I'm sending the money back I want the product back um and yeah it's been it's been a whole it's been a whole thing nice good yeah anyway yeah I thought that was pretty interesting Chad is talking about my take and like yeah I think eBay is completely fine oh yeah completely because it's very clear what you're doing when you're on that website to me
it's not super clear when I'm on some of these other websites a lot of these other websites what's actually happening if I'm actually buying this from the store that I'm at or if I'm technically buying this from some other store but with eBay have we just been frog boiled more effectively because eBay used to be an auction site if you think about it they used to be by it now I don't think I care now it's a Marketplace site that yeah but I don't think does eBay sell their own
product no then yeah I don't care you know what you're getting into when you're there whether you buy it now or you auction it I'm not too worried about it um I'm just saying there definitely there definitely was a shift in model for eBay but it's one that you consider I think that's fine cuz you you still know you're buying from a massive array of sellers it's very front and center what the seller is that you're buying it from and you know when you're on eBay that you're buying it from a huge range
apparently eBay always had by it now I I think it wasn't as popular was not aware of that I I mean I know that it's basically most of what I see listed these days and I don't think that was  know definitely good to know yeah apparent apparently it always had it I know they've had it for a very long time   that's it for topics is it time for after dark yes let's do it after purple after yeah after chair after do we have an after dark sponsor today yes Dan you're muted sorry it's in the it's in the dock
is it I don't know I can't see it um that's cuz it's an advertisement let's just say I'm dumb nice that was a pretty good reference actually uh Pia oh okay after is brought to you by private internet access and it'll show up on the banner and things as well nice all right Dan you want to hit us with some merch messages yeah let me switch this Banner over and then yeah I've got some here let's see purple even though new standards are always more useful and successful and never compete
with their predecessors uh SLS lonus and Luke what standard would you like to have erased from history oh wow uh uh USB what no it be funny no I mean see what happens every device just uses a parallel port from like I mean there are to your phone yeah just this giant 25 pin sub kind of thing yeah um I definitely do think that there are that there are standards the world would be better off without um I don't think that I would go as broad as as USB but I think I would I would delete micro USB
from history if I could I think mini B was a uh no it wasn't a mini B was B but it was mini B um mini be first of all was much more durable than micro b and second of all at least anecdotally and second of all was not that much bigger I found really wasn't much very few devices very few devices that had a micro b port on them that couldn't possibly have just had a mini on them instead um and people are saying micro HDMI and mini HDMI yeah those are those are complete garbage Town however I
wouldn't delete them they have a certain utility whereas micro b my issue with it is that I would have rather just used Mini until we made it to USBC I really think we could completely delete that standard from history and not a lot would have been lost you got anything got a standard that you would eliminate Adobe Flash JK JK Adobe Flash served a purpose actually really liked it when it was also macr media flash yeah yeah yeah before it was Adobe Flash I don't know there's a lot
of I feel like I feel like most standards like I I completely agree with you on the micro b thing but I feel like most standards are just suffering from the xkcd let's there's too many standards let's add a standard so that we can just have one standard and then there's one more standard um I don't think most standards are necessarily actually that bad like the fact that HDMI and display port have to coexist yeah I understand there are features that one has and the other
doesn't but the the fact that we keep propping up HDMI at this point when it really doesn't do much that display port doesn't already do or couldn't do and it has a license fee associated with it when DP doesn't I just uh couldn't we put copy protection over DP I believe it can be done yeah yeah why yeah yeah I don't know maybe maybe HDMI I don't I just I find most standards like I don't know you could get rid of the vast majority of them um and there would be something U USB is kind of
funny cuz not really but you could get rid of the mass vast majority of standards and there's probably some other standard that's probably fine I  firewire rambus I mean one of the things though is like even with fire wire if if it kept being developed until now maybe firewire 4 or whatever maybe it would be fine Titan storm has the best one rj11 we could have just never had rj1 and then everywhere that was ever wired for a phone line could just be RJ45 and could be useful for networking today
now that landline phones are dead if we had just not had rj11 the world would be a better place today I like that I like that that's a good one you win yeah pretty good you won yeah mini disc n mini disc is a fun curiosity yeah we don't need to get rid of it yeah yeah uh let's see hi lus been playing Beat saer about two months now what levels are your favorite at what settings and do you have any tips for moving from hard to expert also my friend Micah says love you l.w uh the biggest tip is uh that
instead of moving your arms uh which is slow because your arms are heavy and have a lot of inertia um you need to twist your Arms This is faster than this maybe more painful to start um where is it tip to tip yeah yeah exactly and side out and whatever en coding uh anyway compression um so so yeah you need to you need to learn to pronate and subate this was very difficult for me your but I got a lot better once I kind of figured it out I was never that great at it but I got a
lot better I had better luck with the Oculus Rift controllers than the index controllers cuz they were lighter and the center of mass was closer to the the wrist do you have any tips for improving index controller grip uh you can you can look up grips no no it's uh it's mostly just the mass of them and their ability to rotate in space no man it's it's totally a thing um hold on I was just trying to R you uh no this is the wrong one uh basically there's there's like guides for all the
different like grips that you can have and stuff oh no dude this is this is a whole oh yeah it's totally this is a whole thing I've been trying to find those myself actually and yeah I kind of do similar things to some of those it's a whole rabbit I should look that up cuz my my ability to play just absolutely tanked to nothing after I got the index man try playing with the old Vive Wes oh yeah those are freaking heavy they're tough so people would like put their fingers like through the hole um and
then they like hold it like that so that the center of gravity was different still can't find the buttons  oh man okay uh let's see getting this to replace one that fell off my motorbike and got crushed when riding from Glasgow to Lisbon what are you buying they bought a 40 oz water bottle in Atlantic blue LOD what is the most important thing you have lost while R riding or your bike or traveling oh man did I tell the story of how I left not one but both of my luggages on a bullet train when I was in
Japan I have vague memory of this but they probably don't know um oh wait no I think I did I think I did okay yeah well basically I got it back thank you Japan I'm not too surprised and culture of honesty and efficiency I got it back in a couple of hours and I managed to make my flight wow yeah I'm not surprised you got it back I'm a little surprised you got it back like with haste it wasn't super Hasty remind me sometime to send you the completely unhinged chat history that I
have with Ivonne while I was waiting for the lost and found okay it was not moving fast and I was very stressed out because I had a flight to make that I literally made by 1 minute oh ultimately yeah it was it was crazy it was one of the most wild experiences of My Life um but anyway I ended up like rushed off the train and I was like a grab my backpack and go and I just completely left them in the top which where I wouldn't normally put things like I cuz you know cuz I know I know what I'm like
y um anyway the the worst sort of tech thing while traveling and I think the way that you're asking was when I put my laptop on top of my car as I was getting into it and then drove to school I took notes with paper that day yeah I drove to school from Sur to UBC it could have been anywhere literally anywhere I I've I'm I'm very like once an item is put down yeah I think my memory of it is temporarily removed I don't know that that what's it called like uh cont per object permanence yeah
I guess yeah pretty much if I put something on my car now I put it on the driver's side windshield yeah that's my hack yeah I I've got things like I I have better habits when I travel it's something that honestly frustrates me in general cuz I'm like I wish I could keep these things up when I'm not traveling but I better habits when I travel and one of those things is I will just tie things to myself so like if I'm on a train and I put my bag down I'll just tie it to my leg I'm really good with my
backpack I didn't forget my backpack but part of the problem for me on that trip probably like the physical memory was I had spent the trip there and going around everywhere in Japan with my family so I didn't have cuz what I'll do is I I count I'll count how many items I'm supposed to have with me three three three three two three so that's how I keep things with me but there had been no consist love the grunt  recognition number we phone we child it just felt very real
but there had been no consistent number on that trip right like no I'm I'm the same way about my phone my my number of things that are supposed to be in my pants is four yeah don't ask me what the extra  is you can forget that um I mean I would if it wasn't attached to me um so yeah my my number of thing that's supposed to be in my pants is four and I have designated Pockets where everything goes and if for whatever reason I put something in a different  like you know um anyway what' you lose
oh I've lost a bunch of stuff I don't know I I think there's there's one on the plane I forgot my wallet in Uber one time um dude was super super helpful came back was great um I left the phone on the plane as you know um there's there's been yeah there's been a bunch of different things I lose sweaters all the time m i don't when I travel I still take a sweater CU I like doing the like I put it on backwards on the plane to get like a a a dark environment so I can sleep more easily is that more of a
front and pull the whole thing tight so I can have my gigantic snorkel of a nose sticking out of it so I can breathe more easily but yeah you yeah's good too all I but I unless I like really need it I will not take it over of the hotel room because I'm like it'll it's gone I leave sweaters at friends houses all the time yeah it's like it's bad you've never left one at mine what are you saying I'm pretty sure I have no I know I'm just I'm like rather certain um but I don't know Ben Mitchell goes 
now stop bringing it up sad I never thought it was that big yeah but   man hey low density lipoprotein LDL question for lonus would you ever do an interview with Hank Green I'd love to hear your thoughts on each other's business practices as successful YouTube creators I mean sure I don't I don't interview people but if I was going to interview someone sure why not H green seems like an absolute Chad yeah let's see hey Daddy lonus I was recently featured in a mean comments
video please tell James I'm sorry he is not in fact a menace that I think the term you're looking for ising Menace I did uh bleep the word when I when I said that verbal bleep I like it well just for just for for you guys so there's no it's kind of how I sing along with rap songs you just leave a gap yeah that's the safest thing yeah yeah pretty much or you could just not sing along much no no I'm I'm okay I'm okay you know violence and disrespecting women and all that kind of
stuff I'll sing along with that but  line I drive a Chevrolet movie theater um please tell James I'm sorry yeah yeah uh do you have any concerns about videos like that encouraging toxic comments um no not really it does it doesn't really seem to go up or down I think most people have uh a pretty good sense of humor and have a pretty healthy relationship with their consumption of our videos it just is like a very very small minority of frankly kind of unhinged people that have taken the
whole parasocial relation ship thing whether it's with us or whether it's with like a tech brand that they stand or whatever else it is and have just gone off the deep end with it um it it's still I think you see a lot of it in Tech just because how do I put this um respectfully I think uh yeah was buried what two and a half hours into a wind show it's probably fine what's happening you see a lot of this in Tech right where I think I think that a lot of us ended up into computers and Technology
because we struggled socially right um like I'm not I'm not I'm not going to dance around this right like that was a big part of what was appealing about it to me so I think it's natural that we end up with um some people in The Tech Community maybe disproportionately so that have kind of uh um some challenges when it comes to sort of social understanding and social interactions right so um it's totally a thing it's totally a thing I don't think that even needs to be like buried in a w show it's
not an overwhelming it's not an overwhelming majority and no and a lot of the social difficulties aren't harmful yeah yeah it's just it's just a handful that you know write Temple OS um you know like well we had some  yeah hi W.D what are your thoughts on home theater setups talking full AV receivers for PCs I've been looking for an option but it appears none support 21 by9 and this is yet another reason that HDMI is such a weird stupid standard like why does it only support certain
resolutions in certain implementations why does it matter who cares um it's not it's not entirely due to HDMI it actually has to do with the implementation obviously it'll work at 21 by9 on your computer with an HDMI cable um but it it it's it's just been a it's been a that's just you've you've hit a trigger for me that's really frustrating that TV receivers won't just pass through whatever resolution who cares as long as there's enough bandwidth why does this matter um yeah so you don't the the thing
though is that you don't have to go through your receiver for the video like you could just um you can just use the AV receiver with um you can just use the AV receiver for audio and then have a separate cable go out to your display so that's probably what I would do if you want to if you want to use home theater speakers and an AV receiver which I actually did for a long time I had a non receiver and these um who made the speakers anyway wow how do I know oh kef yeah I had some I had like kef um satellite
speakers was kind of a sick setup at my girlfriend's parents house imagine having a sick audio speaker based audio setup I know right at your girlfriend's parents what level that but that's another angle I like the angle it's just so so so Chad but is it brat yeah I think so I don't even know it might be Beyond brat I think if your parents had a sick audio system at your house like your girlfriend's parents had one at your house that would probably be brat that would be that would be super
weird why would they do that why why would they have that yeah just because you're that brat Dan I don't I don't know if you understand what brat is I don't either though yeah me neither so sure why not yeah sure yes it's Brad confirm yeah that's quite okay moving on I think before I think that might be the show for today yeah sure really appreciate you guys tuning in we'll see you again next week same bad time same bad Channel bye   oh you might have to cut back to me this is hilarious uh John from
ashtech messaged me 35 minutes ago he's like all man go ahead and confirm we'll do a Perpetual option don't say prices yet though I you you didn't technically confirm that they were going to do it no he says go ahead and do it though oh okay yeah yeah yeah yeah oh yeah so now it's done I love it all right see that pretty much guarant I'll be using it  investor Oh by you can't do it twice what if I say bye-bye what if this  bye-bye what that's going to do there might be music playing over music we'll
