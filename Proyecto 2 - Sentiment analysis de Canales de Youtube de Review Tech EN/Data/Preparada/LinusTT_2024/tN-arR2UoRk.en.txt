okay hear me out you know what would be cool movie night but in the pool like outside like with a projector yeah this feels like when you asked me to put a TV in the bedroom you begged for years and you used it one time so just make a video if they can find a sponsor I'll do it they're not going to find a sponsor I found a sponsor what a okay fine but if we're going to do this I'm doing it my way sick movie watching experience but easy to deploy and tear down and tuck away for when my
family inevitably doesn't flipping use it and we're going to do it with the C2 Ultra 4K projector from high sense and my world class team of helpers that's me no extra holes no promises do you want to drill the holes I do not trust myself why do you always sound surprised with  after I was assigned to this video my first task was to actually figure out more details from ion how big of a screen does she want how important is sound you know that kind of thing and oh too late now that we're committed
then we need to come up with a plan for where all of this is getting mounted we were originally thinking hot tub viewing but that limits the number of people who can watch and realistically you can't hang out in the hot tub for an hour and a half at at a time so instead of mounting the screen here we settled on the longer beam right over here except looking at it now I think that's actually really stupid and we should probably put it on that one why because you could totally see this from the
shallow end of the pool anyway yeah but you want to be in the deep end why Jaws the experience of Jaws I've never seen you have never seen realistically we could put it anywhere we want though because it actually reaches 300 in in "size thanks to its 3,000 lumens now to" be clear that's not enough for daylight viewing but as we make our way into the evening it's going to make a big difference to the perceived contrast the screen was actually really difficult to find mainly cuz I was looking for two
key things one of Avon's requirements was that it needed to be a drop- down screen so that way it could be moved out of the way whenever she wanted it and the other one was a rear projection screen cuz I don't want the projector in the pool right or out in the rain you guys might have noticed we live in Vancouver our weather isn't always wait it's powered yeah why'd you get a powered one well I cuz you know you can hit a button and it goes up and down yeah but then we have to wire it up yeah
you you you got power right there dude I know you follow evon's requirements what about my requirements your requirements was a sponsor and thankfully Elite screens sent this over they recommended the 100 in so that it's big enough for movie enjoyment but not so big that we lose some of that brightness from going too far back okay so just uh roll it up put it on the tip then unroll it I'm working did you not attend sex ed claz I just can't believe yard Master is an actual line of projector screens and
this is longer than a yard what's a yard a meter it's an American meter question for you have you given any thought to how we're going to handle power for now both the projector and the screen yeah you have an extension cord and then I have a power bar oh okay I have thought about it not much but a bit why don't you go ahead and run that and then I'm going to go take a look at the projector sounds good inside the Box we find the remote complete with oh probably the app
shortcuts you would actually use as well as a power cable and the star of the show The C2 Ultra the mount swivels and tilts giving you a ton of Versatility and it even has a/4 20-in threaded hole on the bottom if you wanted to ceiling mounted or put it on a light stand or whatever the case may be or if you don't want to mount it you can pick it up and move it to any room in your house and the auto keystoning you'll see in a second we'll fix that  here we go theoretically it should look
pretty good it uses high sense this pure tricolor laser which is a fancy way of saying that it uses three laser lights and then combines them before they shoot out the lens this contributes to a brighter picture than conventional lamp projectors and even than some single laser Ones high sense also boasts much better color accuracy with a Delta e of about 0.9 oh here we go oh I love that Auto Image correction with cameras on the front oh I probably shouldn't do that with the Keystone done you can see
it's doing autofocus now and having a look at the io it's pretty solid they've got two HDMI ports including one with E and some USB ports for media file playback naturally we're going to be streaming most of our media so let's go ahead and get logged in and fire something up have you come down to check on your completely impractical project no is it cool I don't know you tell me this is really small let it never be said that I've never done anything for love using just whatever magnets Linus had left we
actually took the cable red along here underneath the floor mat and all the way up to here but now I need to mount the screen so I know actually where that cable is coming out which is why We've Ended it here for now but I don't know it looks looks pretty slick dude this looks pretty good and the brightness is apparently at 50 that is really not making much difference let's put it back to 50 oh here we go it's cranked this might be kind of usable Elijah yeah they also partnered with Dolby and IMAX for Dolby
vision and IMAX enhanced certification employee movie nights let's go you don't want to sit in the pool I will fight you on this you got an ear infection last time you swam in the pool maybe clean your pool my pool was clean yeah I just didn't to get the water out your ear was dirty wow you did a really good job of that the cable management while we were in there why do you always sound surprised with these things best part about modern cases take this off please do not tell lonus I put
like five extra holes in someone's wall what and it meets my requirement of being able to be tucked away easily because it's all using our magnetic Cable Management stuff heck yeah boop boop sick um I couldn't help noticing you didn't finish though well we need to mount the screen cuz I don't know where the cable comes out of that screen to be able to route to that point got it I'm fine okay I don't know my hand was there why is there a camera here well we need two angles for later when
we're in the pool relaxing we're not going in the pool today are we it's a pool movie theater we have to test it it's cold and raining well you're not going to notice the rain cuz you're in the pool you know it's not heat this time of year right turn the computers on isn't that how you heat it I think we're ready to drill some holes um there you go there's one well I mean you got to no dud you got to check the size I'm aware sir I just gave you you're aware sir what you turn into you
like wear a suit at the full moon oh awar sir do you want to hold the projector or do you want to drill the holes I'm holding the projector screen cuz I do not trust myself good answer uh okay so like there sure wait did you measure it what do you mean like did you get a measuring tape like do you actually know or are you just I was eyeballing it no we're not eyeballing oh my goodness 362 so that's 181 181 is our Mark and then conveniently there's a little Thumbtack in here from putting up
decorations for some birthday party so I'm just going to use that as our Center Mark well that's not 181 I know so I'm going to move it okay we're going to go right uh hold on let's see it needs to go all  a I mean good is a really really strong word to describe what that is but you think we can get the other side up there I'm working on it I'm working here this is really bad this is very bad Elijah we're going to have an extra hole and it wasn't me okay hold on okay just let it down let it down we're going
to you know what we're going to go for gold here at least it's kind of level it's fine the auto keystoning will fix it that's not how that works  boys I think it might need to be turned around Elijah you know what no this makes sense no this makes sense because the facing on this is this way I was just going to say so this has got to be it okay we're good we got it we have to cuz if you were going to wall mount it this is on the side you would wall mount it yeah and then you would see the yeah
we're I'm pretty sure this is right Elite if we got it wrong send me an email now I really don't know if I want to commit to mounting this projector up there yet I think I need to see it in action first so for now I'm just going to use that quarter 20 Mount and throw on a tripod that might actually be usable no way this is pretty sick it's not even that dark out right now could you imagine like in the summer super late at night pitch blackout we definitely don't have it perfectly
leveled no no no there's still alignment things to do okay one sec okay I think we can adjust this Elijah move it a little farther away oh here we go oh nice uh okay I definitely need it bigger there's a little bit of water stop don't touch it there's water don't touch it there's water don't touch it this might be usable I'm so happy do you want to get in the pool and test well get in the pool we haven't even set up the audio yet oh yeah but we wanted to test the speakers that are included it's got 2.1
that whole base is a sub I don't think I need to be in the pool for that okay what am I trying to do again crab Rave no I'm trying to change the language and location Germany yeah there's your problem right there I said it so no one could docks you uh yeah wait Canada's not even an option hi sense sense the United States is not oh we must have gotten a Euro model okay I don't know whatever we're in the UK I mean we could set up speakers yeah  suround what was your plan exactly I saw
a receiver there were you going to like ceiling mount that or like what did you think this through yeah it's easy to roll up and pack away so we'll just put it on a chair and then we'll cut speaker wire for speakers that I bought off Facebook Marketplace we'll just drag them in the yard I thought this through I probably should have expected that he wouldn't want to go with the speaker route that's not really easy to pull out and easy to put away you know especially a big sub
like this um but I also didn't expect him to actually get in the pool so I guess I actually need to get to inflating the pool floaties I bought I bought four of them oh man the rain is really coming down are you sure this is a good idea Elijah 100% confident oh good oh great we put it over there well you can get in from the ladder it's so cold this is so unpleasant dude no no you're going to like it once you use it no I come back there's a hole in the Middle where your butt gets in the water
no I'm not coming back to I need the other one you get your own floaty well push me push me not into it how am I supposed to get it back to you now oh I'll go from the other side Elijah sorry can you spin me no how am I supposed to spin you I see a flaw now okay hold on maybe if I like stick my foot through the dut hole I can kind of it's propellers no no it works Works dude it works it works oh dude no I'm so maneuverable now all right oh dude these have hooks we can hook each other
neutral hooker nice nice now I can pull you oh now I don't have to do anything we have the  awesome it actually looks shockingly good oh man normally I'm against like r/ TV too high you know like this would be too high but I but when you're reclined this much it's kind of fine does it look pretty good on camera Andy it's a little bright it's a little bright it's a little bright that's actually a good thing I'm not sure if I can fix that Andy this is so ridiculous do you want
to try some gaming yeah I guess so no I want the Alpha seat no I want the alpha SE I want the Alpha seat you move at this distance there is a little bit of input latency on the control oh that makes sense yeah hold on I'm working on it I'm working on it yeah get me closer I'm working on it I can't kill demons even with like the pool lights on and stuff it doesn't really bother it I thought the extra City lighting would honestly be more but like it's pretty good yeah all right Elijah I got to give it
to you it's pretty sick heck all right thank you for convincing me and thank you high sense for sending the projector and sponsoring this video If you guys enjoyed this video why not go check out out our coverage of the high sense Booth back at CES we looked at their 110 in TV that a little birdie told me I might be getting a closer look at very soon
