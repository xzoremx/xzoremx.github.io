and welcome to the W show we've got a bunch of great topics for you guys today of course there was the big Global it meltdown that took place thanks to cyber security company crowd strike we'll be talking a little bit about that as well as just the implications of how hyper centralized our Global it infrastructure is it's kind of scary we'll also be talking about an STI screening app that asked people to submit genital pictures uh for AI screening or for for AI evaluation uh that got shut down by the
FTC we'll be talking about that what else we got there's an MMO publisher saying that Intel is selling defective chips which is rough and a company apologized to uh reviewer golden sound for threatening them yeah you oh my didn't threaten golden sound don't do that I'm going to give you a golden  um what um we just started you can't going to be that kind of show today folks that's against the rule here we go show is brought to you today by vessie Ridge RFS and secret lab our chair
partner there's also going to shoes are water resistant um there's also going to be something a little bit special hre excuse me I pronounce that wrong I always do that uh HRS uh there's also a  today we're doing it live the classic we're doing it live we're doing it live we're doing it live I think wait I don't see any it did anyone I have okay I think they wanted you to do some of it we're doing it live are you just going to do some of it I Luke I already  whoa I'll explain that later you've
always been facing me this I genuinely had no idea that was that was a fully real reaction I never saw that okay so you're doing the the rest of it all right let's jump right into our big topic this week wow today the world was struck with an historic it outage as Windows systems in businesses and government buildings around the globe were sent into endless boot Loops this has led to business at airports and Banks grinding to a halt while hospitals have wound up cancelling non-emergency
operations and this one's really awful emergency hotlines so 911 even went down in multiple US states cyber security company Microsoft's got to be sitting there going okay this is bad but at least it wasn't us yeah cyber security company crowd strike has taken responsibility for the outage which was apparently caused by a faulty software update for their Falcon sensor security platform the company has enacted a fix but okay dude have you looked at the replies on their Twitter
yeah yeah okay I saw everything from people claiming to be shareholders asking pointed questions about how they're going to regain trust and have a functioning business moving forward to it managers demanding to know what the compensation is going to be and and if you're wondering why they're so mad guys this is not like oh roll it back okay the fix is in that's not what that means but the point is there is a fix but unfortunately it requires the  be oh oh it's turned on it needs to work
which it can't turn on right now because it's boot looping so so you have to have physical access to the machine put into some safe mode and then manually remove files yes so so first of all the computer has to be online and then there's the other fix which they suggest rebooting the computer as many as 15 times might fix it so that one great and then there's the one that Luke said where you can reboot and safe mode remove some files and then boot again be online and get it fixed and crowd strike
uh there there was groups before crowd strike said anything I believe uh that came up with ways to fix it which was cool and then strike put out like an official way to do it which is a little bit cleaner um and and and worked well but you need you need manual in-person intervention so companies that have outsourced or remote it are in a pretty rough spot right now yeah this is kind of scary also a fun one did you see the bit locker stuff is that in here no I heard about it I have only heard about
as much as you just said apparently Microsoft is like nuking bit locker keys or something like that can you can you elaborate so a lot to do with this story is happening kind of live this is still a little early to talk about it I think there I've I've read a decent amount of stuff that has turned out to be misinformation already this doesn't seem to be one of those things I'm just warning people that that's true also um as with all of these types of topics there's only so far we can really go
into it I would recommend checking out um various people that cover this type of thing more in depth um but the bit lockers stuff um you know to be able to get into the computer in that way you're going to need your bit locker key A lot of these companies are storing their bit locker keys on systems that currently  on so they they literally are just stuck they might even have it teams ready to come in and fix this stuff in person they might be ready to go and there's nothing they can do because they
can't even get the computers to the point where they could even fix it because they need the bit locker keys and the bit locker keys are stuck on a computer that they can't fix so rough Linux systems are unaffected by the outage as are Windows systems in Russia of all places where crowd strike software is unavailable due to sanctions and coupled in with that effectively just it's crowd strike so if you don't have crowd strike on your system you're you're not affected so our
discussion question here is this is kind of like if Y2K actually happened the way that people worried it would obviously on a relatively small scale because not every organization is using crowd strike I have to confess to you I was not aware of them I don't leave them in that space I have heard a data point I think this came from John Hammond I heard a data point that was over 500 of "the top 1,000 us companies run crowd" strike with that said with that said y 2K was and you you were pretty young
when the fearmongering was going on oh but I was walking around Best Buy when they all had the Y2K stickers and all that kind of stuff Y2K was a huge deal literally the fud that was floating around was that when the Clock Struck midnight in the on the year 2000 and and every software that had a a calendar that was only programmed to go as high as 1999 and then it would just crash like literally every computer unless it was you know hack sword to be Y2K compliant but even then I don't know it
might break and all software was just going to stop working planes were going to fall out of the sky like just everything was going to be absolute chaos and on fire and this was horrible but it wasn't quite that it wasn't that I've heard everyone in their mom bringing up the Y2K reference there's been a lot of people saying the same things about this whole crowd strike thing but um hugely impactful hugely impactful I think it's going to take quite a while for us to actually really
understand what the impact was um because like I mean I saw and you don't know what of these images are doctored or not doctored but I saw an image of an MRI machine that was blue screened out um there's there's questions on like what is this going to do to Global Supply Chain um anytime Global Supply Chain is impacted I know a lot of people might be like oh it doesn't affect me it affects everybody um from food to standard consumables like toilet paper we've seen that Happ
general transportation it's the the amount of people that were grounded because the a lot of the airlines weren't running um how is that going to impact things some of those travel some of that travel wasn't just people like going on vacation for funsies it was very important things happening um Southwest I heard this through grape Vines this is another one of the things we're like I don't know if it's true or not but I've heard that Southwest is still up and running just fine because
they're still running Windows 3.1 uh so no problems there here's my big question or here's my big fear this was in oopsy Doodles yeah oh yeah that the implication of that is insane I think we're looking at what effectively War would be like if it was through large like world powers yeah if if we were if we were looking at state sponsored activity that was that was not just you know harassment you know TR digital skirmishes you know like like what an what an actual all out assault
on our digital infrastructure might look like CU we've often talked about things like power um Power Water these like these like standard infrastructure things I don't think we've thought about something on this level before um and like another part of that topic is it's often discussed about how like the the most effective way to deliver malware is effectively usually like social engineering what if you just got a job at one of these companies and then push something sheesh man yeah so if if it's a if it's
a you know I don't remember exactly what state sponsored like that might be something that's a viable option yeah and and to be clear like we don't necessarily like we we know enough to to kind of go oh you know that could potentially be plausible or that couldn't or but but we don't know exactly what exploits are there and I guarantee you what I can tell you for sure is that there are zero days that large entities have in their back pocket that they are waiting to use and they
are constantly developing new ones as as these things get patched and as as the holes get filled in um and it is it is terrifying to think of trying to operate in this modern world if there was a capable organized actor that was working to prevent us from having access to what we what is a basic necessity now like power and running water right like it's not like it's it's not like we just got inhome Plumbing 20 years ago and the well you know still works and everyone for the most part still lives walking
distance from it you know like it's yeah we'd be ducks ducks that are sitting that's that's the word for it right ducks that are sitting sitting ducks yeah yeah no no ducks that are sitting nobody says it that weird way you said it someone someone posted this apparently air India's systems were down so they started handwriting tickets oh my goodness I mean you got to you got to respect the hustle I actually I kind of like it you got do what you got to do so crowd strike do they survive
this um remember this is this is America this is the land of the lawsuit people going to die well people the rather they're going to start tallying up yeah uh it's going to be billions um I don't know it's hard to tell CW  suffer yeah oh man um no this took out the FAA I'm not they apparently lost about 20% of their valuation yeah they stock tanked pretty hard I I just I don't know they're an actually enormous company but it's not like there isn't other options sitting there and honestly it's not like
plug-and playing some of these other options would even be all that hard I'm sure companies like Sentinel one the one that we use are looking at this just hungry this is crazy tilt Lord says did you see the Wall Street bets post a few hours before the update where a guy was saying crowd strike was over valued and shorted the stuffing out of it good job I lucky job um on the yacht congratulations on winning the lottery because that's what you did but  wow cool why don't we do our next topic

subscribers to choose from other options like $7 uh monthly plan like a $7 monthly plan with ads or a $115.50 standard HD plan uh or a $23 premium Ultra HD plan without ads the company saw a 34% increase in ad supported subscriptions after introducing the standard with ads tier in November 2022 contributing to a record 277.50 million subscribers holy in that wild wow in this in the second quarter of 2024 uh partly due to increased signups for the cheaper plan and efforts to limit
password sharing uh this isn't a discussion question but do you think it's going to go back to being not many services other than Netflix because as far as I can tell the other services are not really doing that well yeah Paramount plus just uh just ditched the um I think it's Paramount plus that's not renewing Halo yeah two years I mean what a show though I I never I heard it was terrible I was excited for it um and then I heard he takes off his helmet and I I literally didn't even
look for like anything immediately I don't even know I never watched the show but I just heard that he takes off his helmet and I was like I'm not going to like the show I just I just know immediately right then I was like it's not a show for me and not because like oh I don't know it's just he never takes off his helmet in the game so if they're doing that what else are they doing probably stuff that's dumb yeah so I'm just not going to waste my time in the first episode really he takes it off in the first
episode like they probably thought this was going to be some huge payoff for the fans and it's just like no yeah you don't understand Master Chief is the guy in the helmet yeah that's the whole thing yeah he's a Space Marine in a helmet yeah don't take it off the only time he takes it off um you just you like I think you hear him take it off you don't actually see him and people uh I don't remember if it was on like PC or something they found some way to like no clip into the ship that he's in and he
like takes the helmet off there's an animation for it he's just there's just another one under it that's so cool I remember this from like forever ago and I remember when I heard that I was like nice because now it's still just Master Chief which is great um no I it does kind of seem like it's going that way I mean Disney has talked about how they're backtracking on the whole yep Disney plus is all our stuff only our stuff you can't see our stuff anywhere else and they they're
open they're open for business again when it comes to licensing to third party platforms and I think Netflix is still the monster I um I can't remember if I said it out loud but I'm pretty sure this is a this is a classic Linus I Told You So moment uh I remember people talking about how Netflix is is cracking down on password sharing boycott boycott they're never going to survive the yeah with two almost almost 300 million subscribers they like immediately they'll survive saw a huge boost in
subscriptions once they started cracking down on password sharing uh I'm a little surprised to see them come back again so soon after getting so many more signups and increasing price and this is something that I've talked about before on the show so this isn't going to be a they they um I don't think they increased the price well they're discontinuing the $12 ad free plan like that sucks but there's a $7 monthly plan but that's with ads oh no it's going to cost you it's going to cost you
$15.50 for what you used to pay $12 for S I'm not a subscriber and you know what don't subscribe to any of the platforms look I don't I don't work in government policy okay so I'm sure that there are there are challenges and there are obstacles that I don't have familiarity with I I I'm going to I'm going to say that up front but I do not understand given that this is something that basically every living breathing human with a credit card has experienced at some point I don't understand how
nobody who works Within These large governments has ever thought you know when I sign up for something and we agree on a price and we agree on a product or service that should be the deal you should not be able to unilaterally say that is not the deal anymore hold on are they though I I'm I'm genu okay so how how would you solve this I would solve this by saying look it has to be grandfathered in you you have to you have to grandfather in but does that work forever like okay let's let's use this
in a float plane context right so we we have grandfather subscribers in for a long time we have grandfather subscribers from 2017 yep wait do we have do we have grand we might have grandfather subscribers from 2016 technically um it's the $3 tier right we've never increased it um and I I like that that's cool that's that's good stuff whatever sounds cool um but what if it's like 30 years from now so here's the solution to that because right now they want to eat their cake
and have it too if they want to have certain if they want to have a fixed term on this agreement then they need to stop charging my credit card at the end of that term okay it should be like anything else so if you want to change if you want to update the pricing you have to cancel all current subscription exactly and there's going to be a lot of attrition there because the friction to get get someone to Reign up for someone something is extremely high here's a spicy question for you
sure we've talked on wo how about how there is a possibility that we'll be increasing Flo plane prices I don't think that's a possibility I think that's something that's happening and we'd be Grant it just hasn't happened yet which is why I word it that way right um and we'd be I guess yeah we'd be grandfathering people of course okay so if you wanted to increase the price on say the $3 tier in 30 years or whatever um you would cancel all their subscriptions but then allow them to
subscribe at like a now increased but still grandfather discounted something like would I wouldn't do that either okay yeah cuz that's lame so you just it's not cool you just grandfather them for literally ever yeah or if it's not sustainable anymore then I guess we  service well like look it's not like it's not like these changing it's a different product it is a a different product but it's very related yeah it's it's pretty darn related float plane has a lot of the same um dynamics that
something like a Netflix does we pay for bandwidth we pay for storage we pay for development we pay for Content production you guys pay us for all of those things yeah like when when I mentioned like I don't subscribe to any of those platforms I meant things like Netflix so like Netflix Disney plus Amazon Prime video whatever those types of things um I do technically like I I support at least one I don't remember how many creators on float plane where I'm technically paying for the float
plane subscription that is a thing and I also support I have at least one patreon thing where I'm supporting a Creator like I I support creators individually I don't support the Omega video platforms they're different but here's the thing right like if they don't like that it was an option to not do it like okay look look at something like uber it's it's finally people have kind of finally figured out what the Uber play was they took a bunch of VC money they essentially undercut the traditional and
to be clear there were a lot of problems and a lot of corruption in the cab industry at least here in North America anyway and um and other sort of just like private uh private transportation companies so they came in they took a bunch of VC money they funneled it into to undercutting everybody until the infrastructure and these companies decayed to the point of negligibility and then they jacked up the rates to the point where now it cost me more to take an Uber today than it
did to take a cab before they came in and disrupted these industries right so they didn't if they if they were to come back you know uh 10 years later right and say well this is totally unsustainable so well well yeah but you had an option to not just dump money in running it unsustainable in what is essentially an anti-competitive manner uh in into this to to kneecap your competitor that that was that was totally an option you could have run the business and built it in a sustainable
fashion in the first place and I get that that's not what your investors want I get that that's not the Silicon Valley model but guess what I don't feel bad for you that was a choice nobody had a gun to your head and said you have to you have to charge razor thin margins on this and grow your your install base at a break neck speed instead of building something slowly and sustainably so no no I don't I don't  care yeah electrobot says yeah same thing Airbnb it's more expensive and a
worse experience than a hotel now it's like you're you're actually a lot of the times better off to go to a hotel where they will clean the towels for you yeah I feel that way uh I'm a flanker said the difference is that yours is in-house without being required to compete complete multiple compliance in multiple Nations we do actually actually we do we absolutely have to do that and it's like man tax is so complicated for a multinational online platform like Flo plane it's actually a really stupid
project that we should have never started yeah it's kind of sick though hey now that we got it hey if I if anyone want to license some really cool Tech I had I had very good very intelligent very connected friends of mine go through a lot of effort to try to convince me not to do it at the time and I did it anyways it is what it is um they were right but we're here now and it's good I like it um okay I'm going to continue his message I'm not crying for Netflix but they need the
ability to change pricing the cost should absolutely be that if it's uh overinflation then you have the ability to cancel with a penalty yeah but inflation's such an arbitrary number anyway has zero contract length so technically you can leave whenever that's it's way worse in telecoms so that that was my one point is that you can technically leave whatever so like especially on monthly to monthly like your contract is really up at the end of the month if they if they change like if you subscribe for a
year um and they like change it and then Bill your card because they're like well we change our price that's total BS if you subscribe for a year and they're like when it renews it will be more expensive ensive yep that's why it's legal yeah but what it isn't is cool yeah and that's my problem it's definitely not cool but I don't know about it being illegal like oh man yeah some some sometimes it could be uh do you see the uh the recent Kur fuffle over Microsoft and their game pass
changes so we talked about this last week how prices went up and everything was confusing and they're kind of gating access to the new C that that should actually because they FC is not impress I think that is good because when I I brought this up during the show but they announced that it was going to be game day one game pass for everyone and then they pulled that back people might have subscribed because of that so that's a totally different thing in my opinion yeah that's rough that's
actually bad yeah so uh I mean at this point Activision and Microsoft are like integrated um but the the FTC is basically looking at it going okay you guys said this was going to be a super Huggy muggy nice acquisition and then you came in and laid a bunch of people off and now you're going back on your promises that this is all about so very much content for gamers and everyone's going to get day one access to call of dut the big question for me though is who the cares how about just
don't play Call of Duty yeah Gamers though you guys have no discipline and look I'm not trying to I'm not trying to just amazing topic transition holy I'm going to interrupt the topic transition because it was so good that's ridiculous I even I know where you're going and that's nuts thank you what the heck man I'm not bringing this up and lecturing you guys for no reason I'm doing it "because a recent survey of 5,000" American adults who play video games found that 82% of them said they had made an
in-game purchase in a free-to-play game not ever in the last year 82% it's literally it is literally okay you guys take your two take your two hands okay take your two feet and you won't need  okay you wait you will yes and if you have anything else to is pointy point it four of the five things you're pointing  microtransaction in the last year oh my goodness oh and Salos says right here no shame but it's like we sit here and we complain about the in  82% are directly contribu I don't mean
directly contributing like like uh their like passively standing by or they or they pirating games that that reject the fremium business model instead of contributing that money to the developers that continue to invest in these games I am talking giving money to the people who develop programs to extract as much of it as possible who literally call youing whales I mean who would do that okay we had an entire land event for for for our whales we love our whales I think it's higher higher than
what 82% oh that's the ones that admitted to it yes any survey that's like I don't know how many be over how many times do you WI a day or you know whatever right like it's always going to it's always going to underestimate if it's something embarrassing yeah it's it's got to be higher than 82 some commentators have suggested I'm back to my notes now that this kind of data might indicate why the fremium model has become so popular this is a note uh okay well anyway it might
likewise indicate that at least some of the people critical of this monetization strategy are themselves paying into it further around 45% of respondents claimed that they didn't mind watching ads that offered in-game rewards this is how conditioned we are Luke I don't the interesting thing to me is like we'll just take it we've all been playing bend over simulator and we didn't even know it i' I've never actually disagreed with all of it um like I've usually used League of Legends
as a model of like uh I I haven't played in forever so I don't know what it's like anymore but when League of Legends first came out it a free game it was really good and there was some skins and they weren't so expensive I've heard there's some real expensive ones now yeah wasn't there like $300 one a little while like that I don't know but they were like a few bucks or something and you know you support the company and the way that I viewed it was like okay look at how much I play this game look at how
much I would spend on games I'll buy a few skins to support the company cuz I actually really like this game and then I'll like I'll keep it at a very reasonable level that's technically a microtransaction I'm wondering like you know if you ask who has made a microtransaction at all or who has made like egregious microtransactions like I wonder if this is different I don't know I don't know like even rocket League that is a game that I purchased but I played the crap out of it and I
purchased it for like $4 or something because it was on a crazy sale so I bought a couple seasons passes because I felt like they deserved it and then they were bought out by epic and I was like whatever mad mad Economist says nuclear hot take I love freet to-play games with microtransactions they allow me to sponge off of people who spend much more money on them sponge off of yeah like I mean that's I I like Halo infinite I have never given Microsoft a dollar for it a lot of games somebody else paid for
it and I'mma play it so this this is where it gets kind of funny to me enjoy your weird spiky Mohawk cringe makes it easier to see your head cosmetic so I I agree with that fully I think though for for every game like Halo infinite there's there's and and League um there's probably like for Diablo whatever the heck that is mobile game imortal where Diablo Immortal where in in a game like that uh the like I'm a sponge for the people that spend money your content for the paying members of
this game because they're just going to farm you because you are weaker than them that's like that's where I start to have an issue with these types of things well I don't mind the games where it there isn't a huge um com competitiveness disparity like in Halo infinite I don't feel like I'm at I don't feel like I'm at a disadvantage and like we've worked with mobile games before in the past uh before we tightened up our policies around them where they are too pay to win um and so we we we don't anymore um
yeah pay to win is a tough metric in some games yeah but pay for Advantage pay to win whatever you want to call it like that that being better than other players because you spent money on the game yeah I think for me it's less it's less about can you be better by spending more and it's more about are you worse for not spending so if I could also grind and be just as good I'm fine with that but if I just can't do anything about it or if the grind is unreasonable yeah cuz what what what was it uh who
was it that was Under Fire for having that um oh I forget what it was there was like Shadow ofor no it wasn't that there was a series of challenges or something as part of their season or battle pass or like I I don't even remember but someone did the math and there were there wasn't enough hours like if they did absolutely nothing but eat sleep and play the game there wasn't enough hours to like earn the best item um apparently it was Battlefront 2 thanks Elijah and that was like it was like it
was like oh no no I don't even think it was Battlefront 2 cuz Battlefront 2 it was like could never earn Darth Vader or it would take like it was an absurd amount of time like an absurd amount no it was I think it was something I think it was something else it was some kind of was it World of Warships I don't know it might have been World of Warships cuz I I seem to recall it being a ship the pride and accomplishment quote was was uh Battlefront 2 I think sense of Pride and accomplishment yeah you do
know that that pitch worked um back when all you got was that the princess was in this castle like you don't it doesn't have to be a multi you know hundreds of thou hundreds of hours grind um anyway uh what are we supposed to be doing now Dan uh you're still on topic two you get six minutes till merch messages n let's do it now cuz there's going to be a few merch messages to go through today I feel like sure okay let's see hey land Duke and DUS I work in the post- production house
in the film industry and I think doing a deep dive into the behind the scenes of Cinemas would be a cool video going to DCPS and film delivery super cool and something that for some reason we've never really been able to nail I don't know what it is our audience is super into Tech but as soon as that cool processor or that cool algorithm is in a camera um it seems like people just like they just kind of tune out of it whereas whenever I whenever I I see an audience that's
really dialed into the behind the scenes uh but to the technology of of Film Production and and TV production uh it almost seems like they they're less of a nuts and bolts CPUs and cores and megahertz and more of like a um you know more of like a like a like a lighting and um and and codex like like it's almost it's a different kind of geek like there's a there's an overlap between us and a channel like Corridor Digital but it's different kind it's not as big as I think you guys would think
like we did a video a little while back on one of those um uh one of those motion capture setups with all the cameras and someone goes inside the like globe of of cameras and it like did fine um and the people who thought it was cool thought it was really cool and we did that we did that studio tour of um speaking of Shadow of Mordor uh uh oh help me what's that studio called Mono monolith is it monolith uh shadow of midor uh uh monolith Productions yeah monolith yeah we did
that we did that tour of monolith um and that that was super cool too but it was relatively Niche like it didn't it didn't perform it didn't perform that well man was it cool to do though oh that was that was so sick so cool so cool really awesome so I don't know that that's something you're going to see a ton of from us like we we got an opportunity to see one of those big video walls like they famously used on the Mandalorian for virtual production season 1 um and I
was like okay can we game on it you know like I'm like I'm I'm looking for an angle yeah where I can tie it into our audience which is really technophiles Gamers um we have a we have a lot of folks that are really into the Enterprise side of it as well but at the end of the day all those things tie back into the IT side of gaming the it side of um of sort of you know corporate infrastructure it's it's it rather than consumer electronics and the distinction between them always felt kind of
arbitrary to me because my interest has always been in both of them so I thought until I went to Cs and I realized I actually didn't care about most of it and I mostly cared about the it stuff I'm like oh okay yeah I guess that makes sense over time I've grown more interested in it but you got to understand when I attended my first CES I didn't even own a TV why would I have a perfectly good monitor right here I didn't either exactly so it's just a it's just a funny thing
where the overlap is not as big as you might think I completely agree with that I I will say though there's a corridor video I'm trying to find it right now but they they do this like they they like resurrect I think Dan is going to be able to call it out actually um yeah a green screen style technology that they did with these weird bulbs oh God yeah that was amazing that was really interesting talking about Mary Poppins yeah the Lost Disney technology with the Sodium lamps right
sodium lamps that's oh that was such a cool video wicked cool even if you're not into camera stuff very cool yeah um yeah so just want to CH that out cuz that was that was sick more yeah uh lonus what are your thoughts on the Intel Factor coming to Ohio your videos inspired me TOS Ohio why would is that the one that everybody wants to leave young gentlemen saying young gentleman meme Olo skibby buers uh your your videos inspired me to pursue a career in electrical engineering hey that is super cool I am
I am extremely excited to see semiconductor manufacturing moving um on continent I think that we are headed into a period of unprecedented global conflict maybe not unprecedented but certainly unprecedented in my young lifetime um and or how would I say this not conflict I'll say uncertainty we are headed into a period of uncertainty that I have never seen before in my lifetime that is my revised statement that one I will stand behind and seeing us building up infrastructure to continue to
maintain our digital Independence in the event that things hit the fan uh is pretty seems pretty important to me and it's because Canada has no money um or really much strategic value for the most part um everything's declining here yeah it's well our population keeps going up but we don't like build more houses to put anybody in so that seems stupid to me anyway the point is that it's good to see our neighbors to the South and their and their corporate Partners you know whatever however that relationship
complicated works if you did want to have a hat as a country you might be able to buy us soon if things keep going the way they are I mean at this at this rate Nvidia could buy us never mind yeah anyway true um I don't think the I don't think the United States has any money but Nvidia does they have the ability to have more debt yeah any who um it's a good thing I'm happy to see it saving up for a backpack a $10 gift card at a time why are graphic cards so big but you can buy loose CPUs no build
your own graphics card fun fact that used to be more of a thing I don't know that I ever saw a socketed GPU but you could definitely buy uh graphics cards that had sockets for memory so you could actually configure them with the amount of uh video that you wanted them to have depending on your application the challenge is that the same integration that we're seeing take place um on mobile uh right now with CPUs slc's where we're seeing the ram either soldered onto the main board or even on
package like right next to the CPU die um that same Trend took place on gpus way way longer ago because they are so hungry for memory bandwidth that getting those traces as close as possible and getting those cards as integrated as possible was more performance critical than it was on CPUs or at least it was much faster that the performance Advantage outweighed the modularity advantage from a from a cost and consumer preference standpoint so graphics cards are big because their
orientation makes them extremely difficult to efficiently cool and stay quiet like if you put a tower cooler on a GPU it doesn't need to be nearly as big as as as as these like sideways monstrosities because they're so limited by the skinny fans and um and the and the the way that the air has to flow through them it's it's it's a lot worse than just flowing straight through like something like a CPU tower heat sink so they're big for that reason and then as for why you can't buy a loose GPU it's
because they're just so tightly integrated that there would be nothing you could do with a loose GPU there are exceptions to that I believe there have been some uh some tech shop SL YouTubers SL both that have actually performed some pretty wild upgrades I thought I saw someone put a 4090 on a 3090 or 3090 TI PCB don't quote me on that but there have definitely been cases where socket compatible chips have been desoldered and then resered onto other pcbs but that is ex 
uncommon your video you did a video on this uh no no that was repairing a  died it wasn't putting on a different one I guess we never explained merch messages and also I have never launched a crazy surprise deal yet so why don't we explain how merch messages work you're probably seeing people's messages down here Dan is replying to some of your messages we just responded to a few of them ourselves let's see there finger on fire I don't see any smoke so that's good uh we just responded to a few of
them ourselves all you got to do is go to LTD store.com where we are currently celebrating lime day with some pretty wild deals here's a little summary for y'all who are just tuning into the show right now it's lime day baby free shipping on orders over $100 also we got a ton of deals and all you got to do is go to your cart there's going to be a little box whenever we're live and you can type a merch message and it'll go to producer Dan who will reply to it forward it to someone who can take care of your
message or send it to me and Luke as a curated merch message for us to respond to so we just did a few of those and I'm going to give you an a rude and I'm going to give you an incentive to uh try it out I don't know tell you what Luke four oh  me okay we don't have a lot of these and I suspect they're going to go pretty fast which is going to be a theme for these surprise Lightning Deals let's call them Lightning Deals oh we found some swacket V2s I don't know what kind of sizing mix we
have or or anything like that in here uh can I can I check can I check our stock oh we we do have a little bit of everything um the one that you not a lot of some of those yeah not a lot of some of them um and we are putting up the very last of the swacket V2s for 50% off so that's going to be uh what does that work out to good gravy this is an interesting question do you know this line is if if the question was from lumit man he said if he releases multiple deals throughout the show and I
want to lock in each one of them will multiple individual orders be combined for shipping do we do combined shipping I think that if the order is uh in North America we can and that's that's our less loss um and if they are outside of there because of like shipping manifests and stuff and import and stuff we can't okay um but as long as you add a couple of other things to your cart then you well if you get over $100 then you get free shipping on the entire order anyway no
they're they're saying they they want to catch your deals as you're saying them throughout the show so they want to do like a bunch of orders yeah yeah you're going to need to place orders um yeah I'm not you can't you can't buy every deal that's not a I'm not even going to facilitate that you know what no no I'm not no I'm not I'm not I'm not facilitating that no no no no anyway yeah you have to buy every deal twice anyway the swacket deal sw% of Gamers do microtransactions dude there there it is baby
$49.99 can I pay $5 more to to get it in blue no in blue yeah I want a I want a different skin oh my God thank you for that Dan uh what do you want our next topic to be luke oh sorry I was stunned by Dan um let me sorry I'm sorry let let me find one uh STI screening app for for pcks of your dong is shut down by the FTC a company called Health has shut down its app called kmar following investigation by the FTC kmara purported uh to be able to use AI to screen your dong piics for signs of 10
sexually transmitted really 10 sexually transmitted infections with up to 94% accuracy they this happened are you kidding me notably I can't believe you missed this no I had no idea this was like dude everyone was talking about this in the office this week this was like the big Tech news like forget about crowd strike this was this was the biggest Tech news for us this we at least all these lonely dudes aren't going to harass women anymore they just send it to this company I guess uh notably many STI lack
any visible external symptoms further an investigation by the Los Angeles Times discovered that the app wasn't always great at distinguishing between penises and phallic-shaped inanimate objects issuing a clean bill of health to a  doong the FDC opened an investigation into Health as making health related claims without adequate scientific data is very illegal unless you're a supplement company yeah true yeah uh the FBC found that Health had only tested their algorithm on a limited number of
images I mean uh likewise there are a lot of those images on the internet they probably could have used a bigger sample Set uh likewise a study associated with the app only CL how did they test positives is like someone on St oh um on St I get it uh yeah likewise a study associated with the app only claimed it could identify four STI not 10 the FTC has thus ordered the app closed and all Associated user data deleted none of this is even the worst part do you know about the
microtransactions within the app no  skins 10 out of 10 I want mine to be a different color anyway um the our discussion questions our disc  STI our discussion questions are many here uh do we we really need what is essentially a giant dickpick repository apparently do we not already have that bigger one actually they didn't have a big enough sample set is chat roulette not enough like sorry that's a dated reference I don't know whatever the current random chat with strangers at that I'm sure is
full of penises yeah um you know tradition privacy wise what if someone submits a picture of someone else's penis I mean yeah that would be I thought that was part of their pitch for this thing was that you could submit that someone sent to you and be like is it safe to have unprotected sex with this person can oh man I mean they are they are lucky they got shut down because if they had gone down by lawsuit for yeah from people that longer period of time that got a sexually transmitted 
oh this doesn't necessarily mean that they won't that could still happen still time yeah dude my my mind is my mind is my mind is blown um can I make a segue off that somehow yeah oh well we would have been able to segue to this topic from it little bit more challenging uh what what what are what are we supposed to be doing Dan what even is this show company apologizes for threatening reviewer David Steven the managing director of audio brand DC s has apologized to YouTuber and reviewer
Cameron Oatley also known as golden sound following allegations that a representative from the company threatened to sue him over a review from 3 years ago according to Golden sound he was contacted by a company representative in October of last year alleging inaccuracies in his 2021 review of a DCS product Oley asked for further details so he could correct any factual inaccuracies but didn't hear back from DCS until May of 2024 when he received a list of Errors alongside the threat of potential legal
action if they were not fixed within 10 days after that delay yeah sure um Oley claims however that none of the listed complaints were true factual errors managing director David Stevens originally refuted these allegations claiming that the company had not provided a list of provided had provided list of inaccuracies in 2022 and Ole failed to follow up on them and that there was no threat of litigation following further rebuttal from oley's employer headphones.com and internal
investigation at DCS Steven now says that his initial statement while issued in good faith was based on faulty information given to him by someone who now no longer works for DCS Stevens apologized to Oley stating that certain messages sent to him were totally unacceptable DCS apparently plans to meet with Oley in person and has sworn to repair their relationship good yeah I mean this is about as well as you can expect something like this to end I I saw this Kur fuffle start up and I basically was
like just let us know uh what you need um the headphones.com folks are super awesome we've worked with them a number of times in the past um they I I I think this is mutual but um we feel that our missions are are pretty closely aligned to demystifying technology for people and uh seeing them bullied like this was absolutely unacceptable for from from our standpoint so we're we're really we're really glad to see that this was hopefully just a miscommunication and oh golden sound is here oh sick what's up
Golden sound that's cool I didn't know that what's up Golden sounds in float plane chat chat says thanks for your support with this yeah Abol I saw you do that reach out yeah we we got you don't even trip dog highly respected the approach we just want to say yeah well it's it's one of those things where there's another one behind the scenes there where they're not ready to talk about it yet because there could be some pending stuff um but we've got there back to and if it comes down to it uh
and if this goes public and turns into a big show um then we're we're we're in it to win it so ready yep yeah yeah so the discussion question is is this a happy ending of A Sort I think so to be honest yeah I mean the most that you can do when you do something wrong is apologize right and make it make it right moving forward like I'm not going to ask I'm not going to ask DCS to just shut down no like that's not constructive no so as long as they're as long as they're moving forward in good
faith and I think that's all that we can really ask for and uh thank you very much for being mature enough to investigate figure out what went wrong and and try to find a path forward yeah golden sound in chat just said here's hoping this sort of stuff is not something we see more of and I think we will I think we will but I also do agree as well but as long as I think as long as Tech media has each other's backs and as long as we present a united front against this kind of behavior you know
kind of like what happened with um hardw box back in the day um then I think it I think it acts as a deterent it's almost like it's almost like a like a unionization of sorts like obviously we're all independent from each other we don't like a we're not we don't we don't pay dues into into a fund or anything like it's not formal right but I think as long as we as long as we recognize that we're all on the same team team consumer um and we and we treat each other as such and we treat manufacturers
manufacturers as such then I think there's um I think there's less risk that this can become a widespread problem yeah yeah yeah okay um okay I'm going to give you two options for what we can do next we can either we can either talk about  Skywalker or we can talk about what happened   think I think we got to hang them on the hair a little bit and and talk about scrapyard Wars all right cuz I think that's the funniest Poss option out of the two so guys it's back when you look from afar I
really don't look that different um I was thinking about this I read a I read a comment on it um you can see the reception pretty positive this just went up a little while ago um I I I was reading a comment where someone said Luke looks completely unrecognizable less I can totally identify wao I feel completely different and I feel completely differently and I was thinking about it and what I realized is that um my wife who I think is very beautiful has kind of a funny nose I am not really a nose person and
your only prosthetic was the nose is on your nose I am such an eyes person so coming back to my wife who I think is spectacularly beautiful I think she has some of the most amazing eyes ever and that to me is very important when I look at someone I'm looking in their eyes I'm looking at their eyes so when I saw you here I just saw Luke I didn't even notice and I saw him in person I didn't even know that you had a nose prosthetic until I watched the video and I watched them put it on what's funny is I
technically have two three other Prosthetics um if you look they call them Els so right here so you can see I have like it almost looks like I'm frowning even though I'm not frowning oh yeah I guess I I guess I have those too they didn't tell me what they were called we have those as well and then I have fake eyebags but I told her while she was doing them I was like I kind of just have eyebags all the time so I was like I don't I don't think this is going to be a big cell like I can't even tell
looking right now Luke has the Superman disguise or like the fake nose and mustache no but but for some people my disguise is great and Luke's is junk and Luke's disguise is great and mine is junk and don't worry guys this is not much of a spoiler it's in the thumbnail of the video that yeah that's the angle that we we've never told we've never told the broader audience oh I didn't realize that this my friends is how is this was like a dream it came to me it came to me during uh during one
of the like Film Production disruptions I think it was um the writers the writer strike or something like that I forget or might have been one before that anyway I like like it was one of those like middle of the night I need to write this down this is how we bring back scrapyard Wars we add a makeup and effects budget that's the only way to go back to reset the clock because like that's the problem with basically any media franchise is they always have to increase the stakes I and sorry I just I
saw I saw somebody and before we get too far off of just the makeup stuff bubbly char art said Luke is definitely obvious lus is actually a bit different my costume goes a little further than that yes um so it's actually okay yeah wait till he takes off his pants he'll see some real Prosthetics um any media franchise it's not fake eventually runs out of stakes to raise right sorry just Dad you went too early D we're going to  oh no sorry Luke you're you're talking  prosthesis I'll wait what we what were
we even talking about every media franchise eventually runs out of stakes to raise the Avengers save the town then they save the country then the world then the universe and then and then what oh I don't know the Multiverse and now there's even more multiverses or I don't know right because and then and then it sort of it sort of become so contrived that the stakes don't even feel real we're going to go into the quantum dimens who cares right so so you just you just kind of it loses relatability
right and that's I think that's what happened to Scrapyard Wars is we kept trying to come up with a new and interesting twist when what people fell in love with was a simple mono a mono who can build the best for a relatable realistic Budget on a fixed timeline and and and the and the shenanigans and H Jinks that just naturally arise from a situation like that and so it it just like came to me in the middle of the night well we just have to we just have to be new people we
re we reboot rather than try to continue so that that is what scrapyard Wars 9 or scrapyard Wars 2024 is is it's more of like a series reboot why did we ditch the number um because the number is kind of meaningless it's scrapyard Wars 2024 and then we'll probably change it in a month or two to Scrapyard Wars 9 so that when people are going through the playlist it makes more sense but as we're launching it like the title for this one is going to be this for probably about the first 20 minutes
because we want to try and get a little bit more momentum from like notification Watchers yeah and then we're going to change it after that and then there's another title that we're going to change it to probably a couple months after once the whole series is out it seems good try wise yeah we're trying to kind of kind of take advantage of that but um yeah a couple cool things don't worry no spoilers guys um scrapyard Wars is back though unless you unless you want to watch it um this is this is one of our
most beloved series ever uh it's back for a ninth run uh we're going live next week with the first uh with the first part on YouTube I don't remember exactly what day it will be but it is on float plane already and also a throwback we are bringing back early access on float plane for scrapyard Wars specifically it's not going to be a full week and I don't know that it's going to be completely consistent yeah but what I can promise you guys is that uh float plane is going
to be getting both access to Scrapyard Wars Episodes before they are available on YouTube and it's going to be getting some extras in fact there was a uh there was a Reddit post today someone caught an accidental momentary making something live and then unmaking it lie okay so you do know about this um so there was an extra piece of content that people saw the title but nothing else uh on float plane today if you're not familiar with float plane it's uh do you really watch wow anyway welcome welcome to W
show uh if you don't if you're not familiar with float plane uh it's our our video platform that has uh videos from great content creators like LTT and Tech quickie and short circuit and it's got lots of great exclusives that are not available anywhere else uh extras from our AMD uh and Intel Tech upgrades um this cool series called Closer Look where the writer is getting into a little bit more depth than we can really get into super cool in the YouTube video because something's you know something's
got to get cut um we've done Dan week and luk week where we focused in on some fan favorites and about you know their cars and their hobbies and their birds and cool stuff like that so there's there's literally are there literally hundreds of exclusive videos watch close to a thousand I think yeah so it's it's pretty awesome uh behind the design LTD scubby screw driver featuring The One and Only Kyle thet there's there's so much there's so much good stuff over there anyway scrapyard Wars sign up
Now's the Time to do it uh oh yeah right so we're going to talk I mean what are we talking about um airing on something something a whole later today later today there's going to be 70 minutes of additional exclusive content with much more coming each week today on float plane do you know about this for scrap a Wars apparently 70 minutes I mean I was talking basically continuously while I was in the makeup chair for 4 hours I don't know about you so that doesn't surprise me that much I
was I was sick for the whole thing so there was definitely times where I was recouping energy so that I could be more energetic for the camera next time so I definitely probably wasn't talking as much but I think I think uh I made sure there was some juice this time around we've partnered with the folks at Jawa and we'll be launching giveaways and other exciting bonuses throughout the run so stay tuned for more information on that their giveaway is going to start when the YouTube
release drops but in the meantime you can check them out and sign up for float plane at the links in the video  now what would you like to do next I guess we just keep going through we got to get rid of these articles so we can just start powering through should we do the thing on after dark let's do the thing on after dark what thing on after dark how do you keep forgetting about this oh oh oh oh it's not how do you keep forgetting about this I literally can't see it at all it's on my mind it's 
yeah I mean let's do it no no let's do it after dark really we're doing it after dark yeah yeah I'm going to string I guess after dark doesn't have to be just merg m y'all just got strong strong it can be whatever we want y'all got a strong yeah uh all right all right let's do a topic then what do we got record companies are suing Verizon and this is like two point this is a billions of dollars lawsuit here and they are suing Verizon for not shutting off Pirates internet service Universal Music Group
Warner music group and Sony Music are suing Verizon for 2.6 billion dollars in damages on the grounds that Verizon has profited from continuing to provide service to thousands of customers that are engaged in flagrant and repeat piracy the legal strength of this argument is currently unclear but it has been tested in another very similar case a few years ago these same record companies sued Cox Communications on similar grounds the court found that Cox was guilty of failing to stop privacy
privacy piracy however the damages were overturned on appeal because the record companies failed to prove that Cox directly profited from the infringement I.E Cox makes more money because it didn't punish its paying customers but it doesn't make more money from a customer who commits piracy than one who  this could be crushing the biggest the biggest sale of vpns ever yeah did I mention by the way Pia our partner private internet access hey hey Dan do we have a Pia Link in the video description uh if not
please make sure we do uh a a VPN is I just copy paste a VPN is absolutely not the Silver Bullet to your to your online privacy and security W oh we actually do yes good excellent it's down there but what it absolutely is is a way of keeping your ISP from snooping on exactly which ones and zeros are being download ulated to your drive and in what order so it is a great way to prevent uh something like this from impacting you in the future um what else is there for us to really say about this other than this
yeah sounds absolutely terrible for normies who don't know about vpns yeah MMO publisher says Intel is selling defective chips yeah alderon games says that it is switching its Intel 13th and 14th gen servers and we touched on this last week um when I hadn't watched the level one Tex video yet but we did talk about how Wendell from level one Tex um has been talking about how Intel's 13th and 14th gen chips are having some serious problems well alderon says that they are switching them out for AMD
following significant stability issues according to alderon their servers have had extremely high failure rates which is overwhelmingly due to errors from Intel chips and I can hear you already asking why the devil is alderon games using cor i7s and core i9s for servers that's not as crazy as you might think it's actually I I still I still while Intel and AMD have at times certainly and especially Nvidia have certainly put pressure on barebones chassis manufacturers and uh Solutions
providers um to steer their clients toward Zeon and epic and I don't know what is what's nvidia's branding even it's not Tesla anymore but whatever what's what's their branding for their GPS these H grid who who knows but but their Enterprise Solutions while they certainly steer them sometimes those Enterprise Solutions don't necessarily make the most sense and in the case of something like a game server where performance and value might be more meaningful to you than running ECC
memory for the utmost instability um it it could make sense to deploy um to deploy um just like one use of Game servers or even or even I think you can I think I've seen ones that are like more like four four in a one you or we oh we looked at oh man what was that cool one that we looked at from uh super micro it was about a year ago but it was a bunch of just like ryzen um in in little like like blades uh super cool anyway uh the point is that it is way more common than you would think to run desktop
chips so let's have a look at what the breakdown is here uh in aleron's testing the chips initially worked fine but later deteriorated failing at a rate of nearly 100% And you can see here which models seem to be the most likely to be affected although we don't know what exactly the mix is of their deployment so the ks and this is already something that has been touched on KS seem to be experiencing the worst failures the lower core count Lower clocked SKS seem to be impacted less
and according to level one Tex this looks like Hardware uh we talked about this last week about you know Intel could need to do a recall here if they can't figure out how to fix this good Lord what would this look like yeah have no idea I don't think in my time as a PC Enthusiast I have seen such a high CPUs are always Rock Solid like well here's the exception that proves the rule well no there's been bad stuff I thought copper mine was a huge disaster um was that Pentium 3 yeah that's what I'm
saying like in pretty much like that was before I was in high school that's 25 years ago it's been a decent assumption that your CPU is like not really the problem for a long time absolutely freaking wild man um I just yeah I have absolutely no idea what this would look like because you got to go A Step Beyond just uh you know oh well you know Intel takes the chips back right like that that's a recall right no what is what are they going to what are they going to issue people in
exchange like what are they going to give them now these are an inherent flaw there's there's a there's like okay okay like let's look at it from a couple of different angles they can't like recall the car replace the airbag and give you the car back yeah I like I've got my say I'm I'm an end user customer okay I I bought a motherboard from gigabyte and some crucial memory and a seic power supply I've got my computer here right and and I got this bad Intel chip and I need a I need a new one Intel here you
go you got my chip well now what they they send back a fixed one well no you you this is the the Intel's R&amp;D teams okay are working on CPUs that are coming out next year the year after and the year after that that gives you some idea of how long you're working on a chip before it ever sees the light of day just the the spin up time if you watched our Intel Fab tour the spin-up time from okay we've got the design finished and now at least in principle and now we need a physical
one in order to try to power it on is I forget if it was weeks or months but it's a long flipping time because all of the different steps that are required to manufacture a mod processor for Intel to fix this in Hardware they they would this is this is enormously costly they're going to have they would have to pull teams that are working on future products and get them essentially back on the CPU design of 13th and 14th gen and even if they did that yesterday it would be months before
they would have a single unit to ship to anyone and when you consider how much of their manufacturing capacity would have been used over the last couple of years to ship all the chips that they had it would be months or maybe even a year plus before they could actually manufacture enough of these bloody things in order to issue all the fixes so in the meantime imagine you are not a gamer who just bought one chip and put it in your computer and are kind of going where the devil's my chip now
imagine that you're a customer like the United States government or Dell your expectations are now completely different and there's a huge cost to you especially if you're someone like an oem like a Del or Lenova HP the cost to you of these systems that you have designed around this now defective  Monumental good luck Intel it's going to be rough yep Intel is currently working on a fix for the ETB bug it says contributed to the instability but there's no indication that the company
has a fix for the root problem says the last of our   cool I mean I guess yeah one option um is they can just keep sending you more of them as long as you're under warranty and then hope that everyone's warranty expires at some point and uh that this doesn't leave too bad of a stain on their brand I think it's a pretty big stain on the brand I think that's probably more realistic and the the stain on the brand to Consumers is not the one that I'm worried about if I'm Intel like yeah sure whatever um the
amount of cares for Consumer sales right now has never been that and like Gamers already mostly kind of hate them anyway so realistically what difference does it make um it's it's the brand it's the reputational damage with the Dells and the HPS and the and the large institutions that I'm really worried about because a big part of why Intel has uh managed to maintain the kind of for example server market share that they have is because you never get fired for buying Intel oof not because their performance
has necessarily been better there are other reasons um you know Intel makes Investments That AMD traditionally hasn't because they haven't had the resources for it in terms of deployments management and stuff like that but um a big part of it is you don't get fired for buying  might yeah um in other news PS portal still selling like Gang Busters so can I uh can I have a Linus was right moment I think you get it yeah I think you get the point you get the little token lonus was correct I don't know people are
still mad at me about it I'm sure they are recent sales figures indicate that the PlayStation portal is still going strong 8 months post launch it has even beat Sony's own projections to the point that it's the bestselling video game accessory in dollar sales in the US for 2024 so far I don't believe that yeah dollar sales 250 bucks controllers yeah but it's 250 bucks controllers that's two and a half controllers okay tell me this how many controllers did your friends have for 
consoles you're an adult right like I'm trying to yeah I'm trying to think a lot of console owners have one controller Luke yeah not anymore but you said I think you're referring to like before and there's so many options for controllers now not everybody buys a first party one SKS are different okay I sorry $200 sorry $200 that still seems kind of nuts I'm Canadian I don't know how much things cost what could One controller cost Luke $120 do it cost9 no no that was a banana
reference this is this is a side this is a side tangent development I remember now how frustrating is it as a Canadian how much more difficult it has gotten to just navigate to the American version of a web page drives me flipping crazy valve oh you're in Canada you must want this thing no I am making a video and I want to know how many bloody Freedom Units people have to spend in order to get it oh I see you manually navigated back to the American site that must have been a mistake no problem here's the
Canadian site for you again leave me alone Best Buy yeah I've had that problem with best says another VPN plug opportunity L not planned but there you go Pia uh Sony also appears to have worked out the supply chain issues that led to the portal recently running out of stock so that's good for them I guess uh in the past Sony has alluded to potentially adding cloud gaming functionality but there is currently uh no confirmation that that is the case so anyway let this be a lesson
sometimes and I didn't buy a PS portal no I don't even have a PlayStation 5 yeah but sometimes when you review a product it's helpful to put yourself in the mindset of someone who might be considering it in the first place so when we gave a positive review to the PS portal while also acknowledging and complaining about some of the things that bothered us about it like how locked down it was it was in the context of someone who cares about the PS portal not the context of someone who wants
another Vita because you aren't getting another Vita what you're getting is a portal and you can either like it or not I know like three people that have PlayStations they all have portals and they all like them the good news is that even in spite of the haters we won the battle for PS portal we are the number one video for the PS portal got I think there is one that has more views W those are two really similar thumbnails this these two right here oh yeah look at that wow oh
that's both from the same person oh that would explain it that's very reasonable yeah there you go this is cute I actually don't necessarily like browse other people's thumbnails that often oh game ranks is great yeah there's not really a lot of uh there's not really a lot of Buzz around ah yes yes this one uh this one was like a month earlier than us it's a really good video and it was um it was that video actually that was part of our conversation about why we should not accept Sony's sponsorship
for the PS portal so Sony for this was for the first time ever I don't think they'd ever offered to sponsor us before but maybe they did their research and knew that I was an advocate for and I was an Enthusiast about remote game streaming um and they they reached out to us and um part of the conversation was hey we think this could be a pretty controversial product among our audience and our take is going to be positive in a way that some of them might get mad about we certainly nailed that one um
and so if we if we take the money and say hey it's the same video we would have made anyway they might not believe us um and considering how many people thought the video was sponsored even though it wasn't I guess we kind of nailed that but another part of it was that we were getting it too late for like a sponsored overview to be of any value yeah because of this video makes sense this video was so good that we were like okay in order for us to really add anything to the conversation we're
going to have to get you just got called out deeper into the nuts and bolts oh who' I get called out by whiskey nerd 88 who's whiskey nerd 88 they sponsored your setup in a storage container that's true got them I blocked that video and that was um okay so working with companies like Sony can be very complicated so that was Sony's uh home audio SLC consumer Electronics division which as far as I can tell operates like a completely different company we um you know you know how that
video came out shortly before the launch of the PlayStation 5 oh man this is all this is all coming back to me now it that video was shot before the PS5 came out but I believe it was released after the PS5 came out and it has a PS4 in it oh and we tried to get them to delay it so that we could like but that division like didn't care whatever didn't care and just wanted their thing out so yeah I forgot but the the what I said about Sony was still true as long as we mean that part of Sony ah nice I like the
Sony PlayStation all right has never has never engaged with us sponsored wise um Mo says it's still Sony come on it can't be that much of a different company they ultimately answer to the same top level higher ups you are so wrong yeah it's actually kind of nuts yeah you're it's you it Samsung makes tanks yeah there you go um yeah it's yeah you you have yeah you got you have no idea if I remember correctly Samsung makes like tanks and toilets and insurance I guarantee you I
guarantee you that a worker on the line of yamaha's piano division doesn't give two shits what is going on in the freaking motorbike division yeah it's just some these companies you guys are unfathomably large like it's it's always funny to me to hear us described as a large company occasionally this this topic of conversation comes up whether it's in the comments or Reddit or chat or whatever else we are nothing we are actually nothing we are what what does that work out to we are 100 people so we
are are one we are we're 0. one of a Sony is that is that right am I doing the math right uh it sounds right yeah no we're 0.1 we are 0.1 of a Sony we have 100 people don't we have slightly more than that slightly more but they also have slightly more "than 100,000 so I think we're doing okay" sure and that was back in 2023 so if they hired they might have more than "that now yeah yeah 1,000th the size" um anyway congratulations on your PS portal success uh Sony uh thanks for
thanks for reaching out about the sponsorship we actually would have loved to work together with you on it uh it just might have been better if we did it earlier so that it was more of like hey Sony sponsored this it's a preview it's all their talking points anyway and we wouldn't have had to worry about our like sponsored preview going up against a full review that I forget what the channel name was again but they did a really great job of and we had to really dig deep to add to the
conversation sorry I I think this uh might really help your point so I'm going to bring it up uh apparently Sony  before no way no way the only company to own a major music Major computer manufacturer major electronic business son is has been insulted by its own trade associations and has even sued a company that Sony itself had invested in oh my goodness um cool that's hilarious that's  amazing YouTube YouTube pulls the rug out from Firearms content creators I I'm sure you have some
thoughts about this so I'm going to do the read and then you're going to tell me what you think sure Google has updated its Community guidelines regarding the depiction of firearms when this was announced earlier this month Google said that starting July 18th it would prohibit videos demonstrating how to remove safety devices from firearms and age restricting videos showing automatic weapons or homemade Firearms however according to Greg kinman who runs the popular gun enthusiast channel hickcock 45
his YouTube rep says that a previous ban on content selling Firearms has been expanded to any content sponsored by the Firearms industry meaning that he has had to take down a large number of videos from his back catalog in order to avoid a channel strike many if not most popular gun content channels have some form of relationship with the Firearms industry including companies providing ammo and Sample firearms for testing as  ammo is really expensive that type of partnership is really common in this
space uh also a lot of uh Firearms YouTubers are almost exclusively sponsored by companies in the firearm industry um especially there's there's one I don't remember the name of it it's like a Gunsmithing company or University or something soran desert Institute I believe it is um they sponsor like a bunch of stuff I'm sure that is still included um in this because I'm sure a Gunsmithing University is considered as in the Firearms industry well that yeah that and if they're talk if they're um
gating depictions of homemade Firearms I'm certain any kind of well smithing of anything is it would just be a sponsor so they don't show it no I understand I just mean clearly they have clearly they  crosshairs I didn't I didn't see where that was going I knew you pun of sorts but I didn't I didn't see no notes yeah this is going to be very tough the you YouTube has come for firearms creators on YouTube many times um changing what type of content they can have changing
the size of the magazines changing can you show full auto or not can you show bump firing or not all of these different rules over the years have expanded expand expanded sped banded many many many times I don't think they've ever come for their monetization before I think this is the first time that they've gone for their monetization um what are they supposed to do it really feels like YouTube doesn't want them um but like where are they supposed to go like it's not it's not like there
haven't been attempts to make Firearms tube yeah um and and it's not like this is the first time that a Firearms creator has looked at the situation on YouTube especially with respect to monetizing their content and gone wow this is this is untenable I mean we we have one actually really great uh firearm Creator on slow plane yeah um but it seems like this is a major escalation Two Fire creators on FL plane but oh who' I forget about uh the TGC oh sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry it's
okay the gun Collective that's right um but this seems this seems like a major escalation yeah and people are shouting float plan Flo CH which like I appreciate it but we're not YouTube we're not a YouTube competitor it's not we never have been and it's it's not the same thing people seem really confused about what float plane is I would say it's more of a patreon competitor but with actual like video patreon has video I would like I would like to I think our video is better but patreon does have
video we're I I say that we're video focused sure that's a nice way of putting it yeah yeah um but yeah there there's been YouTube's Monopoly effectively nobody can really compete with them and if you make a people are saying that a bunch of creators just launched one called pepperbox dotv I wish them the best of luck I don't think it's going to work because they're going to discover it's really hard yeah it's it's really hard it's really expensive and people come to YouTube for a variety
of things not usually just one thing um and that's it's the discoverability of YouTube that allows it to hit that critical mass that makes ad supported tenable so um Hickok posted an update um and it apparently only prevents from linking to their sites not the actual sponsorships which is going to hurt those sponsorships a lot yeah it'll hurt um okay that's less bad than that is definitely less bad but that kills the tracking but like and the other thing too is I mean you remember how much we
freaked out back when YouTube seemed like they were you remember this right before we moved to this office YouTube sent out that deck oh yeah where they where they were where they were telegraphing a move where they were going to crack down on third party sponsorships all of them this was terrifying yeah this was really scary and so I I can 100% relate to what Firearms creators are feeling even if they're still allowed to accept sponsorships because the rules back then were that basically it looked like
someone at YouTube had decided they wanted a piece of the direct sponsorships that were happening to YouTubers so so they put these draft this proposal Draft rules I don't know what to call it but essentially I got this deck that laid out what the restrictions were going to be on thirdparty sponsorships we weren't going to be allowed to show logos we um weren't going to be allowed to have link backs um we or if we wanted to have those things the sponsor through YouTube had to buy out like complete the
complete inventory of either that video or the channel during some period of time like essentially they were inserting themselves between creators and their direct sponsors the whole thing ultimately went nowhere but it was the Tipping factor for me that made me sign with vessel so that was the precursor essentially to float plane that was run by um uh Jason Kroy or something like that I forget his last name but he's like a Silicon Valley investor Mig kind of guy uh killar kilmar k
yeah Kyler Jason Kyler I think um anyway that was that was the Tipping Point for me that made me go holy crap um no sponsor is going to want to pay for a sponsorship where I can't put their logo or a freaking link how am I going to deal with this uh how am I going to monetize my bloody content and that was what made us go to um that was what made us go to vessel where they offered us uh an upfront payout because they were trying to court creators and bring them onto their platform to do Early Access access
and um that that actually paid for a sizable portion of the of the um the renovation that we did here the tenant Improvement that we did in this building so it's a bunch of ancient lmg history but the lore yeah exactly but anyway the point is that I 100% relate to what these folks are feeling right now and I I I wish I had a solution for you but I I think that building a platform is going to be really challenging because what makes ad supported work is volume and we've seen attempts in the
past good attempts from smart people that didn't work out because YouTube is impossible to compete with you can't build that kind of volume up and the other two major models right there's the all you can eat model like like a Netflix uh where you you pay a monthly subscription and then you you watch what you want I've I've never seen that work either because on something like a Netflix it works because you've got hundreds of content pieces right that Millions hundreds of millions of people
are watching so you've got this extremely high concentration of interest in the content the challenge that happens when you try to build like that but YouTube is you've got hundreds of thousands of pieces of content and then you've got on average Maybe dozens of people watching each one so the hosting costs go way way up also people's perception of that kind of content tends to be lower people will pay more for movies in a lot ofes platforms that are succeeding but every single example that
they're giving are platforms that are not free to access we're talking about free to access platforms any any competition out there including float plane that is not free to access is not comp beting with YouTube it's not happening YouTube is free to access it's a completely different Ball Game Y your your view counts your user counts everything are going to be astronomical on a free to access platform compared to um a not free to access platform someone said Tik Tok Tik Tok is not the same thing um but
it's a closer competitor than something like a flow plane or some of the other examples that people have been putting out there um and yeah it comes from an mind-bogglingly enormous Chinese conglomerate that's what you need in order to compete yeah and and like the thing you got to understand is like in the Creator space um there are platforms that have an all you can eat model but what they also have is supplemental revenue streams that are not simply people directly paying for that platform
directly watching those videos and sustainably operating that way it's not that simple um as for the final model which is like the more patreon like model which is what we use on float plane where you pay a Creator directly the advantage is that it makes it sustainable for the platform holder we could run float plane forever because people are paying anywhere from the ogs who pay $3 to our I'm and I'm so grateful for these folks to are LTT supporter plus contributors who pay $10
a month or $100 a year people are paying a substantial amount of money that goes directly to the Creator so you can have a couple 100 uh or you know optimistically you know thousands or in our case tens of thousands of people contributing there and it really moves the needle and and and and pays staff and pays to keep the lights on um but unless people are contributing those significant amounts of money it it it doesn't it doesn't actually make that big of a of a difference right like if it's if it's
less than you know a few dollars times you know 100 people like think about it right like if you're if you're paying five bucks and you're watching 10 different creators um each of them at most is getting 50 cents a month but also the platform needs to be paid for so so these numbers start to get vanishingly small uh the more people they're split across so that's why that patreon model works that's why we can sustain the site um so I really wish them luck and I want them to succeed
like yeah go for it and the good news is building a video platform today is a lot easier than it was when way easier well there's the and I mean we talked about this back in the day I don't remember how the math works out but it's like I'm sure you've heard me say this quote I think it's like every three years things are three times easier to make when it comes to stuff on the internet I think this is a conversation we had back in the day about how like we're we're starting this now it's easier than it
would have been 3 years ago but it's three times harder than it will be in 3 years whatever it's been a long time since we started Flo plane starting from scratch now it would be a joke compared to what we originally had to do um we'd also know to not do certain things like streaming oh but that's okay um so yeah I don't know it's way easier now it's also expensive and really annoying and takes expensive employees and stuff like that so it's a tough undertaking uh Bambi on float plane asks how long was
float plane in the red for uh float plane was never in the red you guys um incredibly contributed to us right from the outset when all we had was a rudimentary file download on the LTT Forum um I also want to make sure to shout out the early members of our team um like Alexandra uh who legendary Name instrumental in keeping the platform up and running on a shoestring budget uh we  now it was really desperate times it was a really scary time uh vessel was a significant portion of our Revenue first
like payment if I remember correctly was a thank you monitor I think we I think we shipped him a monitor um he was a he was a that's amazing he started as a volunteer on the Forum we were a much smaller company then I would just like 10 people or something I would like to make it extremely clear that we take very principled stance these days on like compens speaking of which Dan yes send me a bloody invoice uh yeah sorry D just pay the invoice that I sent you I'm not going to pay that
one okay need to pay no Dan Dan did I have service levels Dan did some contract work for me uh to help me with my sister's Memorial and I appreciated Dan helping with that because it was a lot easier for me to have I actually pulled in Brandon Brandon Lee it was a lot easier for me to have people that I was familiar with as the video crew um that I was I mean I wasn't comfortable talking at all but that I would feel more comfortable with than having strangers there that I have to
coordinate with anyway the point is that I told them explicitly because this is this is one of our core principles that people should be paid for their expertise and they should be paid for their work I told both of them I do not want to discount I'm asking you guys as a friend not because I believe friends should get discounts but because I believe friends should compensate each other correctly okay and I told them to both to Bill me properly one of them managed to follow my simple instructions at a
time when I really don't want to be following up with people about this kind of and one of them didn't so this is why I'm upset and it's been sitting in my inbox for a while and I don't like particularly know how to discuss it with you I guess we're doing it live yeah cuz I thought you trusted me to understand your wishes and Bill accordingly I believe that you spent more than 2 and 1 half hours on that pre-production is included in my price for that type of uh service work I I
reject your rate then for and I substitute my own all right well I mean what do you want the pre-production rate with own equipment and travel time let me put it let me put it this way let me put it this way yeah absolutely you should include travel time no no time the time should be build out per hour and the travel it's my rate card well I don't like it okay fine jeez all right thank you Dan I will I will give you the uh the other rate card give me give me the you rate card then all right
fine all right okay thank you by the way this guy he's too fair I no I would like to tell you I appreciated I appreciated your help um and it was very it meant a lot to me and I it was an honor to be able to be there and to be trusted to be there well I appreciate you um send a proper Bill okay what were we talking I feel like you guys need to handshake or something no that's fine I'm Misty no it's okay Misty yeah go back to merch messages what were we talking about back to the
we we were talking about the Forum and F being hard to start up and stuff I have a story about AJ that I that I love uh when I hir AJ so that we we could stop paying him in monitors monitor I don't think we sent him more than one yeah I think we one um when when when I hired AJ that was the first person that I had like completely solo hired hold on before you tell your story I just want to say it was a big sort of glow up moment for me when we could bid adue to barter deals and like
paying people in gpus yeah and and monitors and and you know whatever else like like for me it's the point of Pride that we can pay people yeah uh money that we worked hard to get there so that's that's that's why this means so much to me anyway carry on yeah I mean we didn't at the very beginning of the flow plane project we didn't know what we were going to do with it and then AJ really made it a thing that we could actually really do professionally and then that's when we were like oh okay
well I guess we should like hire people cuz like we didn't we didn't know that we were going to make it a thing at first we had no idea it wasn't even called Flo plane it was called Rip vessel when AJ joined it was it was mostly a joke we were just trying to like do something um well we needed we we was we were trying to do something we needed we needed to do something to do something yeah um so when I when I hired him cuz I had like been a part of hiring groups for hiring other people like
there would be like two or three of us that would work on hiring a person or whatever I'd been a part of that but I had never solded one before yeah so when I hired him I I I remember I realized like it was kind of weird that he had never talk to Aon do you you know this story now do you know what I'm talking about I have a vague familiarity with this I so I talking about his onboarding I called yeah I called AJ and was like I think we were talking about something then I was
like hey you should talk to ion by the way and he was like okay uh and then I just handed my phone to ionne and was like here this is AJ I just hired him and she was like hi probably one of the most awkward conversations I've overheard like ever neither of them knew what to say at all the hiring was already done there was no interviewing the needed to happen or anything she eventually had the phone back and I was just like well I'm sorry that was really awkward it was completely my fault it
wasn't either of their fault at all um and it wasn't because we were like trying to do a bad job we yeah I just never done it before and I was like I mean it's it's at that point in time it would have been pretty weird to like join the company and not talk to it turns out you're not born knowing how to do things and it's not because in bad faith we you know tried to screw things up it's because we just were new at this right yeah cuz like I it it was always like we've talked about this a bunch of
times Ivon always did a huge amount at the company but she was very behind the scenes so a lot of people didn't know so like he was going to need to interface with her a lot yeah so like I wanted them to touch base but then it was just it wasn't the right time and it was the worst possible intro anyways um yeah what do we got left I think we're supposed to do sponsors real quick here why don't WEP into that the show is brought to you today by vessie you might have wasted lots of money on useless stuff like

to throw your party if you don't do it for yourself but I I don't know I always just like I don't know I just stopped I don't like gifts giving and so if I don't throw a birthday party no one will give me a gift and then I won't have to give them one I also don't get invited to anyone's birthday parties though so I guess that's my social isolation strategy right there you this too can be yours I yeah I genuinely can't remember the last time I like had a birthday party yeah that's how you know you're
old yeah pretty got him okay merch messages Dan hit me oh wait not that you shouldn't do them and I actually enjoy going to other people's before we do it Luke is going to pick a random number between two and seven ah but I oh did you move the the one that I picked before yeah I deleted the row smart four you I can't tell him it's not random technically random could be the same number every time but like really what okay oh my god well I okay uh what is it it is 82% off short circuit sweatpants
whoa they are going to be $11 what absolutely everything must go however Absolut everything isn't really that much I think we've only got about 100 units so this is just one of those what the heck blow it away uh right off um do it yeah I wouldn't wait much for this okay um where are they I'm having a hard time today finding our stuff they're they're on the site somewhere cuz when I go to when I go to pants bottoms they're not like pants they're they're sweat pants yeah they're pant
well I don't know sweat pants don't worry about it there's other sweatpants in the sweat in the pants section yeah I can't find them either I'm sure someone will someone will find them they'll buy them um all right yeah we we have some work to do we know but oh are they not on the store and this is like found stock oh that might be it actually that makes sense that actually makes a ton of sense all right Dan's going to hit us with one but I'm going to run to the washroom real
quick oh this is perfect this one's for Luke anyway perfect how was Final Fantasy 6 coming along oh I already answered this uh what I've had a very busy professional life that's C out excuse you suck why do you hate float plane is it CU they all use Firefox I use Firefox now were you there for that conversation yeah probably all right moving on Firefox for I got another one for okay fine uh how much do birds factor into your diet our kakatu likes eating everything I eat and I find
myself eating more fruit and veggies because of it so I can share I joke she is my diet Bird that's good that's adorable and also cute not at all because my birds don't eat anything that I eat um I think budgies are more skittish than you say coatu I think so yeah are more skidish than that they're sold out already wow I mean $111 sweatpants yeah that's not surprising um yeah but they don't they don't eat anything that I I I will say however that they they our our kitchen
is like right by where our our birds are so we can't cook well we could we don't really want to cook while they're out um or not covered up at the very least because of if we're cooking stove top or something fume smoke whatever um so uh there's more meal prep going on than there has been in the past I guess that has affected the diet a little bit Yeah okay let's see what else got do for look I see um he LDL I'm a Digi Key software engineer who was inspired to get into computer
science because of your videos awesome if Luke couldn't have Birds what would he have instead uh my my house um my house grew  dog um my my mom was a dog groomer and she ran the dog groming shop out of our garage um so there was dogs around all the time and we had dogs of our own and my mom would would train our dogs really really well and then bring them to dog shows and all the kind of stuff we had a great day and growing up so dogs always been a big part of my life and I want a
dog but after dog sitting someone else's dog uh I have no desire to have a dog in an apartment I want a yard it's very difficult to afford so I don't know um but one day I'll get a dog but only when I have a yard I will not get a dog before I have a yard dogs in apartments don't make sense to me personally it's the work for me yeah I mean it's way more work if you're in an apartment and imagine like imagine you have a little puppy and you're trying to potty train the little puppy oh it needs to go to
the washroom I'm going to put it outside in a few minutes I guess CU I have to get out of my apartment building like what the heck I don't know yeah it's pretty challenging I mean there there are definitely Solutions um also properly exercising the size and breed of dogs that I would probably end up wanting in an apartment yeah you got to remember he's going to be a big dog guy yeah um so I'm I will I will not have a life ever cuz I'll have to be walking the dog 100% of the time if when I'm
away at work and stuff it's just stuck it's like okay I don't know so yeah I I will not get a dog until I have somewhere that it can play no Dan's messaging me um Dan yeah what do you what do you want Dan whatever how did you even know it was him it was him how did you know that um I signal with my phone oh I don't know Dan you can um you guys can just curate a little bit more but yeah do do you want food like should we do food during after dark I know some people hate it when we eat but we have
we have um we have mute buttons now so you can only hear me sometimes and W we have close to a thousand merch messages yeah maybe we should do food I've only got 22 in incoming yeah oh and there's not that many curated you guys can  I muted my mic shots fired he said something into a muted mic that was spicy he said you guys suck at merch messages pretty much to be completely honest that's basically what he said I think it's because people are just like buying things right normally people buy
stuff on the WAN show because they have a question that they want to ask it's very pointed and directed that's true that's true a lot of them have been like yay thank you for things ha uh you know thanks for the cheap stuff cuz realistically we're going to get to a small fraction of them but I'm super down to I'm super down to get some food I'm really hungry I don't know about you guys but I did not really get a chance I um we have uh we we have a food delivery for the office on um two days a week and
one of the days is Friday and the thing that I ordered today was like a like a vegetarian Kebab thing and I was like this is delicious for I don't know was this 23 calories like I'm I'm so hungry right now you've also been you've been working out more though uh yes yeah my boobies are even bigger than last week oh yeah not by much but a little bit um so yeah if you if you actually I can legitimately tell I hadn't looked but you can see it poopies You' got some check cuz you
you've got the the dip here it's visible anyway you've cleavage the fashion team's going to be so mad cuz like when my body ch ches materially it throws off like their measurements for like clothing development for the stuff that I I'm trying on and stuff anyway that's pretty funny yeah so um what what do you guys want to eat though I don't know dude delivery is tough getting something that's like worth the calories from delivery is hard well wait does it have to be delivery if we don't have that
many incoming is chewy working like I believe chewy still here and I'm almost dead incoming I know it's not like technically his job but it wouldn't necessarily have to be delivery um I don't even know if that helps it might it probably does I'm sure it does I just I don't know if you guys pick a place I I'll be able to find okay um pad tie you said pad tie you got me thinking about pad tie I'm down for pad tie fighting phone scams with AI this is actually a leftover from last week that
we didn't get to but it's pretty cool Australian researchers have created an AI chatbot system that is designed to waste scammers time and resources as well as study them the system is called a after the Greek goddess of deception it can take on a range of personas with different ages genders and accents and is designed to keep scam callers on the phone as long as possible it's at least partially inspired by older scam baiting chat Bots like Lenny a relatively simple system created in 2011 that cycled
through several pre-recorded lines pretending to be a forgetful and lonely old man until the scammer hung up in frustration aete is now in use among telecom companies in Australia who have diverted around 2 billion I mean I know I get a lot of scam calls but like think everybody is the sheer volume of this is incredible have diverted around two billion likely scam calls to the system which is also collecting information on tactics and Trends in scams which are typically run by large criminal
organizations authorities are hoping to use this information to Warn and protect potential future victims the op team likewise trials different strategies for keeping the scammers on the call as long as possible and refines its output based on that information of course the scammers are going to increase their volume by moving to AI callers and we're going to have AIS talking to AIS so we have fake take over the world now it's like fake phone call Theory oh my gosh all the phone calls are just
robots I actually don't know where my pad tie is from uh yeah only Vance would know I I literally don't know where he gets it the first thing I thought this man sorry I thought this man has an executive assistant I will ask him where he gets linus' food that he likes I know how this works I know where my chicken comes from langly Vietnamese cuisine oh love it that's the best oh I mean I'm I'd be down for that too but I'm also down for that Pat are they open oh I don't know I
don't know what their hours are I will check all right do you want to hit uh or we should do more topics no you know what we should do if we're if we're stalling for time they closing 10 minutes don't do that that's oh yeah don't do that that's mean they would totally do it for us would they actually specifically opened for us once without us realizing yeah I felt so bad yeah I was pretty I'm pretty sure I was there and yeah I agree yeah uh I was like I would not have asked you guys to do this
and they were like no no no it's our pleasure like people from here eat there all the time like they know who all of us are but I think they were taking time off cuz they had like family in town and we didn't realize that they were closed and we like called The Reserve or something yeah I terrible yeah let's um should we do it if you're in town it's an amazing place yes okay we're moving to wow after dark Dan do you want to do it oh wait yeah yeah yeah what okay yeah sure yeah tops
left I don't think so right no I think we're good on topics damn I mean we can talk about someone who put the wow on the Jumbotron yeah this is great that's awesome that's super cool yeah maybe full screen it next time but you know you're doing really good yeah yeah just D teasing obviously sure you leave the mouse over the uh transport bar also also somebody somebody flagged this for us but I wasn't really I haven't looked into it at all apparently Nvidia just open sourced their driver what
what like Linux no I I I I I I read the text really they open source their I don't know I don't know I don't know hold on two days ago uh sure whatever transitions fully towards open source GPU kernel modules uh this this seems this seems like a huge deal um transitioning fully to open source GPU kernel modules is The Right Move we're making the change in the upcoming r560 driver release whoa I mean awesome how did I not heard about this I mean it was this was two days ago the
sky would be yeah two days ago I mean remember there's been a lot going on like in the in the tech world so yeah I guess um uh crowd strike really really had that pop up yeah super super exciting though there's not a ton of coverage about this that's weird this seems really cool is it not cool for some reason there's only uh like I I I looked on YouTube Nvidia open source driver there's one video from 2 hours ago and everything else is from like months or years ago there's not a lot of
coverage huh there's like two comments on this blog post yeah like what it's not the whole  I don't know well let's uh let's let's hope that this is just another step towards being more Linux and open source friendly from Nvidia agreed I don't think we have time to like properly write and whatnot that topic but yep hopefully it's good okay after dark Dan you got to do the thing we have different colors for after dark now right oh yeah that's right oh oh yeah you already did that thing that's
okay I guess I also need the other thing sure if you just uh prepare yourself I'll be over there yeah you have a thing to put on I do yeah uh I don't know where it is okay it's after dark on the floor right there or do you have it okay okay Dan's got everything yeah we've got a thing or he does I'll tell the story uh while we kind of get set up for this um once upon a time I actually forget the full context but once upon a time dbrand uh made an offer to sponsor me to dye my hair back to the
blonde color that you see in this picture right here um oh right I filmed a short circuit earlier this week where um I was given this letter dearest Mr Sebastian they really did send me a letter on February 10th 2024 a thread was published on your subreddit titled let oh that's what happened let's get D Brand's attention to sponsor Linus to die hair blonde again over the past 159 days we have indeed been trying to get your attention emails texts and DMS have been met with
non-responsive evasion not good we even went so far as to purchase the domain blond lin.com in both American and Canadian spellings during last Friday's W show at precisely 23 minutes and 20 seconds you stated dbrand wanted to bring the blonde hair back I thought they were going to sponsor me to diet again on the show or something I'm down debrand come at me it's going to be a big bag of money or I'm not doing it though today your evasive maneuvers will be ineffective before we Fork over a big bag of money
we'd like to engage in the age-old tradition of try before you buy inside this box you will find hair bleach grab that grab the hair bleach and turn the box around and look at it yes I've seen it I saw this on short circuit uh here I'll get you guys a better look at it yep that's um that's a picture all right that is is the thing that exists um use it to dye a small portion of your hair right now on camera if we like what we see you'll get your bag of money so Luke didn't notice this until you guys 
but Jake bellance who I trusted during the short circuit okay I mixed up the bleach and I was like okay I can't see what I'm doing right now it's not like I have a mirror go ahead and die okay according to the instructions a small portion of my hair they did this huge spot put some  the Yvonne cried from laughing okay but she she actually like real tears was crying when she saw this she was like oh my God you're going You're it looks like a bald spot like it so incredibly worse
than just doing the whole thing yeah yeah yeah so so so basically um what I said after that was Belle let this let the business team know okay get in touch with dbrand they are they are sponsoring the W show tomorrow like this is not this cannot this cannot stand I can't have this for an extended period of time um so anyway I uh C is saying that Belle did it on purpose and dbrand bribed him which honestly I believe that that would make sense I would not be surprised if
that was true so anyway what we're going what we're going to do now is we are going to finish the job and I I don't know Luke are you going to do the honor have you ever have you ever hair dyed before never you have never hair dyed before in the last what two months if I do this I will have cut someone's hair and dyed someone's hair so this is getting a for the first time both yes oh this is becoming a thing might have been a small spoiler oh well they don't know who's yeah and they don't know they
don't know what video it might have been for yeah um okay well I I'm not going to expect you to know how to do this but I'm going to I'm going to help so yeah right so I'm going to help so basically you take this thing right here which is the developer cream okay hey it's cream for me and then yeah like you develop anything that's true okay then you dump that powder in it hold on let me just double check into this yeah into into that uh container yes why wouldn't they
just do that hand uh well because it has to react Luke I don't know dang it uh okay this is the French side which I could read but is a lot of work uh carefully pour the entire packet yes screw the flat cap onto the developer cream bottle and Shake okay so then you'll put this on and then shake it okay Shake it Like It's Your Money Maker in the meantime I'm going to give the people another lightning deal oh no pick a number uh do we have other gloves are those other gloves are these do we only
have one size of gloves yeah we only have one size of gloves show off I'll  I'll be back in a can you really not get okay this is hilarious those are other those are other gloves these are not the same this is hilarious look at my hands  like no I think this is the same size glove no it's not it just it just looks Gigantic on my hand no they're actually different gloves let's see got these can you get your hand in it yeah well more easily I can go get I really do think
they're the same gloves Luke they're not going on they're not going on Luke why are you forcing this you're being so weird about it I I do this with gloves all the time this is how I have to put these types of gloves on none of them just go on Luke they are the same gloves they're not they're not look dude look dude the first pair of gloves Luke it comes with one pair of gloves no he pulled these out of a package I know no he pulled these out of a box of gloves these are different gloves I'm not look
okay yeah yeah yeah different you're you're right you're right okay I thought they were the gloves that came with the one that I opened on set for short circuit yeah no and it was just the other the pair from that and the pair from this cuz I didn't has a box of gloves just they just why does Dan just have a box of gloves lying around are  boxer and he likes boxing gloves my goodness blow into the glove it makes it easier just a packaging Enthusiast um I yeah I don't that's not going to make
a difference now he's just pre- moistened it before his hands I felt that too it's just going to stick it's really not going yeah I can so I I think I could get my hand in this one but it's already ripping so I I would kind of destroy it so maybe if he has bigger ones that' be great if not I'll make it work all right uh give me a number between two and  it you have to give me number this is your choice four there's free oh my God you you know you have free will right um
yeah which is why I'm picking four why you got to pick this kind of stuff it's random it's it's random that I pick four every time and true Randomness will show weird patterns sometimes because it is actually random it's not random everything is predetermined okay we don't have every size of this but we have mystery sweatpants we've got about 150 of them  $11 I what the I don't know man I it's a it's the write off sale yeah but like it's the inventory management sale I mean look it it is it is it is
challenging right when you've got I got you okay come on I can't actually like you don't okay this is wait what you only got one of these no there's two  tinan these aren't appropriate gloves I'm starting to wonder if anyone who works here is actually on my team f they do fit they fit great that's all we had they would probably fit there were out of the large n trials oh okay so I'll just have to try to make cuz these I can't there's no dexterity  dexterity is that what you said no that
is not what I said why do you got to  what is there another one that match he put all his points in dexterity oh my  strength but if you ask him to make a low strength repetitive movement many times he's really good at  party okay wait I'm making this one work I need the other glove though why are you doing it under the table it felt easier I don't know don't all you're doing is making everyone watching you more uncomfortable I'm uncomfortable I got it I got it is there another one of this sir Linus I think
the Box only came with one of those no no no no no no no there should have been two well what's that second other glove you've got there these are the other on oh no Belle used the other one oh this isn't a new pack this is this is I I used only a little bit of it you know waste not want not so this is the original pack that they said do I only need one yeah I mean sure go ahead go ahead and dump the thing okay so I put this package thingy in this thingy and then I shake it oh my
God that deal is going so fast we have a bunch of yeah I wonder why we have a bunch of Smalls left if you're a small go for it go for it and don't forget it's free shipping on orders over $1100 free shipping guys always complain about shipping and then I'm like whoa free shipping and you're like I don't know maybe no go for it do it do it uh Dan do you want to hit with the merch message in the meantime while Luke figures out how yeah that little foray cost me 75 potentials um let's I hate you I hate
you so much I had it down to five uh Hey much messages per minute right now is at 14 I haven't done the calculation let me stall for time and do that so we've been live for 4 hours and 16 minutes there's a calculator isn't there no I'm my made one uh what there's a no there's a running one it's built into the thing no no but it doesn't do per second so we've been live for over 4 hours and 15 minutes and been doing one every 15  time well aren't you getting help nice yeah yeah Che we I yeah uh hey lldd uh
what's what is it what what is it with time that you have grown to enjoy the most out of each other oh wow now you're you're now you guys are just fishing for the 20-minute merch messages what a tryhard merch message uh um in all seriousness though um I don't know Luke just gets it I don't have to explain things to Luke but if I feel like talking for a long time because I don't know the sound of my own voice amuses me or because that's just something that I needed to get out uh
you know he'll listen anyway even though realistically he probably knew what I was going to say there's definitely stuff I can say to Luke that I can't say to almost anyone else like I would say anything to Ivonne she's S Plus tier but then Luke is like is like s tier plus if that makes sense cuz he's cuz he's s tier plus things that I could tell Ivonne but she just wouldn't  about oh I spilled I was doing so good until then oh wow you really made a mess darn it maybe you should have stared
instead of touching it wow he got all the scare stare points W um and like there's things that Ivonne would give me a courtesy chuckle for but that like you know I can indulge my inner complete toddler and and Luke will reinforce my behavior you know so yeah I mean it's it's kind of like it's kind of like asking someone you know like what have you grown to enjoy about having a friend like I don't really have a ton of adult friends um like I joke about how I have none and
it's funniest because I'm saying that in front of the one person whose feelings would be most hurt by me saying I don't have any friends um but I I genuinely have very few I don't have I don't have time for um did you spill no I just realized what that what I'm doing it's okay you're  you were trying to saying something about toddler jokes there you   giver oh my goodness friends friends in  Mar oh no um how much do I have the shake I think you're good okay he'll tell you when it stop yeah you want put
this thing back on it um I don't know  yet okay okay get the towel uh so you  now no you can't use my shower my mom's coming over later get out now you take no no you don't put that on yet you got to put this um this is the hyper lightening cream the coloring um it's just bleached man it's uh yeah this is how much uh all of it oh what yeah do it you coward I think are you only supposed to put in part of it uh uh oh yeah oh yeah all of it squeeze the contents in and then uh
shake until the mixture is rich and creamy that's actually in here all right rich and  um what are we talking about I don't I think this was a merch oh yeah what have you grown to enjoy the most out of each other well he enjoys fondling I guess Luke are you a cuddler uh don't answer that it's such a manageable size I can't actually kind of answer that to a certain degree without being that weird uh I sweat a lot so like I don't actually like it that much M um unless it's like cold but it's rarely
cold M yeah that's fair okay moving on uh Hey alius Luc and Dan has anyone from the Canadian government or military ever approached you about collaboration to help with recruiting Tech focused people would you be interested the Canadian military reached out to us once about sponsoring something or maybe it was like doing a tour of one of our decrepit military things something I I I forget what exactly it was okay I I make fun of the Canadian military because realistically everyone does uh but why
would you make fun of our boat but we Steve and Dave in the canoe will be very upset yeah we uh we we we we upgraded the we upgraded the engines um we now have huskys running on the on the hamster wheels inside instead of actual hamsters um yeah I mean we we we have some we have some Hardware that would actually make for a pretty cool video uh but I I don't remember why it just it never really worked out but yeah potentially I don't know that I necessarily want to be a mouthpiece for military
recruitment um like like a like a hard cell but if you guys just wanted to show off some cool stuff you're doing or whatever else and I could I could see there maybe being some synergies there I guess I have to lose my I guess I got to lose my headphones for a little bit and uh yeah oh I guess we we didn't really give any thought to how to handle the audio of this I guess I'm on merch messages and Luke is on um this uh okay so Dan do you want to are you able to actually make that
camera a little wider also I don't think it's in Focus yep minor Minor Details and I guess I will I will just start reading from the carried merch messages for a little bit while this happens I don't know what to do I just you basically your hair and then rub it around or what so I don't know if they can hear you or not but yikes um double yikes that's good enough you're okay y any who um I have never done this before where part of it is like already done already died I try to work around that
area yeah I do all of it because that area should be the same color or would that over bleach that area no it would it would double bleach that area and like I don't know maybe it'll fall out so in in theory in theory you're supposed to kind of avoid the scalp but when you're bleach yeah I know when you're bleaching the whole thing I've always felt like that's kind of a stupid like cya instruction because if someone's hair all falls out then they can be like well we told you not to rub
it on the scalp but realistically how are you going to dye your whole head all the way down to the roots without getting any bloody dyee or bleach on the scalp that doesn't that doesn't compute for me uh so if I had to guess I would say go for the heaviest application um everywhere except where it's already bleached and maybe just go for a very very light application there and all of this assumes that your nozzle and head massage control is a lot better than Jake bellant who claims that he
actually tried to do a small spot but it just spiral out of control so um I want to make it super clear I have no idea what I'm doing yeah we we um we get it oh my God not a not a great start we yeah this is this is incredible um I hope we get some like really serious questions Anonymous asks could you talk any more about the small backpack and what you're aiming for or what the design process has been like I heard you mentioned recently it's still a long way from completion I actually are you going
did you take the top cap oh you did you you may want to put it on your hand oh okay yeah and you may want to yeah you yeah you may want yeah yeah there you go you may want to hold the bottle in the in the good hand and then the yeah yeah you're good so you could just put it on your hand it's basically want to add a ton more cuz I added that I want to see how much it just do it like putting in shampoo okay yeah okay so this is totally nice you're going to want to do more of
like yeah like do you not wash your hair like do you know how to do you know how shampoo works yeah there we there we go is that right okay well I don't I didn't know it was the same okay yeah it's a funny thing like um I I've thought about this sometimes when I've had to do acting things for for our videos I'm not an actor but occasionally I'll have to do something that's like kind of an acting thing and it occurs to me sometimes that um actually it was when I was showering on camera for some reason
I was like I've never thought about if the way that I shower is normal weird yeah right like I you know is top to bottom chill is it is it dirtiest Parts first is it last is it like like I've never really thought about if I if I do it right I actually really wish I had two glov you're going to need way more of this yeah I just there's a lot of it in one spot I got you gloves so okay compensate compensate by putting more of it everywhere okay okay the the longer you spend on it the more unevenly bleached
it will be so getting it all on there is pretty good um anyway as for the small backpack I got a new sample so we've reduced the number of pockets but we've got more of like a pocket pocket of holding now which is really nice and we have um we have put a little bit more thought into how our pocket layout is going to work and how weird is this for you it's actually not that bad for me I'm just getting to work it's not the most normal thing that I've ever experienced you
need so much more of this just yeah just is it supposed to be like white just give her yeah just yeah just give her um it's a long way from completion still but I have one that I can start daily driving again I just haven't um I haven't started doing it yet I've just been really busy this week and I haven't had time to move all of my stuff over okay cool uh Dan you want to hit me with a merch message uh yeah sure let's see um lus says an owner of your own small own business do you ever feel like your
employees don't have the same passion you do how do you cope with this # asking for a friend Happy CS Disaster Day H it's tough because everybody's motivation for doing what they do is completely different some people do what they do purely out of passion and would do the exact same thing whether they made any money or not some people do things purely for the money and absolutely hate everything about it other than their paycheck and then realistically almost everyone is
somewhere in between on that Spectrum do I feel like they don't have the same passion I do absolutely I I I do what I do because it's what I would have done anyway and there's very very few people who fall completely into that category um to be clear I also have to eat and the money is absolutely a factor uh I was very very upfront from day one that when we split off from NC this was my job we were starting a company and it was going to need to be sustainable which means it was going to need to be
profitable and grow and hire people and you know do all those things um but it is what I would have been doing in my free time chatting with people about tech anyway I just have to do a lot of you know business stuff that I frankly am a lot less passionate about uh on top of that you're doing you're doing this Luke what I was going to say you're doing great but then I realized that there's no possible way I'm doing great we have honest relationship and I don't really feel that
way you may at some point wish to yeah  cool um yeah so dbrand sponsored this for those of you who are tuning in late and I'm fairly certain that this is what I'm going to look like afterward how sir if it's anything other than this then I'm asking L'Oreal for a refund do you think you need more stuff or less stuff way more you got to saturate it all right saturate that Biz like especially here has like nothing oh man okay um okay Dan oh wait how do I cope with it well you cope with
it by learning to manage right like you um everyone has different styles so you you make the company a place that people want to work in different ways if they're not quite as passionate as you are about you it Widgets or whatever else um neither of you guys showed up but one of the examples is you know extracurricular activities that are fun for people we had softball night last night it was flipping awesome we had a 20 we actually we had over 20 people turn up for it which you know sounds
like okay yeah that's a softball night right but that was our biggest that was our biggest turnout ever and if you think about it a little more that's a fifth of the company softball night is freaking popular and it's freaking awesome um so yeah whether it's whether it's events or perks or or pay or uh working conditions uh you know one of the things that we feel very strongly about is that warehouse workers uh deserve air conditioning too uh the vast majority of the warehouses in the Lower Mainland do
not have air conditioning and uh ours do because we think our Logistics team deserves to not sweat like pigs all day every day and I know that's an expression pigs don't actually sweat but yeah chill okay hit me down lonus with it being a month since the allyx video I'm curious to know have you been playing it since then if so what games have you tried on it uh the Alli X is to my knowledge still under review embargo so if I was to share with you anything other than what I said in
the first video uh I would probably be doing a bad so um and the truth is that that was a pre-production hardware piece anyway so I haven't been playing with it there's nothing for me to glean from it other than that I like the ergonomics which I  video goodness okay what do you guys think is he doing a good job oh now there's some bleach on my keyboard no no you're good now my eyes sting you're doing great loot just just make sure you get everything please that's what I'm currently working
on is making sure there's no dead spots people are saying no using too little I don't know like no one told me how much to use all of all of it yeah that wasn't said until after I was already going uhhuh is all of it on there now no no he's used like get the rest on there half just to get it on his hair before he dies before he dies well all right before he doesn't die before he dies oh because it's G to get worse you can  f what's that okay what's that face there okay yeah that's a strong that's a
strong uh smell and um everything else about everything else that is happening right now Temple oh my God okay Dan hit me uh sure on the wrong tab the ends of the front if I just have like oh you've got the ends are good brown tips it's going to look pretty stupid okay uh greetings to everyone question for all three of you what is the most seriously that was the solution solution you've ever had while troubleshooting oh oh man there's got to be so many of those but remembering them might be
tough yeah I feel like I I often just block these things from my mind um I've got to man there's got to be something with like a like a ram something oh I remember okay I've got I've had scrapyard Wars on the brain and I think the most seriously that was the solution was was uh was scrapyard Wars 4 with Bob with Bob and Rod okay I know it didn't really make it into the cut very well we were under extreme time pressure to get those bloody videos out and the editors weren't the same ones who shot
it so they weren't necessarily there for every crazy moment in the last episode we kind of allude to this really quickly but honestly it would be pretty cool to dig back into the archive at some point pull this footage out and like do a float plane exclusive video on what happened because we had a motherboard that either worked and then didn't or we broke it something happened and it ended up with scratched traces on it it was and it was dead it was not working and I don't remember if
it was Bob's idea or if it was my idea but somehow we came up with the idea of bypassing the broken Trace by jumpering one of the fan headers onto another fan header or something it was absolutely wild we did it the system powered up and was stable throughout testing so we were able to complete if it hadn't worked we would have not had a working computer you want an interesting followup on that story apparently it was Bob who bodged the wire I apparently doubted him the
whole time that that checks out I don't I don't blame you for doubting them that was a crazy thing to do and I'm surprised it worked you want to follow up to that story yes I ended up buying that motherboard and C you bought that motherboard I did it's still running isn't it I gave it to my brother it's still works it still works that is sick no particular maintenance on it nothing's ever gone wrong it's not like the fan stopped working nothing happened everything's been fine as far as my goes
maybe you didn't tell me it was something but okay so have you saturated it I don't know I think so it seems pretty saturated to me I can't see there's like goop everywhere but like I don't know okay I've never done this before do you have all the way to the roots at the front there I don't think so yeah watch those bang Roots there's goo at the roots I don't know okay cool okay oh man it really looks like at the at the front here you have temples temples in the Bic right now
okay I was pointing here but sure oh  done I thought I got this part but apparently not eyebrows Serenity Now no uh no this is not designed for eyebrows this is the really strong stuff that is designed for the head okay Dan hit me uh let's see um what's up LL and D what was your best trip or vacation that wasn't planned I don't think I've ever taken a vacation that wasn't planned do people take unplanned vacations uh those seem like crazy people how does that happen you just
like end up up leaving I don't know like I I've definitely known people that are like oh yeah I'll just like start driving and I'll like arrive somewhere um but I have never I've never done that okay so you've got it saturated everywhere now I think so but I haven't used all the goop okay if you've got it saturated everywhere and you're 100% certain then we're Dan have you dyed hair not for a very long time okay can you run over here and evaluate the level okay okay Dan's apparently going to come
take a look so I guess I will find another merch message this one is from Alan J oh actually no you know what I'll do is I'll do last year because it was already done back there the last crazy deal I think is gone not probably okay I'll do the oh no we still have 14 small mystery sweatpants for $11 do it you cowards if you want I don't know uh Luke yeah give me a number  four okay that looks very gooped to me but I will add goop it's not about the goop quantity it's not about the
goop quantity it's about working it into the hair oh my God thank you Dan for helping him because this was very painful um I can't imagine why okay here it's 50% off the Technicolor key desk pad oh that's a cool design um yep once again we don't have a flipping ton of these uh we've only got a little over a hundred and they are going to be yeah 50% off 15 bucks I am setting it active now so if you need a desk pad this is a great deal don't forget we've got free shipping on orders over $100 this is the  
is good reviews cool design great packaging courtesy of Sarah but here's what it looks like with a keyboard and a mouse on it I am so stressed right now  cool okay get uh Alan J says lus Media Group and lldd I'm starting a manufacturing startup and struggling to keep up with deadlines as my family's Farm helping support the startup demands 12 plus hour days 7 days a week advice sheesh there okay oh this is a tough one because you know the last thing I want to tell you is give up on your
manufacturing startup dream and the second last thing I want to tell you is you know let your family know that they need to take a hike but what I can tell you is you've got to set boundaries um there are as you've discovered only so many hours in a day Alan and if you've if you've if you've got you know it's if you've got a dream and you've got your heart set on something um and your family is supportive then hopefully they  to have to hopefully they can find a way to support what you're doing as it's
actually important in exchange or not an exchange I mean it's family it shouldn't be an exchange hopefully you guys can be mutually supportive of each other have an honest conversation that's the most important thing honest conversation about what is feasible for you what they need from you and how you can mutually achieve your goals because communication is clearly an issue here if you're asking me rather than talking to them about it uh and I'm not saying you've done anything wrong I'm just saying that um
obviously the current situation isn't working and you're going to need to do something so hard to take line is serious right now um okay so are we good I don't know I feel like it but I've never done this before so okay we're good so the next thing that I need is a plastic bag do I do I have a plastic bag do we have a plastic bag in the house was not Luke go ahead and have a seat all right well I should probably put this somewhere just any plastic bag uh yeah you could just just make it
inside out and then uh it's good or oh yeah that's it's not the uh anyway uh good luck with that is he even going to be able to remove the glove yeah not sure yeah I'm trying to do it without like being messy um okay thanks uh yeah yeah yeah very funny  okay so uh these dyes tend to work a little bit better with heat same with bleach so I'm just going to get a bit of a plastic helmet going on here and um let's it set for a little bit longer Luke took so long that realistically
told me how long there's not much leave-in time left but I can't have the parts that he just did rinsed now so don't worry about it guys um realistically I used to leave these things in for probably about double what they recommend in the box with the heat helmet so um if I was going to if I was going to lose all my hair it would have happened before I think my teachers sucked to be completely honest cuz somebody told me at the beginning that it maybe doesn't have to go on the scalp and I'm like
okay I'm going to take I'm going to take some advice from that and then somebody else is like actually you need to massage it in what are you guys saying we said it was like shampoo no one said amount of time nobody said until I was significantly through that I had to use the entire B we said it was like shampoo do you shampoo you know what Bo you know what it doesn't matter shampoo that can't touch your scalp Dan hit me yeah what uh terrible teachers what about using conditioner that's not
supposed to go in your scalp yeah wait it's not no I put I man I I just go ham with the condition mean so short it doesn't actually matter oh okay uh I have ADHD and work in startups I enjoy hearing lonus talk about his experiences in his professional life what are the aspects of ADHD he thinks benefit him and what is his advice to others I mean hyperfocus is the one benefit that can think of with ADHD when it's on the right thing I will have absolutely zero productivity and then
I'll be like minutes from my deadline and I will get an hour of work done in those minutes um it's not because I want to procrastinate it's yeah I'm probably not going to use it it's not because I want to procrastinate it's more just that I find it almost impossible to focus  I'd say that's the biggest one as for advice to others do everything you can to stay organized write down everything because one of my biggest distractions can be forgetting a good idea and trying
to get it back and then I end up missing out on probably five other good ideas in the time that I spent thinking about that um that one that I would The One That Got Away I think that's the other thing too is um ADHD again another superpowers is that you're kind of going in a 100 different directions at once and I think in a creative industry like we're in that can be a benefit as much as it can be a challenge it can be helpful one of the biggest things I've done in managing people with ADHD that's
been helpful is creating uh sacred time for them to stay in flow and stay focused very helpful all right um stinks you guys oh yeah it stinks you guys got a couple that you can do while I run to the shower I'm sure yeah yeah yeah wish me luck guys God this is this is very blonde already there's bits that aren't so that   again he looks so beused I think I think you did a good job Luke that that face means bits I think his um I think you you dyed most of his skin as well you tried not to get it on his
nuts man right well you should have warned the the gloves that I bought you I just I don't know I thought I needed dexterity nobody told me it was just smash it into the skull it wasn't smash into the skull it was very like you know forget it forget it uh short tall and regular sized Luke how do you know you've nailed a work life balance how would I know that's why I wanted to ask this because haha let me know when you find out yeah um uh I don't think either of the people currently present are 100% 
balance you did not you did not specify what kind of ratio that you like it's really easy to not have a life when you just do work and then you don't have to worry about a whole bunch of things yeah I think I mean neither of us have a child so for me if I'm not doing uh what I call work work which is work here um then I'm probably going to find ways to do other forms of it basically fun work yeah yeah yeah yeah I think that's a good balance if you if you asked me if I would have done that when I was a kid I
would have said obviously not and now I do it so it is what it is I do my fun work for work work too yeah yeah I just like working here  the oh okay thank you so nice why did you say oh my gosh cuz the food's here oh I thought for a second no sorry hello thank you hopefully this is from the right place we couldn't get a hold event thank you so much appreciate you thank you uh work life balance bad uh let's see what yeah I don't know I'm not necessar saying work life balance is bad I I try
to defend it for my my people as much as I can I just don't defend it for myself  my I I kind of do this all the time so sometimes I'll be like super dialed in and then other times I'm not as dialed in and it just kind of flows and I allow that to flow and my low point is you know there for8 hours a day and I'm putting in good work my high point is like I need to do stuff my brain just like wants to work on things and then I end up putting in more but it is what it is I find that it's also important to
not get upset with yourself when you're in those low points yeah I found for a very long time I was getting down on myself for you know just getting eight hours of work done or maybe nine you know do a couple hours at home that's not very good uh and kind of pushing for those 12 hours and yeah that can be dangerous so if your work life balance if you have a healthy relationship with yourself yes then it can be healthy it no matter what side of the scale it's on yeah if I'm if
my brain isn't in hyper work mode you got to be okay with letting yourself not be in that yeah if my brain's in hyper if if my brain is not in hyper workor mode what I try to do is resist the temptation to Deen super hard into really bad things and what I'll do is Instead try to focus on like you know what uh brain's not really feeling like getting certain work goals done this week instead I'm going to try to walk really far or like huge amount of total steps this week or like I'll make sure
I'm really consistent at the gym or like find some other thing that I can do that gets the dopamine wheel spinning in a good way instead of like a doom scrolling way or something like that dopamine control is probably what I would say especially for ad HD people as well dopamine control is an extremely difficult thing to manage and to maintain it's scary okay let's see what else we got BL is going to be so pissed I don't even take full blame I got like no training yeah I don't know I don't know
whatever happens uh hello lldd as a person busy with my work as a software developer how do you balance putting extra time into work versus personal development in order to become a better professional feel like this it's like the same question not exactly but it's very similar I mean I've been going up and down the list here CU this person's kind of saying like Okay become a better professional do I do that through doing my own work or do I do that towards putting extra time into
work do I want to be a better me or do I want to be a better career person I think it's basically Crux of this maybe that's a very personal question and I think can change depending on the scenario and stuff so like could they they don't necessarily have to be mutually exclusive if you're a better you you become a better professional yeah that's totally a thing yeah Rising tide makes all the ships in the sea yes yep not my goat not my horse or whatever this saying is uh let's see what else I got here so
many of these are things I think lonus would want to like have an in  hard uh oh I can hear him oh he sounds angry yeah he does he's like he's doing a lot of yelling he is and storming  crashing about he's be so upset oh God oh God uh oh he's walking above us right now FaceTime of on live we should do that he he's not going to be able to FaceTime but he should he should video call V I mean she could just watch W know you say you don't like presence de like cards I don't think he really
particularly likes anything but it it depends there have been ones of both  liked I hear him a what oh that's not fair that's not fair okay wait wait wait you haven't revealed yet uh what if you what if you video call ion you want me to video call yvon I think so uh I don't know if they can hear me right now can yes they can yes what's that they can  y'all all right that was a good idea I I wasn't sure why you were upstairs that makes sense I thought you were yelling at us Showmanship kind of did too no 
presentation all right uh hold on I'm going to call on um a data application   show yon can you hear me uh yeah I can hear you just fine you're live on the W show okay um what's up well we did a  today did you did you finish dyeing your hair um well here's the thing you know how I've dyed my hair like over a dozen times and I'm pretty experienced at it and um you know with nothing but a mirror and some common sense I can do a pretty good job of it did luk or Dan do it Luke did it and not only has he never
dyed hair before he doesn't appear to have ever shampooed hair either you told me not to put it on the scalp you put shampoo on you work shampoo into your scalp I just what do you my teacher was really bad I I I maintain this I don't know if it can be worse than yesterday honestly happen I I was literally crying yesterday I have a feeling the sideburns aren't uh fully done there's some other things there going to put you on his mic sure and then turn on video calling okay
wait is it on that means that means I need to put my my phone on speaker one  you can put on the video feed that's fine she can't see yet you got to put her like right on the tip okay okay we  yeah well it's everywhere it's just  why why is it orange why is it leave it  enough it does seem to be everywhere it doesn't seem that bad honestly I was expecting way worse is May video the certain tips are just darker it's fine it's it's supposed to be that way can we do it it's called
it's called orange flame it's a it's a design can we do it again is that is  okay all right see the brown spot you can snip that uhhuh that's fine I don't know I haven't even seen the rest of it yet so uh oh no how's the okay how's the blending on the the previous Circle the spot in the back is still there I don't yeah it's brighter she says the spot in the back is still there  brighter do you have more can I help you fix it I don't know if you can help fix this but we're certainly not going to do
it with loose help so um I'll let you go now hun okay bye bye it really does look orange it's really very orange well I I told you I used to leave them in for about double the amount of time that they say on the package but I was seeing how much it was lightning under the thing but I think I was seeing areas like this where you you know put dye 15 minutes before you put it in other  do you want me to have a go is it is it possible to try again think so no yeah you certainly shouldn't try again like the same
day um wow this is probably the best result for dbrand to be perfectly honest man we're going to have to start pushing the LTT hat Pro in our videos a lot I unironically think it looks pretty all right it doesn't look like it's supposed to I I look like kind of cool I look like I'm going through a midlife crisis you look like you're supposed to be in like a earlys punk band sponsored by Deep no I look like I was in an early 2000s punk band in the early 2000 never grew out of it yeah yeah that makes
sense Johnny Rotten had better hair look at the back there's like a there's like a brown ring around much of the same yeah yeah yeah I think it looks cool it just doesn't even sort of remotely look like what's it's supposed to based on the box oh wow those uh those desk pads are gone well um do you want another one should we do should we do more there's some pretty crazy stuff yeah also that's another thing chat disagreed with you guys all the time about what chat was saying you rinsed it way
too soon oh CH also saying the the soap analogy or the yeah the soap analogy was bad oh no shampoo is fine if you just put I I I've done this a lot of times I don't have super sensitive skin on my scalp so if I just put it in like shampoo do the heat thing then why did you tell me the avoid scalp thing you're going to have to watch it back I think you were very focused on what you were doing and were not listening he said to absolutely hit the scalp I was focusing the camera and I remember that
instruction but you can't you should you should know from teaching people that are new at things you don't say the part that they're not supposed to do then you shouldn't say avoid the scalp but you know on mine can go for it because then they're still going to hesitate that's a very like beginner teacher thing that you should know don't get I got to say I look Sasser like this yeah I like it I don't know if I agree I don't think you look sassy it makes you serious no no he looks like he's uh violent
violent the orange does help with that a little bit if it was actually pure blonde I don't think so no but he looks a little insane this looks like he's had some problems yeah like look at that face like he's just going to stab you what do you mean look at the face we didn't change anything about the face yeah but like the face no you ah all right hit me down uh sure I might have to get you guys to read them yourself okay Anonymous says hey lldd sweet sweet sour lime Day deals
lus badminton talk what's your Racket and string combo in your play style uh I play with the nanoflare 700 for you I like to smash a lot but more of like a more of an accuracy focused smash rather than a super hard Smash Thank you I saw that um I uh I have good defense but my my my light touch could use a lot of improvement Richard says it's 2024 how come we don't have individually addressable sprinkler heads in our irrigation systems yet I mean that can be done but I I I would counter your
question with my own question why is individual room HVAC not completely normal now yeah because it's it's been a thing but when I got quoted to do the AC system at my old place they "quoted me like 20 something, and it was" just like one thermostat in one place that's so bad which is so stupid setting up a system where you can have where you can have um ah not baffles the things the things in the ducts man why is this word escaping from me right now I've turned into a blonde now I know how you feel not
really it's more orange um dampers louvers whatever yeah dampers dampers I think that's what we call them here um so like why wouldn't you just have damper control on a per room basis so you can dump cold into it or not dump cold how do these not communicate back how's that not it's like a little bit of wire in a tiny motor like for the cost of these HVAC installations it seems so obvious like everyone can relate to this like being in at work and like person A's office is
always freezing and person B's office is always boiling why is this not obvious and then when I did it myself I did it with mini splits rather than with ducted Central AC and that just had per room control built into it and it was a fraction of the price I'm sitting here going why is anybody doing anything other than this I it's so obvious it seems genuinely very weird yeah I don't want to AC my whole house I'm I'm I'm sleeping in one room it it just I don't know maybe it's
just like a silly like North America if we can we'll just make a bigger AC and cool the whole thing like I don't know what it is but I'm yeah individual control of things seems like like it should just be especially where the cost is so low it just seems like a thing that we should we should do more um all right what else we got here Joseph V says full kit for myself the new wife and our cat what all do you get oh drop out scoop braet a bunch of stuff Luc and Linus as newlyweds we'd
love to know some of the hilarious quirks about your SOS that were unexpected adjustments so Ivon and I lived to together in her parents house for at least a couple of years before we moved in together so there wasn't really anything unexpected but one of the ones that drove me crazy and that to her credit I don't know how she did this cuz old habits are hard to break she corrected for me is she had a habit of using approximately correct words so she would say put it on the floor when she
was talking about the ground or she'd say I left it on the table when she was talking about the counter now English is not ivonne's first language even though she speaks it as well or better than the vast majority of the native speakers that I've ever met but so so so com so that combined with the fact that she grew up in a non English first household means that there were some idiosyncrasies to her communication that make a very literal person like me very frustrated because I and and that's
something I've worked on too when she says check the counter I know to look at any horizontal surface now but I didn't back then and so she would say I left it on the counter I would go look on the counter it wouldn't be there I would truck all the way back to where she is and be like it's not there and she'd come back up with me and it would be on the table I'd be like she's like look there it is I'm like yeah that's the table I didn't I didn't look at the T that's not where you told me it was um
so that that took some adjustment that's something we worked together on I'm good fair enough uh next up Hale Le says hey lonus I know you don't like presents do you like cards oh sorry and just to address some of the comments no I'm not abstaining because they're so bad or something I'm abstaining because I just I don't feel like it he's hungry he's cranky he'll get some food in him and then he'll want to answer merch messages later well no just not that one I'm not going to like Drop
dig on my on my partner I don't I don't feel like I need to oh so you're saying I'm a bad person no I think that one makes sense because you gave the you gave the uh English not first language thing and and there's some like she can speak really well but there's some translation Oddities between languages that might make things like kind of weird whatever I got one here for you hey there Goldie twink and the two bears  thank you so much anous so uncomfortable  reasons looks all right sorry apart from
bleach blonde what's the worst hairstyle each of you ever had oh yeah I can head this one up I probably had the worst between both of us which is Quite a feat given some of the hairstyles luses had that a lot of the audience has even actually seen um I used to go to IC and those were some blunder years if any but um at one point in time I went to this Barber Shop downtown Victoria and just told them to you know I don't know do whatever I just need a haircut um and the guy like joked with me about how
like you know you should probably pick something and I was like no and he's like well we do some like pretty crazy stuff and I'm like really not paying attention cuz I like actually don't care cuz this is what I've done all the time and I end up just getting like very normal haircuts so who cares right yeah I'm more specific now um he did carving it was a barber shop where they do carving at least that's what they called it then I'm sure they call it something else now um but I had waves on
the side of my head and then a star on the back and then I had to go my my girlfriend at the time prom because she was one grade below me this was my first year in University and I it was mostly grown up but you could still see it hold on let me ask this how much was that haircut not very much at all okay then that was a really cheap lesson yeah I'm pretty sure he didn't upcharge me for like the carving stuff like he would normally um and yeah it was like I lived in dorms at
the time so it was like a joke for a while and then my hair grew back and it was fine um so yeah any any crazy hair color that you may have done when you were younger at least you didn't have a star cut into your head yeah you win yeah you just automatically win yeah so you looked like a col student dating a high schooler um sure we were get over it um yeah I mean I've done a lot of colors and I've had a lot of like you know kind of not very trendy hairstyles I guess um but I can't say that I've 
cool I win how did you not notice well he started okay and you were just like well what do you do now tell him to keep going yeah whatever like I I I thought it would be better to just like embrace it at that point um then be like okay I have this like big line in the side of my head or something um I don't know and ended up being like kind of funny I don't know I didn't really care I was obviously never going to do it again but like it didn't it didn't ruin my life or anything like it
whatever I didn't it didn't actually like I was happy when my hair grew out and it was gone at least she still took you to the prom with her yeah yeah I don't know how happy she was about it but it also didn't really show up in photos and stuff cuz like the big bit  yeah did the star look good I mean I mean did you ever see it not not directly I saw you like pictures and stuff um it it was a star on the back of my head so like by default no um but like were the lines clean and stuff like 
yeah okay let's see what else we got here you answered the cards one right maybe I don't know uh no I didn't answer the cards one what was it elus you don't like presents but are you okay with getting cards yeah sure I like graphics cards network cards storage cards I'm going to get you a 1080 to frame on your wall uh no I think cards are a waste of paper and eCards are a waste of time man what about an nft remember eCards I had quite genuinely forgotten probably for years until you just
mentioned it that was a relatively short but that was quite a phase of the internet yeah wow just send me a text that's all that's yeah if you must like congratulate me on making it around the Sun again I like sending my friends the just birth just the word birth yeah  contrived uh um yeah let's see what else uh wet noodle says grandparents send me e-cards oh wait hold on oh wet noodle says grandparents still send e-cards to  won't lonus would you be willing to ever make an appearance at a land type 
we kind of do our own right uh yeah I did um froa a thousand years ago that FPS Doug we both that's cool I remember that's how you got your poster signed y um we both separately because before we met used to go to local lands all the time yep 100% but there isn't really any local lands anymore except for ours I don't know it's like um that' be cool it' be fun I like going to lands but um these days if I'm going to go to one it's going to be like one that we throw so I I I probably wouldn't like
travel for it I don't know it's tough  tough I no I'm not planning to go to Pax West I'm not the biggest I'm not the biggest PA guy Luke was a big p guy it's not as good anymore it's not the same  okay let's see here sorry I was chewing another thing I'll say about lands is modern lands uh really need good administration of the people um a lot of modern land like like the Pax West Land used to be really fun and now it sucks um largely because everyone's just like sitting on social media or watching
YouTube or doing something like there's no they're not land partying they're sitting at their computer it's a totally different thing um and there's actually a pretty serious amount of trying to make sure everyone's engaged in doing things that happen at our lands well I remember you talking to me about this how you felt like over time a lot of the byoc seats at PS turned into a place for people to stash their stuff yeah rather than a place for them to hang out all day and play video
games yeah totally that's that's absolutely a thing um people started prioritizing the the show more but that that was like a self-fulfilling prophecy because once some people started doing it it impacted the quality of the land which made other people less interested in the land so they started doing it and then that just kind of kept looping and it turned into a thing where like no one was really Landing during the day and then even after the expo hall closed people were still just using it as like
mostly a crash pad or or uh a place to sit at their computer instead of really focusing on playing games early packs lands were sick I think there was also some form of administration change like the the people or the person that was running it early on stopped and wasn't running it later on and I think that had a significant impact as well um but yeah it's it's not really that great anymore to be fair I never win over Co I haven't been in technically since 2019 number between two and  one four

to figure out how they wrote this because it was like Tech you have tinkered with for education so is that education Tech or is that Tech that you  specifically I assumed it was tech for education I mean you know data projectors have gotten a lot more affordable and a lot uh better um oh my God are they just gone already both of these deals are going like absolutely insane um you guys are you guys are mad Lads um anyway oh the drivers aren't on sale it's the solid color drivers solid color

Replacements uh We've thought about it but I don't know we tend to be more of a like move forward instead of move back kind of mentality place here nothing's impossible but I don't think we have any  I've been waiting for sweatpants and hoodies to go on sale I've been taking advantage of the lime Day sales all week my question is what do you think the  are x3d is super cool I um looking back I don't remember a time when cash was so important to gaming yeah like I I I've never been able to
find it again but I did this really cool video um not video um article on Hardware Canucks back in the Core 2 Duo Core 2 quad era where there was a Pentium chip a um a Celeron chip a core like core branded chip and then like something else an extreme or something and the only difference between all of them they all had the same core count and they all had the same clock speed the only difference between all of them it was either three or four chips I I seriously can't remember U but the only difference
was the cash amount and I basically was like okay we keep getting told more cash more cash is more better how much does it matter for gamers and I specifically benchmarked games and what I found was that shockingly even the lowly seller on at the with the same constraints at the same core count at the same clock speed almost kept up it didn't you know the I think the the happy medium was actually the like like Pentium dual core or whatever it was um but I I was shocked
at how little it mattered past a certain point so when AMD first pitched X3 with that very limited outdated data set I was like oh well I wonder if everything's the same and they just add a bunch more cash if this is really going to make a material difference for gamers and as it turned out it definitely did Zen is super super sensitive to uh data access lately and adding a hunk ton of cash to it makes a big big difference um especially in certain workloads like gaming so um I
don't see x3d going anywhere anytime soon it's obvious that it's really challenging for AMD to build I mean we saw this in the uh in the way that they kind of baby these x3d chips in terms of the amount of voltage they're willing to put through them but hey at least they uh at least they're doing that instead of them dying in the field so that's rough aside from Terry Fox what is something about Canada you think is underrated that should be embraced as a  patriotism I legitimately thought that
about Tim Hortons at one point in time don't remind me now it's been a long time think that Tim Horton blows so many chunks it's so bad now I'm proud of duffins donuts duffins donuts that gives me Pride at least in Vancouver I don't even I don't even know like what's uh what's cool about Canada we're tree yeah we got rocks and trees and trees and rocks and rocks and trees and trees and rocks and rocks and also trees and rocks ship them to China and then buy back rocks and trees and trees and rocks and
water which is good that's that's a real song by the way that is actually a real song by The Arrogant Worms great band proud Canadians um I used to like Canada more I think Canada had more of a its own culture before and I think it has less of its own culture now I think that's not great  know it's pretty yeah it's pretty somewhere some places I don't know I think um this is probably a super confusing thing for like some people from other places to watch I know that you know in America in particular um we
took our kids on a trip down to Washington State and they were a little confused that there were like American flags everywhere they were like is that like normal like what what what's the deal with that and we're like oh yeah just like Americans are like hyper patriotic and stuff um and we I think don't get that beaten into US quite as hard and so so it's probably a little confusing for people from other places to watch us kind of struggling to think of something that we're proud of Canada for
um it's not cuz we like hate Canada you also put up Terry Fox yeah um you're trying to you we're trying to find something that's on the level of Terry Fox if you ask a Canadian for something that they're proud about that's on the level of Terry Fox they're probably going to struggle um yeah like we don't we don't hate Canada we obviously either of us could leave anytime we want so to be fair yeah if it wasn't for this I'd be gone that's that's true I wouldn't well thinking no well I don't know a lot of the
reasons that I would stay are not necessarily anything to do with Canada anyway and to be fair I wouldn't be gone because I like notably dislike Canada I actually like Canada for amount um he just likes the Nordic is better certain other places that I like a little bit more um yeah but Canada is cool it's just I think it doesn't get televised as much but Canada's been really going through some stuff lately um what what gets the views on the interwebs wherever you're from practically as far as I can tell is
American politics and I think Canadian politics are even less interesting because we're so physically close to America that it's just it just seems like America light to a lot of other people but we're we're like actually really going through it right now um financially Canada is doing really poorly right now um yeah so much of our like GDP is just increases in land value yep which has been just ripping the population apart because no one can afford housing and people are genuinely
seriously questioning how they're going to live literally anywhere in this enormous country because they can't afford to live anywhere and there's all this incentive to not build enough housing and and crank immigration like crazy so that the the housing prices keep going up no matter what and just like yep it's um yeah a lot of the things that we were known for and we were kind of good at we don't even really do anymore um or it's not as much of a focus it's uh Vancouver which is
close to where we live is like literally one of the most corrupt places in all of North America um that's been reported on pretty extensively but like money laundering and criminal Finance is like realistically probably the main export of Vancouver um racism is becoming crazy in Canada right now I would say that it's probably growing more than I've ever seen it before like wasn't a thing when I was a kid and it's becoming a thing there's a casino in Coquitlam in the middle of absolutely
nowhere it's in an industrial Zone they made exceptions for it to be there for who knows why some reason and as far as I can tell it exists only for moneya laundry um like it's not an entertainment Hub it's not it's just like it's just like easy access on the freeway it's the only reason that anything like that would be there yeah so it's like I don't know there's uh I I understand it's it seems like kind of the whole world's going through it right now see name says it's
a terrible Casino as well but that's not the point the point is just that you can lo your money there yeah yeah nothing nothing else matters yeah I get everyone's going through it I'm not trying to say it's necessarily worse here than elsewhere we're just very much going through the whole world's kind of going through it that's what I'm saying being honest right like and there's a lot of um there's a lot of pessimism um and you know I'm I I I'm not a I'm not a huge fan at this point
of like taking sides in an election um what's what's the point right um but what I will say is that there's a lot of problems with every option for our upcoming election yeah and I think that there's a lot of our there's a lot of fine folks down south that can probably relate to that um a little bit I have I have never been less interested in an election than the one we're currently going through and not because I think the answer is going to matter it's because I've never seen an election
where both sides were so flawed yeah and it's like cool okay so I'm like voting for lesser evil but the Lesser evil is like really bad so cool like I don't know it just it feel it it it feels kind of tough and I say all this while like I'm pretty sure last show I was talking about how I I've been trying to actively like avoid negativity spaces on the internet and stuff so I'm not trying to I'm not trying to do that but I'm just trying to be real like it's it's rough right now um I I think the um
always online nature of modern life is really really really bad for people and I think that we're starting to feel that um in in places that aren't even just online now I think just the general negativity of like everyone is is partially that partially other things I don't know but it is what it is you know this show was kind of an upper until now yeah we shouldn't feed you on the show cuz clearly you just you're you're you're a downer Luke low blood sugar is Happy  it's I yeah it's cuz he's not getting
his chicken and rice it's like oh this "doesn't have this doesn't have 4,000" bottles of red Frank's Hot Sauce of sad now my body has to deal with economy is terrible foreign thing it has never dealt with this type of food yeah it's only ever chicken rice what is noodles it has a spice in it um I don't know why I imagined you're just eating boiled rice and boiled chicken why the devil Mr are there still so many curated merch messages I thought we were oh well when we did the dying thing
I got another 200 merch messages if you want if you want to have a look at the stats page I see um well okay cool I'm going to do the last lightning deal then okay I'll give it here I'll give a no never mind there's actually a lame ending I won't do it all right well I'm going to make sure that the deal is what it says in my sheet first and then I'm going to I'll set it live oh this one's pretty good okay yeah we have a few hundred of these but these are going to  hoodies 9.99 man
whoa guys please For the Love of All that is good in in the name of whatever it is that you believe in please put something profitable in the cart with these mystery hoodies um fill it up 100 bucks uh gets you free shipping for your order uh do it mystery hoodies 9.99 I'm fine I just I'm not acting I just actually don't get it oh it's like so far below cost dude it's crazy that's okay they're going to they're going to help me out are they they're going to buy something else at the same time but
like you didn't have to go so hard quite gen I know that's like a line but like I don't even mean it that way you just didn't I know if it was five $5 more I literally think nothing would have changed I literally intervened on this one to make it lower to make it stupid why what can I say I'm a fan of the blackeyed  started the boots with the fur we need a no we need new we now get us out of here D Apple part turn the C on you're in here with us Luke uh let's see uh Jesus this a real
job that I have looking back looking back over the amazing content you have created not this show what is something you wish you could redo now that uh you have some notoriety and how would you do it to be different okay let's try that again unless you got what I was saying no I got it I got it I uh I don't know I I again back to the looking forward not looking back I I think um there's definitely things that we could have done differently with a bit more planning or you know what oh no I I lied
nerd Sports I'd redo nerd Sports really Channel super fun yeah or would you change or you just want to do it again I I think it would be a blast to do again for one thing but I would CH I would make the I would make it more structured I'd make it more like a show more like my original vision for it okay so like a like an external host more that's like inflicting things instead of like you hosting it and playing at the same time yeah and just and the and the episode format being more clearly defined from
one to the next it was supposed to be and it just I'm I'm not going to blame any one person it was a big Challenge and we were a very small team um but I think it could have been a lot better nerd Sports 2 would be sick and I think all of those are out of stock now says    scared huh okay we probably didn't have to go  hard please tell me you guys bought other things let me let me moving too fast did you because they had to race everyone else cuz the deal was so insane there's
people in chat that are saying no right now and also there's someone in chat that was like yeah I couldn't even get through the checkout process and they only tried to buy the the hoodie it was too cheap yeah this guy just uh this is just a hoodie yeah I'm going to send a mean response no nice do it will the keyboard pins ever come back   yeah we're going to be like one of those restaurants where like the shtick is that the the servers are rude yeah all of Dan's replies now like why didn't you
buy more I need to keep working here  all oh no why is oh man uh I got to keep asking these I think uh let's see H hey DL I work in the motion picture industry do you think generative II will be as big a disruption to the industry as a lot of my co-workers think or do you see it being like the Advent  CGI I think it's going to be pretty disruptive I think that if you look at the very like cutting Edge original content that's coming out of Hollywood right now like I'm going to point at
something like barbon Heimer is something that clearly was different from what came before that subverted expectations uh the Barbie movie in particular turned my expectations for what a corporate sellout movie could be on their heads um 100% that is never going to be AI there might be a little bit of inspiration and AI could be a tool for facilitating more out there ideas potentially um but the execution it's it's such a tight package that's that's it's so original it's never going to be
AI however the like just generic uh just filler material catalog filler material your Hallmark movies your catalog filler material on   that's debatable that's still it's not always done well but I think there's a high degree of handcrafted to Marvel stories um especially the ones that have comic books B thing at all I mean like  contribution I'm I'm thinking more like your like your your whole film written or done by it not written your your your 25% Rotten Tomatoes like romcoms right
like that's that's what I'm talking about all of the Hallmark films ever yeah th those are the ones that I really do see AI significantly um replacing writing on and like no disrespect to the writers I suspect it's a it's a budgetary constraint as much as anything a lot of the time I think it's further out than people think though I I've yeah I think people massively discounted the hallucination issue early on and thought things were going to be here like right away but the hallucination
issue was a huge deal and it's still a huge deal and I don't know how much better it's gotten um Emma and I my my my partner have been playing the New York Times games recently um we don't pay for it you get a free game of each version every day so we play like wle and connections and uh I'm not going to remember the name of them but there's one game where there's what is it 12 letters so there's three on each side of like a square and you have to make words out of the letters um actually I'll just
bring it up give me a second uh New York Time games it would  you almost there I don't know if we have a way of doing this but why can't I the heck I will say in advance that if we dig in and if there's a way to do this and people I saw oh I don't know if we have a way to do this but I will say this up front here um if we dig in and you're muted apparently I un muted and there's a lot of people who did this and we have a way to manually undo it if people ordered like 10 of those mystery hoodies
uh we're going to manually go in and change it to just one don't be a dick um so I saw a couple people kind of talking about that in the chat so I'm going to have a conversation with about that next week cool that's was a good call okay like that's just not it's not cool you know like yeah you technically can but um like if people if like literally 10 people just went in there and you know bought 40 hoodies each that's uh that's not cool yeah okay um so this is the game it's called letter
boxed um you you have to spell words using this box so we'll do h e oh no you can't okay so part of the game and I think this is a big part of the reason why it has hard time oh sorry there's a p in there too S I wasn't even watching um no just kidding uh is that you have to use uh a different side every time so you could never have like a repeat letter in a word because I couldn't pick L twice for example um and you have to try to spell U you have to Sol see it says try to solve in four words
sometimes it's five words sometimes it's six words but you have to try to solve so you have to each letter to solve it um and you have to try to solve it in as few words as possible um we were having we always try to beat the amount that it says to do it in so try to solve in four words and we'll try to do it in three or something right sure um there was one that we were doing that was like try to solve in six words and I think we got it in four and we were trying to see if we could do it
in three but we were really struggling um and screen oh people are trying to tell me to do it I'm not going to do the whole puzzle right now um so what I did was I used open AI because normally we we don't use external tools but I was wondering like okay are we just not good enough could like a could could an AI do this for us so I I screenshot it and I copy and pasted because if you click under the question mark you can get the exact rules for the game so I copy and pasted the exact rules for the game um
pasted that in through text and then I screenshot the square that we had and I asked it to solve it and I could not no matter what make it do it no matter what I did I I it would it would like pick letters from the same side repeatedly and I would tell it that it did that and it would be like oh sorry here's your solve and then it wouldn't actually solve for all the letters it would leave out like half of them um just I would constantly tell it like no you broke this rule you broke this rule you broke
this rule you broke this rule blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah and it just would never work I could not get it to do it um so like it's cool that it can pass the bar and stuff but it still can't do everything you know um so it's it's both further than I think a lot of people think and not nearly as far as a lot of people think um it has a lot of issues still and it has a lot of issues that are going be extremely difficult to solve and take some serious
time um but then there's an incredible amount of investment that's going into it and I do think these problems are  lius do you ever consider how many people whose lives have changed by interacting with your content um it's easy to lose track you know we get our head down in the work and we get focused um but Adam actually sent me one sent me one today he sent me an email today a nice reminder of the positive impact we can have and I'm going to anonymize this obviously a
little bit so I'm going to change it a bit so this person cannot be identified but someone just um sent them a message sent Adam a message and said um I was watching your setup doctor video and absolutely loved it it also moved me quite a bit it was genuinely relaxing to see the before and after shots of all the setups it made me reflect on the state I've kept my own PC setup in over the years I've only recently realized I was struggling with depression uh Part of Me Part of trying
to grow past it was to reclaim my PC setup so I can feel comfortable again just wanted to thank you for doing this video it uh absolutely made my day and it's like you never know what is Meaningful to someone right you never know what someone's going through and I guess if you throw enough pieces of spaghetti at the wall eventually something's going to stick for somebody  cool hello D Linus what brand and type of paint do you recommend for painting baseboards trims and walls any painting
tips for somebody new to painting uh a lot interior get semi gloss um you know yeah I I like Cloverdale Paint but that's just cuz I have experience with them I think it's a good quality product um it's a local local chain obviously so you probably won't be able to buy it but uh get wrecked they're great good luck with that I wouldn't like travel here to shop there yeah not worth it but they are cool I've been there too not eggshell semi gloss for trim hi I've been watching since Luke
was slick you've said in the past setting up a warehouse overseas in complex why don't you partner with local Distributors uh PS why is the Lux bag not real leather holy crap breaking news Reddit is down whoa what nice that doesn't happen all the time constantly Upstream connect error or disconnect reset before headers reset reason connection failure it works on my machine really well just ship my machine then I think he's meing no I actually have it oh yeah no someone else said it's
working I just got I got a different error this time no healthy Upstream I mean that's the thing about whenever a site is going through trouble is everyone will start fing and that  um oh yeah no I've got another one uh transport failure reason delayed connect error 111 no I'm it is it is not up for me uh the reason the Lux bag is not leather is because a it's much more challenging to work with aside from the "cost it would be like a $2,000 bag or" whatever um aside from the cost it's
much more challenging to work with and our backpack is an extremely detailed design like I just don't even think we could build it out of like like uh like full whatever the good one full grain leather whatever we would want to use uh I I just don't see how we would do that and number two we were really really impressed by the Apple leather that we used and we were comfortable moving  it hey Wanda dlll aspiring software developer here I have constantly stressed about my code not being secure
do you have any suggestions on how to secure your software so that you don't  strike H the bare minimum I don't know just keep trying to get better um ask your friends to try to pentest it if you can um try to pentest it yourself look into how you would do that so that you can learn how that works so that you can understand when you're writing stuff how that could possibly potentially work um figure out what cross- site scripting is I feel like that's a type of thing that a lot
of newer devs would end up accidentally making a thing that could do that I don't know let's say three more merch messages  do and then you're done yeah I want to swim tonight cooling yeah all right okay I'm G to throw this one in for oh oh shoot sorry I thought sorry I was muted um uh uh three more merch messages and then uh Luke and I are agreeing that we're both swimming tonight okay sure I've got this one this will be free I guess X stylist hair turns orange when lightened because
natural undertones are exposed always tone after lightning reapply lightener in one to two days Google hair lightning levels for appropriate toner I don't know man sure sounds good I like that Luke just messed up I'm salling time to try and find an actual merch message that's probably a better storyline or do you want to pick one yeah I'm probably just going to leave it the way it is no Dan go for it I actually genuinely think the orange just kind of looks cool no it doesn't I like
it it looks like an amateur job I like trying to cover that up I like that's got a story now yeah if if you had done his hair and it was perfect it would be oh yeah cool now it's Luke's fault and there's story now there Story the spot's like white yeah you messed up bud uh let's see as a biohacker I wonder if lonus or Luke would ever get an RFID chip implanted in their hands I thought about it a few times quite a few times times we had a trip tentatively planned um Taran van heemer I think was going to
go I was going to go at least a couple other people on staff we going to go we were all going to go down to um down to Washington State there was somewhere that we' already like talked to and everything and we were all going to do it we're going to make a video and then Co and then we didn't go anywhere and  yeah uh lonus has there ever been a promotional stunt that dbrand asked you to do that you actually turned down also any idea when the screwdriver shaft  stock extensions will come in when they
come in I have no idea um ask for debrand promotional stunts I don't know part of my thing is like I I I think a lot of people take themselves too seriously and I think that's part of the reason that I have ended up with a bit of a like perception that I'm not a serious person because I don't take myself super seriously like from who oh I just like I mean Community wise no not from people who actually know me okay um and so so I I think that's where you know some of the the the perception that uh this is
not a serious operation or that we don't take things seriously might come from um but you know what I don't care um I I think that I think think that some people are a little too uptight about their image I think some people like I dude I don't think anything makes me cringe harder than especially in like the music scene and I think you know like kind of who I'm the kind of characters I'm talking about the people  smiling like crawl out of your own ass and just take a nice picture with
somebody for a change you don't have to you don't have to always look cool you know um it's part of the brand though uh yeah I also the world is like so dark and crappy just smile sometimes yeah I just I yeah I just I can't um it's it's it's cringe it's cringe uh and so I'd rather I'd rather be I'd rather be outwardly cringe than be like cringe and not even know it if that makes sense yeah uh okay last one I got for you then hey dll I'm confused about gaming handhelds why are they all so big why is
there no steam deck in switch form factor thermals can't be that Co thermals are that Co it's it's just it's truncated you guys yeah yeah I never I never know like do I just leave out the sentence sometimes it's funny to leave it in sometimes I can into it with they're saying I have no idea yeah complicated it's it's a it's a real challenge no to me okay so yes it's co because it got cut off yes I mean complicated it's sounded like both of you were saying slang for cousin oh
okay yeah what do you know about cousin slang anyway what do you me help me step handheld okay I didn't mean that oh thanks for tuning in we'll see you again next week same bad time same bad Channel bye oh there's supposed to be a warning huh I'm supposed to get a warning when I brush this because the scroll is going to be longer than four minutes oh what do I do where's the button sign up for Pia with our link I'm  Dan buy something profitable on the store fault hold on get outro I'm going
to redo this uhhuh get ready to say byy again dude we sold a lot of let me know when uh those PTM 7950 yeah I can't believe we discounted those yeah let's try that I wonder if that was a mistake okay now say bye bye oh yeah yeah was my fault okay cool oh there's not even that many um oh what have you guys done oh my god what have you guys done yeah he's he why did you slow it down just hang up for a sec it's okay does it accelerate no what it's uh there's a strategy going on do you know how many is in the
quebe they started with 265 there's not that many anymore yeah obviously dancing lus okay so it lasts as long as the song now if it's past a certain amount of time I don't remember the what the amount of or if it's past a certain amount of messages I don't remember what the amount of messages is whatever 4 minutes is we're going to have to sit here for 4 minutes while this just I mean you can go home we could not yeah we could we could be that's that's no that's cheating
that's cheating you can't do that it's not four minutes yeah I thought it was supposed to be like two and a half I'm going to try and do them as they go thanks Dave I oh wow um oh wow great great start hi back Alex thanks Quinn P um thanks Victor M thanks Jonathan K I'm going to try to read one wow good luck a they scored they scored they scored man a lot of people just like didn't leave merch messages oh and they're gone
