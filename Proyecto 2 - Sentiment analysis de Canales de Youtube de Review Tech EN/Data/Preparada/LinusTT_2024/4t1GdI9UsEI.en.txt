plof 2004 Honda Civic has over a qu million kilometers on it but only one big problem it just won't die he'd love an excuse to upgrade it he could get modern amenities like a backup cam or Android auto but how do you justify replacing a car that still runs like the day it rolled off the lot I can't Windows still clear heat still hot even the fuel economy is nearly identical to the current model which is 20 years newer what can he do how about jumping onto a trend that's been picking up
steam and giving his older vehicle a little Tech makeover by the time we're done pl's going to have some big quality of life improvements and you guys are going to have some great hey hey I'm filming here and you guys are going to have some great ideas for adding features to your aging daily driver or for that matter taking back Fe features that manufacturers like GM have been cutting out of their vehicles oh and you're also going to have this message from our sponsor rocket money it's easy to lose
track of all your paid subscriptions but rocket money makes it easy to identify and cancel your subscriptions so you can save money check them out at the link below first things first we've got to get this Old Stock receiver out of here we're going to want to disconnect the battery then we picked up some inexpensive trim removal tools and these should help ensure that we don't cause any damage to the console beyond what the previous owner did now every car is a little different
but for this one we've got to remove all this trim to get at a couple of hidden screws underneath by the way you can check out the new nocta edition of the LTD screwdriver at LTD store.com all of this has got to come off AC controls stereo and the little compartment here plus all of the panel trim around the outside but what is wrong with your current head unit I mean you place compact discs yeah you know I mean aside from the fact that I got to use it FM transmitter play songs off my phone the
clock doesn't work doesn't keep time properly I'm throwing Google Maps on my phone in the cup holder let me put it this way I live in Siri it takes 30 seconds to break into this car and it's  here to solve all of that or at least the not living and Sir parts of it plof went with this Sony xav ax6000 most importantly it fits in the car but other than that it's got physical buttons easy Universal backup cam hookup Android auto of course but most importantly this is one of the more
premium ones with Wi-Fi so he doesn't need to plug his phone in every time he jumps in the car and if someone else wants to connect it's got a USBC Port as well you just run out of here to somewhere now there are a ton of other options out there like this Boss Audio be 920 wcpa that have similar features and for the most part good reviews but given that plof was willing to offer up his Chariot as a test bed for all this I agreed we should kit him out with something nice and then Sony was a bro
and sent it over for us anyway so thanks guys um there were also just a few concerning comments on the boss unit so take all of that for what it is warranties do exist but this isn't really the kind of project that you want to do twice if you can avoid it after ripping everything out we attach our new unit to the stereo mount by screwing it in then put on a new Double D fascia cover grab a compatible wiring harness and solder everything together while checking your wiring diagram once you're
done plug it in and do a test run big moment guys here we go pluged in get to this in a moment yep she's in okay hey there we go 6 hey xav ax6000 pairing okay allow access to contacts yeah cuz I'm going to use this for like phone calls everything to continue select Android auto on your CR start Android auto here we go cool dude this is awesome I know look Google Maps works like right away I don't have to put my phone down here anymore freaking a man like how does everyone not just do this I mean this
particular unit a little on the price your side but like here check this out guys there's still more stuff for us to do where that AV cable I had before I go oh you're sitting on it perfect check this out it's surprisingly simple compared to the last time I looked into head units anyway we just got the harness okay and then you just what there's basically everything and then there's audio and look at that simple composite video in for your camera if you can't connect through Bluetooth or
whatever even it's it's still got that USBC uh Port back here somewhere freaking he yeah it's not you know we'll have to Route it somewhere if I want to actually use it whatever put it through the glove box put it down here yeah who cares yeah yeah oh man what an upgrade great yeah it works great okay you got to play music hold on what do you look at look at this guy using his phone like a oh yeah W I can actually just use my phone what are you even doing bud crazy I'm not used to it anymore see sptify uh
okay fine that probably has DSP stuff in Alex the fact that this plays over Bluetooth at all is a W for us okay  dmca oh man you could have Phantom Imaging who you can probably do uh like out of phase in the rear get some stereo her like surround sound this guy with the level  now Flawless freaking Victory hardware buttons there's your volume right there huge point for me I do not want to rely strictly on touchscreen like the backup Cam and the dash cam are going to be great but this alone is like totally
worth it honestly I want to do this in my Odyssey now yeah that's the one thing about that van that I'm just like oh this sucks like I have one of those Dash mounted things for my phone and I hate it suck I hate them cuz they look bad and it's annoying and you got to use your phone battery put phone up there and better chance of getting a ticket too around here anyway they see you like touching something up there whereas you touch your dash whatever that's allowed because that's in my car sure do a
little bit of an EQ on the rears from "200 HZ to about 7,000" and then you can get like much better spatial stuff this is so far beyond what our goals for this project were but sure heck yeah I mean maybe we do another video when we swap the speakers hey what other video we only really asked for two things out of our backup camera Universal compatibility so that it would work with our Universal head unit and a decent camera at a reasonable price okay that's three things but the Kenwood
cosos 230 does all of them once again there are a lot of other options out there oh yeah more expensive less expensive including a bunch of allin1 solutions that come with their own little monitor that you attach to your dash or your review mirror and I mean man if you want to gamble a little like yeah what do you pay for something with a decent amount of reviews on Amazon like 60 bucks maybe $80 this Pixelman unit okay 4.4 Stars over 600 reviews but then we started reading the one star
comments and decided to stick with the car audio brands that we know and trust um I guess we'll need the extension to get this installed yeah the pretty funny thing is all the pictures on here are black and white but then it's got some disclaimers that are like don't camera allows full color images but carton image shown as black and white you know what's hilarious is it's a color package is it the there's blue yeah what what why would they why didn't they just print the whole thing in black and white
at this point okay there's a couple factors this is only two color printing whereas full color printing would have been a lot more okay I get it I get it I get it let's look they put the money into the product okay I guess we'll find out if I wanted the lowest possible maintenance right under there right under there yeah I think that's pretty typical that's also a really easy spot to punch through as well I guess we need a hole then yeah well we have a drill you love punching holes through
things I don't I don't mind it I don't mind it before anyone complains you can't find out anything about people from their license plates we're not going to bother blurring it in this video it's a lot of work yeah I don't really give some places it matters here it doesn't really yeah where does it matter uh there's places where by license plate there's like public Registries and you can just like look up stuff about people or something yeah  y hey easy look at that chipped like a
tiny bit there but I don't care about  that's fine whatever we might have to go one step larger oh yeah oh that's definitely a big enough hole now yeah that's good oh yeah okay nice nice all right now we just have to you know run it all the way to the front and hide it under some carpets get into car stuff yeah we're good to go I mean they're just rolling computers at this point after punching that hole we're going to feed our wires through and then attach it to the extension make sure
when you run the cable you leave some slack for opening and closing the trunk depending on how it's mounted we've zip tied it to these rails and then ran it through the back seats along the sides and out to the center console take the video cable and go up through the back to the head unit and then for power we're just soldering it onto our 12volt accessory since I don't need a cigarette lighter with more time you could definitely do a bit of a cleaner job but after throwing some Gaff tape over it
I'm honestly pretty happy with how it turned out we have camera it does still appear to be upside down okay rear cam is there like settings for rear cam I don't see any wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait rear camera view normal hold on hold on hold on flip boom got him we will have to do no such thing wait what it still looks flipped oh it wait Did you flip it already Justin no I did not okay it might be flipped instead of oh well hold on hold on maybe okay well what I don't know it's
fine we'll flip it physically we'll flip it physically it's okay yeah I think it's flipping it the horizontal way now things are about to get really interesting we really liked vo's offerings in our dash cam review video a little while back and like Sony they were down to send plof their new 4k a229 Pro an all-in-one model with front interior and rear monitoring that would have been great for a car a little newer than this one but unfortunately it's not compatible with our receiver that we
needed to add add Android auto to this car so why am I still holding it because it's got what is arguably the best sensor on the market the Sony starvis IMX 678 guys I'm talking HDR better low light image quality with lower noise 4K capture I mean at that point who cares if we can't monitor the feed from the head unit he's only going to need this thing in the event of an accident anyway so we're just going to put the 1440p rear camera aside and if you guys are looking for something similar the a229
pro is available in a single Channel configuration as well and if our test footage is anything to go by it looks great to power the dash cam we grabbed an Addis circuit fuse tap and tapped into my non-existent heated seats in the cabin fuse box then ran our wire up through the center console out the glove box and along the sides of the windshield to the camera I was offsite shooting something else for a little bit they got the dash cam installed very elegant wiring guys I love it what did
this used to be it was just a blank Port oh okay yeah how convenient and a wow that is a that is a nice long USBC cable get all the way to the back seat with that boy I guess I assume the intention in the longer term would be to have kind of a little grommet here or like a little plate or something like that you got a female USBC freaking love this All That Remains now is to get this dash cam mounted get the micro SD in there supports up to 512 gigs I can't get this VHB backing off it no no it's got this
it's got this yeah yeah oh there we go okay okay now there's a minor thing and we FP flip well no no no no no Flip Flip the cable flip the cable cuz we're going to go up here yeah yeah yeah and then hide it up there later later later can I just shout out USBC oh it's great you know oh yeah reversible my problems great just can't can't talk enough about how much I love USBC okay uh oh uh how do that feel we feeling that sure oh yeah oh yeah there we go okay turn the it's as straight as your Trio bar code
was wow thanks nice do we get to try it now yeah yeah yeah you get to drive it turn it on everything should work look I routed the well we should probably close the yeah that's a great idea what the hell don't do don't worry about it I think I got it reversed nope God up just leave it red light there we got power hey Dash Cam's alive oh it would have been kind of nice to be able to see that screen at all uh it's okay I really don't need it I only ever need it when I'm getting footage
from it hey look at that you know what's funny is this is more usable than the backup cam on my stupid TI can it's pretty good right have you seen the backup cam on is it really bad it's terrible it's terrible it's like unusable you know what that's not that much work no hey look at that look at that we're at the office I know I used it to drive home last night let's use a L Media Group yeah okay we're let's go to work boys where's volume control so kind of that's for music the only thing
with Android auto and Google is you've got to go in and go play test sound adjust volume volum oh there go already better easy as that yeah yeah we're on I already changed like wallpapers and stuff I've got the USB and the HDMI coming out of like right here what's  Rave that worked really well actually cuz right now we should just have the microphone kind of way down here we're going to plug it's plugged in but we've got to uh yeah feed it up to over here or something like that is where Alex
recommended it like up above the rear view hey there we go nice the system works it's not just GM taking Android auto away some car companies don't have it at all at all yeah which is horrible that's actually one of the big reasons that I wasn't even considering a Tesla when I got my car right you can't tell me that I'm going to have to rely on you for software updates I don't care if you're a new kind of automaker I don't trust automakers who what am I doing what am I doing oh yeah it's
actually really good quality yeah oh yeah oh yeah okay let's not hit this pole let see you can keep going that's probably about it yeah pretty hey hey hey not bad right you should see my piece of one here come check this out seriously Porsche fix this well how am I supposed to use this what is this that's tight yeah look out the back of there that's not tight no that's yeah that looks like I'm going to freaking hit it it does you're actually quite far away from it I I can't use this that's way
further than I thought they have another view that's it's kind of better but I have to press that every time and there's no guidelines anymore on you take the fisheye away oh my God what the Porsche the one on my Odyssey is better the one on my the one on the vault is perfect go buy a Chevy Volt okay and fix your that was terrifying yeah looking at that like that I know right if you guys are interested in anything that we used or mention today as always we're going to have all of it linked down below but
I got to say bottom line wasn't that bad no I mean sure some of the folks here are more experienced but these were very simple upgrades that result in a major major difference in quality of life for an older vehicle and if you think you're going to be driving it for another 5 or 10 years which like probably probably realistically like I got to say it's looking pretty worth it and if the current car software landscape keeps changing over the next 5 or 10 years and we see more folks like
GM a abandoned support for Android auto and carplay and we might even see this become a viable alternative to keeping your up today stuff you might be downgrading he you know who knows maybe if this video does really well we'll do some other stuff too power locks power windows cuz I've got the very base model remote start we need a sponsor though yeah someone like rocket money we both know you're not using every streaming service you're subscribed to meaning you're paying 10 bucks a month
