what's up everyone and welcome to the W show we've got a fantastic show lined up for you guys today yeah I forget what our headline topic was so I guess Luke's going to take it uh This is Wild a US appeals court has sided with music publishing Giants oh saying that isps should refuse service to users who are suspected of piracy someone's going to get their parents pretty mad in other news your vacuum is watching you and blasting out racial epithets oh what oh yeah no it's a whole thing I didn't
know that part yeah no it's it's it's not good oh boy the manufacturer thinks it's okay but no one else does speaking of things that are are bad in some ways uh are we moving uh are we moving we could talk about the feasibility of that yeah also uh you can talk to your dog now yeah you can talk you can talk to your dog you can talk to your dog with AI [Applause]  yay the show is brought to you today by acronis Squarespace MSI and of course our chair partner secret lab our laptop
partner LG and our rap partner dbrand who wrapped our table and wrapped my phone and wrapped yeah yeah they they just WAP things they don't like they don't like Melo melodious singing they've never wrapped a you they just rap wow nice does rap not have Melodies nice I mean yeah it can oh that's not the point the point is that Luke thought this was the headline topic which I find actually really interesting because interesting to me we've we've kind of we've you want to you want to should I pull back the
curtain and let them know why I thought this would be a good headline topic what's the point of even having curtains anyway right do they even match the carpet like just not right now um I mean same wow this was quick um  rails oh anyways no it just seemed clicky okay it's also like an actual discussion yeah well well that was it that was your curtain pulling back yeah jeez it seemed clicky remind me not to Camp outside of your apartment with binoculars cuz I'm not going to see anything that's 
so what I told Luke we could do on the show what I said we could do was we could go through the exercise of why it's really difficult for us to move because it's been a pain point for us for basically the last probably 3 years since we got the lab we've known that we were growing out of this space that we're in right now which is the old everything you know Studio office uh so we we expanded on the one side we expanded on the other side we hit a wall there there's a neighbor that's not
selling so that's it that this is where we are here and then we expanded to another unit elsewhere in our complex for Creator Warehouse uh who handles all the merch um and then finally we we were like okay well this is it we either need to kind of separate our operations and have different departments and different buildings kind of like we did with Creator Warehouse or we need to consolidate into one gigantic building and the gigantic building was going to be really really expensive not just
because it's expensive to buy a building but because the building you're going to get is going to cost an absolute Fortune to build out the way that we do and there just aren't actually really that many buildings at that size is what I said back then oh is there but the market has softened a lot here in Vancouver I mean there's remember I'm talking Industrial I'm talking commercial it's right still well let's have a look let's go through the exercise that I go through every
time I'm looking at commercial real estate and I'll talk about some of the things that can be uh really sort of appealing and some of the things that can be really challenging and why it's so hard to find something that's the right fit cuz like for for some context for viewers too right like we have if you if you think about the production team for videos that is pretty fragment right now literally none of the teams that might work together are actually close to each other even if it's writing
in Labs you're at opposite ends of the building and there's a big set of stairs and many sets of doors in between and it's very likely if you're going through those doors you're disturbing somebody in some Department um so it's like not really that small of a walk if you're either Labs or writing and you're talking to editing well I mean that's now a 10-minute walk or a two-minute Drive um how do we solve this well the Lego pieces don't really click together very well um there isn't a lot of office
space in the labs building there isn't enough space in general in the in the studio buildings parking is a nightmare at either one of them it's just like H okay anyways now In fairness to us it did look like the best solution for expansion at the time because building out something the way that sort of I expect us to do it for our team is really really expensive and that adds a lot to the cost of uh sort of abandoning what we've got here and then consolidating somewhere else for example
in the Lower Mainland so in in our area uh it is way abnormal basically unheard of unless you are um like a Food Distribution Company to have HVAC in your Warehouse so the fact that we have heat yes cuz you know you can't it can't be so cold that devices working properly or whatever but having air conditioning in an in a warehouse space pretty much unheard of in this area whereas all of our warehouse spaces are heated and cooled so that you know because we're not really using them in a warehouse
capacity and we don't really have like just Warehouse PE I mean I don't know I say that we don't just have Warehouse people working in them but that I honestly I don't think that's a good excuse either I think warehouses should probably be climate controll sometimes like uh like if you're a forklift driver you might have like aan mounted on the forklift like that like that doesn't  blows nice that's pretty good basically what I'm trying to say is I don't really care who you are or how much money you
make you're you're worth air conditioning when it's C when we have things called heat domes yeah and you're you're in a big metal box might be nice to be able to cool now In fairness to a lot of the the building owners and business owners in the Vancouver area it hasn't really been a problem until probably about the last five or six years like we used to have like one hot week of freaking summer and so whatever we're going to install tens sometimes hundreds of thousands of dollars worth
of air conditioning for like that one week no probably not but um we've made the plunge which means that any building we move into we have to you know put stuff like that into it which adds a lot to the buildout cost so uh let's take a look and let's let's talk about you know some of some of the challenges that we run into so uh callers is one of the sites that you know probably makes sense to use if you're looking for commercial real estate sure let's have a look ooh oh there's the look at this see this is
what I'm talking about Luke when I would have pulled up this map let's say let's say two years ago there would have been nothing right there would have been flipping this is such a terrible interface can you guys like be slightly slightly less of aites are brutal yeah they're so I always thought like you know if we could if we could go back and instead of making float plane we should have just made like realy software I know right they pay so much for it and it's so bad it's kind of crazy freaking wild
okay so this is kind of the area that we'd be looking at so here's where the office is now um and most of the team is living in you know kind of these are the urban centers you can tell from the the white instead of the green green is like for grass and trees and whatnot uh so you're going to have people living in kind of Maple Ridge kind of Langley um not too many people down in South Sur just because that's like the bougie area of the not the actual city city over here it's like the the bougie
BB oh wait you mean like uh potentially like employees or what do you yeah there's a bunch of people in South it's just really expensive yeah I'm talking about like where people who commute to this office here are are generally going to be coming from a little bit of kilum little bit of Burnaby a little bit of like further west but the more we were to move an office kind of this way into bernabe Marine Drive or like Richmond or something like that the more expensive housing is going to get um soare we have
found that yeah that too so we found that this is a this is a pretty good middle ground if we could be more like here that might be more better but okay let's close you're very nicely close to the highway just to give some people some context there the the this is Canada's only road yeah the Canada Highway that's that's the road everyone memes about when they're talking about  so's have a look this this what's in this area this is hilarious the first one that comes up is of course the court
ordered sale for the uh yeah the aspirational mall in sui so wait Newlands is for sale yeah Newlands golfing Country Club is for sale what dude okay what if we what if we what if we could bring like telemetry golfing data and like what if we made a high-tech Golf Course okay Luke and had an office there get this the combined the combined estimated value of Creator Warehouse the studio and the lab is probably in the neighborhood of around $25 to $30 million okay okay get this how much do you think new's golf
and country club is worth it is 111 "Acres with 990,000 ft building to to put" "for some context we're in about 40,000" ft combined what do you think nand's golf and country club is worth that's like pretty nice building and there's like Kitchen on site I'm assuming that has a cost I'm assuming they're not just ripping that out oh no I'm not going to look at chat um yeah don't look at chat don't look at chat they're going to help you cheat my first hunch is like 350 350 what mil 350
mil really try 40 40 what so what do you think we move lmg let's buy newand to Newlands Golf and Country Club wait how is it actually is there something going on with it dude I have no idea cuz how is it multiple times bigger than ours the facilities are like  nice oh man what how is it so cheap that much land so there's there's like look like I said there's some stuff going on in the Vancouver area right now how how do you get 112 acres some of the big money I think is moving is it zoning is
moving out okay so we'll talk about that some of the big money though is moving out of Vancouver real estate because of some of the recent changes that the Trudeau Administration has made to uh the way that um uh taxes on capital gains work so there has been like an emergency fire sale of some very high value assets and there's only so many buyers for a 40 million so for contexts that's about3 million a little less like 29 or something P cooled computer right how fun would that be gaming PC in your golf
cart we could overclock one of the oh no you don't do that with golf never mind okay I was thinking baseball like when it shoots the so so part of this is that it does seem like uh there is there's a bit of um there's a bit of bubble bursting going on um I think that part of it is a demographic shift so you've got a because realistically I'm probably one of the only people in my cohort that is like running a a a small to medium you know like like a business of this size yeah you know most of the
businesses in our area are run by Boomers and what's happening with Boomers they're retiring right so when you retire you either are looking to sell sell your your your business and retain the asset and keep collecting rent from it as like your pension or you're looking to sell the building take a big bucket of cash spend it on you know some other crap give it give some of it to your kids uh spend some of it on like a lakefront property over on the island you know whatever you want you
want the big bucket of cash and then you keep running the business for your pocket money instead of hookers and blow  painkillers sorry  trying that's good thank you um or or you're selling both pieces and you're just like screw it this is so much of a nest egg that I'm going sit on this Nest Egg forever and yeah yeah so I think there's some of that happening as well and then the other big one that you already touched on is zoning so this right here why am I on the just new cam
this is this is zoned essentially for operating as golf a golf course yeah so I didn't think but cuz I was I was trying to think of the acreage cuz the that amount of acreage here if you turn that into five story walk-ups infinite money oh for sure and to be clear there is some development potential you can see there's about 6 Acres of um nonagricultural land Reserve so that means you basically can't do jack with it like you could buy you could buy a 5050 Acre Farm for less than
like a one acre residential lot in some cases okay not quite but but the point is that this agricultural land Reserve Land is worth functionally nothing compared to um compared to you know something that you could actually build residential or build industrial or commercial on um there's a whole lot of other red flags here Landmark status oh no what does that mean you don't want anything with status you don't want Heritage status Landmark status I've heard of herit her status I
I don't know what landmark status is I don't care I don't want to know that sounds terrible basically it means there's red tape that you're going to have to jump through if you want to do anything other than sit in the office there and run a golf course okay what' you find what' you find uh historic place I haven't got anything specific yet but the first Google brings you to Historic place which I'm assuming is essentially the same thing as Heritage status yeah you you don't want you don't
want any of that you don't want any part of that okay so we're not buying a golf course because you know it's stupid basically um what what else we got what else we got here okay so yeah we're not we're not buying the the city block in sui that's been rotting since the 90s we talked about that last week you're going to find a lot of stuff that's for lease um and the thing is leasing yeah it's an option um if you can afford to buy though the fact that we have owned this has saved us
literally literally I've liked that approach I've supported that approach the whole time literally millions of dollars because your landlord in in the time since we bought the first three units we paid a million dollar for three units one of those units is now worth about 1.1 or something like 1.2 essentially quadrupled in value which means that if we had leased it our rent would have quadrupled putting money in the pocket of our landlord when instead we were able to invest that money in our own
Equity that we can now use to cross shop something else so if you can afford to buy I'd like to buy even though with that said the market is you know not going too great right now but sorry one sec lomac in phing chat said we pay half a million dollars a year for our business property and Port KS for our lease of our business property ands that's a lot of money dude that's a lot of freaking money half a mill and the thing about commercial leases is they are way worse than residential leases
like and I know residential rent agreements and Lease agreements can be brutal they can be so burdensome for the renter um especially if you live in an area where you don't have ample protections but commercial whole other level they're what are called trip net which essentially means that you pay for your rent and they get to advertise that leas rate which is going to be per square foot um you know probably somewhere in the neighborhood of like1 to $18 a square foot depending on sort what
you're looking at let's say $10 to $20 a square foot then you have something called additional rent what's your additional rent go ahead and ask me what what yeah what what is that is that like Power and Water no you pay no you pay your own utilities I have genuinely no idea me neither it's whatever it is I just pass through to you whatever property tax I pay whatever building maintenance I might incur now I as the landlord have to pay it up front so if the building needs a new roof I pay for
the roof but then what I do is I pass the I pass the expense along to you and you pay me back yearly in installments for that roof for my building oh my God  baby so um yeah yeah commercial commercial leases absolutely brutal apparently additional rent can go up by any percentage Yeah so additional rent is used to circumvent the maximum percentage increases for rent because if they can't increase the base rent they just increase the additional rent by any percentage they want so it could be this
is obviously not real but it could be like 300% cuz they're like ah we need it to make up for whatever yeah yeah commercial uh commercial leases I also I'm just like Googling this stuff I don't know if this is 100% true or not don't take this as a fact it's shirle times says never sign a triple net lease you will not find a lease in the Vancouver area that isn't trip net and that's that's even now even now that things are a bit more of a buyer Market I think our vacancy last time I looked
at the the report for it was uh under 1% real vacancy because some of the vacancy is not even real it's like it's fake because it's vacant now but it's just pending uh yeah it's absolutely brutal so you pay the base rent property taxes building insurance and utilities as well as other operating and maintenance costs the landlord assumes no cost other than structural repairs and structural that mean that doesn't mean roof that means like found the foundation essentially unless the building collapses into the
sea they are not responsible for anything and that whole and you're paying the insurance by the way to cover if that happens the whole other operating cost thing is where you're getting killed because they can Define anything that way other operating cost could be I don't know the landlord decides to pay himself "$440,000 an hour I don't know who knows" yeah or they hire trades that are like their buddies to to do any of the work yeah pass that along to you that's not their problem yeah yeah so it's a whole
it's a whole thing it bral it leaves itself obviously glaringly open to abuse um but that's the system we have cool all right what else we got okay we've got residential development course not a park is for sale brother what is that it's it like Willowbrook like like the shop wait what like the shopping center not Willowbrook Mall the one like right across from it Willowbrook Park Willowbrook Park is for sale the whole thing the whole thing "200,000 Square ft of" retail what I know right 90 million dude
and the number of court ordered sales that I've seen recently what the hell freaking wild Mayfair industrial what's going on okay so this is people running out of money yeah so interest rates have been high for a while long and it takes a while because your mortgage is going to be on two year three year fiveyear 5year renewal term right so so if you were on a fixed mhm so in a in many cases these properties are owned by people who are using them as a land bank essentially they're just parking their
money in an asset that unlike cash isn't going to just inflation rot itself into Oblivion um theoretically you know land um gold crypto I'm not endorsing any of these particular assets but typically assets are as long as they aren't hyper volatile ones can are a safer storage of wealth than just cash because there's nobody actively trying to deflate the the value of it um so what's happening is all of a sudden if you if you don't own the property out right like if you if you are if you're just hoping that
you know your rent is going to cover your mortgage uh while the asset appreciates that calculus just like for many residential owners is changing the second that you renew your mortgage and you're not getting essentially free debt anymore so this land bank might be appreciating although in the case of Vancouver as I mentioned the market softening so it maybe isn't appreciating it's either it's either not appreciating so much or it's it's just stagnating and now it's costing you way more than you
thought it was so you're sitting here going okay well there's no upside to this let's sell Willowbrook Park which should be clear some that's an outdoor mall yeah that's some across the street yeah y um so it's not some people were like LTT mall it's like yeah I don't think it would be as interesting because it's m yeah not so much um this one's kind of interesting you you'll find a a lot of the good land has been kind of developed sectioned off in way so what's left as
development opportunities is going to be a lot of these like super weird shaped sites yeah um this is a good shaped site um four acres though of it are encumbered by BC Hydro easement so you got to watch out for you got to watch out for easements because that pretty much means 2/3 of this BC Hydro which is our our power Monopoly uh needs to be able to access drive on and access essentially y um so that one yeah probably not super appealing okay what else what else we got here um okay development um office
units and this is this is not going to be that relevant to us um yeah yeah residential residential you put in property type and stuff you could use the filters okay yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah sure use the filters techman sure I'll use the filters I'll use the filters all right let's get uh you know what let's uh let's look at let's look at office too why don't we look at industrial and office LT Towers Linus Tech Towers oh paved and fenced yard area oh I can lease a yard oh yeah you're
welcome I'll just pay your mortgage for you uh what else we got oh man this is far this is really far also small too small brand new industrial facility in P Porco quum this is too small this is only about the size of the lab so if the lab was big enough then we could do that so even now you can see with all of these options available to us there's really not that much that would actually be suitable for us to move into unless you just yeah make your own town dude we don't want to be on anss
island Dan's given them no thank you don't want to be there no thank you a it's really far B it's like the traffic burn your nostrils out for the rest of your life that and it's like the the kind of the old industrial like crappy Island it's like uh lot of sulfur pass and you guys play ano anyone play ano okay so they put all the stuff that contributes to less beautification of your Island you know you move it all onto steel smelting steel Island that's anesis Island essentially the rug of
Vancouver you just push everything under there yeah um okay we can actually we can actually change our listings to just things that are for sale to kind of narrow things down a little bit basically there's there's not actually that much and part of the problem is that Center dude there's a big there's a big Industrial Park further down like down here in Campbell Heights um that's pretty far from any population centers because like I said most people are not living in South Sur so people are mostly
living here and they're Liv here and they're living here um so the farther down South we go the more challenging it gets so Campbell Heights is down here there was one that seemed kind of interesting but it keeps as you're scrolling around it keeps oh I'm sorry the quad uh no that in C Heights no it was scrolled down it's not that mall again is it we're not buying that mall no no no it was scrolled down okay court ordered s was right here though I don't know where you were looking at the time
dang I'm so sorry Luke I'm not sure maybe you'll see it uh there is uh there is kind of an interesting one in uh in Port Kell's so that's up in this area so it's uh it's kind of a sister building to the smash Champs Badminton Center building uh this is too far dude being right next to smash Champs would be sick I would love it but the problem with Port Kels is that it is bestass lunch breaks crazy expensive oh crazy crazy expensive way out in Delta yeah why do I even why do I have Delta on the map okay
let's get let's get Delta out of here we don't need to see anything in Delta um yeah I think that's about it I mean is there any is is there anything else you want to look at you want to ask like why not that one cuz I'll be happy to oh is it this one uh 192 Business Center it wasn't but let's look at it sure yeah we can look at 192 Business Center so this one is very similar to smash Champs pretty nice brand new building right pretty sick okay let's have a look "ooh look at that up to 50,000 ft 32t"
clear ceilings lots of power 200 amps woo got that high efficiency LED lighting it's it brand new buildings man really nice there's some very nice to haves but there's a big problem with brand new buildings you notice something here they talk a lot about when it's going to be complete and how many Dock and grade loading Bays you've got and how close it is to Highway A1 okay how close it is to the airport ah okay so here's our problem how many parking stalls do we have yeah this is very common with new
buildings they just don't put enough parking at all because you sell the building based on the square footage yeah that's the calculation that everybody is doing yeah but the parking stalls don't count towards square footage so develop ERS and you know what part of this is honestly probably a good thing because less parking less cars if people were riding their bikes or taking Transit more that would be awesome I can tell you right now uh not a whole lot of that is happening here yeah um it just
it just it just isn't um so so part of it is is good aspirationally if we were using more public transit but the reality now is that that would accommodate maybe a quarter of our company right now and my understanding don't quote me on this my understanding is that Bey the developer of this property worked out a deal with the city where they didn't have to account for any street parking parking in their development uh so they were able to effectively like build right to the road like right to the the
travel areas of the road so while in the building we're in now also has inadequate parking probably about the same ratio like a new building with would have because they want to maximize the square footage they can sell um ours at least has street parking it's not ideal nobody likes walking trudging to the building through the snow or whatever in the winter it's fine but we have itable yeah yeah whereas at least there is somewhere to put your car this you'd be you'd be parking probably in
the neighborhood of like five to six blocks away which if it's anything like smash Champs which I actually did have to pace out because we were trying to figure out what parking would look like for a l event for example so at Lan events if we can get the city on board at smash which by the way oh we can talk about that we submitted our package to them this week we gave the city our package did you know we did was it well received I think so nice I think so I think they they were you ask them they
they admired it was it good for you so so we gave them the package um we could talk about that a little bit more later actually I pretty excited to talk about uh wh land but if it's anything like smash it's it's brutal basically you're it's fine if you're coming in once a quarter for an event yeah but if you're commuting every day and you're like hiking from your car you're going to need like an electric scooter in your car just to do the last leg of your commute which is a little
ridiculous so that's the problem there's a video upgrading every one of my employees cars with like a electric scooter storage sorry keep going the older buildings will have more parking they'll have more yard space but they will lack a lot of nice to haves that are going to need to be upgraded that are going to cost money the newer buildings are built with the new meta uh which means you get a lot of more upto-date nice stuff good power uh good LED lighting they're way more efficient in terms of keeping in
heat and keeping out cold that sort of thing which is money but they have no parking what else we got here we don't have to do this much longer if you guys are bored underground parking okay so I find this stuff interesting rer asks what about underground parking over in float plane chat very little of it here um you know no well like the water table or something what I would okay so a I suspect there is something to do with that but I don't know anything about the actual engineering of it what I can tell
you is that the way that property values have skyrocketed here in such a short period of time has changed the calculus for underground parking in a big way so it would have been not that long ago that underground parking didn't make any sense here it's really expensive it's it's it's the last quote I got was about "$100,000 Canadian dollars per stall and" that is going to be somewhat dependent on what kind of a building you're building and like whether you would have had to like dig a big hole anyway versus
if you're digging it just for the express purpose of putting cars in it um but pretty much until land values went to the mo here it made way more sense to do the Suburbia thing and just sprawl your parking lots so what I suspect is we'll see a lot more of them in the future but they don't really exist here at least not now because it didn't make any sense it was it the land was not worth so much that it was worth digging into it in order to the only thing you'd see it for was apartment
buildings generally y I don't necessarily know why but that was the thing yeah shraf 2K says you can always add nice to Hales you can't add more parking stalls you can yeah Rd Raph says rooftop parking yes yes that is technically possible but you're going to have to re-engineer the entire bloody structure to hold all the cars on the roof so that's going to be that's going to be requiring some budget some budget just you know have a have a program where uh a certain percentage of the
employee base gets gets free Ubers to work I actually kind of like this one it's really close to home I've seen this before but part of the problem is that "while it does have 100,000 square ft of" building on it uh I don't think is that train oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that's the rail I mean okay look okay let me get to that let me get to that it has "100,000 ft of building on it but those" are the buildings oh we ain't using those buildings no this is what we call In The
Biz a tear down so that would help you know with mitigating train noise is you could you know double insulate your walls or whatever else like you could you could actually going to solve it it won't solve it but it would it would do a lot um but the cost of this because "you're essentially buying $100,000 worth" of buildings that um you are going to then wrect uh makes this just not make any sense I don't even think they have a price quoted on this one I might have asked at some point but I can't
remember but yeah this one's uh yeah interesting but unfortunately no what's also cool about this one is it's over the 196 Street border which means that we'd be eligible for More film and Production Services tax credits I suspect whoever's selling it is hoping that whoever buys it wants the buildings to just store stuff from the Train in so that don't they don't need to be nice yeah unfortunately that's not me so get wrecked me yep yeah someone asked this um and I I can think of some
reasons why this might be rough but there is there are examples of this around the area but empty land yeah there's not much and a lot of what is a lot of what's empty land is ALR so you'll you'll see it you'll look at it and you'll be like oh yeah look how many buildings we could put here what what if we made I mean there's Clarkson's Farm it's doing very well what about a server Farm what if we had L what if we had Linus's Farm ding it ding the thing you have to ding your own thing what if we did
Linus's Farm what's like what's the minimum we would need to farm it could be fine you can do things like chickens and it's like whatever six pigs or something it's less that how much minimum we would need to farm and it's more how much maximum other things could we do there we couldn't have a Production Studio on a farm because that would devalue the the Production Studio zoned land that somebody else bought before also pretty much all of our Farmland in the Lower Mainland is um
flood plane and I don't know about you but I'm not super into buying things that are going to be underwater soon uh or could be underwater soon we have had some very significant floods here our our only Road was wiped out for a substantial amount of time because of um basically a lake that we were we UNL and then it decided to Rel Lake itself it's fun when things Rel Lake themselves yeah breweries on ALR with their own hops have issues with the ALR y y I mean I know of a small amount of people in BC
that are aggressively skirting ALR rules and I think if someone from the ALR just took a little drive around a lot of places in BC and cared at all a lot of people would lose their their setups um so it makes me care less when it feels like more than half of it is being abused um and it makes me want to do it ourselves I get such a kick out of the gigantic Mansions the Omega mansions on Farmland with no farming going on ever like this is oh we got him going we got him going here boys here we go here we
go at least my my biggest thing is like you should at leasing attempt you should at least try put something there why is it just open grass field you don't have horses there's noing horses there's nothing else you're doing nothing how do they get away with this I know the whole flip I've heard the stories I know the flip of you you bring an outside company to plant some junk and then you have them also come pick it and you make Z off of it but the whole thing is so that you can have your stupid probably
disgusting looking terribly designed building on this plot of land in the middle of nowhere that you live in and do nothing else and probably don't see anyone because you're xenophobic for some reason anyways um I hate anyways um wow but it's all just it's all a joke I've also heard that a huge percentage of that crop just gets thrown away because they're just growing whatever they're not growing based on what we need they're growing based on and it's not being properly treated it's
just being planted and then pulled out of the ground at the end of the season right yeah that makes sense so like it's a lot of it's junk like it's just it's this clear obvious insane charade and there's parts of BC that you can literally drive around for a very long time where you're just going mansion with no Farm mansion with no Farm mansion with no Farm mansion with no farm for like ever it's it just it really makes you not surprised when you drive around Farmland in BC figuring out
that there's more corruption in BC than like practically anywhere cuz you're like I wonder where do all the people live that that have all this corruption and then you drive around what should be farmland and you're like oh it's oops all mansions  anyways all right yeah good chat I'll relax so anyway uh we still have our ear to the ground and I suspect I'm talking as much to our staff as I am to our viewers at this point we still have our ear to the ground but it's it's a
challenge um Taran sent me one actually the other day that looked pretty cool um it's a little far from my house which I'm not a huge fan of um move more videos more videos it would be far from a lot of oh You' have to set up your new house uh I really don't want to move um here let's see if I can oh wait not this one no this was me free content this was me sending him the stupid uh the stupid content dude let me see if I can find it oh yeah here we go um 85 North Fraser away honestly it
looks pretty cool one of the big problems is like the really good Solutions are going to be so far out um and then they they become bad solutions for other reasons oh yeah that's right relocating the whole company okay hold on you asked about empty land yeah that's a big problem for empty land um is that it's all really far out I know I've seen some locally but it's probably like residential or something dude smash Champs was a completed building when we got it think about how long it
took us just to do the tenant Improvement oh yeah if we're building a building it's like two to three years before we will actually move into it you just you spin up a new channel L building tips LBT um I you Clarkson's Farm it I can't find this for some reason what if you don't even hire a Contracting Company what if you are the Contracting Company what if you sorry what if you don't I got a concrete mixer we could do that in a weekend let's do it let's do it we got a laser level in
logistics it'll be fine we can figure it out yeah we'll figure it out well all the walls are just made of conduit L said he likes conduit we just make it out of conduit you never have any problems running any cables no might be a little loud no you put insulation like  the oh my God we're figuring it out this is why you're C so smart he so smart oh no bikes between the buildings keep looking we uh we keep our ear to the ground um we we kind of you know watch what's happening
with the market and and we hope that at some point we can find something but and and we're going to look at moving some departments around um you know to have people who work together more closer together but it's it it is actually pretty tough and part of the problem is like you said the way that we built this place out peace meal means that it's not as flexible of a space monal monil mon okay anyway um what do you want to talk about next messages we should put train tracks behind the buildings and
then get those old bikes that you can ride on train tracks okay uh merch messages apparently oh oh there's something really exciting for Merch messages though uh this is oh my God there's so many there's so many announcements it's kind of too many announcements guys yeah we might have to dial back the announcements but okay fine first double sweet 16 live stream we just hit 16 million subscribers on the on the LT Channel and we're currently planning a stream for November for our 16th
anniversary how did those things line up so perfectly 1 million subscribers a year not bad we're tentatively planning to look back at some of our most watched videos and do 16 builds that we're going to auction for charity on Jaa wow so that's coming up November 16th uh oh no for November for I don't know sometime in November um and now a seg way to our sponsor and it says dan will play a video hi it's James from LTT store anyone ever tell you don't clean your screen with your T-shirt screw their
rules cuz we made a t-shirt for exactly that purpose a regular shirt would scratch up your since the LT microfiber t-shirt is made out of soft fabric Loops it won't this is for your car your jar your glasses your phone and it's got this soft and cozy jersey fabric interior so you can just wear this puppy all day long as a certified glasses cleaner this works unlike you it's made by nerds you know that nerds always make  order if you want sarcastic ads Riley and James are just like the way to go
that was fantastic I had not seen that before the best part is it wasn't satire it's I've been wearing it the whole show you didn't even know except for the people that asked if my shirt was wet it's a real product now look guys that funny that funny video aside I do I do not want to oversell this thing because it is not up to the regular standards of our regular t-shirts it is not as comfortable it is literally made of microfiber cloth material okay that means it has some disadvantages in terms
of comfort which I already kind of touched on but it also has some advantages Advantage number the first it's really warm it y it is actually like uncomfortably warm if you are moving around a lot it's like a sweater yeah yeah it it it also means that like the sizing and the and the drape um are a little different a little different than our typical shirts so it ends up with kind of like a very fitted fit I would say if you like our this is me wearing our like my typical size so if
you like our our typical fit this isn't going to be it you could maybe size up or you could just I don't know not buy the microfiber shirt I tend to wear xl's I put on the XL microfiber shirt my arms didn't fit yeah yeah it's it's a little tighter cuz it's not it doesn't have this is a 2 XL I normally wear an XL it doesn't have the same it doesn't have the same stretch you know um but but here okay let's do let's do a little experiment okay I got a here usually my face is greasier than my hands okay so
you know got that get that get that face grease on there okay oh stop it okay okay you guys see pretty uh you can see that pretty greasy right HH okay watch this boom I don't even need to I don't need to go find a cloth nowhere I don't got to I did notice like it seems like the the microfibers I guess are like a little shorter maybe than in some cloths so it might take a little bit more work but it it works she's perfect look at that she's she's completely like new isn't that beautiful isn't that a
beautiful thing so um it's as much a meme as it is a real product it's one of those enjoy it it's one of those products that came about as sort of a like what if we what if we do this yeah we should do it for April fools no let's just do it I asked I asked to to make sure that we didn't order too many and it sounds like that's probably true oh no yeah no we we didn't order that many of them which might mean order now you might not get one yeah you might not get a lot of
opportunities to get your hands on this but that might be okay um so anyway if you're into it if I will say it's a conversation starter I'll tell you that much I mostly forgot I was wearing it I don't think it's that bad Elijah in the chat said it gave him sensory issues your experience may vary yeah yeah doing this doesn't feel great if I was going to go in a jog in this thing I think I'd be pretty upset doing this with your arms is is not awesome have you tried that rub it against yeah the elbows CU it's
you know it's microfiber right so you'll like you'll like rug burn yourself if you want to know what it feels like go find a microfiber cloth you know one of those blue ones and you know put it on yourself you know but anyway yeah um why don't we take a little break from announcements and do a couple merch messages so the way to send a merch message is to just go on LTT store.com put something in your cart you'll see a little box for Merch message and once you check out it'll go to producer Dan
who will forward it to us or put it down there or who will reply to it himself or who will send it to someone else internally let's show you what it looks like when he curates them for us sorry uh Digi brat said uh can we get it with a Star Trek logo I said like right when I sat down at it I was like wow it looks like a Star Trek shirt you can put your own Star Trek logo on it yeah we are not we are not licensed by Paramount or whoever the heck to yeah there yeah that's not going to happen yep then
again you never know if you don't ask true but it would cost way more you really want to like guys there's a reason that licensed merchandise always sucks it's because the money goes into licensing the brand rather than finding the finest microfiber rags build your shirt it's incredibly expensive yeah hit us Dan sure hey D loving my Precision kit already used it to fix my switch blade yesterday lonus what's your favorite genre of music to clean your  uh oh I don't know I I uh man I always I always
struggle when people ask me about my taste in music because it's pretty random um and I know like everyone says that everyone says like oh yeah I I listen to like really random music but like no really so I got some some Maroon Five here I got some Tupac I got some Michael Jackson I've got some Ghostbusters Ghostbusters theme music like May a no it's like actually like random like you could just throw a dart at you know got some Annie Lennox in here like I don't know uh I'll listen to
Shia Twain you know or like uh like Taylor Swift's first album I'll listen to kind of like pop country okay I'm not into much country country um I came I came across a oh man uh-oh um what's the song called song pillar Seven Pillars of something I came across these guys Seven Pillars of awesome no isn't that a thing Sabaton Seven Pillars of wisdom I came across these Sabaton guys when I was playing uh beatsaber the other day and it's like it's like freaking awesome um the first thing that I thought when I
when I heard this song was like there's no way that Adam saard from the writing department does not listen to these guys cuz it's just like it's like the most it's it's the most adom thing ever so yeah I don't know random legitimately random yeah I'm fairly all over the place as well well I thought it was sea shanties with you no that's for the birds yeah I know but I mean that's what you're listing to while you clean the house for better for worse than it does play a very often percentage of the time
uh yeah it'll be that or like some local radio station just cuz like the radio clock thing that we use to make sure that they have music just like plays radio stations but I never listened to it it I don't really know what's happening or care um nice yeah I don't know it I think it'll kind of depend on like the vibe like is I'm am I speed cleaning maybe like metal or something just go for it let her rip um no metal I I don't really do I don't really do metal I don't really do like like
really like uh vocalists I don't really find it appealing that's probably my one thing yeah I think the metal that I listen to doesn't have as much of that M mhm I'm not 100% certain but I think so um all right Dan hit us sure lus I had I just had my second born last Saturday any tips to make it easier on the first born they are both boys so I want to build that brotherly Bond um communication you know be honest talk about you know what's going to be good talk about what's going to be not as
good always make sure you only have one  okay he's being a bit of an ass about it but he's actually kind of not wrong because if you don't teach them to share um they're not going to learn later so I I we we go out of our way to buy one of things in fact you're going to see this uh we've got an upcoming video um where the kids asked for a karaoke setup I am not a karaoke guy I don't bluo speaker in a phone I don't know anything about it uh but I was like oh well there's an opportunity to uh
offload the research for my child's birthday wish to um one of our staff members and all I have to do is make a video about it which may actually be relevant because uh when I tried to do the research myself I discovered that karaoke is one of those rabbit holes that's like dash cams um where it's just it's just flooded with AliExpress garbage tons of products you don't know which one's good and no reliable information so we kind of came in and we're like okay we are going to
demystify anyway when I when I kind of have my hands on their eyes to be like ah reveal I'm like okay you know how we do that thing where sometimes your birthday present is for everybody well we're doing that again um and and that is something that we do on a pretty cool way to do it in my opinion a pretty regular basis like this you know is your birthday present but it actually doesn't belong to you um so and another example of that is that Water Scooter thing the the underwater scooter um I bought that
as a birthday present for my middle child uh but I made it very clear when I gave it to the when I gave it to her that she got to write it first sure and beyond that it's everybody's it was for everybody to enjoy you can get some credit for maybe the idea yep if if it like goes really well everyone's like oh yeah this is great it's like oh thanks for you know requesting this or whatever I don't know yep that's cool but you've got to yeah you've basically got to um you basically got to set the ground
rules now and and you've got to micromanage it like oh man I forget what kind of ridiculous passive aggressive thing one of the kids said to the other last night but I was just like hey that's rude um what should you have said and what do you need to say now you know you need to apologize now like you  another top oh yeah let's do another topic what do you want to talk about we do more I wanted okay no let's do a real topic oh I wanted to see it the whole show okay uh SpaceX sure let's go SpaceX literally
catches a rocket midair that's pretty cool uh it's actually insane SpaceX made history during its fifth flight uh for uh for the company's two-stage Starship vehicle this week which is intended to take astronauts to the moon in the upcoming Artemis 3 mission the Rockets first and do many other things to be clear the Rocket's first stage the super heavy booster the most powerful booster ever made not only carried the upper stage Starship uh spacecraft to an altitude of 65 km or 40 Mi above the
Earth but successfully separated and then it says slowly descended very rapidly descended towards extremely rapidly descended towards the launch Tower um after a breaking burn which looks sick the 71 m or 233 ft or some people are calling 19 story tall rocket booster used uh just three of its 33 engines that's also not correct uh to maneuver towards the tower's massive mechanical arms which uh clasped onto the booster sort of I can explain that too in a moment uh catching it in midair
sort of um the Starship spacecraft itself climbed to an altitude of 89 M or 143 km and cruised towards the Indian "Ocean slowing itself from over 16,000" mph to near zero uh as it splashed down in the water as intended um and it was cool how they did that because while they didn't catch the Starship it kind of like positioned itself as if it could have been M and then went into the water cuz they they were still trying to test for Telemetry stuff so there's some details about this that aren't
immediately apparent um Dan and I were talking about this before the show do you see the fins can you make this full screen you see the fins that's not what catches it the Chopsticks or the arms also do not pinch it right when they called it Chopsticks a lot of people imagined that it was like grabbing it and holding it with like friction or something that's not what happened um also the fins that come out that you can see are not what caught it there's these tiny little in
reality they're like bigger than a person but the thing's 16 or 19 stories taller whatever so it looks insane apparently it did use three engines for the maneuvering sort of it also used a lot more of that first more than that first and then went down to three 13 then three says Shamy Shamy heel that is correct um so yeah there's they're two I'm again I'm saying little they're they're not that little just in comparison to the structure they're tiny you can barely even see them there's
these two little tiny arms that come off the side and there's uh sections of the Chopsticks that actually go up to touch them so what's actually connecting is very small and like even the the turn of the ship had to be perfect so it didn't just have to be aligned like within the Chopsticks at all it also had to be turned to the like almost exact right angle and they nailed it I think I had a better angle of it but realistically um you should just look it up yourself so that those people get the views um but
there's cameras that are closer where you can see those those little arms that that actually catch onto the Chopsticks um that was wild to watch super super cool massive success there first time they ever tried it which is insane um and uh also again yeah the Starship itself while it you know went into the water and blew up that was entirely the int tradition yeah um but but watching how it like kind of came in and and positioned itself nicely and then set into the water and then was like cool
mission complete fell over and exploded was wild they had these little buoys in the water you could tell it landed in the right spot because this buoy that I don't think they were controlling is just sitting there and it comes right into view nicely um but one of the if you watch the footage of the buoy one of the like fragments of the Starship flies and smacks the buoy nice so it was like pretty close um but yeah that was that was genuinely extremely cool to watch and even if you're not super into space
stuff like this is this is a mindblowing feat of engineering um watching watching something 200 1 33 ft tall come flying in at crazy speed and then just catch itself is nuts I mean I'm impressed when my my little handheld drone hovers yeah you know yeah I don't know that's a lot easier to deal with this this this whole thing was uh yeah extremely extremely fun to witness I'm happy that it happened um what do we talk about next what was our announcement topics we moved the vacuum the vacuum yeah all
right your vacuum is watching over the past several days there have been widespread reports from owners of ecovac robot vacuums who say that their vacuums have started acting strangely including screaming obscenities at their owners and chasing their pets the as it turns out these vacuums were remotely accessed by bypassing their pin code which does not use serers side validation once hacked the these maliciously controlled vacuums gave the hackers control of the vacuum and access
to its video feed at least one hacking victim a lawyer expressed relief that the vacuum had only been used to broadcast lurd language rather than used to silently spy on the household yeah eax the company was warned about this issue by security researchers get this back in December of 2023 after security researchers spoke out publicly eax gave a statement to TechCrunch saying they would not fix the security flaws pointed out by the researchers and telling users not to  this earlier this month the Australian
Broadcasting Corporation successfully demonstrated that they could easily hack an ovax vacuum and used it to spy on a colleague's family without them noticing this is in part because the vacuum doesn't play a camera recording warning sound unless it is being accessed from the eax app note this hack was performed with prior consent okay cool this I didn't know I had never heard of them before but eax vacuums are some of the most popular in the world primarily because they are very cheap our
discussion question here is should we be more cautious about and then it just kind of trails off there that's fine the team didn't have a lot of time to put together the notes today um uh yes yeah yes discussion question we should be more cautious about I think the the camera flip thing that was made for the Logitech c920s I don't know if it was actually made by Logitech or not but do you know what I'm talking little privacy screen yeah I I I just I just put all my c920s up that I got for the
land Center last weekend cuz I finally got around uner ones do my original one didn't it comes with a little plastic clip and it goes on the front and then it's a little flappy do thing oh man if it was a physical little thing no no that wouldn't make sense I'm just not convinced that these robot vacuums actually save any time just cuz they kind of suck well it's they're helpful for me a do it uh um maybe it's just because I've never had a house layout that's conducive to using
them mine barely is but with the constant mess that birds create and the actual ease of cleaning that mess up it's nice just having something on routine that'll go through and do a pretty decent job and then you can do a proper one every however long um but having something go like every day or even twice a day to pick up you know the seed that they've thrown out of the cage or or little bits of feather or or whatever El elf whatever else is is kind of nice okay that's that's a fair that's
a fair assessment I guess for me the issue was just at our old place there were there were so many transition and the sunken living room and the multiple floors and the super complex upstairs layout like there was solve a lot of our problem yeah it's mostly it just it mostly just helps the birds I mean there's a lot of people in chat that are saying they're super stoked on theirs so there you go and like we've we've worked with uh Robot vacuum companies before that have had very
impressive performance compared to the last time that I actually tried to use one at my house so it's clear that they are advancing in a big way it's just that our layout just doesn't yeah work for it yeah I think for us it's like we we take a problem area and make it no longer a problem so it takes cleaning from this like annoying thing that you have to do practically literally all the time to something you can do on a more reasonable schedule I think part part of it is also me just making the mistake of
putting in wall to- wall carpeting every time yeah I should have just not done any wall to- wall in the new place that was really dumb but Ivon and I both like it on our feedies but then we have hardwood in the bedroom any way so like why did we even anyway I am a w thewall carpet enjoyer but when the birds were at the vet not that long ago we did like emergency hyper deep clean and we like borrowed uh Emma's dad's like uh deep carpet cleaner thing stuff like yeah yeah and went hard and it was
gross carpets are gross they're kind of not sanitary it's like wow there's a lot of stuff coming out of this they're fine if you just never check it's like most things in life yeah um we should check out our sponsors yeah oh sorry danez freaking out here acronis as much as some people thrive when under a Cyber attack that is me that that is legitimately me I think we can all agree it's best to prevent them from happening in the first place with a ronus cyber protect you get

description all right oh we're supposed to do merch messages all right Dan hit me yeah yeah yeah yeah hi dll my seven-year-old lately has shown interest in computer science especially cyber security considering getting him a PC to game on and explore his curiosity in the field any suggestions on how to safely or the operating system how to safely the operating system um sorry punctuation how to do so safely how to what operating system they should use oh I yeah I'm looking at I don't I don't know
what they mean by this but throw them at Linux um windows's parental management tools are still terrible like they are sort of a disaster Arch or get a new kid like you can set them up yeah give them Arch and then the parental management tools is they won't be able to do anything just disowned that's kind of interesting and if they can figure out how to do it then then I guess they're old maybe yeah they'll be ready by the time they're 18 maybe they okay if honestly if there's super
into computers and stuff I don't think giving them the like easiest thing is even probably going to be what they want um I would throw them at some form of how could we at least give them something that can kind of do some stuff out of the box there's seven maybe recommend them to mess around with no gooey modes and stuff um they're seven they're seven but they're expressing interest in cyber security Arch console to a cyber security kid he's going to feel like a hacker remember this is from a parent
you know parents will see their kid like do you want to do cyber security like get their hands like covered in drool and like smear it on a piece of paper be like oh he's interested in art like you never know right I I'm not I'm not saying Eric is like that I'm just saying it's it's a possibility um there's seven so like I think it should at least have a gooey sure like don't be like that yeah he could just install it himself yeah or do it with him yeah teach him how to install a gooey yeah that's fun
that sounds like there's some games that feature um hacking elements I can't remember the name it off top of my head right now it's pretty old but it was cool I don't remember the name of it was that screen uh what was that like educational like platform thing up blink up Uplink Uplink thank you I loved that game still do Uplink could be fun hacker hacket yeah um there's a there's a a website that is good for learning cyber secur stuff that I also can't remember the name of right now I'm just going to
use chat for um you know everything I guess um hack the box there we go what was that one that um thank you what was that one that came with a Raspberry Pi that you would build oh uh and it had like a bunch of like sort of coating friendly um games like it had um I don't remember oh man KO yeah yeah Cano Cano Cano sure yeah uh and I think you can just get the software like I don't I think you can I I I mean don't quote me on that are they still around separately getting them into the scratch
programming language um scratch is in my opinion genuinely a pretty solid way to to learn the basics of things good Cano world is relaunching in partnership with Astros safe and  something more yeah hit me yeah some of my favorite content was the crazy multim monitor 16k gaming type deals with the lack of SLI are projects like that even possible how do we push Hardware peripheral limits um actually that project did not use SLI it used Quadro multisync so it had four individual
cards that were driving the monitors individually and then it had a separate fifth sync card that each of those cards was linked into that handled all the synchronization of the image that's why it was a little a little a little wonky um that to my knowledge still kind of exists but I think the challenge for us is that we want to find new things to explore I would also say resolution pumping was like a big thing back then it's not really a thing anymore now we all agree it's kind of stupid like we're
definitely going to do a video gaming in 8k on the 90 or whatever when it comes out but do we need to game at 16k I don't know maybe not that that one dud dud who spends his entire life modding a cyber Punk will care yeah yeah exactly so um like okay like we uh like one of the things that people love is US using you know wacky fans to cool things right so we had that one where we rented those like industrial fans and we hooked them up to that Cooler Master case with like
a plywood duct in it like blew the top of the case off that was great and then we had the one where we uh hooked up that like bigger like almost looked like a jet turbine fan to a computer and ran it off of like LiPO batteries but what you'll notice about those two things is that while they both had fans connected there were sort of different things that we could explore so the second one ended up being more about the LiPO batteries and less about just the fan you know uh so we we want we want there to be
something new for us to talk about we did another like wacky fan video just now uh where we used a turbo to cool a computer um which is Alex and I sort of agree maybe the  done but the difference the difference is that what makes it not Jumping the Shark is that there's new learning outcomes okay we discuss what a turbo is we discuss why a conventional one might not work and why we might want to use um uh an electric turbo or supercharger exhaust fed uh yeah normally but you
know computer I mean it has exhaust but not like that um just pulled your car up we talk about the challenges with the high pressure and there high temperature of the turbo's exhaust air I shouldn't say exhaust but it's output cuz when you say exhaust in automotive terms it sounds like the exhaust not that the the like the output from the turbo the the fresh air uh from the turbo so it so the air is actually hot so then we we discuss intercoolers and we use an intercooler and anyway it's a really
great video but it's more than just taking a big fan and hooking it up to a computer because we've already done that and we try not to do the same things over and over does Alex like traveling like does he go to computex I don't remember I don't think he was there I Alex usually does um I don't know if he did computex last time but he he does CES I think there's a there's a maybe possibility if you guys are interested maybe maybe I haven't actually asked anyone maybe um that you could do a did
do compy Texas fanless Computer build um but in a wind tunnel and try to cool it that way and see what happens I'd be down there's another one I want to do I want to I want to put a computer in a hyperbaric chamber oh nice I want to know what like denser air does yeah why not I don't know that's cool I love stuff like that um we also still have pending um actually maybe I shouldn't talk too much about these because these might take us a while to execute never mind the idea is Doc is like we're we're
not out of ideas um we we got we got wonder what the oldest thing on it is wonder how old it is I have no idea I'd have to go back to like every revision the original revision that's not bad you know what could be kind of fun too is like my my three worst ideas and you do like you you have the writers vote on like what the three worst ideas in the dock are and you do all three of them in one video you just do like I don't know I'm kind of down anyways uh I'm going to send that to myself sick let's go
uh yeah what are we on we're on topics okay sure SP catching the rocket we already talked about that I fanboyed enough I  um L is struggling with his stream oh L is having streaming issues with his VR PC yeah so I was I did a I did a VR stream last night and I don't know what it is about this machine but it was perfect for a long time and now whenever I stream I get this like stutter in VR and I don't feel like the load I'm putting on it is super crazy I'm running an index so it's high
resolution but it's not up there with the the best headsets these days anymore not by a long shot and I'm streaming at 1080p um you know 6 megabit um but when I use nank uh oh one of the things that is a little bit challenging is I'm using Liv for um to for like a virtual Avatar so it has do yeah um it has to do some compositing but like I don't get it because CPU usage sits around like 40% GPU usage is what it is and if you're using inven for encoding it should like be fine um but I think I'm going to have
to I think I'm going to have to rebuild it um Elijah says I promise it's your CPU your GPU is trying to comp and ends up with more overhead on it it happen with my old computer that that's possible the first time you ever overclocked something I have a 3600 so it's it's not a super high core count machine um so it's possible that I'm that I am running into some some CPU issues DP latency spikes what now DSP latency spikes can often be caused by NVIDIA drivers it hits the audio and
causes hitches like that or little pops it's not audio no the audio no no it it like interrupts the system badly and like causes really weird issues like that interesting and this is what an Nvidia driver issue you said most of the time it is NVIDIA drivers you can use something like uh I don't know there there's tools out there I think it's called process no uh DSP latency something I have another theory latency mod that's it this Windows install oh yeah I mean has made its way all the way from Windows
7 okay I didn't know that through Windows 8 I didn't know that and I was going to say start there through 10 through 11 it is now 11 I did you 8.1 it uh I don't remember I I had never I had never intended to to Windows 11 it but one of my kids just like clicked okay upgrade at some point and good it's free I was like okay it has had at least three different motherboards so I may just need to reformat my computer yeah it's is my VR machine yeah yeah so I I think from the original video
where I built it I just like grabbed a drive and it like already had Windows on it so so it's it's probably from a completely different system originally and then it's had multiple different mother 100% nice yeah so so that might also be it yeah I will I will say I I I through fake shaded Elijah I will say uh Elijah was the only person to set the screen saver and the young people try Windows XP video the way I would have done it I couldn't believe that video was extremely fun and
oh deeply infuriating at times the CD dual case yeah I know that actually killed your soul like I talked about I talked about this with Luke after if you don't know how they work there's a spine on it there's a spine there's a spine if you don't know there's a clear Pivot Point you open at the opposite end Luke if you've never if close your laptop how do you open it I don't know even some cardboard boxes can be a little bit challenging even though you can clearly see which way it's supposed
to open because of the way it like comes over and in or whatever I don't think to someone who's never seen one before I don't think it's immediately obvious I even though I know how to open them I have struggled with CD Jewel cases especially when crack it open well yeah I like I know the techniques like a nut but I'm talking about like my whole life like at some point in my life I didn't know that and like when they're brand new and they're like they're they're kind of
sharp and the first time they were ever put together I don't know maybe they a little crack they can be a little hard to be a little hidden there's also a very obvious hinge on one side I'm just saying I get it I get it but um it was a little hard yeah it was a little hard to witness I do think and and I I noticed today actually after we talked I swear I didn't steal it but I noticed one of the top comments um the second comment from Daniel ENT Daniel owch okay cool um is now check if they can use Windows
11 most of my high school students have no idea how to do anything on a PC that isn't in a browser and watching the video I was actually surprised I think my rose tinted glasses were like cracked or something I thought it was G to be harder for them to do these things I forgot how much it would prompt you with like oh you tried to do something what do you want to do with these things yeah you inserted a thing here's all your options I forgot how much that Windows XP was pretty sick yeah yeah it was it
was back at it more positively since watching it was a turning point for Windows for sure cuz 98 was it was simple but you couldn't do that much yeah like 98 was really easy to use I was not stoked on the move to XP and how like over complicated the start menu was now and stuff like what is all this other crap I just need my programs like what what you know like and obviously my recollection of this is pretty spotty given that that was a hot minute ago and I was quite young but um
I I remember not having a problem using 98 SE um and then XP was like the only reason that I got kind of got good at using it was because I was at a stage in my life where it was fun to just like you know explore and spend the ample free time that I had cuz I didn't have a job you know playing around with just was fun that way it was it was fun it was fun I think it actually was just fun I think it didn't get in your way um I think it had a lot of ease of use that modern operating systems have you know
maybe not as much as the most modern ones but it had a lot of ease of use built in it wouldn't get in your way and you could do a lot with it was very cool that way you know what else is cool uh we should do a couple more announcements yes I want to see the shirt a lot of people have been requesting a smaller version of the LTT backpack here it is the commuter pack a backpack built to support your day every day your day organized pockets for all your Tech and Essentials ready
for you to access in seconds no more rumaging our most portable backpack yet with a 20 L capacity built to last with durable water resistant reprieve canvas a rivet reinforced top handle YKK zippers and a certified validated dual layer bottom I didn't know you did that's hilarious product is still in final development final specifications may change oh my gosh uh but you can sign up for it at LT store.com Pages commuter Das signup and I am really excited about this thing are you are you
g to cut into it no I'm not it's not necessary did that we already did that um this is it it can hold I love this pocket it can hold a shocking amount of stuff considering how much smaller it is than the OG backpack we have external water bottle holders on both sides so it that's it was more of an ergonomic Choice than thinking that anyone needs to carry two water bottles some people do sure but it was more to do with depending on which way you like to swing your bag off to grab your water bottle
you wanted to have the option on both sides uh but I use this side for my Precision screwdriver kit and also get this so you can see the the bag there yeah see the pocket there HH there's a little hidden zipper here what I didn't know about that keep my mouse in there okay pretty cool right H I didn't expect the hidden Pocket to be that big I didn't expect you to pull up M um ah oh man it it like yeah you going to need it second hand cuz it it it wants to be more streamlined so it tries
to close a little bit like the OG we have our RFID protected passport pocket back here I believe oh no it was going to be accessible from both sides I killed that um because I didn't think it was necessary uh it's got a sunglass pocket I have a ton of stuff in mind right now sunglass pocket in there it does not include uh fancy dangly thing made by lon's children oh yeah no that's uh that's not part of the bag yeah and then it's got kind of a pocket of holding just like the OG
one so I've got a bulky sweater in there I've got a Tex sack in there to help with organization that's about it cuz it is a significantly smaller bag so that sweater you have organiz your pockets after that took up the whole thing and then in here we've just got you know kind of a variety of pocket including one for the screwdriver got a little magnetic thing on here to kind of you know keep them from getting all Flappy doodly and then just like the original bag it's it's Tech first right
so these go all the way down which they didn't in the initial revision because of the interference with the water bottle pocket but we found a new way to construct it so that they can and we've got one two sleeves so you can have like your laptop and your tablet or your big laptop and your smaller laptop and then we've also got uh space on this side for your one or two Chargers and then or a mouse or something y or a charger and a mouse or something like that and then we've got cannot get the angle right on
this we've got a black zipper pocket right here so you can you know put some some low profile things down there as well the ergonomics are really good uh I would say it is as good if not better than the original one especially if you have a smaller frame like your body the  and it's going to be have we announced pricing I don't know uh given that the team hasn't I'm not going to say it not in the blurb that we have and I don't see it on the site right now personally oh was there a blurb sorry did I hit all
the points in the blurb uh I don't know neat well anyway uh cool not yet the official answer is not yet the official answer is not yet okay well it's going to have a price it will uh yes it will have that lm. g/c commuter Dan do you mind throwing that in all the chats yep all right um okay fine do you want to get to see it yay did really darting all over the place I'm trying to copy the link yeah I mean it's not like it was 12 characters you you need oh my goodness okay this
one's for all the floaters out there yesterday Sarah went live on float plane designing a shirt with with suggestions from our float plane subscribers the result a design that Luke has not yet seen no I was busy working I didn't get to see it at all and I have also actually not seen oh cool so it's a as far as my understanding goes it's a bit of designed by committee so there was input from the audience but she did the actual design work and you have to be a flow plane subscriber and then log in
with your flow plane account on the store to be able to buy it oh okay uh so Dan if you want to copy this one as well what uh okay I that's so sick what am I looking at here it's a float plane with a little Dino hanging off it I think that's actually so cute wait is it on the back you want to  adorable I actually really like it the wings broke oh he probably chewed the wing off on this side oh my goodness that's my assumption hold on someone says they see bread bread I I don't see
any bread I don't see any bread did did she hide bread in it is there hidden bread Dan no way I don't know I was doing my job bread plane what are you guys even talking about I think no is it made of bread is that why there's a bite out of it baguette Wing is it oh cuz he at it no I think get the little the little marks like a baguette is that is that is that intentional that is probably a stretch yeah yeah guys I don't know about that I don't know about yeah those little marks
there they kind of look like baguette marks no I don't think I don't think such a reach that is that is a reach indeed the planes landing like the pontoons were supposed supported to be bred I don't know what you guys are talking about anyway this is fan fiction now thanks float plane um enjoy your exclusive t-shirt it is only available to float plane subscribers so if youall want to leave a merch message this is your chance lm. g/f merch 10 well yeah we sold out of them yeah we don't get to wear them sorry
luk I guess I'll have to have some shirts that aren't talls all right okay sorry Luke okay yeah they're so nice dude oh my God every day that I don't have a clean one or I'm like too lazy to do the laundry again cuz like the the T-shirt one the nonong sleeve one is probably I had it for like two weeks it's probably gone through the laundry no joke like 10  and then I went to I did my thing where like you know I I try to let the audience buy stuff before I request it uh they're
gone yeah sorry okay we didn't order that there's some long sleeves left but the short sleeves they only have short medium large extra large extra extra large and triple extra large mean small are all gone not short oh right yeah all good my bad um specifically not short actually yeah sorry about that I'll get them someday uh okay the last announcement is uh do you still need your original LTT backpack carabiners replaced we have contacted all the backpack buyers we think but we want to call out our form
one last time if in case there's anyone who missed it all you need is your order number and just go to lm. g/c Carabiner form to request it it'll be closing soon but if you missed the deadline for the form yeah trust me bro we still got you you can message support uh we know this took a long time we've learned a lot um but whether you own a backpack or not we hope you feel that we've honored our commitment to do right by our customers and we have finally delivered carabina
Replacements to everybody with an LTT backpack speaking of things that aren't right oh no this dog specific chatbot an AI powerered pet caller called the Shazam band I wonder if they're going to get sued uh uses sensors and speakers to allow your pet to talk to you out loud in a humanlike voice the caller comes with 30 different voices with Associated personas such as Southern bell and mafia boss cool it's how much Insight the Shazam band actually has into the emotions or thoughts of the animal wearing it
spoiler alert uh a big old guess but zero um yeah judge by its demo the device appears to use some amount of situational cues such as what the animal is currently doing or the behavior of nearby human beings to inform its responses oh good so it's spying on us real good then yeah it's oh every part of this is perfect the collar optionally includes GPS tracking and text notifications in case the animal gets lost or winds up in danger or starts following random strangers around
talking to them uh which would be crazy  C for a Bluetooth speaker with junk AI you kidding me the enhanced version it probably needs a subscription too I don't know uh the enhanced version costs $595 and there is yes there's optional subscription fees that cost $200 to $300 annually after the first year so do you want to have a entirely fake relationship with something that you only have in order to have a real relationship with it wouldn't that be cool wow do you want to
be actually completely not in tune with what your dog is thinking or just feeling at all imagine yeah you know there's been a bunch of this type of stuff like there's been this trend where people try to use chat GPT to like talk to their future selves and they're getting like really emotional over it  you that that's not you at all you're talking to a robot please stop oh my goodness anyways citizen Bean says personally I use dog psychics this may be a product for Dennis some people do actually go to
psychics to tell them what their animal is thinking yes this would be cheaper than that in the long run and probably just as accurate actually probably not even because if you actually know anything about animals at all you can probably tell something of like what its attitude is I guess you would bring it yeah that makes sense yeah yeah yeah might I make a suggestion the dog psychic has high animal handling skg the psychic if you I mean it would have to be for the psychic to form a link with
it where was The Hyphen oh can I make a suggestion if you have $600 to burn hey there's always the Lux backpack it won't talk to you unfortunately it has no AI whatsoever but there is one review for it and Buddy is stoked so  go it's got a it's got a whale on it okay oh that's kind of I actually didn't know that that's kind of sick um I I love that so many products on the store just have so many reviews like the screwdriver and the water bottles and stuff have an insane
amount of reviews and then that backpack just has one um we only just started shipping them recently okay we've been taking orders for like a year but it took a long time to get it done because of all the issues with our backpack supplier "the screw driver has over 8,000 reviews" in all seriousness the Lux backpack I think we have like three left in stock um because we over ordered compared to what people pre-ordered but not by that much and then it took a lot longer for
us to get them and we kept taking orders so by the time they actually arrived I think we only had like 10 extra uh so if you want one do order it right this second um if you don't want one then I don't know if we're ever going to make one again so yeah cool good chat this this guy makes a $600 backpack but won't build lonus town I know right well maybe if people bought more $600 backpacks I'd be able to did you ever think of that Luke that's where you have to store your ID
card is in your $600 backpack I mean it makes perfect sense to me you get randomly ided on the street someone asked how many Lux backpacks we sold and this seems like the kind of Intel that would be really stupid to like talk about publicly but I'm curious so I'm going to look and then I'll decide after I see it if I'm going to disclose it nice uh in in other news I'll do a topic while you're looking that up uh the FCC makes cancelling easy because Lena KH is a boss okay this is actually the coolest
thing ever and I love it and every country needs to do this and I don't say that that often a lot of stuff she's doing is sick uh the FCC has released a final version of its new click to cancel rule which requires companies that offer subscription services to provide methods of unsubscribing that are at least as convenient and easy as their sign up method a service you signed up for with an app needs to allow you to cancel via app or online a gym you sign up for in person needs to allow you to cancel by
calling or online the new rule will take effect in around 6 months very cool very cool very nice uh discussion question is can some subscription Services even survive without lover leveraging the ADHD tax uh this will hurt some of them for sure if if for no other reason then because this law comes in I think people will pay a little bit more attention they'll go like oh I wonder what things I'm subscribed to now that it's easy to unsubscribe and then go we can help yeah oh yeah how is the uh how is the the
Twitter block function change not in the dock I totally slept on that this week I even went through and was looking for stuff to add and I just totally forgot about it I don't know I basically people you blocked can see your stuff now they just can't interact with you is that right the funny thing about that to me though I don't know what it is this is where this is where I'm a little confused about it is um I I I don't understand what difference it makes it doesn't make a difference at all because
block was not um like protected tweets it was just they can make another account yeah you could you you could have another browser tab that's logged into a different one or or isn't logged in and then you could see it there so I yeah this this being the straw is very confusing to me uh the MCG said blue sky got over half a million users and I've seen a bunch of people okay Bots no no go ahead uh no I don't know no I I don't think that's actually the issue I don't think that's why people are um migrating
to Blue Sky in droves right now I think it's actually more to do with that they updated their terms so any art you post on X just belongs to them for AI training now how is that not a bigger  know okay we're just used to it by this point yeah so there's no opt out anymore if you post something on there it just like belongs to them to use what if it's already on there I don't know that should be super illegal well I mean there's a lot of things that should be super illegal but that's true I don't
know sure yeah yeah Crystal Thief uh said it's not just that it's the AI crap I hadn't heard of that at all I had only heard of the the blocked thing yeah the block thing honestly doesn't that seems like kind of fundamentally not understanding how the block function worked like if you're sort of mad about this change it just doesn't I don't really understand how it makes a difference apparently Lux sold out it did oh balls uh okay said luck sold out I was going to order it as my Christmas
gift myself next month well um thinking about that as well you were yeah Merry shitty Christmas then I guess kind of seems like something you might do actually might have I think about it for a second might have been for somebody else I don't know I haven't quite decided that's why I've been dragging my feet on it for so long it's a lot of money it outsold Luke Nukem I think a let's see if I can find it yeah we uh that was a weird decision that was done I wear it like every  Emma I I wore it
I I don't think I've told you this story um I wasn't planning on leaving the house one day Emma's car was at the shop suddenly ready to be picked up she needed me to go get it I went to go get it I didn't think about what I was wearing I was wearing the Luke Nukem shirt I walk up and it's this like random tire shop um and there's one of the worker dudes just sitting outside on a tire just chilling and as I walk up he's like Luke nuke eh and I'm like I look down I'm just like
uh yeah I mean even I don't wear shirts with my face on them oh it was so brutal the name yes but the face really Gilmore D says I'm wearing my Luke Nukem shirt right now hell yeah the thing was they had a bunch of different color options before they decided on one so they gave me like the those ones basically so I have like a bunch of this shirt I I can't wear any of them yeah so Luke nuk um let me see if I can find there's also like a reference from one random obscure
W show that never came back and then we sold shirts on it like weeks later it made no sense Sarah brought me over to see the draft of the design she's like I have no idea what you want but is this  yeah I mean yeah uh we sold 129 Luke Nukem t-shirts so you personally own probably like a solid 4% of the total Luke Nukem stock of the world we didn't sell those I know okay yeah but I mean you but you yeah um the second you said stock so Luke Nukem shirt was also outs sold by mem face sequin pillow clearance
okay that's actually sad outs sold by um gotfish pullovers um outs sold by Red dad hats you know if I knew we were going to do it I could have like kept the meme going for longer outsold by sweatband [Laughter] sets I don't take fault for any of this um Olive beanies crushed it uh yeah even our even our ABC book character plushies outsold the Luke Nukem shirt unfortunately I like I'm pretty sure I've actually bought some of those for yeah those those are pretty nice um okay for if you guys are curious
uh we ordered 240 Lux backpacks and they are now sold out um so not like a Smash Hit or anything but when you compare the revenue number to other things that sold you know 200 250 units it's it's pretty substantial um yeah like order 50 more I don't even know that we'd be able to bring it back because the only reason we were able to do a production run of it was because we took pre-orders for it which we kind of learned our lesson because some people toward the end were
getting kind of irate about waiting so long for it but you know how we are we're not going to ship it until it's ready um but but the only reason we were able to commit to a production run of it was because we took pre-orders for it and then um we would have to produce like enough to to meet a minimum order quantity and we wouldn't want to take pre-orders for it again so I don't I don't know how we'd justify it what is the rarest lmg merch item the rarest yeah I don't know if we could
technically know because we sold stuff before um there was that patch hoodie that you did but that was not necessarily like that was yeah I mean a one in like fluke kind of chance right yeah the the ones that like had rare patches on them I mean some of the some of the lambo stuff where we've only done 70 minus one units that's that's pretty rare we don't say that anymore what 69 units nice okay yeah don't care I didn't know I'm I don't know meing I was like are you avoiding this for a reason I wasn't sure
um thought you being Drake for a second eight more than 92 pretty much pretty much anything that we pretty much anything that we order we have to order hundreds of so some of the pins some of the pins in the in the like RGB yeah I was wondering like maybe going all the way back to like the the original logo shirt like way back or the keep on digging shirt oh the like me in a box coming out of it like one I think only like four of them exist or something like that from the Cafe Press store that
we set up back when I was at NC I ruined mine very recently actually oh no I washed it and just the ink had not aged well and it just completely  bummer all right what are we supposed to be talking about Dan are we supposed to be doing topics uh you have 5 and A2 minutes left until 8:00 Twitter blocks blocking is in the is in the oh hello uh yeah I totally I totally missed that great work everyone who worked on the dock on that yeah my bad some users are calling this a win for stalkers while proponents uh
argue blocked users could already view public content from yeah okay no we need to talk about um the US uh a US appeals court has cided with music publishing giant Sony Universal and Warner against ISP Grande Communications concluding that Grande purposefully ignored customers who were engaging in copyright infringement and should have taken action up to and including the termination of the accounts of some of these customers another ISP Cox Communications is attempting to appeal a
similar ruling to the Supreme Court Cox argues that copyright infringement notices sent on behalf of record labels aren't reliable and that forcing isps to disconnect users based on unproven pirate accusations will cause great harm a supre a supreme court brief filed by multiple isps argues that the ruling against Cox imperils the future of the Internet by exposing internet service providers to massive liability if they don't carry out Mass internet evictions it further argues that this decision
potentially harms other residents at the disconnected address who may have had no involvement in the infringement your parents are going to be so mad this appeals court ruling is crazy crazy um I there are there we have not even touched on we have not even scratched the surface of the potential problems with a ruling like this like imagine being an educational institution you're the it admin and now it's your job to have an absolutely bulletproof system for making sure that nobody downloads any copyrighted
materials or what your internet goes out because the ISP is not going to want the liability do you have any idea what kind of Damages they seek for every single instance of copyright infringement the numbers are ridiculous cuz they don't they don't go based on like that movie would have been 20 bucks or whatever like it's like it's crazy they want like tens tens of thousands of dollars per per instance right so ISP are going to be if this if this happens for real isps are going to be trigger freaking happy
to just cut off anything that looks like it could possibly be anything that could get them in trouble this is freaking wild dude VPN oh yeah hey uh Dan do you have our Pia affiliate thing it's automated unfortunately oh it's it's automated what does that even mean it uh it appears during Banner after dark randomly oh I just mean do you have the link do you want to put it in the chat oh oh oh okay I thought you wanted me to put it on screen now's look a VPN is not a silver bullet for like cyber security or
whatever um that that's not a thing um but but it will make it so that they can't tell that you're downloading pirated stuff it will do that so thanks Dan yeah sick uh Dan can you also throw the Carabiner Link in there's a couple people asking about it to make sure they get it thank you so much you're wonderful all right should we after dark it I'm running on on little time let's do it it's after dark time I I just tasked Dan with like two things though so how's he going to switch us to after
dark mode he would have to be some kind of magic man oh he did it doing the what a guy what a guy what a guy is a little harder and then we do scene sorry he's on it I'm trying do watch him work and then we go also here have you ever had this many people judge you at once yeah I've been to a family reunion  him and is it magenta I actually haven't looked there it goes nice are you going to do it thank you ni y all right that should be the links and everything else let's get through some of
these now we'll put them away cool I'm good I'm good hey land du andus saving for a commuter backpack question for the small boss as a cereal fan have you tried Milk Bar in Vegas or La it's not an alcoholic bar they have cereal milk ice cream I'm going to have to try that at CES this year I have not heard of that Milk Bar a cereal bar yeah that sounds genuinely more interesting to me than but you can just get them at the grocery store like neutr grain oh my goodness the second I
said cereal bar I was like this is going to come back to me I don't know how it will Fast happen fast is that confir you're going to CS this year uh oh yeah I got to go yeah it's just a thing I think it's just a thing I think that um I think that I tried real hard to not have to go and nothing against the team but I need to go he's got to go I got to go like on purpose uh good day lldd I I have a new job as a senior FSD I assume that's full stack the tech department is less than a
year old and doesn't follow best practices how would you suggest I push for change leading by example most most tech departments that are a year old aren't going to follow best practices uh also spoiler alert most most tech departments that are any amount of years old aren't going to follow best practices um yeah try to lead by example do what you can push for certain pieces of change that you think are going to be most impactful um work with uh your your I don't know your managers whoever else
in there to try to like there's this there's this thing that like if you want to get stuff done um propose Solutions or options yeah um don't just complain about stuff and keep realistic expectations yeah because your manager probably has 10 trillion things to do because most companies don't have enough they I find most companies either don't have enough or they have like about seven times two many there doesn't seem to be a lot of like right in the middle um so try to yeah if if you're like you
know what I'm going to look up a few different good options for doing this thing I'm going to a b and c these options show the pros and cons show the one that I vote for and I'm going to hand this over you're very likely to get something done um compared to like I don't like or just not saying anything and and hoping that it gets fixed magically that's that's the that's a real fun one I love that everybody loves that it's very useful it works really well stop complaining uh but yeah I
wouldn't sweat I wouldn't sweat it too much um it's uh it's pretty common but yeah moving on hi DL who do you think will be the main benefactor of the newly announced x86 Alliance AMD Intel uh softare vendors or and consumers um AMD and Intel actually I think I think other members of the ecosystem will benefit as well um just from not having to deal with like a diverging x86 um I actually I think it's I think it's kind of a win overall um industry cooperation and standardization is probably the only
reason that you can even plug the same USB devices not probably is the only reason that you can even plug the same USBC cables into apple and and PC Computers like it's generally a good thing I I don't I don't necessar know that it's going to be the the the I don't think it's necessarily going to mean that x86 wins forever but I think it will strengthen x86 which in general is good better better stronger competitors means more competition for us means better products for
us I'm into it it's pretty wild seeing uh Pat gelsinger and Lisa Sue like on stage together like what timeline is this all we needed was Jensen up there and I'd be like okay I quit I'm done this is this is Peak tech industry and it's all downhill from here yeah weird Okay up cuz you know we're going to get new colors the weird blue one get purple hey lldd with you float plane exclusive shirt be a permanent fixture on the store or is it a limited run very shortterm is drop yes any earbuds you'd

to make it easy yeah I know yeah hit me Dan uh that's kind of all I have for the curated there's a couple more here maybe let's see um was wondering where the stuff on the store get stored I'm guessing you don't have it all on site with you guys no uh we use a third party logistics company that's actually run by one of my former colleagues from NC uh it's on anesis island actually we talked about anesis Island earlier yeah um and we we actually did a popup there once when we launched the backpack
because it was Impractical to move because the backpack is so large it was Impractical to move like a significant number of them to somewhere else to do it so we just did it out the back of their warehouse um I remember that I think it would actually be kind of cool to do a a tour of it or something but maybe not I it's not high-tech like it's it's pretty low Tech I've never even been there um I've only been there once for the backpack po pop maybe like a tech quickie on like how do you get
things and it goes through like the logistics process when you order something which is super cool by the way yeah except that like again ours is pretty low Tech yep um yeah only there's a way to order some there there isn't we no like our blanks our blanks are our own blanks and we don't have a blue one until like we don't have one yeah that we can't we can't just like order some We There are blanks and we don't have a blue one yeah but we have a microfiber shirt and I don't think you want that shirt in
blue blue microfiber with the design on it um yeah I I also would uh you know like the full plank shirt to be in blue it's just it's not going to happen cuz we don't have blue blanks we sold 150 microfiber t-shirts today I don't think our inventory is going to last very long on those that is freaking hilarious you guys hilarious you know that right like do you actually know that though I seriously wonder how many of them are selling cuz they look like Star Trek shirts you think so they like really
kind of do they really kind of do don't they especially with like the way the light kind of catches them like they really black collar there there was that was not intentional no I know I didn't see it at all yeah until I sat down wearing it and then I was like wo I can't I can't unsee it yeah at least you guys aren't wearing red oh damn I got my I tried to do the yeah yeah yeah sorry okay yeah we aren't wearing red so we'll we'll survive the [Laughter] night and I guess I got one more curated
and that's probably about it uh hi lldd Paradox interactive admitted last week that releasing City skylines 2 in the state that it did was a mistake do you think this is indicative of a larger int U intolerance for unfinished games I think that one was also kind of a unique situation where um the original game had changed so much from its original release state that they were kind of in a in a difficult position where yeah there were problems but also one of the biggest problems was that the modding
and the modding ecosystem for the original game was so good and so vibrant that they actually like they had kind of no hope of matching the feature set of the new game but also of the old game at launch like it was always going to take a long time but they also like screwed it up by having technical issues and  I yeah like it's clear they screwed up I mean the CEO said as much but I don't know that if it's I don't know that it's because people are generally less tolerant of Unfinished games so much as
it's that that was a a pretty unique situation I do think though that people don't understand what beta means anymore yeah oh did it launch into beta I no I don't think it even did I I do think people's expectations of anything they can use are pretty high oh yeah so to be fair companies poisoned that well 100% 100% no Minecraft is in beta for like a decade yeah insomnia ACC say it's the Sims problem every new release is so basic it doesn't feel like a finished game until there's a bunch of expansion
packs yeah yeah totally Civ to a Lester degree suffers that I find most Civ games are better after one or two expansions Dei says there were B basic features and functionality missing give me my bike Lanes yeah yeah 100% like they I can see where the ambition was in City skyline City skylines 2 but it's clear that there were blind spots uh I don't know I don't know what they could have done other than just eat it and work on it for longer sometimes isn't an option uh Top Gear Lux is not coming back back for
those of you planning on buying for family on Christmas it is October the 18th I just told you we just sold the last of the inventory where do you think new ones are going to come from this may surprise people there are legitimately people that this is going to surprise but the items on our store are not just rebadged AliExpress stuff I know right the water bottles are re badges right yep yeah yes but even then we do our own production runs we don't just like go to the corner store
yeah and buy one and then put our label on it yeah so production lead times are long and we have our own lid but like most most of the things that people know the store for are our own things our own shirt planks screwdrivers backpacks all that kind of stuff is our own engineering that wasn't always the case um desk pads and water bottles carried the store for probably like year and a half 2 years but nowadays the revenue is didn't we make aren't the deskpads own thing that's not a Rebrand they're our
own design and they're to our own spec okay um they are our own custom that wouldn't mean that it's a Rebrand then though uh oh okay it's our own spe and our own thickness so so it's we're talking OEM versus odm so this is OEM and then the I would say the desk pad is odm because we gave the design guidelines yeah um that's its own product it's probably in between those not as so is a screwdriver yeah no not even yeah not even close different category I know it's like six months
it's still not a rebatch can we maybe get another pre-order says top GE like dude if you want something you got to like you got to order it I uh oh man I I don't know because it was made by our old backpack supplier who spoiler alert isn't the one making these there goes the water and that my friends is why you close the lid on your water bottle hey we have some clo aren going to be very absorbent uh oh well hey we have some cloths that are more absorbent hey we've got a Dan so yeah we have we have a new
manufacturing partner for our backpack products and I don't know if they're going to be able to Source exactly the same Apple leather material there's definit some there's definitely some differences in terms of uh how we had to optimize the construction for the thicker material so they wouldn't have that knowledge we'd be basically doing product development on it again which what to sell another couple hundred units I I don't know if it's going to make sense and besides I'm sure all the
people who actually bought it because you know they were like hey this is a thing that I like maybe you make a lux commuter bag reason we left my I can set it back down I was getting it out of the water oops thank you I guess there we go uh and besides I'm sure the people that did buy it are going to like knowing how exclusive it is there you go like it's not numbered or anything but it's it's pretty darn exclusive other way there you go what the heck you guys it's not that what did you even do
brutal oh my God why did we even move it it's not like the electronics were in the water I didn't know how what it was yvon's yvon's always like that like water will get like near something she's like oh this is the electronic I'm like yeah plastic housing it's okay yeah she's like I'm like it's fine I don't trust all the cables that much this is true this is fair um we've had these for a long time been through some stuff all right Top Gear all right Top Gear uh I will I will ask
the team if it's a thing we can do okay I'll ask oh Top Gear no what he just looks so sad I know he looks so sad he's like got like like tears streaming down his face crying Emoji like jeez okay like I don't know man it's it's kind of a funny thing cuz the number of people that are upset that the flannel shirts are gone the Plaid flannels are gone and I'm like wer dude they were like they were rotting in our inventory we had to blow them away if you guys like stuff buy it if you don't
like it then don't complain that it's gone I I do think that sometimes we have a really funny way of handling Seasons oh dude we don't do them because when stuff's done it's done the season it's in the store the season for flannels showed up and that we don't have flannels 100% 100% man no y not even lying not even lying about that all right well hey the show thanks for uh thanks for watching we'll see you again next week same bad time same bad  bye I was so ready for that ready for what that outro came in
