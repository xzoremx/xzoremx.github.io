pretty much everyone and their dog has a side hustle these days and dog walking or Uber driving might work for some people but I'm better with tech than I am with organisms what's a socially awkward penguin to do hang on I've got it there's all this broken Tech all over sites like eBay and Craigslist maybe I could fix it up and flip it for profit man where to start I mean I used to be pretty good at fixing pins so here's what we're going to do we're going to buy some four parts am4
processors that don't look too far gone we're going to set a timer fix them and find out how much we can pay ourselves to do this kind of work with minimal Tools H how about this one this one this one this one this one this one this one and this one well I mean they're not here yet but while we wait how about we do the Segway to our sponsor MSI It's Autumn and leaves aren't the only thing that's falling it's prices too msi's fall Ready Halls sale is here to help you save on
your next laptop gaming handheld and more check out the sale using our Link in the video description before we could try to fix anything something already went wrong we ordered a total of six CPUs but as you can see I'm holding only five thankfully the one that didn't show up was canceled and refunded by the the seller so we haven't lost any money at least not yet let's give everybody their assignments I've never unbent CPU pins before but I think I'm a good candidate for this because I'm a fairly handy guy
I'm a fairly DIY guy like I've ran out of kitchen before I can do things but I've never done this uh it's been a while since I've done this but I have repaired pins on like older CPUs before and like CPU sockets and motherboards so I've got some experience at least just not super recent I have fixed bent pins oh all right that's about as far as I've gotten I've never soldered pins my experience level is pretty low but of the probably I'd say 10 to 30 CPUs that I fixed over the years I have above a
90% success rate all right so I get a 50700 x and how many problem pins are there okay first thing I'll say is these are really small I could like naked eye this but it would be a lot harder I'm grateful for this thing this is actually a good way to check as you can see they're all orderly and you can see gaps between each row so if there's anything that's walked over you would see it fill that Gap the only bent pins are on the corners over here and over here this is a game changer having it on this thing
there they are Three Amigos this microscope is so sweet this is going to make it so much easier oh there's more B pins than I thought on this corner I thought it was one but it's four maybe may even six two things I'm worried about with this task is number one I don't know how many times you can bend it this way and that before it just snaps right off number two I don't know if these are solid gold or just plated and I worry that if I were to grab it with like a plier that I
would strip off a coating and then it would no longer function as it's supposed to do you know the answer to these questions I do not I'm still out of four confidence but I don't know if I can do it in an hour but maybe I can do it in 10 minutes I really don't know I'm going to start with a spudger and the microscope and let's go oh my God the spudger is like wider than the gap between Rose I may not be able to use this tool okay I might use a razor blade instead okay the other thing I don't know is how
straight do they need to be what's the margin for error looking at the socket each pin has a hole so if it's off a bit it should just get snapped into place that's the theory not snapped in the bad way snapped in the good way you don't want to have to force it but like it's got a tiny bit of give at least almost looks like I'm done here but but then when you turn it this way you're like oh yeah those I need a helping hand so cuz I I can I use my nose just the focus okay so I previously was working on
these ones and now I'm going to go over to this one so this is a mechanical pencil and the tip is a hollow cylinder and apparently you can actually fit the pins in that Hollow cylinder and then just manipulate them that way I think I can give that a shot cuz I love the idea of just being able to use a tool you might have lying around the house I got her on there now the question is will I give have enough feedback to like know what's happening that looks really straight up and down we'll pull it off
did we get make progress oh yeah not bad it's not perfect yet that one is still wonky that one right on the corner I'm I am digging this Pencil Trick but I don't know if I can get these ones cuz they're so leaned over they're touching the neighbor yeah I don't think this pencil is going to work for this application all right where's my trusty razor blade this is like when Luke just uses the  system I think I'm I'm pretty good here guys going into this I thought the definition of bent pin was like really
leaned over and now I'm realizing it might just be like a little leaned over and that is worrisome aha oh she's in all right let's send it let's go 21 and A2 minutes CPU  processor plof that's the win condition you see plof you win Cent is running fine all the numbers are within expectations so I'd say we're done we made the money I hope the other guys are doing at least this well but who  knows all right what do we got it's it looks like a couple of rows are bent but I think maybe I can get them all at the
same time with like a razor or something I like to stick it onto something a little more substantial to hold on to just to make it easier so i' got some double-sided tape on a cork here probably better than a half dozen bent pins but they're not very bent this is almost like Not Bent enough like I don't think I would have tried to sell this on eBay I would have tried to fix it I'm pretty happy with that to be  good I think this is a broken ship that someone just kind of creatively bent cuz
I would have tried to fix that myself all right here goes nothing 3700x running 3600 mahz voltages are good CPU looks good let's see if we Windows here we go that guy again everything looks okay to me let's see a c bench yeah not too  bad M let's take a look at your chip okay this one I probably the one labeled me three pins on the very corner it seems oh and I see maybe one that's bent in the bottom right corner by the triangle so three missing pins and a slightly bent pin all right but three
pins all beside other on the edge there and like the most open Edge the corner I'm probably I I think I'm we'll find out the confidence is jumping up yeah jumping all over the place right like uh all [Applause] right I I am not having fun I think even if my life depended on this I would die I like genuinely would not be able to  done ah I I think it's dust yeah I think I got to call it I'm sorry no worries  try I hear you need some help Elijah had some trouble with uh soldering on some
missing pins there I have tons of soldering experience and working on small electronics so I figured I might be able to do something all right so I'm I'm going to give a shot uh so yellow one to five then how confident are you probably about to six okay that's off The Confident all right take a look all right yeah he uh he mashed that one pretty good eh see for me it's not the getting them off part that's going to be difficult it's the getting them back on part is going to be fun first things
first probably try just straightening out the ones that are still there are you still at a six uh steadily dropping down to a four so glad this isn't like a for real these things cuz I would have been fired no way all done all done got one that's time heck so how many more do you have to do uh eight okay that's not too bad though you think it's a viable side hustle not replacing pins unbending them sure but if you're replacing them there's no feasible way to make a dollar 
you now it's my turn oh dude oh there's a bad one I don't want any hints I don't want know how oh dude there oh there's two like that oh dang those are both pretty mangled and there's a fair number of other ones with minor bends all along the edges here what did they do to you my poor boy check it out just like the Scribe driver but a mechanical pencil that is awesome yeah where do I get it uh nowhere yet yeah got them wait you started already yeah jeez Jordan hey you were poking at pins before well I was
just I was looking at it I was looking at it what I want to do is I want to really get under that pin and see if I can get it to slightly less bent over without ripping it off if I rip it off I'm going to have to put a new pin on it which means I need a donor CPU and I need a lot more time it's hard to get under this guy um you can really see boys that this is the smallest Flathead in the iix it kit and it's still kind of hard to get it under there wait I figured out what they did oh I
think they put it into the socket the wrong way Jordan I wonder if they like had it the wrong had it oriented the wrong way or something dude that totally done uh I think I may have nailed it and the thing is it doesn't have to be completely straight y it just has to go in that'll get in there hey hey hey she's in now just because she's in the socket doesn't mean I want to fire up the board yet I want to see if I like really mashed one down because if I fire it up while I've got a pin Mash
down who knows what's going to happen right at least that way I get another shot at it you only get one shot one opportunity okay okay I'm ready it's my okay so it took me 15 minutes ryzen 5 3500 how much I pay for this thing 30 bucks 30 bucks 30  I did it faster well not the same CPU the point is that aside from some overhead here I can afford to pay myself 80 bucks an hour to fix this CPU dude I'm feeling good challenge number two for Mr lus I get a bonus CPU he gets two cuz neither
of them is worth that much that's why they call me the boner oh dear cuz I get a bonus CPU and bonus Tech tips okay sorry what are we talking about this time I get a 3500x this also seems like it's not in very bad shape wait is this just fine they said it's missing a pen I couldn't find it now occasionally you're going to buy stuff that's for parts and it's just going to be dead uh okay stop the clock I think I'm ready to test this thing because I do not see a missing or bent
pin on it well she went in the socket easily yeah nothing was bent on it before this fires up or doesn't what's my potential profit here uh 15 20 bucks okay oh I just saw the keyboard light up holy crap did we just get a forart CPU that's just perfectly fine no way six core processor all six cores there they freaking go she's turbo in baby yep and she seems like she's working just  fine now what if I told you that actually is missing a pin a missing pin doesn't NE necessarily mean a broken CPU
though sometimes they have unused pins or ground pins that are extra FAL pins if you will dude I feel bad about missing it though naughty lus eyes are getting old man here pop it out we'll take a look and there she is yep how'd everybody do uh so James took about 20 minutes how'd yours go took me about 8 minutes and I got it working fine how about Elijah uh Elijah had a bad time did we sabotage Elijah has never soldered before and he had one was missing three pins in the
corner and uh it didn't go well Justus ended up cleaning it up and getting one pin back onto it in the time allowed it's it's been through some something to watch for is sometimes you can get away with sticking a little piece of metal into the socket that's as long as you can get a good contact here I actually had a CPU that I put into my parents system an old Tri cor I think it worked for about 10 years like that with a broken off pin on the CPU right yep but with a little slightly over long piece
of metal in the socket so it would make contact should we try I was thinking maybe if that's memory Channel B maybe we could run it in single channel that CPU I dropped that Zeon back in the day where I dented the corner of it it did still work yeah just five of I believe six memory channels no way no way there could still be issues are all of those pins memory Channel B I'll double check cuz if they aren't then it might still work but maybe one of our PCI Lanes is not functioning properly right who knows
that's all memory B dude she's in Windows she's in Windows brother I cannot believe that let's run the numbers James should be able to sell this CPU for about $135 and we're not able to completely ignore the cost of our tools but they are good for more than just unbending pins so let's take away a couple of bucks from his profit for that that leaves him with $64 of profit for just over 20 minutes of work a rate of $179 an hour not too shabby assuming he can keep that pace up as for Team Elijah he
didn't have such a good time after 2 hours his 5800 X only works with a single memory Channel now he might still be able to sell that I'll be it at a reduced price but he wouldn't be making even close cl to minimum wage as for Jordan's 3700x well doesn't have quite the profit potential of James or Elijah's chips but he made up for it by being quick he should be able to get close to 40 bucks after expenses or around 285 an hour though there's no way that that's a sustainable Pace as for me
I spent about 16 minutes on my 3500 and really I just used the Precision screwdriver so I should see about $19 of profit coming back $71 an hour if you're playing along at home as for the 3500x well I didn't spend any time fixing this one and I could get 20 bucks of profit there too and I'm only out the time it took to test it and ship it not too bad but is this a viable side hustle well I think so but there are some caveats there is a lot of upfront risk I'd say it's important to make sure that you are
picking chips with good potential profit picking ones where the seller clearly lays out what's wrong with them so you can claim something back if the issue is something else and try to get chips with as few bent pins as possible so you're not wasting a ton of time before you can get right to this segue to our sponsor rocket money quick how many streaming services are you paying for okay now quick how many of them do you actually use if your answer isn't all of them then rocket money can help their app
