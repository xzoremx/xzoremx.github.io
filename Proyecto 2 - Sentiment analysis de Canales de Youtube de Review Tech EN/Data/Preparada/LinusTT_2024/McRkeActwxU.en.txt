is this a bag of apples is that a sword sick the gunk level is actually not that bad we asked everyone on our team to submit their setups and now we're going to judge them like last time we won't know which staff member it belongs to until after we give them a score out of 100 so things are probably going to get a little hairy but I mean we're not entirely heartless whoever gets the lowest score is going to get free lunch which we're going to pay for with money from our sponsor who I'll tell you about
after we do a couple of setups roast  go oh my God I don't know what's worse the fact that that HP monitor contains so many bloody stickers on its bezel or the fact that they didn't take them off them not taking off is clearly worse also this monitor is ancient compared to everything else that they have this monitor has elegant function it why are you being such a monitor shamer if it's an old monitor that's fine my problem is that the the rest of the stuff doesn't look old they probably spent six times
the amount on their keyboard than they did on their monitor I don't know this stain on their LTT desk pad looks pretty old or fresh oh when I see a GPU that looks like this and I see a mouse that looks like that I see somebody who has their priori a little who would be psychotic enough to do this you can replace this with a 1080p monitor which is even going to be resolution upgrade for $75 or on Facebook Marketplace 20 I would I would buy a used one literally $20 yeah wait we have to rate them no we
have to rate them first50 so we get a total score to 100 all righty we're going to reveal in three two 1 I give it a 35 wow really no you are ruthless monitor zero you don't get any points for that you might as well not have one thought I'm supposed to be the mean one this is Nolan Nolan Nolan his apartment flooded so this is his I'll buy you a $20 monitor off Craigslist roast victim number two nice well this is obviously Nicole I'm just going to give it a good rating because I
love Nicole wait a second are those headphones I was going to well there's also ones hanging from the thing but you wouldn't use these when you have these would you though also have a lot of crust On Your Side Glass real estate trading Services is there a foot rest I actually kind of love that that's kind of that's kind of that's a 10 on my vibe right there immediately I I really like 10 Vibe really cool wrist rest cool keyboard really cool keyboard um why would you take a picture of your nail
clipper and is that one of those ear cleaners wait a second what's going on this is a new place no this can't be Nicole anymore the individual updated their setup between first submission and second submission but this is the same person I I saw the Penguin and I was like Nicole now I don't know what to think let's get some scores in well I think we should rate the current set up all right 3 2 1 44 47 dang nice setup it's really good uh it's Curtis from HR ah okay that checks out the only reason
why I rated balance down slightly was cuz the mouse pad that's true it's a good value like our sponsor Ridge make those around you Green With Envy thanks to rid's Voodoo green wallets and key cases they're Sleek durable and of course Very green grab them at the link   like a lot of people going with the one vertical one horizontal monitor setup that's a nice setup what is to the right of his computer that's like as big as his computer Xbox really Luke you're so toxic PC Master race you don't even know
what an Xbox looks like at least Playstation still looks like mildly unique dude that is a hot take what is with the hot that is a hot take to be fair all the all the stuff that this person did looks really good I mean you never know when you're going to need gaming keyboard better ergonomics even bashing it clearly this photo is staged though and they still couldn't be ours to Cable manage I feel like this could be a designer setup yeah but then they also have one of the more rare mouse
pads and they're set up as quite aesthetic that's the LTX mouse pad it's not rare yeah but you can't just like buy it all the time you just take it oh yeah 46 at like 47 a it's pretty high this is chewy our social media manager nice that checks out nice all righty roast victim number four Wicked cushions this is neat yeah the keyboard's your temp is zero so you haven't configured anything wait go back to it for a sec okay the date's right are you really going to give them Vibe points for
having the date correct on their computer I mean you can't even browse the web properly if the date's not right on your computer I like the case whoa just the wheels some Wheels hey you know what though you got to store them somewhere you're supposed to store them inside it's actually kind of a vibe to have them right next to the computer I kind of like is this plof okay I don't look at me I'm not saying anything keep guessing no there's no way why because plof has Aesthetics
well no he doesn't but he has more he has more junk this looks really nice this is where the car goes yeah how is everything out of your mouth even the nice things just brutal desk was featured in do you need gaming Hardware I bought it off the company the first month I worked here they said it was okay because they weren't going to send me back to onario oh cuz he would have been on probation so not eligible usually for a staff discount yet all right let's rate it all right three 2 1
40 46 dang I was going to go higher but then I wanted to troll Jamie there you go you got it Jamie from Logistics all righty next person wow I like it got the monitor arm got the cable management the banana looking wrist rest is like actually kind of cool 3D printed headphone holder no headphones to be seen but man or lady of culture and that's the correct era too are these CPU boxes a stand for your Tower everything else about this is so classy what the fudge I kind of like it
oh you would I kind of like it you need all these computers for yeah I like it yeah sick all righty 3 2 1 44 46 nice setup yes I took points off for those boxes they suck I put points on for those boxes they're awesome but your Vibe is going to be pretty high as long as you've got floppy disc coasters I think this is Jesse this is Nick Harris from the labs yeah that makes sense dang it all right next victim why is the only thing I can see this MacBook charger on the floor we've seen surprisingly few cringe
anime waifus so far I knew it wouldn't last forever though cable managed I like to see management looks fantastic Cable Management Box you left the sticker on your subwoofer please take the sticker off um okay I mean that's where boxes go  God so cute I thought it was like like could plush it first very cute okay I thought you were going to say I thought it was Taxidermy no fired the graphics card was given to be my lus when he gamed against people for graphics cards and he beat me so
hard he gave me another try this was at the verified actual gamer live event just based on the graphics card that I apparently gave them oo is that a hint no this person must I don't remember this well this person must not have been an employee at that time question mark could you compete against you as an employee I don't think so I don't think so either I just don't remember this rating time yeah let's give a rating three 2 1 40 48 40 48 did you see them what you give them a five for Value look
how much they spent on anime figurines that they could have spent on their computer this is James Lynn our new test technician oh roast victim number eight o they got the water cooled macro I forget who bought it or won it at the Christmas party um that a gaming controller next to a Mac I have so many questions yeah let's go to the Mac gaming I like it actually I think I can be fired for saying this but I love their mous looks really good I kind of like that they matched the vibe
of it being in the kitchen with the like kitchen style stool thing no your chair needs Wheels a computer chair should have wheels Cameron none no one needs to see me in my messy apartment okay cool what rate this 3 2 1 41 46 this is Tatiana from CRE a warehouse oh that checks out you're going to lose some value points for gaming on a Mac though however wa you rated higher than a 10 however I gave a 12 for the tower it's a water cooled Mac Studio that's the coolest thing ever all right next victim is that
a shower no no no that's a window curtain I thought it was a shower curtain tin of cookies just like I mean this looks like it's supposed to be for a racing setup or something but no wheel to be found no no it's not for a racing setup heavy curtains to ensure that no light gets through VI out hard while chilling on the couch setup that's what it's for case the cheapest thing Canada Computers had on hand ntg2 shotgun mic that's what I'm talking about you see that interface too with
camera nope so you're just a serious business gamer with a shotgun mic and the world's nastiest carpet like I can see the I can see the chunks of things on it from here all right three two one reveal 23 32 Vibe one peripherals 10 what vibe 10 this is Jordan our writer dang it Jord I gave it a 10 Vibe not because I like the vibe but because it has very strong Vibe I can't give 10 vibe to anything that has this layout for the desktop icon we're going to have some extras over on lm. g/f flat plane yeah oh the
fact that it's ploof on the desktop wallpaper just means they haven't changed the default wallpaper that Logistics puts on everything this is a Jamie Pilkey initiative yeah 7 tabt is this a flex don't have much files to store on it LOL I kept watching the uh what how he blames me and then immediately says he doesn't blame me well I got I got to  um I breathed in cuz I was going to do a take all righty victim 10 okay the Disney wallpaper yeah with the stuff on the door wow you are clearly still in
your childhood room the headphones are hung up with the not liking the headphones here that's going to Dent your headband yeah also this is not enough mousing area what is this doing here what is what is that looks like Paddington Bear or something something that had a volume knob all right I somehow moved into my partner's childhood bedroom yeah all righty 3 2 1 30 38 dang this is young one of our newer editors lame Vibe young although it is a young Vibe you know what they they they win as hard as they
possibly could with the monitors which I respect you can't just grade People based on how many monitors they have no I'm just there's more to life than having a bunch of monitors Luke yeah and they're clearly like making it work good value though clearly don't waste money yeah Traxis and RC nerd got the project Matt over there really like the inclusion of right next to the computer this is my vibe right here great 10 Vibe so this is right beside it cuz you can see oh so it's a turn left which I like
even more ooh getting stuff done I agree see this is how you can keep some boxes but have it be tasteful and classy okay stash it you know is that a cushy foot rest I like it computer build wise it makes almost no sense bottlenecks everywhere no no that's okay yeah your CPU could be a little bit more powerful and you'd get a bit more out of that RTX 3090 but it's not that bad 3600 ddr4 what are you even talking about don't beat yourself up so much you're going to lose a point on your Tower
you're going down to n for not knowing that it's a perfectly good Tower it was built in a scrapyard Wars type fashion where whatever was cheaper on sale I bought nice I'm giving them the point back no I feel like last time my whole thing was people had really bad mous pads and now my whole thing is people only have one monitor can you stop shaming people you know some of us can only look in One Direction at a time it's not about that reveal in 3 2 1 45 46 I love this setup very good this is
Justin nice fabricator for the writing team really good setup yep and I hadn't even noticed link up here just overseeing and making sure that everything's going cool I didn't notice either love it all righty next person the cup holder that perfectly fits the LTD water bottle is kind of sick the mouse pad yeah that mouse pad needs some help you could have spent some of the money you spent on a Mac on having a decent mous pad got him what is this why is your speaker pointing over there I
respect the Box monitor stand though I respect it yeah especially especially when you didn't have the budget for something better because you spent it all on airpods Pros is that smoke detector I don't know does it hurt holding on to a dying IP like this it does I know I'm not even holding on and it still hurts I know so you can tell they haven't given up yeah it's modern stuff y current ERA stuff well some old stuff this is so sad it's got the whole vibe just changed yeah that took a lot
the excitement out of this for me these are super cool though yeah or at least they would have been when Star Wars was cool yeah kind of a cool place to hang out yeah actually got the AC love it they put the good Mouse chair Sor and and yeah yeah wait what better mouse pads yeah why are your better mouse pads over there where there's no computer are you operating your air conditioner 3 2 1 40 live two yeah the Star Wars morning really killed it for me that's fair all righty this is Liam from the float plane
team yeah oh that makes sense who this is a sick setup this is awesome underes desk mounted Tera managing to have you know some clutter but keep it super super tasteful you got some Mario some Lewis Hamilton you got your freakin speaker down  Three Holy no I cannot I was so into it until we got to anything to do with audio if my ears were in my crotch then this is a great setup also leather mouse pad value for 3 2 1 35 46 and I'm pretty sure this is Maria correct overall I think that
one's really nice I just yeah find a better your ears are up here yeah all right next victim Bas is this a B of apples going from Maria's setup to this cup of urine on the table do get over it is that a CERN Cup oh man you're going to need you're going to need some string Luke here's some string and lip Bal Vibe 10 I love this this is sick is that a huge bottle of isopropyl I think so this can't be that old Luke the bread plushies from this year yeah whatever it's sick everything thing about this is
awesome juice get over don't bother putting this in your case I mean you'd hate to keep track of them doesn't need them to charge right now it's fine you take it a full level past the box of Kleenex and you go straight for Fast Orange hand cleaner you re man I mean why contain the mess when you can clean  sword sick oh my god well we found the we  I think there's some de I think it might be tinan it's almost certainly someone from the Creator Warehouse team and seeing that exercise
ball as the chair he's very the first aid kit too um he's like Safety First Aid guy it's like obnoxiously Safety First Aid he wanted baby gates after I  stairs I'm just going to say I like the exercise ball CH I'm giving him a nine ready I give it a 43 it should have been a 49 but it got a 50 cuz I gave the vibe 11 that's kind of cheating but it is tinan next victim what green zip ties classy power button equally class um wow it's weird because it's almost like you broke into someone's house who had a
really cool Vibe stole a few of their cool things and then brought it to your weird like mation cave it's almost like a gradient and then you get to all the like cans and it's like right why is the middle monitor tilted so far down oh yeah look at that do I recognize the mouse pad as being a particular person's that may or may not be here right now I didn't think this is what their setup looked like I'm not confirming anything bro well no I mean I know he has a stupid frame case
that's him too he has a stup he has a stupid super stupid is a really stupid frame case it takes up so much space it lands what's really interesting too is you can really how bad the cable management is everywhere because you can see right through the stupid frame facee there's not nearly enough pathetic simp here though so I'm not sure that this is Elijah yet but it has that garbage keyboard with that wrist rest oh a beline wrist rest yeah this is almost certainly Elijah why are two of them the
same you had opportunities make custom screwdrivers you made two that are the same except where did you get a Black Shaft it was in a bin you know he's the next AMD ultimate Tech upgrade right well he needs it I don't even know if I want to go in this house found more simple that's just the same keyboard case yeah but the thing is like why are you proud of it it looks good on a shelf oh my God you know this this is more than the average American has in their bank account this is probably more than
Elijah has in his bank account because he put it all here I will not confirm that why is your middle monitor pointed down well the mount is not strong enough for the weight of the monitor monor also why' you buy a curved monitor I didn't where'd you get it Christmas party my old job okay let's get to work sounds like I'm getting lunch Bo oh yeah we can't rate him too low cuz then he gets rewarded for it I've already decided he's trying to win a free lunch all right 3 two 1 reveal I
don't want him to get anything yeah all right I gave him a 30 for balance just so that I'd be able to give him a high score so he won't so he won't lose all my other ratings are real I love that we coordinated on that dang it I had already given them all tens before anybody said anything and I didn't see it so well thank you at least I can say I have the highest score now really high rating on that one  PNG they've been loved my main desktop  that you know what I love this art wall 
Vibes given how clearly old this is the gunk level is actually not that bad given given how old it is because so to be able to wear all the way through that like how do you wear through the entire side of your mouse that's really impressive it honestly probably gives them a really good grip though cuz their thumbs going to like slot into position it probably feels great if this mouse dies they're probably going to be very sad I remember this chair yeah the Costco Delux yeah
it's a piece of crap y my chair is peeling my headphone pads are falling apart and my thumb has destroyed my mouse and I'm running out of storage space please send help I agree I'm taking off some points for that crappy chair I got suckered into the same one so I'm just mad still that's you didn't do anything wrong 3 two 1 go 41 47 yeah yeah nice setup this is Hannah the editor oh nice relatively new just off probation I hope your mouse Never Dies welcome Hannah she seems to not be that
stoked on the mouse I think you like the mouse more than she does maybe Luke would buy it from you no cuz it's not the same my my thumb is not going to go in the exact same spot and it would have to be the exact same spot for it to be good ooh with the Evangelion case with the matching water bottle okay Vibes are maxed you didn't even talk about the CRT yet oh it's sick I don't know that it's it looks actually like it might actually be legit any tips you're asking for Tech
tips this that's not what the notes are for Less jarring 3 2 1 reveal 34 49 wow quite different on this one yeah I really like it that computer stolen from work he gets a zero you know who it is I know who this is this is Sam Sam the editor yeah we just filmed an AMD at his house last week sure did zero for stealing that computer no and all seriousness he wanted at the Christmas part he wanted at the Christmas party super nice computer hold on let me fix this that's the equivalent fix this for you 44 44 bin
laddin what Laden okay this person wants the free lunch a lot of action here got a Xbox bodypiercing spray that's a weird thing to have on hand is that a Dreamcast yeah all right you might be slightly oh my God no I know who this is there's no way that this isn't Tanner oh my God why is it why are there  P I don't even think this is Tanner anymore is that no that's one of the LTT  on wait no cuz Alex D's place is nice now I'm so confused now that is a Dusty V how many pictures do you need who are
you base Star Fox it's almost too tidy to be Tanner though all right I think I've seen enough really you're not going  block all righty that's higher than I intended 3 reveal 30 42 I don't really Vibe with it and the value is not good you've spent too much on Wii games you said you think you know who it is who is it yeah this is Emily yeah there you go I know because I painstakingly assembled that piece of correct in her Intel extreme Tech upgrade I give I give this a Vibe of 12
um and a balance of 10 it is very balanced the the expense paid for retro games is very balanced across the entire room cable tie. jpeg okay I can see why it was included that is the world's cutest cable tie that is a very cool cable tie that's a really long headphone holder do your headphones hang low do they wagle to and fro what is the point of that ninja printed Luke's favorite you've you just got a 10 for your peripheral he hasn't seen anything else yet I don't know you might end up with a
six for having only one monitor maybe seven actually that's my standard score looks pretty great I like that mouse pad yeah Sarah did a good job on that one it's limited edition no by and large our staff have pretty nice setups other than Elijah what the heck all right 47 40 I like it I took some points off for that chair this is Natalie from creater Warehouse oh yeah okay yeah I'm not I'm not raing the chairs so much cuz I find chairs are so specific yeah it looks like an
off-brand DX racer which is already not a good racing chair yeah no offense Natalie if you stole it from work then at least I could have boosted your value Mark 117 117 117 it's so might like Halo not sure yeah I got a couple what are  Chef this is under this is under your desk this is where you display the world's most useless place to put those yeah I they're already useless if you're not going to put them on display good Cable Management though you did not pay  you took too many pictures I'm taking
off a point for that all eight lucky setup love it 43 this is Mitchell good stuff customer service from customer  oh that's pretty awesome okay paper on top of your computer yuck mouse pad hanging off the edge equally big yikes at least it's hanging um the same on both sides yeah that's cool though super cool I'm not 100% sure what's going on there UPS though UPS very nice I respect it I respect the uninterruptible power supply there's a lot of cables but they did do some work to make them not
horrible this is not how ring lights work ring lights have to be close to you they put in the effort yeah they stole a lot of extra large cable Arches from work this individual bought them they bought them yes and couldn't figure out the Key Bar holder struggled with it for two hours the only person I can think of who's this dedicated to sticker bombing things is plof isn't that literally how he sticker bombed his cooler though I don't I remember that now this is a very
different setup I think yeah did he move where's all the oh wait no he has gotten into figures hasn't he oh my God does this guy really need more  on outed freaking outed 3 2 1 36 I didn't write a total but a lot great Vibe zero value I think you waste more money than Elijah which is truly remarkable I gave him extra points for the monitors just cuz I thought that would make him happy no other real reason to be completely honest and also um gave him 12 for the vibe cuz I I
really like the the couple setup and how they're kind of meshed together is really cool and he's got a UPS cuz he's trying to be smart and just like there was a lot of things that contributed to good vibe all right well well that means our winner of free lunch with the lowest score of 54 is Nolan enjoy your lunch Nolan very first one we reviewed and enjoy this segue I'll try to get you a new monitor to our sponsor rocket money as every day goes by it seems like a new product pivots to becoming a service
