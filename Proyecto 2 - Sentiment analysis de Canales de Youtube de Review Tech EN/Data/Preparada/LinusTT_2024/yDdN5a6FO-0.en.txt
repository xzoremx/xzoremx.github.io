Evan asks is it worth it to upgrade from ddr4 to ddr5 or should I just wait for my next build and the answer to this one's a little complicated while there are CPUs that have support for both ddr4 and ddr5 upgrading your memory is not as simple as just swapping out the RAM sticks in order to support that newer memory standard you're going to need a new motherboard and by the time you're buying new memory and a new motherboard the benefit that you're getting is simply too small to justify the expense
it is almost it's never worth it to upgrade from one memory standard to the other unless you're also upgrading the components around it to best take advantage of that faster Ram thanks nexo for sponsoring this short you can learn about their nexo gripon case at the link in the video description
