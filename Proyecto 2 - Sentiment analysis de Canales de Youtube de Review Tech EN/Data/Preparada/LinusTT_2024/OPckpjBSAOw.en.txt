when we heard the Canadian government was moving to B hacking tools like this one we sprung into action buying as many of them as we could while we still couldn't guys some of this stuff is flipping wild like this electromagnetic fault injector which basically EMP bombs anything that you pointed at how she doing oh whoopsy Doodles but there was one device that stood out from the rest all the Jammers sniffers looters and tutors that hack rf1 with the portter PAC H2 Mayhem Edition now being a decade old radio
transceiver you'd think it's got to be pretty outdated by now but thanks to its robust developer ecosystem open- Source design and ample tutorials for users of any level the hack rf1 has turned into a virtually unmatched Wireless hacking Swiss army knife it's capable of stealing a car breaking into a house stampeding cattle through the Vatican and even creating a small pirate FM radio station that plays skibbidy toilet on Loop but how exactly is this being used by nefarious and law-abiding people
alike should it be banned and what would that even look like well we have some ideas just like we have some ideas on how to Segway to our sponsor next too say hello to the hello cam Pro and give your setup an upgrade thanks to its 1080p 60 frames per second resolution and windows hello facial recognition learn more using our Link in the  Go part of this device's superpower is its ability to read and transmit radio signals and I already know what you're thinking so could my grandpa's TransAm
but Pea's whip was limited in both the frequencies that it could tune into and in how it could use them not so for us with the right setup we can detect and even glean useful information from radio signals that you probably didn't even know existed like the ones coming from this display cable it's stuck in grayscale but look at this you can totally make out what this person is doing on their screen this style of eavesdropping is called then e freaking and was first outlined in a 1985 paper
by its namesake whim van e of course that was 40 years ago surely Modern Display protocols protect against this kind of snooping right right well as long as you're talking about display port VGA DVI and yes even HDMI can all be monitored pun intended with the hack RF provided that you are within range how far is that range well for our relatively small omnidirectional antenna we're looking at inches rather than meters but in his original paper on the topic Vanek was able to spy on a CRT display several
hundred meters away using a directional FN antenna similar to the kind that was found on home rooftops in the 20th century I mean sure that was an analog signal coming from a type of display that oozed radiation but modern techniques aren't that far off just a few weeks ago researchers in Uruguay managed to train an AI to descramble images at much greater ranges now the quality of these images not to mention the model's likelihood to hallucinate have yet to be seen let's not forget the
Samsung pictures of the Moon debacle but this still has major implications for people who are working with highly sensitive information luckily most people aren't in possession of information that's worth stealing at least not while it's this much effort to do so but what most people do have is material things like this and this and this and what's very little effort is using the hack rf1 to sneak past a wireless security camera whether they're for Wi-Fi car keys or cell phones Jammers all work
roughly the same way by sending out as much junk traffic as possible at the same frequency to mask or disrupt legitimate traffic kind of like shouting between two people trying to have a conversation and the portter pack interface when it's updated with the jamming software plugin makes makes jamming terrifyingly easy Once you know the channel a device is using which you can often find with the hack rf1 all you need to do is Click transmit Jammer select the channel from a list and hit
go now obviously a GoPro would be a pretty odd choice for a security camera but our point is that this kind of technique is useful aha on pretty much any Wi-Fi camera and unless it has local storage for backup that's exactly what's going to happen you're going to get if anything little bits and pieces of what's going on that's one of the main reasons that we avoid wireless security cameras here at the office now this type of jamming is illegal in most countries including Canada so you can safely assume that
everything you just saw was movie Magic and was shot in a Brazilian jail Romanian one got to go the question that must be in your mind now then is why don't they just ban these things well as I mentioned before the Canadian government is certainly trying but it's not really a simple task for one thing like a hammer these devices have nefarious uses but they also have many legitimate uses for example you can use the hack rf1 to monitor for interference that might be affecting your Wi-Fi or your Bluetooth
devices you can get data on flights that are passing overhead you can listen to FM radio and do so much more it's like a full toolkit for learning about RF another issue preventing a Crackdown on these is that not every type of jamming requires easily detectable brute for spam a Wi-Fi deauthentication attack for example finds the MAC address of a Wi-Fi access point it copies it then continuously sends deauthentication packets to every connected device preventing them from staying connected
the pagi or this deor watch are perfect examples of devices that can perform these types of attacks literally from your wrist and all they're doing is exploiting a perfectly legitimate feature of the Wi-Fi protocol I mean you can Outlaw this behavior and they do but how do you prove it didn't happen by accident how do you prove who did it the last big obstacle to Banning these devices is that pretty much all of them are based on cheap readily available single board Computers Plus parts that
can be easily found in a children's robotics Club I mean it's already illegal in just about every country Canada included to be carrying around a break-in instrument and the burden of proving you have a legitimate use for it falls on the accused but even this relies on officers to recognize that that video game or Smartwatch looking thing is what it actually is so there's nothing we can do to keep these tools out of the hands of Nells so what do we do now well we contacted Great Scott gadgets creators
of the hack rf1 to discuss this topic and politely they told us to pound sand fair enough I mean we did call their device aoral in our coverage of the flipper zero but they also weren't alone in denying our request for comment every hacking tool company that we contacted from electronic cats to deike to our friends over at hack five where completely unwilling to engage in conversation about the legality of their products which makes a lot of sense I mean they build them for Security
Professionals but they're clearly being used by shadier folks with recent car theft Trends grabbing a lot of headlines and putting them in an uncomfortable position so I'm going to say what I believe they would say if they were willing to say it the better solution is to beef up our security though this is easier said than done in our flipper zero video we briefly explained how the hack rf1 can be used to defeat rolling code security for a vehicle's keyless entry system and if you're an avid Tik
Tok user you're probably already familiar with the Kia boys a trend where teenagers were stealing Kia and Hyundai Vehicles made after 2012 by breaking open the steering column usually with a screwdriver not purchased at LTD store.com and plugging a bog standard USB cable into the ignition that doesn't even require a hack rf1 or anything fancy so what's clear is that in the interest of saving a buck modern devices can often take a painfully LAX approach to Security even ones that cost tens of
thousands of dollars like the Honda CRV that vehicle holds the title of most stolen car in Canada because while it would normally take a fair bit of effort to defeat rolling code not to mention specialized equipment the rolling pone attack exploits a flaw that causes the CRV to reset the code counter allowing previously used codes to both open and start the vehicle and it took an embarrassing amount of time for Honda to identify and address this issue so yeah are these devices actually making it
easier to steal cars and generally cause trouble of course they are especially by making them so easily available to folks who wouldn't have the wherewithal to build one themselves but the same could be said for a hammer this could help you break into a car more easily are we going to get rid of them so I think the focus should be on the big automakers and how they manage to fail so so hard and on the organized crime networks that are engaging in these practices at scale rather than on the makers of softwar
