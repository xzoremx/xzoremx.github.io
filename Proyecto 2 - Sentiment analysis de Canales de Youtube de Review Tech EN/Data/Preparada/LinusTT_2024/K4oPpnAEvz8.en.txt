Ridge and vessie should we jump right into our headline topic here yes good what is it oh yes the CEO of the Motion Picture Association told a Convention of theater owners that the organization is planning to work with the United States Congress on legislation to require American isps to block piracy related websites with all the other stuff that they have to work on like the cost of insulin I'm sure this is a top priority and oh wait uh okay hm this might have a chance the proposed legislation would allow
copyright holders to petition a judge to block a given site CEO Charles rivkin claimed that piracy steals hundreds of thousands of jobs from workers and tens of billions of dollars from their economy including more than 1 billion in the electrical ticket sales in the United States both tech companies and internet advocacy groups have warned that this proposed framework is likely to lead to overlocking of lawful content yeah which is what wound up undermining the stop online piracy act soapa over a
decade ago so our discussion question here is is this going to work um I I honestly don't necessarily feel like it would work even if it does go through they have to petition individual sites let just spin up another one well Luke I mean here's here's the the domain is unimportant here's the question though what is this going to do that  VPN couldn't already be worked around do you yeah exactly like what is this going cuz Okay already already if you download a copyrighted work okay look I'm just
going to I'm going to come out and say it we were doing some video on emulating something and it was more convenient for me to just download a Final Fantasy Tactics ISO than to rip it so I did and I didn't have my VPN on actually did this at work um and we got a notice we got a we got a notice from our internet service provider where the the rights holder I don't actually was it Final Fantasy Tactics I don't remember it was it was something that was why does he do this from my point of view not morally
an issue why does he do these things I just because they're I will never know it it's not a moral issue to me to download why you do on the work oh I was so lazy I didn't have my VPN installed but don't do that work Network I know but look Luke it this was like years ago okay you you weren't even working here all right now I don't care yeah it wasn't Rec anyway the point is this was like weeks ago I was like what are you talking about the point is I don't personally consider it a problem
to download a copy of a game that I own I don't care yeah I don't care and from my point of view you can tell me all day that I only own a license to use the game in its exact form and on the exact device that I don't I actually don't care about any of that um so anyway I own the game from my point of view and I will download it if I feel like it but I got a notice um from my ISP that the dmca rights holders blah blah blah had notified them that they forwarded it there's no actual punishment here uh
they can't actually do anything they can't turn off your internet or anything like that but they already know um what is this exactly going to do how how are you going to enforce this unless you basically do you know back to our sort of our our title for this unless you actually do create like an authoritarian internet censorship system yeah yeah like just blocking a website tools for it you know yeah just well here's a question for you I mean what are the odds that the American
government basically already has it and is kind of ready to actually I don't know if they're that organized never mind I take it back I mean they can see sites and they they they could make this type of stuff happen but like the but it's slow yes and it's not really it's not really very effective and that's why especially on a larger scale that's why instead of going after them one by one and trying to get the trying to go after the um trying to go after the companies that are
providing them hosting or trying to go after their domain registar or trying to go that's why instead of trying to go after them in in all these ways to get the site actually taken down they're trying to Simply block users access to it but my point with my story was that if you pirate content you probably are  anyway what difference will this make unless they fundamentally change the way that internet access Works in North America I mean there's also stuff like uh I don't know if you've gotten to this
line yet maybe you have uh CEO Charles rivkin claimed that piracy steals "100,000 jobs including 1 billion" theatrical ticket sales like No And there there's there's there's all these arguments like I find it pretty interesting of companies on Steam steam has a very good and robust Regional pricing Tool uh and and companies are finding like they'll they'll see a lot of piracy in a single area maybe wondering how they do that you look at like language in the discussion of the
thing um and then they'll adjust the pricing in that area to be more reasonable like maybe your take-home is significantly lower your cost of living significantly higher you don't have the spending money to buy something in the equivalency of American dollars of whatever it's supposed to be they make it cheaper piracy drops off like a rock people are saying L Brazil Luke Brazil yeah there's a lot of examples pirate software has a video on on him reducing the cost of his game in Brazil
specifically piracy shot down and his sales in that country went way up because it's it's not that necessarily people want to pirate in order to effectively steal something from a company it's often that that thing is not super attainable either you can't get it very easily or it costs too much and it's like well right now with 10 billion different streaming services acquiring video content can be really annoying and to be clear I also don't buy the argument that there is zero impact I'm sorry but there are
people for whom they just aren't paying because they just if they don't have to they'd rather not but they could afford to um so as usual with any argument the truth is somewhere in the middle is this stealing hundreds of thousands of jobs well you know what I don't know worldwide gee man that's a lot like how many how many bloody how many yeah how do you even quantify that also also where is your where is your hand ringing when you know you've got AI encroaching on the industry from every side ah yes
let's please use that as much as possible and like one of the issues that I have with this is I'm assuming that there's some equivalency of amount of times that something was pirated to the amount of money that you lost but it just doesn't work that way like when I was a kid pirating games I was not going to buy it if you made piracy piracy impossible there just would have been no sale I just would not have played that game there was no not give take everyone is like that though either I know but I
do think I pired games I could have afforded to buy when I was young think it's would you have bought them if you couldn't have pired it um I think in a lot of cases probably no I'm trying to think it's been a very long time and I don't really remember here's something that I always found kind of uh interesting about my own habits was that if I pirated a game I tended not to really play it very much and I don't know what it is like we've talked about this on the show before how like when I when when we were
kids pretty much everyone that I knew had no had somewhere between two and oh man I'm trying to think like five or six games for their console total yeah like we did not have if someone if I went to someone's house and they had like 10 or 20 Nintendo games oh you're a rich I was like whoa like damn there's some money here yeah um and we played those games oh over and over and over and over and over again and for me piracy was like this it it became like uh like it was almost like my first
exposure to kind of one of the problems with gaming now is that there's too many options so many options and such a finite amount of time that you can't possibly hope to enjoy them all um I don't I don't think I can think of a game that I actually played for a substantial amount of of time that I pirated and then never ultimately bought bought yeah um so those aren't lost sales either like I obviously there are going to be lost sales from piracy but saying that you can try to quantify it
is like what I don't know where are you getting this $1 billion doll in Theatrical ticket sales cuz I have a major doubt on that one I mean it's not that much in the grand scheme of things I mean when a single movie will do a billion dollars in ticket sales from time to time I mean it's not like they're saying oh yeah we're we're selling half as many tickets as we would have if uh um if piracy wasn't a thing or whatever else I think they I that actually if they were saying
a billion more tickets obviously we'd have to say strong doubt they're saying tens of billions of dollars from our economy including more than one billion in ticket sales the only reason why they said ticket sales is because it's the theater owners organization uh but they're saying tens of billions of dollars from the economy I just don't believe that I've a really hard time without any sources cited believing tens of billions of dollars would show up in the American
economy if they somehow deleted piracy I don't see it happening I think the  really oh man yeah that's a tough one because you know at other points on this show we've talked about how the media production industry is obviously in in trouble right now oh it's in huge trouble but when you when you kind of dig down and try and figure out okay like you know what is the trouble where is it coming from um it seems to be from a lack of of of truly creative Innovative content right like the mariz
of everything when you look at what happened I mean and it's funny because um the examples I'm about to use of of something that that broke out of the the doldrums that the movie industry is in are both huge IPS right like the Super Mario movie and Barbie right um but I think that showed that there's absolutely an appetite the problem with this is that the problem with this whole argument and man I'm going to be in trouble for a hot take here um the problem with this argument that you've
stolen hundreds of thousands of jobs from workers is that I don't think that right now there is a um there is a a Content Volume problem when it comes to lowquality garbage that people don't want to watch anyway I think the content problem that we have is innovative exciting content yeah and no offense but you are not hiring those hundreds of thousands of people yeah in your hypothetical scenario where there is no piracy and you have way more fighting really hard to not hire them how many
actual like directors have financially successful F you know let's say more than three financially successful movies under their belt and it's going to be this is a number that's going to be in the dozens or hundreds not the thousands tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands and obviously there's more than a director that just works on a movie but my point is just how small that tip of the iceberg of what we see at Hollywood is the the the ones that break out the ones that are super
successful versus the ones that um are just working on yet another reality TV show like are you telling me that if you had more movie ticket sales you would stop making you know just stupid random reality TV series and you would you would you just be incentivized more you take a home run swing at at a movie I I don't know man I don't know if I buy it yeah I just the the argument stinks in my opinion I'm not I'm not saying like raw raw piracy or anything I just think a lot of the arguments around it are
um very sensationalized I think I'm sure there's a financial impact to the industry um I think in in my opinion the movie industry in general has always had a like acquisition issue movies and TV shows like how do I get this thing what Temporary Service do I have to subscribe to to be able to watch it I can't get a permanent copy at all anymore that's the biggest problem for me right now yeah like there's so many issues with that I I could not really understand what the point of piracy was during the golden
days of Netflix yeah totally agreed I'm pretty sure we talked on wancho about like you know putting the hat in the closet cuz like there's no reason right now I now it's strongly coming back out obviously they don't have hard numbers on this but I was reading a different article um not the one that was about this recently that um figured based on some number that someone pulled out of their butt somewhere that piracy was up about 12% year overy year um and this is this is in America not surprised at all it
doesn't surprise me one bit I am simply not going to subscribe to Disney plus and Amazon Prime and Netflix and Hulu and Paramount plus and whatever the HBO one is called now I I was sitting here trying to think of what his name was I don't care I don't know I don't care oh yeah it's ridiculous no I haven't seen Game of Thrones yeah because you don't have the thing well it's also because I don't want to until he's done writing the books but I just mean I I don't think I've seen it I don't think I've
seen an HBO show since are saying crave Max is oh HBO Max yeah Max that's right CRA the one with letter Kenny crave crave licenses HBO shows in Canada yeah crave crave has letter Kenny which is great but then I I don't want anything else on crave so it's just like I guess I'll subscribe and then try to binge watch it really hard and then leave like I want to just buy it culus says LOL poor line is he's going to die before that book is done are is that a threat are you threatening
me I'm kidding I know he means George AR Martin I just what am I not allowed to pretend to misunderstand things no okay oh I can buy the D they're just DVDs what's a DVD letter KY oh okay cool  upscaling got is that good I haven't done it it's getting pretty good um no I wouldn't say that you can go to 480p and or from 480p and it'll be a great experience um if you've got at least a 720p Source it's looking pretty good on a 1080p Source 4K is like why bother yeah um one thing
that's not there yet is the SDR to HDR up conversion but I like seeing where nvidia's at with that today right seeing where they started with upscaling in games and where they are now oh yeah yeah I think we're headed in in a give them a few more years and uh if they ever finally release a new Shield Pro um so some more Hardware give them a few more years and some more hardware and I am I am pretty stoked on where I think we're going to be with just being able to enjoy whatever copy
of a piece of media you happen to own at whatever resolution and color space you want obviously it would be better to have a human do it properly and the definitive piece of or like the definitive version of that content is probably going to be that but I think that Ai upscaling and AI SDR to HDR conversion is going to be good enough for most people um with that said a lot of the time the newer grade is not necessarily better people are apparently like super poed about uh aliens' Blu-ray
4K Blu-ray release oh yeah something something it's it's more of it's more of like the film buff type stuff than what I think the average person would care about but it's pretty common not just to get like you know the the Star Wars or or ET effect where you know digitally remove guns or you know who shot first or whatever else right it's it's it's not all that kind of thing um sometimes it's just like oh yeah they they didn't go back to the original um film like they they didn't restore it they just
took uh some some other um master and just kind of you know I don't know applied an upscaling filter and then sharpened it and then res softened it to make it kind of look like it was higher res um so I I don't know exactly what happened with uh aliens let's see if anyone is yeah it looks like this is something that hasn't really made its way outside of you know r/ Blu-ray or whatever the the Blu-ray Enthusiast subreddit is I don't even remember anymore but uh some some people are definitely mad about
it oh yeah okay someone said the Matrix had some mastering issues where they got rid of the green and blue tints and that that's the kind of thing that can happen accidentally if someone's working on and I don't know if that's what happened in that case but that's something that can happen accidentally if the people working on the the remaster don't understand or remember the original intent for why it was graded in that particular way and I I was spending some Googling
trying to figure out how to get shy and letter Kenny which is the two shows from the same group that are highly related same Universe um and and a lot of the responses are like yeah super annoying you just have to like actively be subscribed to Crave bu the junky DVDs or insert what you can assume right and it's like yeah why why can't I just get a high quality version that I can watch whenever I want I don't want to binge they have like eight seasons of letter candy and like
multiple seasons of shorts no I don't want to have a financial incentive to subscribe for one month and then just dgen super hard and watch all of this in one month and then shut it off like just let me own the copies in decent quality and I've been pretty firm that I'm not going to buy any copy of a movie or TV show that is Reliant upon a service staying up and we are already seeing that prediction of mine that anything that you buy from a web shop that is Reliant upon accessing it
through that web shop authorizing or anything like you do not own yeah they'll take it down they'll edit it they'll change they'll get acquired it doesn't matter so this is one of those things where guys to be clear I mean I think that you've heard my stance on piracy enough times um does it have does it have harms um yeah I mean I don't think there's any question of that is it as easy to quantify as uh Executives will make it sound when they're doing a little presentation to their little industry
buddies no are we telling you never do it or you're a bad person for doing it no we're not doing that either we're just telling you you know consider consider the impact that's that's all I say um and also good luck MPA you're are going to have to fundamentally shift the North American the the Western philosophy of the internet in order to make this work and I really just don't think it's going to happen yeah it might be time to dust the hats off if you don't have one you can get it to the
store funny joke I'm trying to have plausible deniability that I'm not telling people to become Pirates really yeah and your way of doing that was telling them they way to go way to go where did you even go what did you where where I just closed it oh you closed it yeah so your sorry your way was to tell them to buy a hat yeah because it was my posible deniability that I wasn't saying pirate hat I see prove that's not a pirate hat modern pirates wear any hat they want
also I couldn't help noticing that it is water resistant which is perfect when you are on the high seas on the high  seas oh boy should we rename it to pirate hat kind of tempted just include like a trial for a VPN change nothing change nothing  okay hear me out do we take a VPN sponsorship again if we're just like here's the talking  piracy that's the world's most honest VPN pitch I feel like the biggest issue with them is the talk points so like I mean our talking points were always clean
like it's one of those things where I feel like a lot of the negativity around VPN sponsorships was from creators who and to be clear I don't actually blame them you cannot expect every random makeup or gaming or nature or history Creator to completely understand the ins and outs of a technology product like a VPN um you know should creators have a responsibility for the products that they promote yeah yes but I also think that the issues around vpns are a little bit more complicated and nuanced then um
you could reasonably expect you know your aunt who makes YouTube videos to fully grasp um and so you know we pushed back on the VPN providers that we worked with especially as as my knowledge grew about them and we ensured that our talking points were aligned with what we believed was the usefulness of vpns um but I think a lot of negativity around VPN sponsorship came from these people who were promoting them in ways that just were not true um now one of the challenges with that is that
obviously they got those talking points from somewhere so we would be working with a company almost and all of almost all of them do this we would be working with a company that did actively promote their products in uh in a deceptive way so on the other hand it's clearly an important part of your online privacy toolkit which is the way that which is the way that we had been positioning it most recently when we were working um when we were working with Pia so in my opinion as long as your
talking points are fine and clear I think it's okay A lot of people when they talk about this including some of the people in the chat right now have been spamming links to a video um whatever I'll just name it it's a video from Tom Scott called this video is sponsored by blank VPN Tom Scott's more recent videos are sponsored by a VPN company and what he was saying in this video is that the the marketing and the talking points are misleading and bad and he was totally right but he
eventually takes a sponsorship from a VPN company and just doesn't have misleading and bad talking points so it's fine um and it's funny because there was a lot of brigading against us after he launched that video and I was kind of sitting here going what we agree yeah what do you want that was a very frustrating time was a super frustrating time uh because his video was great um yeah it's a it's a good it's a good point um cool story bro yeah we got you yeah and to be clear like this is this
is this is mostly in the response to the to people trying to use it to say that there should never be any VPN sponsorships and no one should ever use VPN it's like well hold on you're swinging too far the Tom Scott video didn't swing that far you're you're swinging Beyond where it was going yeah I don't know I um I don't know I think I might just be I think I might just be open to to working with them again like I got to I look full transparency with you guys which always gets me in trouble which is
great but For Better or For Worse exciting those of you who are the real ones who understand that we're being transparent with you and when we are transparent it doesn't mean that you know we have that much more to hide because that's the stuff he tells us we're actually just telling you like real talk how we do things here um VP sponsorships are if not the most financially impactful they are among the most financially impactful um out of everyone that we have ever worked with
uh there's a lot of money in vpns to the point where we not only considered but even went as far as prototyping our own VPN it worked it was great yeah yeah it was up multiple people were using it like it it's actually incredibly easy to do it's not still up is it no are you sure yes I had to think for a second but yeah I I remember it being shut down all right just making sure but I mean you could literally turn it back on in like 10 minutes oh my God not not to the degree that we had it cuz we actually
had like distributed so it was it was it was really cool Jonathan and AJ were like really motivated because it seemed like a fun thing to do and they just smashed it um it was actually like great it makes me sad because it was very well like thought out implemented done future planned all that type of stuff it was it was really really well scoped in those those guys did a great job with it and it just we didn't want to go anywhere because we started talking to lawyers and they posed some
questions to us about like you know if you want your stance to be no disclosure whatever are you okay with these things happening on a service that you run and we were like uh no basically the question was are you okay enabling pedos yeah and we were like nah I guess we won't make all of the money in the world it would have been all of the money in the world though we ran the math it would have been the world would have run out of money before we would have yeah especially with our audience
and with the numbers that we know from working with VPN providers in the past that we know we could have pushed it was huge even if we retained if I remember correctly if we were able to capture I think it was like 25% % of what we had literally already captured mhh we would have just been making monster money yep and it's like huh so then the question becomes what's the difference what is the difference between us making a VPN and making money and us taking the money from companies that are
profiting off of Sheltering Naro Wells it is it is an interesting one but I think that's a question that you could pose to like almost anything yeah but don't what a bism it you just did that's what this is this question is no no no that's not what about ISM I I'm saying here's something really bad and you're saying well what about other things that are bad and I'm saying no answer the question okay I think it's I think it's still okay personally because you're not you're not
telling people hey are you this thing that's really bad use this one it's good you're talking about actually in this situation specifically promoting it  is which is questionable in its own right uh and something we would not be able to do if it was our own service just to be super clear um but what we could do is say vpns are for piracy now and then make our own VPN later but never mention it again  um yeah it's weird so what is the difference between profiting from it
directly and to be clear I actually like have an answer in mind I'm not just trying to give you a hard time I think it's doing the action of of knowing that you're covering the trace for a certain type of people so I thought that's kind of what I was expecting him to say and I guess I guess the difference is that as the owner right because there's no such thing as a completely untraceable connection it is traced to somewhere and then it is encrypted right so so when you're using a VPN it's it's
a relay right so if there's some server hosting awful unspeakable it's not liability content no this is not a this is not a question of liability uh there's there's vpns that operate out of Canada clearly it can be managed yeah um so so if if there's a server that has some unspeakable image or or video or whatever it is on it right and there's a user who's accessing it what the VPN does is it encrypts this leg right so any traffic monitoring that is happening still shows that
unspeakable content arriving at your node so they will come and they will ask you where did it go and Luke lafrenier CTO or whatever seu like would have to title we give him would have to say I will not answer that question I know who they are well no or no logs okay but I could find out I could do it and I will choose not to I could do something about it I dive in front of this person I will decide I will decide to not do this to do nothing about it to stand idly by yeah and I'm
just like literally not willing to do that so if I'm not willing to do that and we advertise this service that people do use for that saying hey there's no logs then we'd have to go against what we were saying because I'm not going to say no to that so we're going to have logs and then it's like wait we said we weren't going to have logs so we can't really run this thing yeah but if someone else runs it we're okay with it people are going to use it no matter what if they want to use it and support us
neat and the vast majority of our audience is going to use it for fine probably downloading movies we could promote kitchen knives people could use them for making food people could also use them for bad things in the kitchen knife scenario there's no logging to figure out who used your thing for bad stuff it's not a perfect analogy no it's really not but like I don't know you can promote that people use something for good stuff um is piracy that maybe some forms of this is going
to be the spiciest W show ever yeah I don't know why we're doing this necessarily but it's a good conversation this is a good conversation it's a I think so I'm I'm interested let us know is this a good conversation are you guys interested no one's like move on like they tell us when they hate what we're talking about there's people talking about drastically unrelated things yeah it's always like that yeah people are like this is great This Is How We Do here this is how we make decisions the
conversations we have on Wow are really not that different from the conversations that we have off of wow they're quite related yeah except that  voyerism as well how do I do that how do I how do I show them wind cam look at that we got some winners in the house look at the Prime seat up front wow that's a glorious position uh a while back we ran a contest draw sweep Stakes I don't know what to call it but basically it's very comfy people who bought the 3D down jacket one in however
many people who purchased it uh were eligible for an all actually I don't know if all expenses were paid but definitely the travel definitely the plane and hotel were paid uh to come to the headquarters get a tour and uh hang out they're actually like I could almost spit on them but I wouldn't because they're above me and it would actually come back because gravity and hit me um myself so I would I could spit on myself and almost reach them uh they're like right above us right
now um hope you guys are enjoying the W show Dan are we doing live Q&amp;A with these guys live merch messages is that a thing yeah I believe they're going to come down here and we can hang well why don't we do another topic real quick and then we'll we'll bring on one of them for our merch message break after topic 2 I think part of it too is for the service to exist like at all it basically has to Harbor bad stuff so there isn't really getting any any getting around how it has to work
and I'm just not willing to run it but I've used them relatively extensively I suggest that other people use them relatively extensively so if I'm going to do so can I not also recommend one to use I think that's fine but I'm not willing to run it myself so there you go you know what Colton if you're watching this get Pia on the phone door's open yeah let's uh it's fine to me like even when we stopped the sponsorship I was kind of like I kept using it K yeah exactly like
I haven't canel my 80% of other creators that have like Nord sponsorships or whatever they are people aren't just going to find it there and you know what's funny is that what's the difference as far as I can tell and you know this is this is the more just like cynical business side of me as far as I can tell stopping our VPN sponsorships has earned us exactly this much Goodwill anyway yeah I I I didn't see during any controversy during any kind of kerfuffle I haven't seen a
single single person that's gone man remember when VPN sponsorships were not cool and lus Media Group didn't take them for literally years yeah and there's lots of other sponsors who've done the same thing for it so I'm kind of sitting here going like you know whatever I still I I'm not saying that to be very clear just cuz someone's going to quote that and then try to throw me under 18 different buses I'm not saying that we shouldn't keep doing that but especially if like we
genuinely don't like if yeah we use vpns it's fine this one seems fine cool and then we control the talking points what at this point I think we're only doing it because people like asked us not to which is like whatever man I don't if if we're going to stop a sponsorship with someone because their customer support is super bad and we've had a lot of uh you know our own user base report that as an issue and we've tried to follow up on it and we haven't seen any good improvements obviously every company's
going to have some customer support issues here or there but like it's it's at unreasonable levels or we find that their product is not sat satisfactory enough for whatever reason whatever else like there's there's reasons why we cancel sponsor ship there's reasons why we don't do certain things that's cool we should keep doing that but like if this was a Goodwill move yeah I don't think it mattered anyways no I don't  whatsoever I don't think we're going back to Tunnel bear
though yeah see but there was a reason suggesting yeah yeah like so like but Pi is still around they seem fine I haven't heard anything bad I don't know may they were acquired by Cape um okay and cape has has a cape has had a complicated history I think is probably the most generous into this stuff in years I don't know me nether yeah maybe we should dip our toes back in I have no idea what Cape is up to these days I have no idea what nord's been up to lately uh a lot of people in
chat are saying I'm I'm I use Pia I use Pia Lots blah blah blah it's like yeah but we promoted Pia for years as well so probably a lot of them that might be why they still have the subscription y so man now I wish we had the uh yeah Top Gear 1224 is like canceling Asus was wild after they paid for LTX so that's a perfect example of how a I haven't seen anyone credit that a we don't earn Goodwill when we do things the community calls for we just get people mad at us when we don't do
whatever they demand and B how the community does not understand how things work behind the scenes here and whenever they make whenever they draw conclusions based on their understanding almost invariably the conclusion is wrong because their understanding is wrong isus didn't pay for LTX the attendees paid for LTX like the the amount of speculation that Asus had us under their thumb because of the spons okay like they they they're a major sponsor I might be able to add some context there yeah sure uh
the amount you guys charged is not in line with other conventions that I've seen for booths for sponsors uh like title sponsors for anything like that the amount of income coming from those things was like orders of magnitude lower than the numbers that I know from certain people that run other certain conventions like way way way way way lower even even considering uh like differences in attendance rates and stuff like that sure like it's and there's reasons for that because lonus was super and I'm not
against this I'm pointing at you it was your idea but I actually I liked it but lonus was super militant about like if you have a booth there has to be something cool there that people can do and all this kind of stuff so the convention was really fun because you you walk into all these conventions that are just like uh it's basically just a bunch of stores or a bunch of like info booths that aren't very interesting so we wanted to be more interactive and cool but doing that meant that a lot of
these big players that go and spend big money at these shows were not really interested because they have a booth that they bring to shows all year it does one thing and they don't want to make it do a special thing just for this one show so we didn't capture a lot of that but I think that's probably where some assumption comes from is often those title sponsors are like big money really big money well that's fair enough um Top Gear says well whoa whoa I didn't say that I was just saying canceling a
headline sponsor type profile no no I'm not I don't I'm not meaning to call you out or anything I'm just saying that people generally do not do not understand um the Dynamics at play here and it wasn't you but it was a lot people when when Asus was Under Fire uh for their handling of particularly some some warranty issues there were a lot of people saying well LTT is not going to say anything because they there there is no Tech brand that we're not willing to speak out against
um and there's a reason that major Tech Brands either don't work with us for years at a time we didn't work with Nvidia for over 2 years on a sponsored basis they begrudgingly especially at first later on things were a lot smoother but at first they begrudgingly seated us cards for reviews just so that we could do our basic coverage of them that was it there are major Tech brands that simply do not talk to us at all we're not in this industry to make friends Apple has my digits I know they
do because I've exchanged emails with a rep one time when they needed something from me every other time that I've reached out to to them they have  so consider who you're going after if it's if it's you know the corruption you're trying to root out if it's the people who play the game we've shown time and time and time again we're willing to stand behind what we say we're willing to stand behind what we believe um where was the thing two two quick things on the convention topic if you
want to look into Booth prices something that's very interesting is Battle State Games the people that run tarov are uh Incorporated in the UK or something instead of Russia and that means all of their corporate documents and finances and stuff are public you can look up how much they spend on booths it will blow your freaking mind really I'm talking like half a million dollars a show sometimes wow like okay yeah we were not getting that kind of money no there also going on stuff like Gamescom sure but
like yeah that's wild huge huge money in booths um also uh I'm going to open sauce come say hi it's going to be really fun I'm doing a panel and I'll be hanging out during the show I realize I haven't told anyone all right one more about to get us canceled topic nice let's go you organize your Welches is that the topic no um that's not going to get me cancelled they all have OCD anyway um I I've made a grid out of my gummy candies here you can't really see it cuz it's behind my screen they're perfectly
they're all in the same direction hased by color they're in a GD this is a this is a good thing all right a small distraction over on float plane asks is there ever an ethical gambling sponsorship adults can choose their vices like basically the question is if it's legal why are we taking some kind of moral High Ground here it's something people enjoy it's something that has made its way into mainstream acceptance especially over the last 5 to 10 years what's our problem why don't we just get
the bag is I'm and I'm I'm expanding on the question a little bit obviously here but thinking my my immediate jump to would go extreme levels of mental manipulation in order to ruin your life um and I think that's like genuinely the main goal of the entire thing um I don't think there's a positive to it literally at all ever uh the only person I have ever seen that has had a healthy relationship with it was uh John Martin actually um and the way that he would do it yeah he would leave it
doesn't mean was John Martin John Martin still exists and still works here yeah um he uh still cool I meant because this thisas old yeah he actually does he's doing good um but he would leave any way of increasing the amount of funds on hand at home go with a fixed amount of money and he enjoyed the process so to him who was like I'll bring as much as I would take to go see a movie I'll get free food because they give you free food when you're there I'll play some games until I'm out of money or when I
get a reasonable amount and feel like I'm happy and then I'll go home and then that is like I am accepting an entertainment expense for the night and there is no way for me to extend it I respected that that seemed fine um the positiv is the winnings you don't you don't get it man no that's not you don't win The House Always Wins yeah everybody knows that yeah sorry dude and like I I appreciate you're at flow planing subscriber all that kind of stuff but like you're that's not you you
lose that's how that works and you is not necessarily you personally yeah you personally might win that one time unprecedented streak of luck but you collect L definitely mathematically lose yeah and like and the problem the problem with saying the upsides is the winnings yeah is you just wholeheartedly accepting the upside is the mental manipulation that is going to eventually rip all my money away and like one I've I've talked about you're taking the dopamine Loop that they want you to take
which is bad I've talked about this on the W show before but like a big moment for me was just walking around in Las Vegas for the first time every like man those the bathrooms are so clean like you could eat off them they're huge the ceilings are 30t high and and painted like the sky like it's like every every every inch of it every brick that was laid was laid with money taken from people who traveled everything they possibly can to communicate to you that you will lose
and horrific and this is how much you're going to give us not you personally necessarily walking into the mouth of a demon like you collectively are here to enrich us this much and even if you win guess what we're going to fill this place with Fine Food and products that are also going to give you a dopamine hit and activities which to be clear I have no problem with activities point is we're going to fill this place with all this stuff so that even when you win you're going to spend
it easy come easy go you're going to spend it oh guess what on establishments within our buildings that we own that funnel that money back to us in the form of rent the whole thing is designed where even if you walk out of Las Vegas up $200 after you spent you know a hundred of it on let's say a a necklace or something something they are still they are still going to keep some of your money there so why don't we take gambling sponsorships  has I used to I used to work at any
reason to promote it yeah we we don't I used to work at the bread factory and there was uh I'm not saying dudes there because there was only men there I'm saying dudes there because I actually don't think any of the women had negative gambling problems only the guys did so L men but um there was many times and many different people that people would come into work and you'd hear them like begging for extra hours and you try to figure out what's going on and it turns out that they yet again gambled
their rent away and are worried about becoming homeless they could have easily afforded their rent they were doing fine we made pretty good money at that point in time I knew these people I knew they were doing okay they were living within means everything was okay but they gambl it away they lost it and then they'll oh all almost you know lost everything that was rough and then a few months later the same thing happens because you're you're being mentally manipulated you're
being controlled like just don't allow this to happen and don't feed into it and yeah I don't know I'd probably so bad I'd probably promote alcohol and cigarettes before I'd promote gambling speaking of vices right like you were saying let people pick their vices there adults and that's fair enough and you know what like to to Luke's Point some people can have a healthy relationship I I actually fully respect John's approach I had not met someone with a healthy relationship and you're you're
going to your brain's just about going to fall out of your head I had not met someone with a healthy relationship with smoking until I met one of my badminton friends she will light up one cigarette like once a quarter just be like I like this I like to enjoy it once in a while and then we'll just not smoke for a month two months three months I mean I still think it's bad but it's not good for you but it's not going to kill them four cigarettes a year is not going to kill someone Luke inhaling smoke is
just bad sure but you'd probably be worse off sitting around the campfire all summer that's very true that's why hesitated a little bit I was like there's a lot worse things let's be real here yeah I mean it's that's I mean it's not as bad as like  smoking I don't know it's one of those things where it's like yeah you can have a just there's really weird arguments you can make about the upsides of nicotine and things get really odd when you start going down that path but then
there's there's much healthier ways to ingest nicotine if you're going for the the posit POS effects that it does have even though it does have really addictive properties all this other like it gets really messy but yeah so it's one of those things to be clear man some people seem confused we are not going to be promoting smoking or alcohol no he no no no that's not the point uh the the point is just that it kind of doesn't matter because these are things that in general are designed to
ENT trap uh to they designed to be addictive they're designed to not necessarily they're designed to but they hurt you yeah and you know what I think we make a bit of an exception for like mobile games for example um our line is that it has to be fun without paying um that's a pretty good line in my opinion because there there are mobile games that are fun there are mob mobile games that are free that are fun um I like Pokémon go I don't engage with it in a way that I feel like it is being
predatory to me I think it's fine I saw oh I saw I saw one comment a little while back and unfortunately I I uh I lost it but it was it was it was a good one someone was basically like yeah gambling is fine if it's you and your buds playing poker and you know that if you lost your buddy won 100% that's a totally different thing I've got no problem with that there was if there was gamble withyou friends.com and their model was that they took like let say say 1% off the top or something like that because
realistically a lot of the odds are are kind of like that anyway but the house was never just like like like Blackjack right like the house was never just like taking all of someone's money I honestly think I could I could maybe accept that what would it even would it what would it would just support poers that correct sure or just any anything where you are betting with well no we can't enforce that it's with people's friends we can't enforce that relationship yeah yeah and then it just becomes a
poker website yeah okay well hypothetically right in in a perfect you know imaginary Utopia if there was Gamble withy yourfriends decom and it was the online equivalent of just you're all busy and don't have time to gather around that stereotypical Round Table just off to the side in the kitchen I know that I know that some people don't like playing things like poker when there is no uh stakes in this case the easiest one is probably Financial but some people will do other things and
that's fine but uh they don't play like playing it when there is none because people just like go all in every hand and like not really take it very seriously so you kind of want something on the line so people play it more seriously that's all fine you do that with your buddies in the comfort of your own home whatever personally I don't care at all go have fun um it's it's the yeah it's the it's the more corporatized gambling that's a problem I'm even like I I generally don't take bets of like almost any
kind lunch I'll do lunch yeah but then that's like the result of this bet is we go hang out yes which is like yeah everybody wins yeah exactly I'm totally cool with those but like hey I'll bet you I'll bet you 50 bucks that this team is going to beat this other team and insert sports game like I have no  $20 Buy in no Reby yeah see like that seems decently healthy to me as long as everyone can afford it you might not have a friend that can so that gets a little weird Uncle Charlie Mt volunteer
fire department people hung around and played poker if you lost 20 bucks you went home nobody wanted mad wives nice see that seems pretty good that's probably okay yeah but there's no way to enforce that with an online service totally so I just don't see I don't see how we could get involved in that it's incredible how much money there is in it though like absolutely wild uh Hey speaking of things that are incredible how much money is in them thank you so much for supporting us through realt
store.com we are going to do some merch messages ladies and gentle folk um the way merch messages work is all you got to do is instead of just throwing money at your screen randomly like you normally would on YouTube or twitch or whatever else you can throw money at LTT store.com all you got to do is add one of our fabulous products to your cart and and a little here let's go we we'll check out our zipup mock neck look how stylish tinan looks okay available on up trip XL we're going to
add that to the cart and anytime the dark colored undershirt that actually works really well anytime we are live there will be a merch message Banner here so you can decide whether to make it Anonymous or show your first and last name you can leave us a little message oh you can even pick your color how cute is that and it will go to producer Dan there he is who will curate your message for me and Luke or respond to it himself or forward it to the appropriate person or just blast it up on the bottom of the
screen for everyone to admire and the best thing about merch messages is you can throw your money at the screen in order to interact with the show and even if we don't get to it or you know your answer is something that we can't answer or whatever else it is you will still get your fantastic merchandise in the mail we've got a couple of new things that we are promoting on the store this week uh we are launching two new apparel items we've got the pocket t-shirt and zipup mock neck so I showed you guys the
zip-up mock neck already it looks great obviously zipper pocket got the little subtle LTT branding how sharp does everybody look YKK zipper of course because we're all about that quality the only thing that I don't like about our stealth branding in general I love it and I want it for myself but the only thing I don't like is sometimes when I'm like driving to work and stuff I'll notice someone walking down the street wearing like a sweater with the backpack or something I'm like hey cool
and now I can't tell yeah well okay that's fair good quality stuff Luke we're going to have something coming for you nice it's going to be very recognizable very out there I hope it's just your face no it will not be that do you remember the what was the dentist  Dennis uh that was so good we've also got our new pocket t-shirt it's a t-shirt now with featuring pocket Infinity per more pocket waa yeah that's right look at that pocket boom right there boom right there on the back
kidding kidding boom pocket available in black and blue I mean I'm sure slate yeah we've probably got some fancy name for yeah slate that's a cool name for it slate I like that it's really comfortable same fit as our blank teas so if you love our teas and you love Pockets we got you we got you pocket gang uh all right want to hit us with some merch messages Dan do you want to do the inperson one first from the uh I was going to ask you if you want let's do it let's do it we'll bring on the
winner we'll bring on the winner cam while we do that sure come over here I think there yeah it's it's like very in person oh wow we can put we can put both so many cameras Oh My Goodness camera setion cameras for days everywhere yeah so yeah oh okay I think uh this is Connor right yes hey Conor and we got some questions perfect thanks guys uh what I wanted to ask was whatever happened to ice giant cooling uh any updates on the next version of the pro siphon Elite now that traditional air
coolers and all in uh Allin ones are so effective and cheap uh did they miss the market opportunity that's a good question in terms of what happened to them I don't think that anything in particular has happened to them other than that they made a really cool really Innovative product and unfortunately oh am I muted I got you oh I I I don't think anything in particular has happened to them in so far as I I don't think they've gone out of business or anything the last time
they showed up on my radar someone on The Forum messaged uh or messaged me or posted publicly I can't remember but I was paying attention to this this discussion that was taking place and they had an issue where they had lost their mounting hardware and they weren't able to mount it to their new upgraded computer right cuz they were using one set and then they needed a new set ultimately I think the resolution to that was that ice giant did get them a replacement mounting kit so evidently
they still exist uh Luc is on their site right now yeah and they have a add to cart product page they have listings on their product page for three different things two of them are in stock one's stock it looks like a real site it's running through Shopify so so they're they're active there but the challenge for their product is that the problem that it solves is not necessarily one that most people have so they came along at what seemed like a really good time when thread Ripper 5000 and subsequent
generations of thread Ripper were looking like we were going to have this need for coolers that were not just able to get the heat away from the CPU but we're able to dissipate that heat to the air around them because that's the advantage of the thermosyphon right is that it does an incredible job of drawing a colossal amount of heat and distributing it to the fins so that it can dissipate it to the air and it doesn't it doesn't suffer from the same bottlenecks that heat pipes
do but the problem with that is that it's only really effective when you have a heat source that is outputting a ton of Heat and the thing about a lot of modern CPUs now that AMD pays absolutely no attention to Consumer thread Ripper whatsoever like we got what we got these like super high-priced thread Ripper and thread Ripper Pro 7000 chips yeah a year a year and a half into the Zen 4 life cycle like are you are you kidding me right now um if I'm an Enthusiast what did I did I wait that long to be on the
latest architecture like come on are you kidding me right so realistically this is something professional users are using the thermal challenges have been solved um the people who are actually running these things overclocked to the point where they really need to avoid um overwhelming their heat pipes in order to get the heat away from the chips like who who are these people and then on the Intel side they're still using monolithic dieses right they're still using and when I say monolithic I mean
single I don't mean that they're actually big right they're still using these single dyes where the bottleneck is not how much heat can we dissipate to the air like an nhd15 is more than adequate to dissipate the 350 Watts that you'll get out of a a 14900 K the problem is that that heat is coming from such a concentrated tiny area that you can't get it away from there fast enough I mean that's why you see Intel actually we didn't talk about on wancho Intel is allowing system
integrators to ship their CPUs delited now select system integrators are shipping delited top tier Intel CPUs that's actually insane yeah that blows my freaking mind with warranty yeah that's wild I know right that's not something I would have seen that we're going back to the be die baby yeah like what year is it 2003 that's nuts I mean Intel had IHSS even then so my my point is that I don't think ice giant has gone anywhere so much as ice Giant's necessity of their product has gone
somewhere if we were getting regular updates for thread Ripper at a reasonable price and we had these large chips where the challenge is how do we get all the heat dissipated to the air then I think there'd be a huge market for it but as it is on the Intel side you got this tiny die and the thermos siphon does nothing to help with that and on the AMD side there's no point overclocking their ryzen non-thread Ripper chips anyway what what are you going to do like get another 50 MHz out of it you
can't even you can't even really push them beyond their power limit not really I mean you obviously if you're an extreme overclock here you're modifying the board yeah exactly I brought it to not interested boom where where's my where Luke muted I can fight back got him wait no you didn't even do it yeah I did did you give me a fake button Dan no I just am bad at my job oh there it goes oh I see it's I accidentally pick the same one that chooses the wide cam how dare you that
makes sense how dare you give me a fake Luke no you just push it until it turns red you're fine I'm sorry D I'll tank all the repercussions from this I appreciate it what what is happening no no I'm just actually incompetent just push it until it turns red I I appreciate you diving under that bus Dan I got you all right good question thank you very know I know they were talking about a copper version forever and uh I was just curious you just uh you never heard anything about it and it just
makes me wonder what kind of they're going to be doing in the future but I mean look it's uh even when you have a really successful product it's really tough to to maintain the kind of revenues that you need to support R&amp;D to build another product screwdriver you're supporting any other people screwdriver has been colossally successful for us "we've sold over 100 30,000 screwdrivers" now uh you know that's pretty easy math to do you guys you can you can do it at home on your
calculatrice um but these days I mean we are down to moving compared to what we did at launch right we are now moving in a month what we might have done in an hour on launch day right like it's not it's not on the same scale and you have to continue to evolve the product and innovate you have to continue to support all the people who are out there owning the product already and who are you know contacting you a year later hey I'm having this issue or whatever the case may be there's a lot of overhead
involved in running a business and so you know that's why you see the really successful companies like the corsairs of the world go out and they're looking for a new vertical to attack pretty much every year whether it's cases or power supplies or peripherals or streaming or whatever those guys are doing freaking everything now and there's a reason for it because if you're not growing your product portfolio it's actually really really hard to sustain your business there's only so much Innovation that you
can do on a cooler you could make a copper one sure but I mean I can tell you right now based on what I know about the differences in the thermal characteristics of aluminum and copper that copper cooler was going to be a degree or or three better and it was going to cost so much more that realistically very few people were going to spring for the copper one would have looked sick I know right would have looked really good I know but very expensive Dan do you want to hit us with
a digital merch message oh thank you so much let's have a look okay uh hey little got a new job as a USB test engineer and I've almost convinced my supervisor to buy the "$15,000 cable tester you guys reviewed" what are the coolest tests lab has coming up in your opinion I kind of wish we could ask some questions back I know right we know who they are you could email them we're actually upgrading our cable tester so uh that's going to be something buy our used one cuz you know
that we're we're well I think we're still going to be using the one we have but we're going to need an upgraded one when we work on our cables because we want to validate them for um data rates that our current cable tester is not capable of handling makes sense that's going to be a somewhat recurring expense I guess uh I think probably the coolest thing oh I don't know everything's cool those guys are working on so much cool stuff a really cool one that I saw is this um
thermal test platform that has I think it's like it's either six or nine sensor locations and they created a custom PCB for the uh for the monitoring piece that outputs the logs of uh the temperature in the case and all these different spots because we don't want to just review a GPU and show the GPU temps we want to review a GPU and show the GPU temps and the temps near your vrms and the temps on your like all over your case right so that we can so we can try to quantify okay this cooler design does
it assist with exhausting the hot air out of the back of the case does it uh does it blow all the hot air up toward your CPU area have you had any companies reach out and be like this is scary of why are you guys looking so closely well yeah but that's our job that's pretty funny um I haven't heard of that personally that was a genuine question I just yeah I mean yeah there's obviously going to be people that don't like it most of them are smart enough to not express any trepidation because then
we're going to know to dig then you look further yeah exactly um all right do you want to give me one more Dan yep absolutely hi lonus Luke and Dan well this is weird they they're doing it normally uh uh yeah who does that what's wrong with it how is daily driving High RR OLED is it more efficient than IPS LCD also ever try tiny OS 11 it's a strip down Windows 11 OS I use it and love it cuz it's no useless crap we've had looking at alternative stripped down os's again on our list of things to do
for a little while I think that we are we're going to get to it it's it's a matter of time um there can be some there's some issues yeah there's some issues with these um some of them have kind of worked around the licensing issues with Microsoft others it seems like have not quite so much um there's also issues around trust you know what is this script doing exactly I haven't personally gone in and vetted every line of code so if I haven't um you know what's my confidence level recommending
it and there are some that are and then what if they update it after you do mhm widely enough known that there's a level of trust there but hey uh it's trust and verify right so if I'm just in that I'm not really verifying We've ran into this issue before we we'll release a video about something and then that thing will change but it's significantly harder to change the video yep and we've also run into um we've also run into issues where even seemingly well-intentioned you know
Community efforts have evolved over time like it used to be that we would call out Community like funny Community uh domains um like people would make people would make like funny websites and stuff based on jokes we make about domain name ideas and we we'd go to them and we'd laugh at the things that they've done and then we would find out that later um they had altered it for like self-promotion or or some other kind of thing like they hadn't in good faith continued the joke there was one in
particular that went like really far to the point where it it was super not okay um impersonation trying to get money out of people tracking information all this type of stuff it was really bad so we try not to do that anymore so we basically like it's this is why we can't have nice things right yeah as for daily driving High refresh rate OLED um I wouldn't say it's more efficient than IPS I mean OLED has its own power draw issues um in fact I'm you know what I don't know I'm going to go ahead and say
I don't know I actually don't think power consumption is part of our test suite for most monitors these days although we did check out a monitor recently that draws six w 312 in does up to 2200 nits Peak brightness what and draws six Watts see if you can figure it out I'll let him think for a second and then I'll finish talking about high refresh rate OLED it's super cool it's amazing I don't know for sure if it will be you know if there will be zero burning forever um it looks the the indications
are that cued is pretty good these days but think of this before chat said it okay what is it it's not e in is it no yeah okay then I have no idea it's LCD I have no clue makes no sense to me at all you heard it here first Luke has no clue Luke has no cl.com yeah oh why would you do this we just talked about this CU it's really funny but it's going to be a domain in like minutes I know don't go to it there oh yeah great oh but how else will they know that Luke has no clue what do you fig Dan I know
what monitor is no that's cheating that video is going to be incredible that's cheating Dan no I'm not I'm not saying nothing I'm not even giving hints might say you might say the video will be  dazzling you might say that the video was a bright idea he's taunting or the monitor I want you to all understand this he's not saying things that will actually make me figure it out the video is uh but he's just saying things to to bother me the things I'm saying right now we're a reflection of how I feel about the
video that's cool I've have no idea um we cover the full spectrum of things you might want to know about the product in our  it all right I'll give you a better hint okay I'm probably not going to get it still Game Boy  is it like magnifying the screen somehow no I have no idea it has no backlight oh why how does it get to 2200 nits Peak brightness you ask I don't know do you have to light it yourself I will say that the power fits in the palm of my hand oh my God I hate
this whole conversation this whole thing just sucks you know you don't have to do W show you could end the streak and then I would win if I ended the stream now it wouldn't end the streak no the streak Oh Oh you mean you would just quit halfway through no no no quitters never Prosper then how would that apply to this conversation then look okay this is a really good hint the power fits in the palm of my hand it's a pop culture reference good Lord I don't how did you how did you possibly think a
pop culture reference was going to help me that's fair the power of the in the palm of my hand I have no idea Batman no it's it's not Batman nice to  you everyone in chat is spamming Sun am I was I supposed to guess Sun so you put it in front of a window yeah that's kind of cool so and also really weird so basically it's nighttime so instead of a backlight it has a mirror like surface behind the LCD panel okay is that cool or what that's pretty neat what is it for it's
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] terrible yeah yeah okay but it's in like the coolest way but it's interesting and Ne oh it's super interesting I'm excited to watch the video about it I don't think I'd want one I I'm sure there's some application where it would be cool because you're like in an environment where power is like very difficult to come by I'm sure there's got to be like somebody out there who's like oh my goodness I need this you got to see it in person we'll we'll grab it out for yeah it's it's
something to behold I'll put it that way and we cover we cover super cool applications of the technology in the video the muddy repti got me he like he can't quit while wearing a Terry Fox  D now you're stuck with us forever yeah pretty much oh I love that that's a that's a deep cut for Canadians man that's true yep you would be letting down Terry yeah that's impossible actually now is probably a good time for us to reiterate that um the reason we're wearing these shirts
are uh to support the Terry Fox run uh you can get your shirt at Terry fox.org all proceeds support cancer research registration for the 2024 Terry Fox run will open on April 12th um and the 44th annual Terry Fox run will take place across Canada on September 15th Terry Fox is a National Treasure uh we are extremely proud to partner with the Terry Fox Foundation uh when I say partner I I realized that's a sponsorship disclosure word that's not what's taking place obviously we're not
making money we were just thrilled to hear from them and absolutely honored to support the Terry Fox Foundation uh they've been doing absolutely incredible work um if you don't know who Terry Fox is then Now's the Time to Google him learn about his life was so young um he was taken from us far too early and um yeah absolutely incredible diagnosed with cancer at a very young age lost his leg decided to run across the country um to raise awareness uh raise cancer awareness and
uh raise money to fight cancer you're going to break Linus up man damn it you're trying it's a big deal I'm done it's genuinely a very big deal um and I said the obviously thing I know there's some creators that have taken money for uh charity work stuff where where I would like to think that it's obvious we're not doing that um but yeah  know um speaking of charitable sponsorships we actually are doing one nice we are well no it's a little complicated so we are doing a charity
auction stream for BC Children's Hospital on April 17th this will be at around 1 p.m. Pacific on whatnot so whatnot is working with us they are an auction platform and they have kindly waved it's a little different all fees so that the proceeds will go directly to BC Children's Hospital we're really excited about this our auction items include five incredibly powerful PCS that will be handbuilt by line of Sebastian I'm just reading the talking points they put my name in there for
some reason they will be built by me it's fun having you say your own last name the slowest one out of all the PCS and this is great has a 14900 K and an RTX 480 so these are going to be Beast Machines we're trying to raise some real money which means huge shout out to all the companies that have donated to this cause uh in particular Asus and Corsair who have donated the majority of the components for our PC builds but also HP Acer Elgato which is also course there uh dell Intel Google noctua sabrin
Logitech nothing the phone company not like thanks for nothing and many more wait the wait wait what oh just donated to the cause okay I get it I I get it I was like what computer parts are we getting from nothing in Google yeah don't worry about it all right um and well we're going to be auctioning a bunch of stuff so not I'm going to be building computers oh but there's other things okay dude I have wanted to do this video for like three years because it has the best title
I will build you a PC right now oh that's going to be the title of the video that's pretty good right now that's pretty good so you will be able to bid on a computer while I am live oh it'll all be for charity and I will build it for you right in front of you it's going to be flipping awesome nice um we've got a pre-built PC from main gear we've got an Acer Nitro 16 gaming laptop peripheral bundles phones all kinds of stuff that we're going to be auctioning for charity um streaming bundles include custom
merge from LTT store many other little bits of LTT history so if you're considering buying a computer or gaming headset or a mouse or something like that consider doing it at our auction and having those dollars go to a good cause I doubt that the price is going to be the best price because people tend to go kind of wild when it comes to charity auctions but but it's cool that's a feature not a bug quite literally um and as I already said all of the proceeds are going to go to BC Children's
Hospital which is one of our favorite uh causes to donate to uh I think oh the last little update thing for those of you who sat through this this is kind of a big deal it's funny I um I came across a post and I'm not going to name any names but it was basically like comparing sort of our um our quality of our guests to another content creator and I was like I mean we don't really like do gu the last time we even had one and the and the issue for us is that we are chronically not on schedule and the
thing about having important guests is that if you are late for them that's pretty [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up um it's bad enough that we're late for the show in general and we are sincerely sorry it is all in the pursuit of building you guys the best float plane and the best content that we Poss important guest I am not saying that they're not they're not guests they're homies that's different ah the point is that it's funny timing because only a couple weeks after I came across that I had possibly the biggest
guest fall into my lap CRA this is actually crazy um and it was just it was serendipitous but next week we will be having the one the only Mr Jim Keller joining us for a Callin uh for those of you who do not know who this is same thing with as with Terry Fox Okay totally different fields right but Google him right now yeah um he is the CEO of 10 torrent he was the lead architect of amd's K8 microarchitecture he co-designed the x86-64 instruction set he was later the lead designer on the Zen architecture he
also had a big role in designing the Apple A4 and A5 the company's first in-house s so's and he worked at Tesla during the development of their autopilot Tech technology anyone asking who Jim Keller is please um so we're going to have him on the show he's going to be talking about what he's doing at T torrent guys an absolute legend in the Computing world I'm just dropping links in the chat you guys are not going to want to miss this uh these links are to where you guys can suggest some topics
of conversation obviously I'm going to be asking him about his new gig right now but if you guys have any kind of questions that are not going to get him in you know non-disclosure agreement trouble or anything like that like don't ask him to like you know talk smack about previous companies work for like it's not going to be that's not the kind of thing we're doing here uh but if you have anything that you want to kind of hear us discuss with Mr Jim Keller we are getting an opportunity to talk to
him we're really excited about it we uh it's funny because the topic came up in a conversation with Toren about like Hey how do we how do we work together what you guys are doing looks really cool and we saw you guys have this dev kit and um you know is is that our opportunity to cover it and talk about it or do you have something coming down the pipe basically it was an exploratory call I jumped on with them and they were like oh yeah you know it' be really cool is if we like had gym on and I was like uh
they're like yeah we don't really know if you guys like do guests or anything I'm like well here's the thing we don't but when is Jim going to be able to join [Laughter] us um it's one of those things where this is funny so I I assign someone to go through the um to go through oh the form the form doesn't work I will uh I'll reach out to the guy who made it okay Dan will Dan will get it fixed the point is um I asked a couple people on the team to create the form and uh go
through the responses to the Forum to kind of see what's what are the biggest things the most common things people want to see us talk about and I was like okay and can you also kind of put together um you know some stuff to help guide the conversation because as much as I can talk fairly intelligently about most areas of technology I know just enough to be dangerous and I do not want to look like any more of an idiot by comparison than I already will with him on the show it's yeah it's going to be
bad it's like most most people are pretty dumb dumb he's he's got to be in my like I don't know exactly where but I I was I was trying to think of like of individuals exact names that I've like Googled in my lifespan he's got to be up there yeah every once in a bluee I'm just like what what is he up to oh making products with sick names have you seen their their product names T Tor yeah gray skull so sick everything's so boring these days here but the the gry skull e75 yeah this is the dev kit one right
yeah this is this is the dev card um this is already from chatting with them kind of old news um but this is all about so they he probably will talk about this and this is something that they they are promoting right now because they do want to get these in people's hands um so that they can interact with the hardware so that when the time comes things are going to work um and they're well I'm going to let him talk about how excited they are about what they're working on I'm so stoked yeah 
oh it's just a per hold on a second kolio Ash says I'm going to be honest I have no idea what the products he's made are used for but it's obviously he's done some big things okay so let's go through it K8 that was before Zen okay so before ryen that was the last time that AMD stole the performance Crown from Intel they stole it hard they came out of absolutely nowhere having been kind of languishing for a fairly extended period of time and crushed it not only did they come take the single
core performance Crown they beat Intel to 64-bit they beat Intel to multicore Computing and just slay it Mr Keller moved on uh I believe his next Port of Call was Apple don't don't quote me on that I forget the exact order of operations here because I think he's done some shorter stints and gone back and stuff don't yeah don't worry about it but the point is the A4 the A4 was when the iPhone stopped using commodity chips guys stopped using commodity chipsets that was when Apple silicon I
mean Apple Brands their Computing their computer products Apple silicon but that was where Apple silicon was born when Apple started designing processors that outperformed anything else that was on the market from companies that had been doing it forever and obviously none of these things happen from just one person but he there's a bit of a pattern just look up look up his Wikipedia page and look at his known for Athlon K7 AMD K8 lead architect AMD K12 AMD Zen Apple A4 Apple A5 a co-author of x86-64 Tesla
Hardware 3.0 and a co-author of hyper transport it's like oh whoa done some things yeah um so then anyway the what I was getting to was  what was the Common Thread Jim came back to AMT he's not there now though he's doing T Toren so he's been he's been working on some AI stuff which is definitely in his wheelhouse from that time spent on um yeah it was Hardware 3.0 at Tesla I think s of the um uh the autopilot Hardware yeah so yeah excited excited it's going to be awesome uh Dan what are
we supposed to be doing right now uh let's go oh sponsors yes let us indeed do that the form is fixed by the way uh the show is the show is brought you by ag1 instead of swallowing hundreds of supplements like a car eat pellets try ag1 which is a much easier Spoonful to swallow it's an all-in-one supplement that has 75 different vitamins minerals and antioxidants and their team is always trying to find better ways to Source test and find the best quality ingredients available
ag1 tests for hundreds of contaminants and banned substances which is much better than the supplement industry's average of 10 I mean that that shouldn't surprise me but anyway it really is as easy as one scoop a day instead of purchasing all your different vitamins separately uh Luke Dennis Maria and actually a few other members here at lmg have tried or even use ag1 daily whether it's because they wanted to stop cutting Corners after a diet change or just because they like the way it tasted in a

my bandwidth is unacceptable why doesn't Luke think that you can handle this cuz Luke does not trust me at all he's a terrible manager and person exactly I guess I lose this game all I'm trying to demonstrate is that even with the spotlight on him D Dan never he'll get   Dave get out of here I like working here it's fun I got to talk to my therapist  this but hey but hey it'll be partially covered that's right yeah you pay for it so that I can deal with you day in and day out it's a perfect system I didn't
think it was partial covering well depends up to a certain amount I mean with the amount of therapy Dan needs so  I'm the reason why the uh the amount is  company oh boy where are we we're doing merch messages let's less cancel ourselves yeah no it's just me should be good merch messages yeah how about Apple is setting its users free and freedom is scary oh kind of funny Apple has further loosened some restrictions on iOS it's actually been really interesting ever since the EU down and now the US
antitrust how quickly apple is running around trying to be like H um well no no like we're not a Apple has further loosened some restrictions on iOS including now allowing Retro Game emulators on the IOS app store and reforming its pairs pairing it's pairs pairing system it pairing system to allow more devices to be salvaged for parts this is pretty cool news remember we talked recently about how we you know you you never report on the good stuff right it's always about the this is good yeah apple
never had a formal rule against emulators but it barred apps that ran external code which included emulators apple is now explicitly allowing emulators though they will need to be age rated in accordance with the most explicit content available for them and they must comply with all relevant laws regarding emulation what was that old game Leisure Suit Larry yeah I knew where's going that's going to screw up all the emulators yeah uh anywh who the change is primarily due to
recent regulatory changes in Europe so yeah I said that Apple was changing things but realistically what's happening is Apple is finally being forced to play nice um Apple has also announced that it will be working on a new framework to allow customers and independent repair shops to use more existing parts from used devices rather than blocking their use with software locks under the assumption that the salvaged device has been stolen Apple says this new system will still protect
users privacy this will also include calibration for used parts after they are installed so basically they are finally walking back some of the pairing that they've been requiring so there was this whole thing with batteries and with screens where you could take two perfectly working iPhones take them apart switch their screens boot them back up and you'd get like a depending on the part you'd get an air message or you would get hindered functionality it's almost like it was never about privacy at all isn't
it yeah cuz now now that it's allowed they're like we can do it without compromising privacy it almost never is it's almost like that was the point the whole time was that they could or that was what they could have done the whole time it's almost like this whole thing was just made up yeah wow really yeah you don't say with that said this is really funny um some Apple Fans don't seem to appreciate some of their new freedoms this is great thanks to the EU we have one more screen during the
iPhone onboarding clown oh no not everyone knows what a one more browser is far from it why not ask for a default music player default mail app default camera app while we're at it unironically that's a really good idea is it I don't know I don't know if I care about that personally I I think for music player I don't I don't know if I care about camera app like they like this as far as I can tell this is them effectively exposing like the App Store as part of the opening
your phone like no this is this is part of the um the you can't have Safari just be the only thing on iOS crack yeah but they're saying it's uh the onboarding personally I don't necessarily think that this needs to be part of the onboarding it just needs to be something that you can do oh sure um sure that's fair enough I mean honestly I don't mind it at onboarding um I I don't know if I want every single thing that my phone can do I I I don't necessarily want to make
a choice where it now downloads that app or whatever instantly when I'm trying to set up a new device that's compromise kind of annoying one screen where it has all the default apps you can click into them and change them or you can go all the way down and go continue I'm on board compromise give me that skip button and then I don't care yeah because like what if I am an Apple user that's just like yeah I just want all the Apple stuff which there's going to be tons of them and that's the whole
thing that a lot of the people who argue for apples Walled Garden and Apple's anti-competitive and anti-consumer practices will say they'll say well I just want I don't want to pick I just want them to tell me what's good they still can and you can still just use whatever Apple tells you to use it's okay it's fine I find it interesting that Chrome is at like the bottom of the list well I mean no one said Apple couldn't maliciously comply I will say uh I've been using I don't know if I've
talked about this on the show ever I've been using the Firefox mobile browser for like a decade never had a single problem it's fantastic I have my my uh like URL bar search bar stuff is that at the bottom I prefer that a ton it's a user setting it's stuck for like years it's great I love Firefox mobile that's all I have to say that's it someone was surprised they're like wait what is that they saw my phone and they're like what is that I was like it's my browser like what do you mean it
doesn't look like Chrome I was like it's not Chrome it's Firefox they're like use Firefox from like yeah it's great I don't know you're a liar no I'm not everyone who uses Firefox lies you told me that no no no no all the people not all the people the cont the context for that was we did a poll on float plane during the W show asking what percentage of people used Firefox and I just knew and then Luke not right went into our logs for the actual access well not me AJ did
sorry AJ uh went into our logs for the percentage of float plane users that use Firefox and those numbers were not similar not even sort of close and like some people are like oh yeah you can spoof what browser it is and some people do this for compatibility because a site will say that it doesn't work with Firefox but if you just tell it that you're actually using Chrome instead it will actually work just fine uh there's pretty much no way the amount of people that do that make up
the Gap um I can't say for sure but pretty much no way this is totally off topic but do you make that pull dad is Luca liar the options are yes and yes but I  they like their polls this is amazing I get weird with them when we do the super checks after party the flo plane exclusive stream oh really yeah uh we every single time you well like who's going to win the round and they just gets strange I should look into that we have a we have a view where we can see every poll ever made and who made it oh really
I didn't know that yeah I should be more careful um this is just totally off topic but I was I was looking at the chats and I'm obviously mostly looking at float plane chat but twitch chat is upset because there's another ad break this is really weird so someone here turned on ads on Twitch and like really intrusively um and I turned them off and then someone here I think Colton I know yes Colton Colton turned them back on and said don't touch that setting anymore we're having ads on on
Twitch and I think they run every 20 minutes for some reason even though the L show gets interrupted every 20 minutes on Twitch for an ad break and there are no ad breaks on any other platform where it broadcasts obviously I'm not going to expect everyone to move over to float plane where there's a monthly subscription does YouTube not ad break during live streams there are we do not have them enabled on YouTube Ah they're not enabled I and they're not on Facebook for sure we also stream on
Facebook what is it about the experience of watching on Twitch that makes it so so that no no hold on hold on nobody has abandoned it in spite of the ad breaks that are not on other platforms like our viewership is basically the same as it always is I have a theory as much as I hate it despise it even the people want a smaller internet they want to just stay on the sites that they use and if they're twitch frogs instead of YouTube users they're just going to stay there they will not have alternatives
it sucks we had this really cool internet where there was all these unique cool websites where people would do neat things and now there's like like Justin.tv people use like five websites and yeah oh there's more than five websites that are possible I mean individuals like there's it's very common that individual people will not navigate to more than a very very small handful of websites they'll be like yeah I'm a Reddit and Facebook and Twitter user and I Google things sometimes and that's it
y I can see that it's like oh well want to do a merch message I need to run to the washroom I drank this whole thing sure sure didn't see if I have any for Luke by the way the results of the poll are 71% is Luke a liar yes but I use Firefox which is I think I actually enjoy that good job nice yeah I mean they're fun they're fun I like that yeah um I think I had one in here for you Luke let me see if I can find it none is this the secret part of the show where I get to talk about slay the Spire to
oh did they well I was actually wanting here about kind of gdau and stuff like that did they pivot oh yeah yeah it's in gdau hell yeah Sal P to and good so they did Dancing whatever I always forgot I already forgot the name of it I got oh yeah we talked about that last week dancing dancing duelist yeah so they did Dancing duelist and gdau and then they followed through with what they were talking about by the way dancing duelist is free you can just go get it it's great um but yeah they followed through
with it SL SP 2's coming in gdau I looked at some of the screenshots for SL the SP 2 and it like looks very similar and yeah sounds good I'm probably G to spend uh my whole rest of my life playing that game so that's cool I picked up one a while ago called core keeper which was also done in in gdo at excellent excellent excellent engine I found I'm I'm going to I'm going to give sh Shameless promotion to someone else um if you YouTube gdau for tutorial 11 hours it's proba going to
work I bet you it works yeah there's a video from Clear code the channel is named clear code it has 1.1 million views right now is uploaded 9 months ago just so you can make sure you're finding the right one it's a 11 and 1 half hour long tutorial that is called the ultimate introduction to gdau 4 and if you look into the the description there's a part two oh hour video and there's a part two for it and this tutorial is amazing I I was like having a really hard time trying to decide between game
maker and gdau because I wanted to do a two I want to do 2D game development and this tutorial being as amazing as it is is what convinced me to work in gdau because I actually think right now that I like the tutorial more than I like the engine which I don't dislike the engine at all to be very clear but the tutorial is just fantastic the person whoever does clear code um very very very good explanations really really interesting order of how they do everything um and then they do a very good job of
explaining Concepts at a relatively base level and then uh setting you up for like okay now here's your challenge these are the three things that I want you to do and those things are slightly more advanced than what they taught you but you know enough to figure it out yourself so you have to work through the engine and see how it works and kind of navigate things and do it on your own and then you continue the video and he teaches you more things and then you keep going it's very very well done and
it doesn't start losing quality I'm like 4 hours in or something and it's still amazing um so if you're if you're interested in game development or gdau um I would highly recommend checking out clear code and especially this the ultimate introduction to clear code video cuz it's or ultimate introduction to gdau 4 video because it's it's fantastic it is super long but like I was trying to look at some of the like the shorter more digestible ones and I'm like yeah this isn't enough of
an introduction right I haven't touched game engin seriously in a super long time I really need a deep dive right and this thing was has been amazing so far  out love it next uh hey dlll I'm curius on your opinions if any on Mega crit switching from Unity to gdau do you think more game companies should switch to open source  still working at it open source engines are cool um open source is not like it's not in my this I'm going to piss some people off it it doesn't automatically
become the best thing because it is open source um I really like gdau it seems great so far um I do not believe that everyone making a 3D game in unreal should switch to good um I I don't think everyone making a 2d game in game makers should switch to gdo there might be some decent Arguments for people making anything in unity switching to anything else um but those are those are based on like business practices stuff like that um but there there are really good things about open source and one of the
things that can be scary about open source is the abandonment of projects and things like that um something that can maybe increase confidence is when you start seeing bigger companies bigger groups um get getting behind and using different open source projects megga crit um moving to gdau and releasing eventually in 2025 SL Spire 2 in gdau could be very big for gdau adoption and be very important um but I don't know enough I'm not here to recommend anything in that realm I am
a novice I'm just having fun going through that tutorial so I don't know whatever Alexander asks lonus will you be going on to the yard at the end of this month lwig said you'll be coming on yes nice I'm going to be on the yard it's going to be awesome I'm going down there for a collab uh we're going to do the Bro versus bro thing I'm probably going to lose so that's cool I I suspect you might get more canceled from being on there than being on here really well I'm just hearing
this now so I'm assuming I won't be there and those guys are going to have a very fun time seeing how far you'll go on things I'm sure oh you've never heard the podcast have you no no it's going to be sick I mean I went on uh KB mod it's great back in the day I didn't get any trouble for that don't know if you should have brought that up or [Laughter] not fair enough I'm sure it'll be great I am mildly concerned that's all I'll say oh wait KB Modo PKA that's the one yeah oh Painkiller Already yeah yeah
yeah yeah I thought that was what wait hold on what was uh I thought kbod and PKA had something to do with each other  on hold on uh no maybe they have nothing to do with each other okay no I completely forgot well cool apparently I don't even know what podcast I've been on so this is good we're off to a really good start here very commonly does podcast appearances no I I don't even though this is my that was the whole point he does one every Friday what is wrong with  
kbod I'm pretty sure that's me I don't   on okay yes I I did both so yeah nice that's  sure yep sponsored by Squarespace good stuff I mean if Squarespace sponsors it can't be that bad what do you mean memory of a goldfish it was N9 years ago I don't remember almost anything from back then I'm supposed to remember every and I kind of remembered every podcast I was on 9 years ago you technically remembered both of them KB mod was 10 years ago you just thought it might have been one or the other I don't even
remember um who was on it uh okay wow yeah that's wild does this still exist this is this still a thing oh yeah no the last thing they did was 5 years ago okay uh okay wait who kbod kod yeah yeah I don't think that's been a thing for a bit okay um PKA seems to still exist though oh  Simpson huh all right well uh yeah he like died yeah yeah neat karma's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] probably took a little long let's do the next merch message okay no I I want to J multiple minutes of this has
been uh let's see let's see um maybe maybe they won't be the problem oh maybe it'll just be you lus is going to get them cancelled yeah my my whole thought process here is like the yard boys are going to get lonus to go too far on something and now it's like you know luuka can handle it maybe maybe they'll be Li is getting the yard guys to go too far you and slime is going to be a  combination I'm excited I'll definitely listen to that episode next one all right let's see uh
how about a quick one hi LC lus and Dan tall sizes soon please I beg you to give I want to give you my money yes uh hi lonus and Luke I work with a I work with a nonprofit and I'm looking to start a camp for kids on building computers how would you go about sourcing Hardware without the option of electronics recycler you don't um there's just there's uh it's not going to happen basically um there's no one who's going to Pony up that Hardware like why um and if you're like
oh well I could just take older stuff they're going to say well where would I get that um at the kind of volumes that you would need because the answer is going to be a hardware recycler so either you go to a hardware recycler or they go to a hardware recycler it's just um it's just not going to it's not going to work um the cost of this stuff like I think that a lot of people have this perception that if something costs $100 well the M or like if if the price the retail price is $100 well probably the
manufacturing cost is what like 20 bucks like I see that I see that a lot whether it's our screwdriver or whether it's uh you know our own merch where I really do know the cost I know what they are um or whether it's computer hardware product where I understand enough to understand the costs I see people have this perception that like I'm going to I'm spending $500 on a TV at Best Buy I'm getting ripped I'm getting ripped man $500 for a TV like right but people who made it need to be paid and so that's
that's how that works right like the Best Buy does not have a ton of margin on a $500 TV I can tell you that with 100% confidence um and so even at the manufacturing level the IT industry is notoriously cut throat for margins so they might have 15 20 points on a motherboard so that $100 motherboard is 80 bucks how many kids are you planning to have at this Camp if I mean it's not much of a camp unless it's like 50 or something right like what's what's a camp exactly to you so they're going to give you what
motherboards times 50 even if it's 20 like this is actually a ton of money you're asking for if you want computers for them to build so this is the kind of thing that over time you're going to have to acquire non-working Hardware because if the goal is just for them to build it kind of more fun anyways doesn't have to function um well not even that so my I've told the story before but in high school my computers teacher um found a way to acquire I'll I'll speed through it partially found a
way to acquire a whole bunch of non-working PCS and then we we built a computer lab for the school out of these non-working PCS by sifting through them and finding what Parts worked figured out what motherboards were working CPUs were working Ram was working Etc and building custom computers for this whole computer lab and it was great it was a really fun experience you might be able to do that as well if there's like a recycler in the area that will allow you to uh take some stuff for this
experience which might be a thing I don't know and guys like it's there's no award for being wrong on the internet I think twitch chat has lost their chat privileges for today it's terrible take line is saying this while these companies are making record profits guys Best Buy is not making record profits it's not Pand it's not the pandemic anymore people aren't buying computers yeah your grocery store probably is but that doesn't mean that that's true of every single company it's not that's not
how these things work um Industries bust and they boom um and no like there there isn't a ton of money in being an Electronics retailer if there was everyone would do it it wouldn't be Consolidated down to just a hand full of remaining  anyway uh sure yeah let's do one more hey definitely not late. DLo I heard a long time ago that having a hard drive at close to or at capacity negatively affects performance of the drive is that still a thing with newer drives like  uh yeah yes
um although for different reasons on hard drives the issue was the fragmentation of the files that would occur as they filled up over time so as you installed the game um and then put some media files and then install another game and then put some dependencies that are needed for a game and and essentially filled up the concentric circles that make up the platter uh you would end up with in many cases um applications or even individual files that had pieces of them kind of spread out all over the platter
efficiently organized when you have a physical needle that is moving back and forth seeking to access that data there's a delay as it goes around searching all over the disc for the pieces that it needs uh so what you would do is you would kind of um reorganize it to put all the data that goes together together to make it so that you're doing less seeking uh with ssds um everything is just handled on an address basis there is no physical seeking time there it does still take
time but it's not from moving a physical object where you run into trouble with ssds is in the same in a similar way um you can have um you can have junk on the disc that isn't what you need I shouldn't say dis because it's not a disc you can have junk on the drive that isn't what you need um in a space that okay I shouldn't say similar it's not that similar so you can have junk on the drive that you don't need but hasn't been fully removed because that's not as efficient it's not
as uh good for the drives longevity because nand Flash has a finite number of right cycles that it can survive before it just gives up the ghost so what happens is when you fill a drive you uh and then and then delete a file it's just sort of Shadow deleted it's not really deleted until such time as you actually need to overwrite it until you actually need to fill up that space so what happens then is instead of just a right operation it needs to do uh a full program eray cycle it needs to
actually wipe it then write it and in some cases having a really full drive can mean that there are bits of data in some places and bits of data in other places that aren't Consolidated which is kind of similarish to what we would see with hard drives and when the drive is very full the odds that you're going to hit a block that needs to um be erased and then Rewritten somewhere else and then written to um in order for it to stay organized is much much higher this is like a super super crappy explanation
of it but this is off the top of my head and I haven't looked at garbage collection trim and nand dat organization in a while this is a situation you should point to like a tech Wiki or something I'm fairly certain we have Tech wikies on these  basically yes being more full means there's less room for this data organization to take place and it can be more delayed you can also have just annoyances with like temp file overflows and stuff like that and it's bad for the longevity of the drive as well because
the more shuffling it has to do for every write operation the more  doing Dan oh are we doing topics now let's do it LTT Labs Nicholas if that is your if if you're who I think you are you should get a uh icon message me next week oh guest Labs will just have to test drives at various levels of fill  of oh that's great internalized screaming Texas schools Embrace AI grading the Texas Education Agency will be replacing human graders not fully replacing but certainly significantly
augmenting I shouldn't say augmenting because they're replacing some the human graders are yeah some of them are gone yeah so we'll be replacing some of their human graders with an Autos scoring engine and this is not for multiple choice this is for written questions on standardized tests with the only exception being tests written in Spanish if the AI indicates it has low con confidence in its score the test will be referred to a human grader for review with the human grader score overruling
the AIS if there's a disagreement between the two scores Texas estimates that 75% of tests will be graded without being sent for further review they estimate this will save 15 to $20 million a year annually by hiring only a third as many temporary graders every year the state has insist that while the auto scoring engine is based on similar technology to GPT 4 it will have systemic systematic oversight from humans it won't learn from one response to the next but always defer to its
original programming set up by the "state it was apparently trained on 3,000" past tests that went through two rounds of review by human graders and is intended to give the same grade as a human grer would have the decision follows a 2023 redesign of the star standardized assignment assessment to include fewer multiple choice questions and six times more open-ended questions which actually seems like a good idea having you know students answer with open-ended questions I guess they're
just like well um this is a lot of work to grade so I guess we'll just have a machine do it which um yeah critics have raised concerns that a machine may not be able to recognize and reward creativity or "originality three 3,000 seems like not a" lot of Prior tests huh honestly no also a person 123 in full plane chat said this is even worse than it seems because those temporary graders I didn't put this together those temporary graders uh who were losing their jobs were generally Texas teachers trying to
augment their crappy salaries didn't think about that that  rough cool yeah controversial take when did tax priorities shift from roads schools libraries first and then other stuff defense realistically doesn't have to be like all of it but there should be some when did it shift from that first then everything else to like Rando programs and vanity projects and then I guess if we have anything left over I guess we'll pay teachers something we can we can call teachers when did when when when
exactly did that happen I know I'm just wondering just curious because like I pay a lot of taxes I wouldn't mind if they went to schools schools seem cool Trudeau is investing some billions of dollars in AI yeah but our government is also investing in subsidies for homeowners instead of just allowing the market to fall so that people can actually afford the houses they're just giving rent subsidies that is actually not the solution it's totally to let the property values go up so the property
taxes go up so you can give a pittance of that money to the people who now have unaffordable rent so they can give more money to land land owners brilliant who can then pay more property taxes it's great it's a perpetual motion machine good job flawless flawless Victory stupid all I wouldn't necessarily have a huge problem with this if I think we were like way down the line from where we are now this is way massively too early you can't put this stuff in a position where
it could have any amount of impact on someone's future um CU it's like oh yeah humans will grade it if if you know it has a low confidence but what if it is highly confidently incorrect which we  times and then if you can dispute it and it will be graded by a real person then everyone's going to just dispute it and  anyways I don't know dumb next topic sure what's happening with YouTube playables at some point last year YouTube added playables games that you can play directly on the platform via
desktop or mobile devices as an experimental feature according to YouTube's experiments page playables were supposed to be available until the 28th of March of this year however there's still a support page for playables and they are still accessible on both desktop and Android devices at the time of writing this based on reporting and uh this post which I'm assuming he's loading up no he's not uh from the LTD subreddit not many people seem to Know YouTube playables even
exist Poss because they seem to be only accessible through the explore section of YouTube site and mobile app which I don't think I've ever clicked on in my life discussion question why do these exist Why didn't YouTube kill them when they said they would what does this seeming ignorance surrounding the existence of playable say about  uiux I don't know but I'm in raptured this game does not look fun what is that you draw new draw the legs yeah okay that that actually sounds a
little bit more fun than I thought it's playable I claimed 10 coin units what does that mean what do you use those for how do you buy more of them speed level 15 searching for an opponent no way it's multiplayer whoa that guy's got like spring legs okay do your legs suck o okay let's go let's go come on give me some let's go oh let's go I want a piece wait did your leg break what happened to my leg did my leg break can you draw new legs at any time I need longer legs is what I need
boom Oh I'm getting tuned here you can draw I'm going fast so there's there's probably some Theory to changing your legs depending on the terrain yeah you got schooled I think you want shorter legs for going uphill I'm suddenly interested in this game wait you can level up your speed though that seems stupid oh so other people just have like better speed Maybe wait am I just playing the same guy that's stupid or maybe it's just an AI like a bot what's happening oh no it has to be
an AI because it slows down while I'm drawing well well no not necessarily cuz they could record the inputs from the other players so they don't have to match like yeah oh I see what you mean yeah so wait it's just going to stay slow while I decide when I want to put my small legs on infinite slowmo cuz I like yeah this this seems like a hack it's like an early 2000s game that you're doing built-in pre-made cheats on yeah exactly also why do I not fall does gravity no longer apply to us do you
just win the game because you went slow-mo I think so I think if I just keep this held that's so I will sick I will not fall that's so cool genuinely love that I don't think so apparently I'm Falling Slowly says the chat are you but I'm not sure if I I'm not sure if I believe it really doesn't seem like it I think I fell a lot faster before yeah exactly I don't think you were this high up before so there's there's at least some amount of effect whether or not it's like you know
super noticeable or not I don't know Urban fervor says I have a career in play testing yeah this man I broke this game faster than I break Linux are you sure yeah I think so it did it took me a little while to break Linux the last couple of times I broke it yeah fair enough like I am not falling is your leg going to collide with this portion no I don't think so I'm pretty sure I'm still above it you're high Danny's got nothing on me yeah I'm so engaged right now see oh it
gets pretty close I think I think hold on wait for it I think it might no no are they both the same life yeah oh it did oh speed boost let's go that's huge hold on is it going to catch it is it going to catch it I no longer think so right by it you're going fast now though O So Danny seems to have his own glitch problem this is my favorite part of the show so far I think this is awesome I love that we have so many people watching you just like float very slowly through the air you
might say they're in a plane oh hey so good I'm invested at this point though I want to see what on Earth is going on so so this is a YouTube playable uh something that I mean I didn't know they existed at all and apparently a lot of other people didn't know they existed either because they were tucked away under the explore button on YouTube which I suspect most people didn't click on there was a discussion question which is what does this seemingly seeming ignorance surrounding the existence of
playable say about YouTube's uiux and in my opinion they just have so much stuff going on that adding things like this it's very hard to get visibility on it why can't I be watching a short at the same time this is a m opportunity honestly if they had short autoc scrolling where after it finished playing one video it would just scroll to the next and you could play these playables on the side move over Subway Surfers I bet you it  sleep yeah I um honestly I'm sort of at
the point now where I just kind of wish that YouTube would do what it does holy crap it glitched in a new way I'm not moving anymore uhoh I am static are we both static you can see the bar at the top oh no he's moving he's moving I'm not moving okay oh no look it has line ofz legs oh he's going to beat you he's flying that no no no no I got this i got this are you kidding me no okay that wasn't cool all my hopes and dreams are gone well all right I think that was my last
attempt at that yep so these are these are the games this there's no mic transactions or anything even I don't know oh for now like who's who's making these I don't boy drag to aim release to shoot I mean uh but sure wait so they have YouTube officially has a game with explosions and you kill people there's a lot of blood as well yeah but like it's Angry Birds Luke yeah there's blood he's spurting blood he's dismembered and you shot someone with an RPG YouTube is full of all kinds of things yeah but they
like don't want to be full of this stuff they don't but then they have video games of it I don't know I think that YouTube mostly oh yeah lob it it has on it whatever it needs to have on it this guy played Flash games in the 2000s yeah boys this man worms Oh well you are failed okay hold on a where are these games even coming from  yeah you're a fail oh no want to crush me at chess no I'm terrible I don't I haven't played in a long time I'd be really bad to I'm there's no way you're
worse than me I fall off so fast it's weird no man there's no way you're worse than me weird running pet deck what is this who made these games I got to like 1100 or 1200 or something and then stopped playing and just sort of fell off I think I got to 11 or 12 no years old oh yeah like honestly there's no way tap to play Roll whoa oh laggy whoa is it laggy on your screen oh yeah oh buddy what what is happening jump can you jump or Crouch sorry can I down arrow no s oh oh okay W or up Arrow yeah
okay so yeah the arrows work the ramp coins Sonic the cat wait I can't wait what the oh dang hold on I'm so confused sometimes the arrow keys work sometimes they don't tap here to build a room the arrow keys are not working right now build a room what I don't want to build a room get a room oh I don't care oh I have to buy a sofa oh I think this one has premium currency oh my god oh check that out at the top of the diamonds wait don't you might have things connected to this laptop because
you refuse to follow rules okay selected roll like do they mean like Avatar how do I play just okay tap to play okay here we go here we go okay okay the controls are working now so that's a big Improvement oh whoops whoops whoops whoops whoops okay so can I okay but why would I do that instead of just going for the coins like that seem seems stupid sometimes it might make sense can I jump over okay yeah can I jump over this car yeah I can yeah dog let's go jump from thing to thing W oh I
bet you better press it twice though ah interesting you can't hold it oh I pressed both this keyboard is really not in the ideal configuration for game has one of those combined up and downs so anyway back to back to playables um yeah so that's something they have I feel like YouTube is just kind of losing its identity a little bit and I've felt this way about yeah everything from stories to shorts to uh being a place to rent  don't I kind of don't understand what YouTube wants to be why not just be
YouTube if it's all video I sort of get it I blame capitalism because the only way to have infinite growth is to have infinite number of products at a certain point you're going to be saturated in terms of what you serve long but that's not what inv demand investors demand grow and when you already I mean YouTube at some point I forget this is like four or five years ago stopped regularly talking about their growth in daily active users because it was like over a billion it's
like well or not daily monthly or whatever it was they stopped talking about it regularly and it's just like like if we if we want more people in the platform we need the world to birth more people yeah the only way for us to grow is to extract more value out of the people that exist rather than hoping that there will be more at some point and it's just I don't know this kind of sucks apparently the currency there there's no microtransactions apparently yet yeah I'm I'm sure the whole thing is
position for that hurts just these Test games don't have any I'm hurt in better news Roku has filed a patent for a technology that would allow its TVs to detect when you've paused a device that's connected via HDMI such as a game console so the TV can show you ads can you can you we've already talked about this can you um can you file a pat we've totally talked about this can you file a patent um and then can can you like file a patent so that no one can do a thing I mean I guess like could you file
this patent and then be like yeah we filed this patent because we thought someone might do this and we were like no it's really I shouldn't say really expensive but it does cost money and time to file patents and filing defensive patents on behalf of consumers would probably be a fruitless Endeavor yeah given the ease with which large companies can sort of look if they can get around each other's patents they can get around yours is all I have to say about that and they have a lot more
resources to do it I wasn't suggesting this as a thing that we do to be very clear cool yeah yeah no I do not have unlimited money to do that it was not the goal at at all donate to that cause I was trying to make a joke about like maybe they're doing this knowing that they weren't so like a crowdsourced A crowdsourced or like crowdfunded organization like a not for-profit that basically preemptively files patents for terrible ideas that  anti-consumer I still don't think it would work it would be funny
um yeah was that a topic in the do cuz we absolutely talked about that last week or a previous week how did we oh I didn't think we did well whatever in case anyone missed it like I did in addition to detecting when you've paused the patent also suggests methods to identify what was displayed in the frame before you paused and use that information to show you more relevant ads I don't think we had that information I think we knew that they were doing something with ads and
consoles and stuff like that so so you guys know if this is implemented you could be using your Roku brand TV as just a display okay you could be completely ignoring roku's streaming service's software and their smartness and all that stuff but another device that is plugged into one of the TV's HDMI ports could be read essentially like what was on it you could be watching something intimate for example and that could be used to serve you a  ad would the targeted ad be before if
you were watching something intimate on your TV like a dating service there's  stop it'd be something be fun to think about it'd be something and it would be somewhere in between you know A Hard  nice thanks it's pretty good thanks moving on hot singles in your area man so many of the ads I get served are that like the second I hit my mid-30s was like do you want to have an affair it's like how many times I have to tell you no I'm good thank you but you might today yeah but but look how
hot the women in your area are I'm like those aren't real I've seen I've seen the women in my area no no I'm that's that's just a joke when I travel the pictures of the women in my area are the same what is it I've seen the women in my area and they're not this person that's not to say they don't seem great good personalities you know healthy hair I get nice what What minus once in a woman it's very your hair healthy it's extremely important to me it's a it's sorry it's a it's a Bob's Burger's
reference sorry we we get along really well but you just have too many split ends yeah um look okay I need to explain this it's a Bob's Burger's reference okay Louise is trying to get um Pockets no Regular Size Rudy to not have a crush on her and she's like do do you like eating boogers I eat my boogers all the time and he basically goes oh well the whites of your eyes are bright and your hair is healthy and your fingernails have or whatever uh I can't say that I'm into it but you keep doing you sister
like it doesn't matter very accepting um The Return of dumb phones uh yeah sure what is this article did you pick this one yeah interest in Dumb phones has increased in recent years with many people being concerned about the addictive nature of social media and constant online connectivity dumb Wireless Great Name an e-commerce site specializing in Dumb phones and smartphone restriction launched in 2022 in March of 2023 the site sold about "$7,000 worth of products last month it"
sold okay all right didn't see that twist coming so March 2023 they sold 7 Grand worth of products last month it "sold over $70,000 worth of products uh" startup Light released the Light phone 2 in 2019 a smartish phone with a monochrome touchscreen and a limited library of custom apps light's Revenue doubled from 2022 to 2023 and is on track to double again this year according to the New Yorker the startups Founders say some of the most willing Light phone converts are gen zers there
are several dumb Solutions in addition to fully dumb phones there are also phones like the light phone 2 which has apps for directions as well as music and podcast libraries some people only use dumb phones when they go out switching to a smartphone when they get home interesting uh there are also companies like brick and unplug they restrict the UI and apps on your phone only allowing you to access blocked apps when you tap an NFC key that you can take with you leave at home or with a trusted person
or ditch completely interesting I uh I just don't think I could handle it I I kind of want to try it I kind of want to do like a one- Monon thing but every time I bring it up people internally are like no we actually need to be able to reach you and I'm like okay honestly though like if it wasn't for work I could probably be a dumb phone user yeah like I never go anywhere anyway I just sit at my desktop I wonder if one of these like I wonder if one of these what am I'm going to do go see my friends
maybe sorry I wonder if one of these light phones would be able to support uh Communications like slack and teams and  funny how aware I am of how many people use  life definitely a thing yeah so yeah I don't know I don't know if it would help that much fair enough y you shouldn't do that by the way yeah it's like actually a bad idea like you really shouldn't for real um when you depart said company yeah that company can retain all of the messages yes and you can't retain all
the messages unless I guess you like copy paste them maybe there's a data dump feature for users I don't know but like you won't have that user account anymore so you should use other ones and even if you could dump that data you should be extremely careful with it because it might be covered by your organization's NDA for example and it might not even be things you said it might be something that someone said to you but by the time you extract that data from their service that they pay
for and it leaks uh well the responsibility wasn't your friend because they sent an internal communication to an internal person that wasn't them that's on you so someone in chat saying there is teams for personal use he's talking about using work accounts that's yeah he's specifically talking about using work accounts don't use work stuff for personal stuff just don't do it um Flo plane chat it's talking about killed by google.com yeah we are only a quarter of the way into 2024 and boy do they
ever have some doozies uh Google domains was oh actually technically that was the end of last year I don't know what Keen is I don't care but Google podcast was killed 11 days ago is done uh drop cam do you remember drop cam yeah that became nestcam boom done dead killed 5 days ago uh Jam board we already knew about Google Jam board is just other more different Jam board because Google is VPN by Google one is dying VPN by Google one kicking the bucket in N9 months it will be about four years
old dang apparently pixel VPN remains what's the difference I don't know I mean I'm often confused by differences in back end for services that appear to be exactly the same thing like I I I there was something with the mobile app uh for YouTube studio and I was like well like you have the the data it's in the desktop app and they're like yeah but it has a different back end and  why I don't always know but actually why I don't always know I am uninformed need view count database
lookup location XY return reasons for apps if if they're even pretty similar like I kind of understand why the teams work and team's personal accounts are different I wish they weren't both called teams because it's really annoying when I'm trying to launch one of them called personal one MSN Messenger let's go yes please like come on uh or something else whatever it is just don't have multiple names for effectively the same thing anyways um I I I get that but in some of these cases yeah I have no idea no
idea anyways moving on should we do the udio thing yeah let's do it Sora for music former Google deepmind Engineers David Ding and Andrew Sanchez have launched yio a platform for creating AI generated music it already features tremendous tracks like wow I didn't know that is that the name of it that's the name of the track apparently quotes maybe but do you want to do you want to listen to it together should we finish the stuff listen to it or listen to it together first got it
okay are we we're not playing it over stream we're just yeah yeah we can play it over stream that is apparently the name of the track it's wow I didn't know "that oh yeah it has 70,000 playbacks" apparently hold on this wasn't the one  um hold on let me see let me open up my teams for work uh this this wasn't the this wasn't the song that I had wanted to listen to uh okay yeah this is great how do I get this link to myself hold on what's the name of it when you just search it that's a Twitter
link okay so I need to send it to LTT when uh Dan are we able to listen to this together with the stream yeah that shouldn't be a problem okay maybe not on your phone but no no no no no no I'm sending it to myself okay so first let's listen to wow I didn't know that together is this is this going to work oh well it helps to not have my audio muted here we go oh also it helps to be connected to the right thing okay Dan you got sound from me yeah I saw a dingle bing bing bing okay here we go  
see I tell youas I've been C out doing something I really shouldn't going to plead ignorance going to tell them about  wouldn't we're in so much trouble when they say drinking turentine   brme that bad scroll down a bit I want to see the lyrics it's on my screen oh you got it oh my gosh so um that's a thing that exists yeah we're totally screwed uh hold on that was not actually the one that I wanted you to hear that blew my mind uh this was tweeted by ABC Dent mind Ed um they said I found an account on yud
that is mostly generating songs about how his friend s sh his pants don't work oh my gosh okay you guys ready for this one yeah I got it muted for now all  go well he works 9 to and he's a hell of a guy but he sitting his pants at   goasts um so yeah oh wow Get Wrecked Seth not going to lie hadn't heard that country song One H I would unironically listen to that so some dude talking about how uh insurance fraud is a federal crime told them it kind of reminds me of the song online by Brad Paisley which is
like one of my favorite like parody songs yeah like I I mentioned like we're in trouble and someone in chat was like yeah I don't think yet people would listen to this stuff that that country song about well I didn't know that people will absolutely listen to it was well produced as well yeah that messed me up actually ninja man asked that just now and you were way ahead of him what does Dan think about these since he has experience in Productions sometimes you can hear vocal issues but is there
things that the Layman might not notice here like it's pretty obvious to me that they're hiding behind like with these genres and with the styles of both of these they're hiding behind kind of a kind of a um a more analog sound a little bit like I think they might be masking some lack of clarity that way um I've heard better voices on the country one but the uh the like the 50s swing Bop Seth pooping one uh her voice was very clean um I've also heard a lot of people that take normal talking and will
turn them into singing voices or make singing voices out of characters and those are kind of similar to the the tambra of the like the country guy but this the backing music was far too good and that was very concerning mindblowing absolutely incredible I wish I could see the prompt like how did how did you get it how did you get it to write this oh maybe you feed it the lyrics I don't know maybe I mean obviously the Seth one probably no because you could just tell it like the person's name is Seth like
it might do the writing so anyway udio will generate two 32 second songs from a written prompt giving users a choice over which they would like to use the song can then be extended by adding sections before or after the original clip with up to 10 sections total the extensions can be made with the same prompt or a completely different one the platform plans to up plans updates with more musician focused tools like being able to add reference vocals easy import of external tracks and more granular
creation options this comes just a couple of weeks after 200 plus music artists signed an open letter in attempt in an attempt to prevent the creation of exactly the type of tool that udio is having said that udo's Founders claim they have strong copyright protection measures in place so you can't reference any specific artist and any track that sounds like an artist will be blocked uh LT community members made an AI song about pilk AKA Pepsi milk shall we listen Dan are you ready I'm ready here's ready
well maybe not my  soul or graphics cards in play it's about a strange concoction we sit today mixing Pepsi and milk a cure M   world and  expl oh it's got the formula down like  tast this one has some some hints of aess oh yeah yeah yeah but there's there's groups that actually do that that's true that's the they have the formula down they have the the like structure down they have the strange modulations down it might actually be more modulation more interesting to listen to than modern pop music because
it will do weird things that you're not expecting using the pop formula so these might actually be more dopamine inducing cheesecake brain than actual pop music a well that's depressing thanks cheesecake I use oh oh yeah that might be my term uh okay never mind pop music triggers with like the cheesecake reflex I call it uh your brain loves sugar and salt by the way I thought you might like this we lus and I have been playing this game uh called tape to tape which is very fun but uh the developer behind it
is called excellent rectangle nice hell yeah I like their logo yeah video game Studio that's that's all you need to know about them that's great what oh never mind okay I saw people also SE for search for and I saw slapshot rebound and I thought it was like they also made and I was like no way Slap Shot rebound sick too uh but tape tape to tape we've been having a lot of fun with it's a rogue light you go through a campaign you play against teams that have various types of completely unfair Buffs there's
basically no rules  pass it's fun yeah it's it's it's dumb fun um supports multiplayer support is a little complicated because it only supports local couch multiplayer so you can use Steam remote play but if you want to play with five people on a team Steam remote play only supports four controllers so we had to have one person or we had to have two people side by side in the same place that was me and Ivon last night and then she was on the keyboard and I was on the controller and
then we were able to have three more controllers remote in that was the only way we could get five players working so if anyone from valve is watching who works on remote play or anything like that um hey could we have a couple more controllers supported in remote play that would be sick obviously this is a n use case but it's the kind of thing that every once in a while a valve person will just be like he that's a good idea maybe I'll just make that because I don't know if I even have a real boss
anyway uh so if if that situation is going on right now um we'd be super into that I've got I've got one final thought on this if I can interject um uh when is it going to be able to make like Death Grips songs you know uh that's that's the thing is is a lot of these are trained on massive amounts of the most generic thing so like pop music is dead like this just kills pop music just like uh you know the AR art gener ators are killing uh single person pinup art um but if you're
going to get weird right or like or like Environ like backgrounds do you know what I mean did hold on hold on what did you just describe like thirsty commissions as single person pinup art yeah because that is the most apt description I have ever heard for anything ever carry on yeah you know okay we got a beautiful painted background right nobody's going to do those anymore but like Death Grips or any of the other really strange kind of out there uh types of so what you're saying is humans
have a niche it's just very weird yeah yeah humans are going to make the weird stuff and then the the boring is Death Grips the band where everyone gets pissed off if people don't record their concerts because they often have songs that they only play at like I I have no idea I used to I used to despise them because they were kind of outside of that uh understanding I don't find artists that I'm like I don't get this very often and then Adam made me listen to them a lot and and he said that they
were good and so I had to revisit it now I get it I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure  probably yeah I don't know uh I ended up on the subreddit because we were looking at that uh generated song and apparently mods at r/ the crew are shutting down any discussion of Ubisoft revoking players license keys so that's bad do they have a pin post about it by any chance over on r/ the crew yeah not sure that's a good question though I want to go check because sometimes mods will do thatc is it actually just r/ the crew
members what is the what is the actual sub R SL the crew I don't know maybe it's not hold on this has like 1 and half th000 votes though I don't think they made it up no I don't think so either I'm just wondering what the actual subreddit is I don't know I don't see a link to it they've also locked the thread explaining why they removed the first thread because no one was buying it oh it's it's written incorrectly it's the underscore crew oh yeah there you go  op in other news um our short circuit
for these wireless routers is finally  yeah we we do uh we do a little bit of real world testing with them could a minion router be any good no Luke why are you such a downer seriously like do does that make you happy to be unhappy Yes except I'm not unhappy but it makes me happy to be a downer about that so you want everyone else to be unhappy because you should just buy a normal one and then if you really want to be a minion you just make it look like a minion you don't need to buy like
products that are just super weirdly branded and probably U priced like a huge amount for no reason it's very unnecessary just modify it make it your own there are yeah I don't know I don't think this happened I do know sometimes that like users won't really understand the pressure that moderators come under when things are going just absolutely wild yep um and what can sometimes happen which doesn't really look like this happened so I don't know but what I was kind of talking about there what was what can
sometimes happen is they'll let one post through and like pin it and then just delete everything else because they're like we don't want to sift through all this and try to figure this out um but yeah I don't know I could write Better lyrics than that AI song Sorry I was just looking at the lyrics I'm sure you were saying something interesting very good which one thee P turpentine oh yeah yeah was that on the same udio was that on udio or was that on sonno people are talking about son UMO Sono
whatever wild uh also I was listening to you were saying people on Reddit single pinned post I think this is going to become I don't know why why is there so many more sonno posts in I can 100% see people just putting on play me some here's here's some songs I like play me some random [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that is stuff I might like and then you just thumbs up and thumbs down and then it just algorithmically feeds you literally an unlimited fire hose of new music you've never heard of and I
use the term music uh with finger quotes uh for the rest of your life like this is this is life changing you know how sometimes there'll be like an alternative YouTube platform that'll go up and they'll get promoted like crazy and then you go on there and all the videos have like 10 views that's not the case I'm on sonno sonno shows off things more than yudo as far as I can tell I only ate three cheeseburgers has a quar million plays um scroll down a little bit uh cat has almost half a
million capy Bara has over a quarter million of course we're taking their word for this yes that's a pretty big deal deep Knight has a quarter million it's very easy and quite common uh to I'll just say um that view counts are not not always super accurate it's very easy for them to not be super accurate and I think it's I have personally deemed that a decent amount of it is intentional so maybe but I have no idea I've never heard of the site but a lot of people in chat had known about
it the second we started talking about udio people were posting a bunch of links from suo Wild uh Instagram is going to be adding a new filtering feature which detects and blurs images that are likely to contain nudity this filtering will reportedly use on device analysis so that's good meaning that it also works with endtoend encryption the feature will also prompt users who appear to be attempting to send a nude photo to think twice before sending nude images nudity filtering will be turned on by default
for all users under 18 meaning Instagram  dead no they'll just lie about what age they are I don't know I don't know if they if they're doing this presumably they have some kind of intent to enforce this I don't think it's going to be that hard for them to figure out if users under the legal age are sending nudity of themselves like oh I see um and uh yeah I I thought of this as uh wait hold on yeah I think the filter is for receivers of the images yes yeah not senders I think the warning is just for
senders yeah the warning is for senders so it just seems like they're headed in a Direction now that they've acknowledged the problem yeah they kind of have to do something yeah and if they do something they're done I wonder how much of like if I wonder how hard it would be to deal with the processing of this for Twitter oh man I don't read through public threads anymore you can't yeah if it's if it's a thread of like someone I know I might click on it if it's not I just don't if it's if it's very trending
I just don't click on it it's just full of bums yeah click on my whatever yeah top whatever percent yep yep and the text will have absolutely nothing to do with the imagery nope uh according to meta this is not only to protect people from seeing unwanted nudity but also to protect them from scammers who use nude images to catch fish user catfish users into to sending them extortion material yes uh that is very important and honestly I agree how going to do that this seems the intent seems great how's
it going to do that with warnings so it warns the sender yeah it warns the sender and it blurs the blurs the imagery um basically they're putting barriers in place for sexting I don't think it's going to do the the also protect them from scammers who use nude images to catfish users it's not going to do that at all if people wanted to see that image they're just going to turn the filter off sure that's fair enough but I'm not I'm not saying the goal is like bad or anything I just
that's that's not going to happen I'm just saying look I'm just Twitter roulette look at the comment section of any trending tweet in public I actually there's a bullet in every chamber I have specifically opened and then immediately reflexively been like oh geez and closed Twitter before because I was like I'm in public and I can't really guarantee that what comes  nope anyway my point was just this direction that they're in heading in this goal seems admirable seems good um
the fact that they didn't weren't working on already is the opposite of all of that and now that they're doing this I I just don't think people are going to use it I mean it's no it's no secret that people use the least naned platform because that's what they want to do yeah uh Avery Studios and FL plane says they already warn about violent content Etc if you said it so this looks like an expansion of something that they kind of already do yeah content warnings uh Discord topic
sure Discord torches switch emulator ser Services servicers okay Ubisoft blocks Gamers from ever reinstalling the crew again Discord has shut down the servers for suu suyu and sudachi both of which were Forks of switch emulator Yuzu as well as disabling the accounts of their lead developers so that second part is  troubling yeah cuz their ability for for the friends connections that they've made so their ability to effectively respawn or even continued communication at all because verifying you were
probably Anonymous so verifying that you were that person if your account is fully disabled if you don't have any secondary forms of communication could be just genuinely impossible yep unless you have some way to prove like look I have this information that no one else would have had or whatever that's don't like that Discord has not commented on why it went this far only that it's following its typical procedure for dmca takedown request yeah that what is to Ben who whoever okay hold on
carry on however DMC takedowns usually involve a notice being forwarded to the group or individuals suspected of posting violating content who have the option to take the infringing content down voluntarily or risk being sued according to the developers communication with Discord has been vague and they received no prior warnings or a copy of any takedown request elsewhere in gaming Ubisoft is now revoking digital licenses from owners of the crew preventing them from ever reinstalling it the game was
delisted in December with the announcement that the servers would shut down in April despite having a lot of single single player content the game is server dependent and players were hoping to create and run fan servers following the shutdown similar to how Wii U and 3DS fans have created a open-source uh pretendo Network to maintain online features following the shutdown of servers earlier this week so there's quite a lot to unpack here um pretendo Network super cool there's no guarantee
that Nintendo won't Patch It Up out it was based on an exploit that they were kind of holding on to until Nintendo shut everything down and maybe his you know final patched out of these systems and they were like haha okay we we were kind of sitting on this ready to go pretendo Network let's go um yeah given how just sort of generally vengeful Nintendo is I could see them investing Dev time into completely dead Platforms in order to just make darn good andure you can't use anything without their
blessing but I guess we'll see what scares me is the pretendo name because it's close to Nintendo because I I I read something about like how one of the reasons why um so the the the Game Boy the original game boy I might get some of this wrong I apologize if I do the original game boy would only launch games if the Nintendo logo was displayed at the beginning they had some way of like pixel matching the Nintendo logo if I remember correctly the logo was stored locally on the actual Game Boy itself
and it would compare against what was on the cartridge because if you made like a uh non-official game or whatever the only way to get it to launch was to have the Nintendo logo on and if you put the Nintendo logo on there they could go after you if if you didn't have an agreement in place brilliant so like they they put you in a spot where they could legally attack you if you made a game that did work on Game Boy wow so and that so that they've been doing this for a while my point they're
experienced oh our things says wo after dark uh just in case any of our live viewers need to like go or something should we uh hey there they are nice should we take their should we take their questions now and then get to a couple more topics after even though that's a little uncustomary they got it from Sega oh I don't know I don't yeah hilarious dude we oh oh jerky we were just supposed to do it throughout the show I got you oh sick Savage jerky's back folks nice perky jerky wait what is perky jerky
apparently it's not called Savage jerky anymore wait it's still called Savage jerky okay I'm so confused they have a line of per perky jerky this says perky jerky Savage Oh were they acquired by perky jerky or something okay I actually don't know two bold Brands stronger together oh okay so they like mer cool so some kind of m&amp;a took place and now uh Savage J and perky jerky are are two strong Brands stronger together or something nice as long as they still have the the bacon bacon jerky then
sizzling bacon or sizzling Maple uncured bacon jerky is that the one you used to go for I don't know but I I I definitely need to get my hands on some bacon jerky here and then uh okay Dan are you uh are you bringing someone down how many how many live questions are we taking I think there let's see I think we have uh one two 3 four five oh Lordy okay why don't we do those okay that would be good Curtis Curtis their new branding is actually really sharp could you please bring them down a random comment but 
mhm yeah make guys  I'm so happy it's been a while AJ not not Flo play AJ but AJ and Flo playing chat said uh yudu is going to be amazing for my Bard short prompts and I can just create amazing songs for my D and D character it's kind of a neat use for it yeah hello I like that one okay guys are here let's do that do that I think you wrote some down right uh right written down all right welcome have this as well I'm sorry the show is so long but realistically you knew what you were getting yourself into 
song Let's go ahead all right yeah go for it uh okay um so first off I just wanted to say uh thank you uh my excuse me my son and I are having a great time oh good I'm glad to hear that thanks um okay so I know that uh Luke and lius are going to have very different answers for this oh but uh that's a challenge actually uh okay so uh what is uh one bit of technology that you would like to see added into or removed from Cars ooh removed I think is pretty easy especially in light of the recent news
that car manufacturers have been monitoring our driving habits and selling them to insurance or selling them to data brokers who have been selling them to insurance agencies I think that the correct time to remove that was yesterday and the next best time is right now um added into though as for added into honestly I can't think of too many more things that I would want I mean okay how Fantastical am I allowed to get because I mean if I could have a flying car obviously that would
be ideal let's go Vall um I would like to have it be I think flying cars are a terrible idea I would have to have it be small enough that I don't have to like register my flight path in order to just Cruise no man collision avoidance we can get Advanced enough collision avoidance that it shouldn't be a problem we got this if that's if that's the case I'm super on board it's incredibly inefficient and a terrible idea but yeah let's go oh yeah super inefficient but I mean we could have invented some new
engine and it doesn't matter anymore cuz you have some battery thing that is charged once for free and you never have to charge it again who knows what I mean yeah I mean while we're making things up sure yeah and it smells like oranges and I'd like that I'd be down okay hold on but let's let's maybe have a let's maybe have a real feature I mean it's one of those things where the the automotive industry is so mature at this point that um I kind of feel like no matter how stupid the idea is either a car
manufacturer has done it or The Simpsons has done it uh what did what did they call um Dan you would probably know this  oh yep well um that's great I don't know where I pulled that from yeah anyway it had like that it had like that space spaceship bubble cockpit and stuff like that if I could okay fine you know what I'm going to pick something somewhat reasonable how about windshield wipers that don't wear out in like 3 months in the Pacific North West how about that there that's what I want how those like
Sonic ones work are they any good Sonic windshield wipers well it must be really fast and he's dead brutal killed from the soul out I thought it was a thing I swear it was a thing maybe I'm using the wrong term they did something where it wasn't actually like a blade oh they had some type of emitter wow I don't remember what it was that sounds like the kind of thing that Tesla would promise to develop and then never do it might have been like a concept thing or something I
don't remember it's been a long time um  know I have this like I've hoped for a long time um that we could get to the point where you don't have to drive the car because like yeah driving cars can be cool and fun and stuff but the vast majority of the time it's just incredibly boring and a waste of time um so that would be nice but if I do anything in a car while someone else is driving it I just get car sick anyways so I don't know if there's any point I don't know if I
actually really care so then what else  be I don't know I feel like there's not a ton left to be super desired okay is part of the problem for you that people are bad drivers though because I am not a super motion sickness prone person I can go out on a boat no problem little dingy in the ocean no problem um I could I literally will sit in the back of a car and use my laptop for an hour two hours at a time no problem but I swear to you every single Uber driver in the entire Greater Vancouver area is
determined to prevent me from doing that by riding the accelerator almost as hard as they ride the brakes yes so over and over over and over and over and over and over and over again how hard is it to press the accelerator a little bit and press the brake a little bit or better yet press the accelerator even less and then just hold it there yeah so it it absolutely has to do with the drivers and it is absolutely pedal control specifically which I find interesting cuz you actually drive
sometimes like a bit of a Madman but I don't get sick when you're driving because I think it's not the overall speed and it's not like turning it's just the yeah so like well I'm married to my wife so um I need to be pretty on top of it yeah fair enough all my kids get car sick too like there's one person on staff actually um Jake that I've driven in their I've I've I've been in their car while they were driving um and I had to get out and I wasn't even on my phone my
father-in no um so it ranges actually un usually most people as long as I just don't read anything I'm fine I'll just be like mildly uncomfortable but yeah so if it was like really good at pedal control maybe it's fine but I don't know Bart the tech says is it that he drive it's that he drives in a way that your body expects the movement so it's not jarring yeah and I don't expect people to just do this like oh I need to slow down I guess I need to slow down with the whole brake pedal oh I need to speed
up I guess I need to speed up up with the whole gas pedal like it's just oh my goodness relax a little bit efficient yes you should not be pressing the gas pedal any further down than you absolutely have to it it like obviously it does not work like this the mixing is nonlinear but think about this for a second if you press down the pedal 3/4 of the way to get up to speed what how much faster how much faster is that happening versus if you press down a quarter as much I promise you the amount
of gas like if you could if you had a little live view okay if you had a camera at the at the site where the fuel was being injected into the cylinder and you could watch how much of your liquid money that you just poured into your gas T too yeah that you were dumping into it you'd go easy you know that's an interesting idea I I wonder if you and I have similar driving Styles because of frugality Maybe I try to hyper mile pretty often now that I drive an electric car I'm way more easy about it
but I was like hardcore on I do not want to be in a gear that is any higher than I absolutely have to be I I will be really annoying about like if the lights red I'm not advancing towards it I will generally slow down and if I cannot stop oh yeah so I can just get really slow 100% And then keep going drivers behind you hate it here though I don't know why I'm helping all of us right now yeah I know I don't get it yeah whatever I don't remember what the question was but maybe that adequately
addressed it oh I think I think I might have a feature actually based on something that you just said that I kind of like you know a a efficient car driving promoter things in cars will usually be when you're doing well it'll like grow a tree or whatever right I think I want the negativity version you want a negativity version so every time you stomp on your accelerator they murder a squirrel like what do you it it'll be like oh hey looks like you like really pushed it there that cost you this many extra
dollars and it's like when you get to the end of the drive instead of being like great job you saved the planet every single time it'll be like hm that was actually kind of rough you could have saved six extra bucks this drive if you didn't drive like that that was 9% worse than your best yeah interesting so gamify gamify your driving found way to gamify another thing okay that's pretty cool but like kind of like that yeah with I think a focus on kind of uh oh man the drawbacks of it being bad oh man
that'd be so cool like you rode your brakes really hard this drive so you could compete as long as they anonymized the data and didn't sell it to anyone which we know won't happen so yeah I I know Dan I know laughing Dan let me live in my fantasy Utopia no it's fun here no yes um how cool would it be if it compared you to everyone else who drove the same drive at the same time of day including yourself and you could like go for the high score yeah that'd be kind of neat that'd be SI I I I I I like the idea
that instead of yeah I think that just grow a tree thing like I never really care that much um got them I I love trees you heard here first yeah luk plant more Luke hates trees.com Etc but it's just like I I want I kind of want it to I want feel the repercussions you know and maybe it's like yeah that was worth it I had to get someone to the hospital or something I don't know but a lot of the time it's like really I was just totally on time driving somewhere and just driving like a butt maybe it
should tell me that me driving like a butt cost me x% more on my brakes that I didn't need to cost me this much more on my gas um yeah I don't know I think that'd be interesting not everyone is quite as financially motivated as you though like if you told the average person that they just wasted six cents of fuel they'd be like eh you'd be like shocking off I could have done better I could have had one 5cent candy plus tax  cents yeah I don't know I would like it  personally does luk get underpaid no I just
uh I don't enjoy spending money I don't like the act of spending money I'll do it but that's not the cool part I do yeah will he does he though really does he my birds have been at the vet for a week o I'm spending some money yeah he's spending money yeah how's wellie doing actually I do have good news oh good yeah so they did they did a blood draw doing a blood draw on budgies is like super sketch um how much how much blood do they have exactly that's that's the problem no but seriously like how many
milliliters of blood do they have I don't know exactly but it's very small there's there's the I like this quote uh humans you know we're mostly made of water Birds mostly made of air or at least budgies so like there isn't a lot there so it's really dangerous but the vet was like yeah we we're not 100% certain what's going on we need more information um so they did it surviv that that's good they detected that it was probably something to do with liver problems so they started giving uh
antibiotics specifically targeting the liver to both Birds both Birds saw an improvement um and it's at the point that Wall-E which was the one that was struggling is no longer in an incubator as of today and they're in the same cage again as of today which is good cuz they're extremely social animals they're still monitoring them I'm really hoping I'm going to get a call tomorrow that I can pick them up one because I want my birds back but then also cuz it's really expensive fair enough yeah birds are
mostly air.com oh my everyone that you said so far has been turned into something and I'm like trying to dissuade people not to do it cuz I keep posting in flow playe chat like we're not going to click on it it's like we're to not click we're not going to you could be harvesting our IPS or doing whatever else someone might have already oh my goodness too late oh that's too fast my goodness okay all right I think we're ready for our next merch messenger live thank you very much so much one of
the people that grabbed the last domain they like name had devops in the name they're just like this is what they do like oh my goodness welcome thank you and uh you're not going to click on it but I already to click on Luke has no clue and it redirects to LTT store.com oh no so you don't have to do it I got it at did two hours ago I don't know what it does now for now it does don't click on it don't click on it but thanks also for having me it's been a great day our pleasure uh my question is how do
you handle the pressure of being a public figure in the tech industry while still prioritizing your own well-being and personal time that's a stupid question I obviously don't no no you're  I don't at all well why not honestly it's not the tech industry that's the problem I don't work in the tech industry that's a common misconception I work in the media industry and I cover Tech and uh being in the media industry used to you work in the tech industry by the way you're actually wrong okay fine
thank you Luke problem I also work in the clothing industry but let's be real here let me let me modify the tech and clothing industry and media thank you for that so oh man the see but my problem is not any part of the working in the tech industry or the clothing industry for that matter I actually really enjoy those parts the parts that I find that the most pressure comes from are is the media industry and that's that's one where I mean you know we've it used to be a lot easier it used
to be that our biggest controversy was hey we need to eat um so we have baked in sponsor spots in our videos now um whereas now it feels like that was a big deal it's also yeah that that was hated that for like years I think yeah we were on the Leading Edge of that we weren't the first to do it but we were pretty early in terms of monetizing the content outside of just AdSense who was first in Tech right is that right I as far as I know we were the first in Tech although
ironically no one cared when the entire channel was funded by a computer  I never actually really thought about that before but that's pretty funny well no it's one of those things where people people are so selectively outraged right how dare you promote into compromise your integrity by promoting Intel's win a snowboard competition for core i7 when you used to be used to be what a Salesman at a computer store this is a step forward um and and we've worked hard to maintain our independent voice over the
years but but that was something that you know I guess was just it was jarring for people and and sometimes it's not about you know big picture how big of a deal this is or how how much this is actually compromising the Integrity of the people or the content and it's more just what do what are you used to um what is the what is the flavor of the week right and um I do find I you find the the speed of the news cycle and the speed of the outrage engine to be the most exhausting part of this job um and
I mean I said it in the I'm thinking of retiring stream um which maybe you've watched or maybe you haven't there's enough views on it that it's sort of fair for me to assume that a lot of people who watch the channel have seen it at this point um but I said it then I said it now I'm tired um the thing that keeps me going now is the team uh we've got a hundred people here who depend on me getting up and getting out of bed in the morning and uh you know being part of this thing and helping drive it and
and being that sort of creative voice um it's also the community I think that what we're doing is incredibly important and some of these things are I think probably not properly appreciated yet but I understand why because we're not done yet they don't see what I see yet for something like the lab um they don't see necessarily why we make the decisions that we do and so you know for us another thing that drives me is doing it anyway um whether people uh see it and appreciate it or
not um by the way new article on the lab sorry new article on the lab oh oh really I haven't seen this yet yeah sorry I have now officially become der with some pretty significant design changes based on user feedback well let's check it out together shall we yeah okay comparison bin welcome to the beta blah blah blah blah blah blah we'd love to hear your feedback so make sure you do check that out at the top okay latest here we go okay oh look at that whoa whoa whoa we got new imagery we got
a watermark now that's pretty cool nice that actually looks sharp oh hold on is this what makes it expand or not expand you know what not going to worry too much about that right now but uh this is uh I think I believe this has been revised revised you while you were scrolling with your fingers I think you're actually clicking on the bars because you don't have to click on the actual symbol you can click anywhere on the bar oh okay well very interesting uh so this is something we talked about in
our meeting this week is like how are we going to handle what's good and what's bad over time and we'd love to we'd love to develop a system where it's kind of tag based and then we can Decay the goodness of tags as the technology changes for for now I think these are going to be manual and you know these are going to be a product of their time rather than being um something that can naturally or not naturally but can decay in a controlled manner as our uh as our standards you know for what constitutes
good 1440p performance evolve but this is this is this looks great I think it looks really good I think the feedback that we got from the community was genuinely very helpful so thank you for that I genuinely strong L appreciate it okay this is just a link to Luma field so it's not the thing we talked about yet that thing is not I don't think it's here yet okay I'm not going to worry about that thing yet so that's cool we're not going to talk about the thing spe boort design cuz we weren't sure
about the whatever whatever thing yep yep yep yep yep yep don't even don't even worry don't even trip uh is there any other particular new thing that I should be showing people oh wow this is a ton of comparative data yeah so that's pretty cool oh this is this highlight new no oh okay never mind it's been there uh in regards to things that are different I mean there is some stuff that are different like if before if you uh loaded if you if you selected drop downs for something that didn't exist it
just wouldn't like load anything now it communicates that we didn't test that um this is so cool this like interactive chart thing I really like just like playing with it Matt Matt did a fantastic job um it feels very nicely responsive yeah it's great it's great looks great I noticed you're in  mode I can address that yeah boom oh well I don't know oh interesting well that could maybe be fixed what oh it said I was in dark mode already and then I clicked it and clicked dark mode
and then it yeah was fine nice yeah dark Mode's pretty looks really good anyway prefer dark mode but I like dark mode on The Labb site so I guess what I'm trying to say is that I find coping mechanisms find reasons to do it um the people are great I I legitimately like my colleagues which helps a lot um I think if that wasn't true anymore I would probably just quit yeah cuz that was a huge motivating factor for me to start the company was that I was tired of working with people that I didn't
respect or didn't like um and for me those are those are honestly they're pretty hand inhand um I also didn't like explaining things that should be common sense to people who were in charge of what I was doing um especially when in many cases and this is not true of every I don't think I'm the smartest person in the world but I think that we had some people in positions of authority who were especially um not the best when it came to making decisions and some of these differences in opinion
um don't just boil down to like oh yeah like I'm really smart and they're not smart it's not that it's not that simple but I just I I was tired of I was tired of being the common sense police sure um I hope that answers your question that does thank you for your time and good luck finding time for yourselves all right now thank thank you for your time you came all the way out here and you're thanking me for my time appreciate you all right next I guess yeah do it come on in let's do it hey yo how you doing
good you excellent never better thank you for having me I have a simple question at least I think do you have any plans on expending on the hat line to include bucket hats bucket hats yeah wow uh no we have no plans for bucket hats I think you're you're you're saying this like it's very out of the blue but I think bucket hats are trendy right now I no yeah I I dude look at me you would never know do I look yeah what would that's why I was letting you know what would I know about
trendy that's why I was letting you know what would you know about trendy not much more if any you could fit everything you know about trendy in a bucket hat probably you you know you might actually know more than me because you talk to the people at cre a warehouse more often they would know they don't really try to pitch me things based on trendy though that's probably wise they probably learned that over time they did yeah they they try to pitch me stuff based on like
what they think our audience will like regardless of trend and we do we do hop on Trends a little bit like one of the trends that we've hopped on is that people need functional workware that is comfortable yeah and we have like a lineup That essentially that we're building around that something that I appreciate a lot about the creative Warehouse products in general is that it's not really it's just good stuff that you'd like to have we really need to stop using the word merch
yeah one of the one of the tour attendees um actually brought that up during the tour today and obviously they bought the 3D down jacket that's why they're here they they won the contest but they were like yeah no I don't buy this stuff cuz like I like care especially about necessarily the channel or you know whatever like the Design's cool I guess or whatever but I buy it cuz it's really good I'm like yeah that's exactly why you should buy something I don't think the actual goal
have I ever asked someone to buy something from us because it's from us maybe but not in a lot of years and not many times like I like this actually sorry Conrad is proposing instead of merch messages because we're trying to get away from merch that we call them good stuff messages good stuff messages I mean The Branding probably needs a little bit of work what do you call the bonus bin uh bonus bin that's what it's called isn't it no what do Luke called oh Luke's name for the bonus bin is terrible it's not
my name it's Conrad's name well it's terrible I like that name what is it come on tell me the fuss or the free upsell shelf it's not an upsell it's free you can't have a free upsell that's not what an upsell is hey man I don't make the rules great any who um thank you for your message or thing you said sorry I just love a good bucket hat that's fair that's fair yeah it's a good one if we made a bucket hat it would be great but we don't have any plans for a bucket hat right now thank you thank you
all right Dan all right oh we got another one come on come on down all right merch messages maybe they're a Quality quality product questions instead of merch messages maybe this one's probably pretty quick for you I love my multip shirt nice can I get one in pink oh I think we actually did a I think we actually did a prototype of that uh when we did the oh what did we ultimately release hold on a second the gray one sometimes I can't remember the products that we that we work on versus
the ones that actually make their way oh man dude I should have shown you guys the uh the microfiber t-shirt when we were over there we have a we have a t-shirt in like it's it's the yellow like a microfiber cloth on the body and then the sleeves are accented in that like soft like baby blue blue and um and it's like made of microfiber cloth like you would have the cleanest phone you and all your friends you'd have friends coming up behind you they'd be rubbing their phone on you for good luck or good
screen visibility it's not very comfortable but I think we're going to make it anyway as someone with glasses that's not a bad idea exactly that's what I'm talking about anyway the point is I think we actually did prototype that at some points with glasses stores and I think we were worried that it would lack mainstream appeal I was into it we definitely did a blue one I just can't remember if we ever did a um if we ever got past mockup for a multip shirt in pink we released blue multip I don't
think we released it okay uh there was like a manufacturing issue so they were sold for like 20 bucks or something or maybe even 10 oh there you go I love that you know that I have one and I bought my mom one for her birthday they're nice shirts right I wish they I wish it was more apparent what it looked like in a photograph but they just it's like it doesn't it doesn't look like that yeah I mean it looks kind of like that part now that we're zoomed in it looks a bit better yeah it's it's
basically more visible it's cool and people love it and we only have it in white and gray yeah um and this is this is such a good shirt um I just need enough to be a cartoon character and wear a different color of the exact same outfit every day of the  L um I forget what the question was oh yes the pink multip yeah sorry I don't think there's any plans to expand the the RGB shirt which is what we call it now I think originally we just called it multip which didn't mean a lot to a lot
of people um there I don't think there's any plans to expand the RGB shirt lineup right now I could be mistaken though like maybe did we ever re did we ever rerun those blue ones I I can't even remember anymore we' have so many products now like I can hardly keep track of everything on our store all right okay Dan you want to hit us with another yes come on D Are we almost at the end I think we got two more fantastic a real question what can I do for question okay so the game industry triaa gaming has
recently produced a ton of flops what do you think professional game studios are going to do to like combat this or are they just going to stay on the same path they're going to wait for someone younger and hungrier and more Innovative to make a cool game on their own and then they're going to buy them and then they're going to screw it up and then they're going to rinse and repeat nice so they're kind of going to stay on the same track but just a slightly different Rhythm yeah I think we might be
witnessing somewhat of a turnover in companies so like uh certain large companies that are starting to flounder I think we're going to see offshoot companies which we there are a lot of examples of uh starting to spawn up and certain Indie companies that are hitting very major success potentially turning into the the Futures AAA companies certain off off shoot companies forming out of these larger companies potentially turning into the Futures AAA companies I think some companies are
going to figure it out I've noticed this is largely a North American game developer problem um some examples from like Japan for example are not having the same type of hit I do wish that I I do wish that I could agree that we're going to see these offshoots become the large companies but I don't think they'll get a chance to get that big they get gobbled again yeah the because the challenge is unless your name is larryan Studios or arrowhead from rockstar I can't think of many game
companies that can swing for the fences because remember the question specifically was AAA gaming I can't think of many companies that have managed this like Mark Rober Mr Beast approach to developing video games where they swing for the fences nail it on every release and then can put their head down for 3 to six years and make the next absolute Grand Slam home run game that keeps the engine turning so at some point when you grow big enough and you try to create triaa quality games
you collapse under your own weight and companies like Microsoft and to a lesser extent you know the EAS and ubis of the world are going to have this unlimited bucket of money that they can use to m&amp;a you and bring your talented developers ironically some of which probably came from you in the first place um on board so that you can continue to do what you're doing except probably with less passion and ultimately burn out like it's it it feels like it's in a really
destructive cycle right now and and this ability of large organizations to just buy anything they want is not helping I I I do agree but I don't think everything is is for sale now yes this is because they're making those big hits um but I I think we're seeing like there's there's quotes from uh the CEOs and other various people at at companies like like larryan and like Arrowhead um that are very resistant to current AAA Norms if that makes sense uh like on arrowhead's website
um this is this is so great fast Philly says oh I love it I can't tell if this is self-aware or not I think GTA 6 will be a technological Marvel of gaming but that at this point there's no  hype that's pretty good uh I it the quote I was looking I hope it's self-aware this is a quote on arrowhead's website I I do not think most current AAA Studios follow this type of mentality um but a game made for everyone is a game a for no one that's hell divers um Arrowhead except as far
as I can tell body loves hellers smashed it with hell divers and a lot of people really really like that game but they didn't design it with the design it for everyone in mind right uh and that's not really a mentality that you see a lot of these giant Studios um bal's gate was made for people you know that would really enjoy this type of thing and it it was just made so well that it hit a much more mass Market I think that's the same with hell divers I think that's the
same with something like Elden ring like really looking at Elden ring success would anyone have guessed that a game that hard would resonate so well with so many people no but it was a masterpiece of a game so it did anyways um I someone messaged on held divers now uh that's great yeah I don't know I I was a little depresso about it because I was like games are dead the whole industry is just dying and then over the last few the last couple maybe years it's been looking a lot brighter so I'm
not as worried about anymore yeah I think another big thing is that the community as much as I dog on The Gaming Community for like buying too many microtransactions and stuff um but they seem to be much more willing to jump on and embrace games from non-aa Studios fall guys guys Among Us uh what is that game that looks like oh pal world yeah looks like Pokemon um hell balers Gate 3 there's there's so many games that have SM Gate 3 is Triple A I don't think technically is it maybe
it is I don't know how many years did they work on it is that how you define AAA um I think I don't think you can call them a triple A you know what it depends I guess how you define AAA I'm defining AAA in terms of scope it's ambitious whether cuz one person could conceivably build a AAA quality game if they had 25 to 30 lifetimes to work on it or whatever like I like to me triaa is is quality but I I could definitely understand if other people viewed it as more of like um the dollars that were spent on
it but I mean in either case balers Gate 3 there's no way that that wasn't extremely expensive to create yeah for sure I just how do you actually Define triaa well how do you f Define quadruple okay balers Gate 3 had a budget of $100 million heck yeah is that accurate where'd you get that from uh oh that doesn't sound accurate no that's just a tweet yeah I don't think that means anything hold on uh hold on this is from oh no this is just the Forum on laran Studios look the point is I believe that
number it's an enormous game I I don't um and in in talking to people that work there uh a lot of people overestimate how much how many resources they had going into it a lot of people assumed that they received like a ton of money from Hasbro to make it when that was just not the case um it's yeah I don't know um it doesn't look like they've disclosed publicly no I don't think so because they are independent I don't know if you want to call them an indie but they are independent yeah this medium article
just says no one called them a AAA Studio before reviews came in for bg3 no one was calling them a AAA Studio when bg3 beta was public no one was calling them a AAA Studio at all these other times um but suddenly bg3 just smashes it out of the park and now they're called the tripa studio which if that's how you become a trip Studio then yeah we saw it we saw a developer go on the path that I'm talking about was that ever a long path yeah so I don't know cuz they they had been making a lot of games before
bg3 a lot of people heard about them with bg3 but they've been making games for forever you want to know a fun one do you remember Magicka the weird game you could do like uh you played a little spellcaster but a lot of inputs would do different things and like one of them was blue screen was the was the input that your character could do anyways I used to play it back in the day I'm sure you've we've talked about it and I'm sure you've played it at one point um but Arrowhead made
Magicka the guys that made uh hell divers made Magicka which I thought was really cool I'm pretty sure that's true let me  yeah Magicka it's kind of neat I swear I've never heard of this Luke I'm sure you have I swear to you I have never heard of this your memory is questionable that's true it's apparently from 13 years ago yeah or at least this video about it is from 13 years ago wow four player Adventure Mode that's cool yeah and it's what like an RPG or like uh would that be the right way to
call it maybe crawler Adventure game sure yeah something like that recent reviews mixed yeah I was I wonder what that's about I'm not sure crashes all the time when played online is the first negative review I found PR to crashing crashing it's a 13-year-old game yeah maybe it's not running well on Modern systems anymore well that's a bummer cuz all reviews is very positive yeah yeah that's a bummer this was a this was an extremely positively looked at game at the time cool all right I think we're ready for
our next one thank you thank you so much thank you thank you I think your last one comes in last one all right question uh so vote for Maga it's like a great like single player together game to play uh so not a real question here necessarily Dan might like it um yudo LT Christmas album no no no wrong no and no all of you no especially you no you know why it's a no because we've got Dan and he can just make one in house exactly no wait no no you you've got enough audio from lus you
can just mix it up you only need like a minute or two anyway that is not the point it's not about how much you need it's about how much you should have and the answer is none got like 300 hours of like uncompressed exactly Channel lus you have the whole album and just review it to him yeah exactly other could just play constantly throughout his house and it would always be different oh that'd be a fun Channel super fun hijacking the  house I think I think I fig exposive oh God speaking of float plane
exclusives if you guys haven't checked them out we've got a ton of really great ones our North Korean gaming console video is up in Early Access we don't we don't TI typically do Early Access necessarily on float plane anymore but hey every once in a while these videos do show up and this one is a doozy uh We've also had a ton of great exclusive Extended Cut From the lwig collab uh we've got the uh h warning adult themes extras from The Roasting Craigslist and Facebook Marketplace computer
listings uh this one was a little bit popular with the float plane audience got got that got that nice like dislike ratio and then from last week the car break-in prank reveals what happened at the end of the April fools video man we've had a ton of really good stuff lately so make sure that you check it out over at lmg floatplane all right I think that pretty much wraps up our in-person merch messages so Dan oh oh yeah okay never mind uh so Dan how do you want to handle
this cuz we still have a couple topics how much after dark online messages there what what are we doing here what what what's going on I ask myself that a lot I think maybe go do some topics and then if you want you guys can move into after dark yourself you know what the the light setting is you know we have the oh you're leaving us well we can either do some more topics oh no no okay or I can go like have more time to get set up if you're going to do some topics and then go directly into when after
dark so we're doing super checks uh exclusively streaming on float plane Linus V Luke we're going to have a live audience assuming they don't all go home cuz it's late and I'm doing four cameras I might need help from them this time four cameras four cameras if I can get them working one of them is freaking out but four cameras Oh do you maybe want to recruit your helpers to um get apple boxes to prop up the thing meant to ask how many do you want and what are the sizes Etc um usually we use two full
apples on the game and then I need two half apples to stand on because the game is too tall for me if it's Luke sized most things are it's funny because even if the score is in favor of me he always wins because I end up emasculated  true we both win it's good unless I lose the game as well oh all right I'm gone doesn't happen see you later Dan bad Xbox creates game preservation Squad yeah let's do it we got to do this Xbox has created are you okay the camera's following
me I forgot that it was magic oh is that one of those uh facial Meo ones or whatever track who makes that one I don't know isn't it on it it's very not I just want to look at you you can't look at it closely without it like yeah uh in insta link uh sorry insta 360 oh okay okay okay yeah these things are cool that's working great okay what was I doing okay goodbye anyways Xbox has created a new team dedicated to game preservations according to leaked emails from president Sarah Bond unlike many
video game preservation efforts which focus on old games for previous generations this team is apparently focused on proactively preserving current games and ensuring backwards compatibility in future Hardware actually super cool that's super cool it's unclear how broad the team's scope will be including whether it will cover online only games that are dependent on servers Sarah Bond likewise claimed in emails that Microsoft is moving Full Speed Ahead on the next console generation discussion question is
thinking ahead and demanding backwards compatibility the only way to ensure the survival of our our favorite game what an absolute Chad I don't know Sarah Bond but I like her already super super cool this is very very important know it's not the only way to ensure the survival of games um but but it's better than nothing which is what we have right now and I think taking a you know Forward Thinking approach to it is just very wise um because trying to do it after the fact can be really messy it can be
impossible some cases Source code's just lost and stuff assets are just lost they're scattered yeah it can be really wacky so doing it up up front is is really good what is this topic are we covering this topic I mean I thought it was pretty interesting I don't know anything about it AI doesn't understand interracial love is okay but this is this is meta specific is that correct multiple AI image generators seem to struggle to understand prompts asking for mixed race couples especially Asian
men with white women according to a report by The Verge this was first discovered with Instagram's image generator which would almost always create two people of the same race when asked for an interracial couple after this was widely reported meta appears to have blocked prompts with keywords like Asian man though this was quietly reversed after The Verge asked them about it the Verge then replicated these results with Dolly 3 and mid Journey for all three generators it was possible to
create an image of a white man with an Asian woman or a black man with a white woman though this was inconsistent and seem to depend on the phrasing black man and white girlfriend wouldn't work but white woman and black boyfriend would when asked for an Asian man with a white wife Dolly 3 and mid Journey repeatedly created an Asian man next to an Asian featured woman with blonde hair and at least once a black man with a white woman in Asian looking clothing Virg's team was only able to get a
straightforward image of an Asian man and white woman couple by using the prompt Asian men and white woman standing in a yard academic setting while the attempted to test Gemini's image generator Google still hasn't reinstated its ability to create images with human subjects which was removed back in February following the racially diverse 1940s German soldiers episode which we talked about on a previous W show the feature was supposed to return in March but it's still not available at
this time so we've got some images for this this is absolutely mindbending uh so this is Asian man and Caucasian woman couple oh yeah Asian man with Caucasian wife huh okay sure uh what else we got here I think these these Asian woman with white husband uhhuh uh-huh it seems to depend on phrasing and specific keywords cuz these were you  interesting uh here's Dolly and mid Journey fusing Asian white features can you make me a photo of an Asian man in a white woman um maybe kind of sort
of uh what are the prompts for this one I cuz these look like it might have worked for some reason platonic seems to work fine check this out and the keyword academic this is weird is that weird I wonder why well I mean it's it's how these things are trained I mean statistically speaking it has no trouble generating the most common mixed race couples but seems to just completely completely fall on its face when trying to generate something that it hasn't seen so how would that explain the uh whatever it was
uh black man with white girlfriend or and white girlfriend with black boyfriend or whatever it was so that was just a wording reverse it seems to me that instead of and and look I don't I don't work in AI development I don't know how the black box works all I can do is look at the output and take a guess as to what's inside it it seems to me that they are somewhat at least to a degree dependent on the entire image of their sources if that makes sense as opposed to being able to use the entire image of
a whole bunch of white women so you think that's why there would be feature blending as well I think that's why there would be feature blending I think that's why it would struggle to create an image that it doesn't have a fullframe reference for yeah that seems like that's something that's very solvable to be honest if that's the case well I mean it's honestly only been like a little while I know it's can they're definitely going fast enough I think the you would think is a we could we leave
we can leave him alone uh ai ai is progressing quite quickly already um but yeah I don't know that's it's an interesting problem but I think it's definitely a solvable problem which is good yeah definitely it doesn't seem it's not like hallucinating fingers or doing anything like that it's just well I mean I'm sure it also is actually strategically check this out this is great all the hands are gone I didn't think about that that's funny hold on there's do any of these photos have hands yes
the uh The Meta AI ones yeah that's not too bad uh yeah anyway yep I don't I don't know I just thought it was pretty funny because AI is funny yeah uh Android air tags are finally on their way Google's rolling out a major update and expansion to the find my device Network which includes Bluetooth proximity tracking and compatibility with thirdparty Bluetooth trackers so this is Android's answer to Apple's air tags it also has an unknown tracker alert feature which tells tells user when a tells users when
a suspicious tracker appears to be following them uh this update was supposed to come out last year but was delayed by the effort to make the unknown tracker alert feature cross compatible with Apple Air tags Google apparently completed the work on their end in around a month but Apple delayed at first waiting on a production implementation of the specification for unwanted tracking alerts which became available in December of 2023 um and then I guess they just took a while to get to it uh the FCC is also
rolling out Broadband nutrition labels this week the Broadband consumer labels rule came into effect which require isps to prominently display standardized information labels designed to look like nutrition labels on food whenever our customer is signing up for a plan I actually think the design is phenomenally stupid but the idea behind it that you can see what the name of the plan is the length of the contract the typical download and upload speeds latency and link to potential bundle and
discount options is a really good thing they must list the online month or they must list the monthly price whether that is an introductory rate how long it will last and any additional fees whether one time or monthly and they must include data caps and charges for exceeding them as well as links to their Network management and privacy policies this is pretty cool this is an example of good um regulation in my opinion they're not actually making anybody do anything this is very much open market all
they're requiring is that they communicate in a straightforward manner to potential customers so they can make an informed Choice which is how an open market needs to work very cool and you know what else is cool it's after dark time nice so am I reading you things then I don't know you can read yourself things  actually um give me a second would you would you just read out loud to yourself you read read out loud to someone else I don't know where I'm going with this uh
anyways why can't I there we go Mr lrer I read out loud to myself all the time oh oh we didn't do the HP suit for alleged printer in Monopoly again well I just broadcasted a merch message so all right well then I will let do this one and then go back to it I'll mark this as something we'll we'll touch on next week all right sounds good uh hello lldd how can I uh get access to my family the importance of how can I get across the my brain is fun sometimes how can I get across to my family the
importance of cyber security and protecting their data on the internet um  can can I say that word I don't know the what some uh Late Night Show comedian host guy John Oliver yeah maybe I don't know John Oliver is abrasive it might not have been him I think he's funny but he's he's he's a a loud assertive personality um which one is he the one that got the the 911 veterans their their lung cancer or whatever it was money because if so he's it sounds like the kind of Chat thing that John
Oliver would do but I'm not I'm not sure if that was him that's pretty sick one one of those guys did a did a thing where to to convince people that was John Stewart okay cool yeah he only recently returned to TV actually he or to to his to his show um sorry I'm listening you been fun to talk to you tonight um I've been all over the place today I'm tired it's Friday it's okay we we played tape to tape pretty late um what was I going to say yeah one of them did a thing where they were like would
you actually want uh man what was it it was something about like data privacy and companies being able to see your files and stuff like that and it was like do you want all your pictures of your thing being shared with companies and it's the same kind of sit situation like maybe maybe come up with something that would be horrible for to lose or something that would be horrible for someone else to be able to have access to and like is it worth risking this thing because this happens
and then give some examples of of uh data loss that have happened because it's totally a thing you can also put together practical demos like generate a little you know generate a little clip of a um of a political figure they admire doing something abhorent and be like hey this is how easy it is to to to be fooled you should really pay atten that's the question but that is a very good idea I was going somewhere with this you need to pay careful attention to you know what the actual from field
says in an email because there's a lot of really important there's a lot of misinformation out there and if you are not constantly Vigilant uh and the reason I brought this up is because my aunt actually showed me some of the emails that I sent her that she's she's smart enough to not click anything in because they're suspicious but she didn't understand how an email could say from L of Sebastian and not be from me and really good on her to not click that is this is a huge problem that I see in
Apple's default mail client it doesn't show the email address by default and it's not even obvious where to click there's no hyperlink you just have to touch the name and it expands and it shows it's from like XJ FMB at some some gibberish domain.com um and so just even the fact that it knows that sending her an email from Lina Sebastian makes her more likely to click on it is information that has been gathered about her so the more you can do to put together practical demonstrations of how a lapse in cyber
security a lapse in vigilance can result in devastating consequences I would say the better yeah yeah good call um chat says it was the John Oliver data broker story and it was incredible says Maddie L yeah yeah it's been a while so I didn't remember but yeah anyways um next up what did you guys look for oh sorry what did you guys look at when picking your shirt printer for the quality you were looking for want to get some images printed on the blank te's but want to know what to look for um so you're
looking at the elasticity of the ink when it's dried you want it to be thick enough that you don't really see the texture of the shirt too clearly but you don't want it to be so that it'll be prone to cracking uh using high quality inks um but that's something you're only going to know if you're talking to someone with experience um how yeah how can you tell like if you were picking a shirt printer would they give you like sample shirts from from like cuz this person it sounds like they're doing very
low run maybe one or two then that's tough you just have they just have any on hand yeah previous work yeah okay but that won't tell you how it's going to look after 10 or 20 washes so your mileage may vary that's fair all right  hey lld curious to know what you think about the freshwater situation in BC I want to relocate there in the near future but I'm worried about the potential Co crisis from drinking water to electricity yeah um the lack of like glaciers anymore thing is going to be a
big problem for Canada cost of Liv increases like we can have we can have all the water in the world um but if we only have it for 9 months out of the Year we're still all going to die in that 3 months that we don't have any water yeah kind of neat and we don't have a lot like BC lacks a lot of infrastructure to um I don't know what term you would use this artificially manually something to to to manage our water yeah because we're like ah I just have so it's just always there yeah we
don't need to do anything and then suddenly it's not really there anymore so we need to kind of retrofit our Province to be able to retain water better which is a little wacky um but luckily there is a lot of tech already out there in regards to cost of living crisis um maybe don't move to BC got him I don't know what to tell you but it's just I think you do know what to tell them it's rough here I think you just told them that's fair I did um I mean I'm not going to leave but
it can be challenging if if you if there's some like great opportunity or something like obviously yeah come here it's it's it's a great P place to live in regards to like the nature that you're in and and all that type of stuff but it can get viciously expensive this is great pit boy says doesn't have anything to do with glaciers drinking water is snow on mountains this year there wasn't much where do you think glaciers come from from Mommy and Daddy glaciers sorry I'm I'm not meaning I'm
not meaning the te but um snow pack becomes glaciers glaciers are started as snow um so yes they are the things that you said are are one and the same broadcasting again what's up boys will there ever come a day when w show doesn't make sense to make weekly or say the CEO says no more when from a  standpoint no when forever got him um next one hey dlll what do you think about achievement hunting in games is it ridiculous to go back and do all the little things just to achieve 100%
completion are you just trying to get different answers from the two of us because I think we feel very differently about this I uh I don't get I I just don't get the dopamine hit from an achievement anymore I just don't care um for me I uh I I think it's it's just that I I no longer have the energy and attention to to to grind at something if I'm not having fun I will only yeah yeah think for me it's it's like I actually I think I only have two games on Steam ever that
I have 100% completed which I don't know if that'll surprise you or not um Assassin's Creed hold on hold on hold on hold on Black Flag no wait that's not on Steam yeah no BS okay FTL is that one yeah yeah okay hold on you should know the other one I am thinking get it I believe I'm thinking slay the Spire yeah man I'm um and is it is it like is our relationship no fun anymore is there any mystery left now that we can just I think it's still fun um I I think I think we do sometimes need like
outside things though we like some new thing to talk about cuz it's like oh my goodness there's there's too much I I don't remember what it was the um what video is that the guessing computer prices video yeah there's a bunch of comments where it's like all's just they just like know what the other one's doing all the time like yeah you get used to it um funny thing is we don't actually we will sometimes go six months in a row without really interacting outside of wow for real though yeah very
rarely that long but regularly we will go a month without interacting outside of wow and there have been periods where it was that long yeah 100% yeah I don't know it's just a thing but um yeah I don't for me it's like if I really like a game but I'm starting to lose interest but I like want to be interested in it still it gives me another it's like an alternative gameplay mechanic almost but I almost feel like they've gotten too hard to account for the no lifes that are going to do it anyway like what I'm
going to go find every stupid Coro in breath of the wild like I hate that type of stuff though like I just I no the slay the Spire ones I liked a lot and the FTL ones I liked a lot because it made you play in like a weird way okay like are they figure out it's just a tedious walk the entire map pixel by pixel grind I just don't really I don't really think I can do that uh Assassin's Creed I actually hate the achievements for Assassin's Creed for the most part you you 100% one of them uh I 100% the the
synchronization which was like basically perfect execution of every Mission which was not 100% of the achievements oh okay because Assassin's Creed like Assassin's Creed 1 had horrible achievements that were based around like there's I don't know these like glowing feathers there's like a thousand of them go find them all it's like dude I don't care at all this doesn't this doesn't introduce a new way of playing the game this doesn't change anything it's just wander a lot um yeah
I don't know like there's other games to play I think that's a big part of it is now that there's other games to play and so so so so so many um wandering around just for the sake of getting a little you know thing that pops up in the bottom of the screen I'm sorry I just can't be motivated for it I did get a little bit more into achievements in general during a kind of lull there near the kind of beginning of covid midco area where games were just trash CU I was like well I'm going to do something
on my computer so I guess this thing I don't know I'll go get that but in general I don't like playing that way um okay moving on what was the worst SL most chaos inducing deal lonus ever made during a Wan show oh the one where I bought a  GameStop yeah okay good call all right next hold on and are there things he has been banned from offering such as the time he gave in international free shipping um H banned from offering I mean I've been I've been told not to leak products
on wano anymore I think that's fairly banned any any lonus ban is um a guideline more than anything anyway cuz like it's it's daring me to do it again yeah kind of I don't know man I look if I can't do this for fun why would I even do this like I've talked about this before like I don't have to so like let's have some fun Tech is this this is supposed to be fun if it's not fun then let's stop you know like no man just you know we got to we got to do our thing we got to do things yeah you to
play some super checks after this yeah yeah let's do it dude I'm going to have a hard time I'm so sore and I'm I'm I I don't know what's going on something I like thought this bottle was falling for a second so I went to go catch it and it wasn't falling and I'm having really hard time with the dyslexia with reading stuff I think I might be tired yeah how's how's I think I'm buffering because I'm going to lose so bad so I'm trying to be like ah there's a lot of things going on yeah how's being old and
not being able to stay up late anymore yeah it kind of sucks a lot yeah I know right uh hi lldd my recent project has me uh upgrade my has had me upgrade my Home Server there it goes uh I was wondering why are the USB 3.2 Gen 2 adapters for 10 gig ethernet not ubiquitous my motherboard has puny 1 gig card which is my bottleneck now because uh did you say 10 gig 10 gig chipsets are still expensive yeah and it's yeah cuz either you're going to have to have so so okay so you either have to
have wider uh you either have to have more Lanes on the highway right so then you would need more conductors or you have to have faster signaling and since  in ex 30 years I was going to say I don't think I like have known not existing yeah I don't I don't I don't know how many years it's been uh then the signaling has to be faster for the signaling to be faster you're going to have to have more advanced um transmission techniques you're going to have to have faster decoding and
encoding on both ends it's just more complicated and going from 10 megabit to 100 megabit to gigabit was pretty doable going from gigabit to 10 gigabit turns out it was really hard um they're getting a lot cheaper they're getting way cheaper than they used to be but it's not the kind of thing that most consumers are going to be expecting to pay extra for in a stupid little dongle and it's not the kind of thing that most consumers need if you're the kind of person who needs it then you know you
need it and realistically you need it for some kind of professional purpose probably because there's to my knowledge no reasonable average consumer application for 10 gig networking um that you can make your Nas faster that's about the only thing that really Springs to mind and even then most things are going to do on that and the only reason you would need it to be that fast like need it to be that fast is if you have astronomical amounts of data or if you're like video
editing off of the nas or something like that and then we're kind of reaching the  here hey I love your old t-shirts but the new ones have really large neck openings is it just me or are they designed that way uh I didn't know they had large neck openings I didn't know that either they seem like good siiz neck openings to me same to me yeah these aren't them I checked my own real quick like I did too I looked at myself in the picture uh yeah I'm not sure while exoc is mostly about the high
score have you seen it impact the development of new products is amdel NVIDIA paying attention to the wild exoc achievements or is it too left field to matter not going to lie exoc means a what so far we've got Precision xoc that EVGA over clocking software xoc tequila Grill xoc uh lady xoc Amaya Queen consort um exoc Pharmaceuticals I'm sorry but I just actually have no idea what you're talking about right now I'm terribly sorry and I will try better next time um if that's true they probably
don't care um if it's just a benchmark thing it's probably not that big of a deal unless it's reported on really heavily that's one way I would look at it um or or if it's reported on in very important Arenas like if it's an Enterprise thing if some Enterprise blog reports on it or something it might be important um how do you lld I'm an attorney and I've had experiences where opposing Council can't even edit a PDF I know your field is much more Tech oriented but what are some stories with some te deck
people extreme over clocking I guess that's it what I've never seen extreme overclocking maybe I just ignored the acronym oh yeah I've I've never seen it I yeah I okay uh I don't think they care what was the question does this does this dictate design decisions oh no yeah not at all Heavens no there's there's people at these companies that are super into it and love it and think it's super cool and um I think they live in the basement and they do their Stu their science fair experiments
there and that's cool and um other than a like you know if one of the big wigs happens to be in the building and walks by and it's like that's probably about the most acknowledgement that they're going to get um is is the perception that I have and I'm I could be mistaken but I know I really don't think they care yeah um some te Tech deaf people I don't know in my life it's usually fine I mean but I am I am surrounded by tech people in general yeah I'm generally surrounded by by tech people too
um and maybe that's made me more patient in the workplace like there's no way that someone's going to be more of a challenge than you know the first time I tried to buy a computer for my grandpa and took it and like he couldn't wrap his head around horizontal movement translating to Vertical movement on the screen W I was just like oh so we're not going to exchange emails all right yeah there's a certain level um I don't know I honestly don't have a very good example I think most people
have been very understanding and if they are lacking some form of understanding you can usually teach them fairly quickly and it's fine wow buddy Michael R bought two swipe plus P days ous invoice getting his house out heck yeah uh Luke mentioned some time ago that you use a knowledge base for float plane what do you use as your knowledge base stack Overflow team or Confluence or just raw documents uh none of the above we use bookstack um slash there's some stuff you said float plane specifically so I'm
going to stick with bookstack but um we use Peter hi Peter um I was Peter I was wondering why there wasn't a Wan VOD that's kind of funny um this doesn't matter really to other people but I don't know if you know this we rolled out a new transcoding system I did not know this yeah uh it's probably good that you don't because that means it's not going as bad as it could have which is great it's going pretty good there's been some problems but anytime you swap out of a part of a system that's that
big there's going to be some problems I think it's going great so far hi Peter how's it going um anyways yeah we use bookstack uh a lot of the people use Google Docs it's cool that's about it thank you oh one of them just moved I don't know what happened uh I don't know what one is displaying because it jumped right before I clicked the button but hi dll I've been watching since 7th grade 2012 as you've grown and hired a diverse team what has the been the biggest culture shock Zoomers oh okay actually I
actually don't really think so I don't think there's been at all other than slang right like uh I you know you know what's funny is age is actually one of the ways that our company is the least diverse because if you if you look at all your sort of traditional ways that people are different or whatever um the kind of the kind of arbitrary lines that we draw our age spread is we're becoming the old people of the company right and even we are in our mid 30s still yeah I still get to say mid at 37 I think
borderline I think I think that's allowable but yeah it's border 38 no 38 is late 30s almost 38 is almost 40 you know what I'm probably late 30s let's go with late 30s 37 I think you could argue either way yeah but my birthday is coming up so I'm definitely late I changed my mind um yeah so like I'm old  and everyone at this company either grew up connected right because that's one of the big generational gaps right either grew up connected or worked in it or has worked in it
extensively to the point where like so I'm like I'm thinking of Someone Like A Gary or someone like a teren and these guys are lifelong Gamers right like they they are they have been immersed in the culture for enough of their adult lives that functionally I don't really see them is as far as I can tell there's like basically no one on the planet that spends as much as their time doing like it stuff as Shawn does yeah like all these guys are just like they're they're you know they age
is just a number um and and it is so like given that we tend to attract people who have this commonality of being into T and into gaming um the whole like spending time doing it thing I think is a big deal because I I find when you get older you tend to do fewer different things so like what your week might look like might be very similar to the previous week and the next week and you just do the same thing all the time and that kind of results in it feel like time time is going very quickly and if
you don't touch tech for I don't know like like pushing bleeding edge tech for like six seven years and then you're like oh I'm going to hobby get back into this yeah it's probably going to be really weird things will have changed a lot people are wearing goggles now what the heck is going on it's weird um but if you are in it every day then whatever  matter anyways archive that broadcast when. dll great show curious about your thoughts on the YouTube UI change that shoves the
description and comments into a tiny column and spams the rest of the page with endless video recommendations uh yeah I've seen quite a few complaints about it I haven't uh had it served to me yet uh it doesn't surprise me that they're doing this it's all about retention retention retention and for some reason retention doesn't mean uh you know making the comment section better and engaging that way it means watch more video watch more video watch more video um I I think
you know my opinion doesn't matter if you don't like it then you don't like it uh I haven't tried to use it yet uh as someone who tends to kind of ignore anything on a page that isn't the thing that I'm looking for I probably won't notice it that much but I I don't necessarily agree with a lot of the things that YouTube is doing as a platform I wish they'd kind of keep being YouTube but maybe that's just me being a you know late 30 something fdy duddy at this point I can't tell I've
been feeling actually very similar ways when looking at it about the like am I am I the one who is wrong kind of situation cuz I look at I'm like this looks messy and really chaotic but then some people like watching a short that's split in half and there's content on one bit and a gameplay on the other bit it's like so maybe maybe this is what the kids want maybe I'm the one who's wrong I don't know never mind nope they're the one that's wrong screw off anyways um greetings dll from the UK just catching
up I wait till he starts reading and then I curate another one so cool just catching up here I just tried Pia VPN it cut my connection speed from 250 megabits per second to less than 70 megabits per second why does this happen and Vary between VPN providers visiting Calgary soon um what you're doing is no longer going directly to the thing that you're doing it with you're jumping through you're hopping through a a uh network of other servers um so depending on where you're hopping it's going to
affect it you could try selecting different servers on there see what happens but using a VPN is generally not something that you do for Speed yeah it's not for performance and don't forget that there's the encryption element as well so you have to encrypt and decrypt yeah um figures you'd be out of the bottle caps when mine breaks uh oh that makes sense like these yeah we do have a new one coming but it's going to be a little bit are we restocking these at all uh it's that but better oh that's
the new one that's coming but you said it's going to be a bit so like how long do you think we'll be out of stock of these I don't know okay got it that's more of a Nick question he's indisposed that is oh yeah yeah that makes sense I'll settle for a gift for my wife and a question uh what's your top three co-op games from childhood are they the same as today much love man Co-op was far less of a thing back then I mean a super cool one that existed during my childhood but that I didn't play as a
child child was uh Secret of Mana um are you are you not including like teenager as childhood where does childhood end I I would say childhood ends at 11 or 12 11 or 12 okay yeah um yeah Co-op lost Vikings for me okay yeah that's pretty cool yeah lost Vikings and like it it was kind of a weird form of Co-op but uh was it Super Mario Bros you just kind of like took turns out yeah that's cool technically go up those would probably people my I really enjoyed the first Trine I was in my late teens like I was
probably 19 when that came out maybe 20 I don't know but trying super cool yeah uh what else have we got man there's a surprising number of merch messages today what the heck happened it was a pretty light merch message night and then now it's like wild that's when we start doing them uh what games do you wish would be either completely reimagined or remastered I'd love to see the Prince of Persia Trilogy remade I love Warrior within thanks for  I want freelancer there freelancer super cool ooh H
man that TIE fighter like Community rebuild thing was super cool I didn't end up playing it though it was kind of there were some things that were not working for me about it oh that would be that'd be super cool I'd be super into that uh reimagined or REM mastered trying to think back anything like the the Well's kind of been sucked dry for a lot of ips like if it had any Merit whatsoever it's it's been it's been addressed yeah Chrono Trigger is a good one from kakaroto 5045 speaking of sness RPGs
have you even touched Final Fantasy 6 yes but all the gaming I've been doing lately is either with you or it's been making games not playing them but i' I've touched it a little bit it works my computer doesn't crash I haven't gotten much further though cuz I'm trying to like remember where I was so I loaded up and then started like Googling things figure out where where the heck I am and what I'm doing um but I I'll play this weekend for sure um for me there's an obvious answer that you could guess
there's a less obvious answer because I was like I got to find something that isn't morind um I don't want morwin reimagined at all um if they remastered it I would hope that they just make it look better like the Super Mario RPG one where it's basically just yeah we like remade it but modern yeah cuz I don't want to have like a modern Quest log I want the journal to stay the journal that would never happen no I know so it's not going to not going to be a thing um another thing that won't be a
thing but a different answer that you might not expect is Skull and Bones really it just released I don't want to remaster I want to reimagined you did the whole thing wrong just start over yeah trash the whole thing that you have and make the thing that the entire Community asked you for the entire time you pivoted like six times long the way you never needed to it was extremely well communicated what everyone wanted and then you didn't make that um you failed try again please I don't think
they will I don't think they're making any more quadruple games anytime soon but uh yeah there's potentials are we looking through these um Aiden asked are there some upcoming features or tools for your Dev team that excite you does the trans does the new transcoding system count um that's very exciting to me it's really cool it's kubernetes based so it's like in our whole thing uh and it's it's nice and fast cool it did the they're just movies podcast which was really long and it did
it in like I think it was like half an hour or something pretty good and it's that's every version so every resolution that's the the thumbnail thing so you can scrub the video all that type of stuff okay it's cool uh toron a nvidia's new SDR to HDR conversion thing is pretty cool but it only runs on PC so I'd like to see oh man they want Community made up mastering for sdrt hdr on a per movie basis I mean that sounds super cool I don't know if it's entirely realistic but I could see something like
that coming out in the future it would be a colossal effort though I mean but then there are things that have happened that I never thought were possible like the way that you can just download subtitles for things and they're just like they are like Community open- Source subtitles that's that's another sort of incredible Community effort that has taken place over the years that uh it's it's shocking to me sometimes how obscure title can be and just how perfectly and flawlessly it works so shout out you 
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] um Anonymous is participating in a skills Canada provincial robotics competition at the traex in abbottsford next Wednesday and says if anyone wants to come check it out that'd be super cool that would be super cool so there you go that's a thing that's happening next Wednesday nice um Anonymous says hello L 2D2 uh what processes and tools do you use internally for product development safe jira I'm a QA lead and we often have to balance getting things done and 
process maybe a short answer for this one because we got to get upstairs at some point I'm trying to think of a shorter answer uh a lot of different teams around the company use their own things I'll say that largely it's it's not like super scrum like individual small units of people use their own things but it's usually like uh what I would Define as a developmental unit within the company so like Labs uses their own thing flow play uses their own thing cre a warehouse uses their own
thing and it's it's good it works okay there's that one I work for an LMS for online classes and we're looking for a video streaming platform for our video content preferably self-hosted free open source but what  service on the business side we just haven't been motivated to develop and promote it and build a business case for it I think this is this is a a case of marketing and sales dropping the ball and vision dropping the ball and not the product not being good the product is great we
just uh flow plane has a service partially the like part of the code exists we didn't like delete it we were working on it for a while um we just started prioritizing other things yeah just like we're prioritizing getting to the Afterparty you're going to play some super checks we'll see you float plane peeps over there and uh oh how do we end the show I don't know how to end the show oh here comes Dan I can hear him running that was really funny actually that's hilarious I don't know how to end the
show all right well we'll see you again next week same bad time same bad Channel someone in flow plane chat said I can tell it's late because Luke is speaking fast is that a thing hold on you got to say the thing   you did it that's what you get for trying to improve your
