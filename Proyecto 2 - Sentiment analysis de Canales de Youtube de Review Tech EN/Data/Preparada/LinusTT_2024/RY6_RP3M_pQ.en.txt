Matthew from Creator Warehouse was asked to describe his job and said I design clothes and make lonus look cool well gosh darn it Matthew now it's my turn with some help from AMD we're going to be providing the usual "$5,000 budget to upgrade your computer" your girlfriend's computer your VR headset and your wait your sewing machine you're really just going to come home and make more clothes in your spare time pretty much well same D money I guess  being from the fashion team Matthew
probably hasn't lifted as much Tech stuff from the office but I wouldn't be surprised if I found at least a handful of prototype merch is that a laptop sleeve unreleased laptop sleeve coming soon to LTT store.com you know Shilling for it doesn't mean that you've actually paid for it um yes I also found a puzzle this isn't prototype but almost certainly stolen yep I see you stole my corner of doors people make fun of my door corner or as I call it my dork Corner pasta exposed I don't get
it yeah truthfully things are just pretty clean I don't think you've actually stolen anything everyone has something how' you get him out of the office over my shoulder he just threw me in the van before this gets any more Awkward let's just get the upgrade started shall we Mr Elijah Gorbachev tear down this wall and let's get this 3D printer extracted how are these handles they're not they're rock climber handles W oh it's a it's a dining table but it's good as like a fabric pattern cutting
table what makes the table good for fabric cutting uh big cuz you usually have rolls of fabric so lot of space flat maybe flat flat is good uh optimal height because unlike Ln I'm actually tall so I actually just got one of these recently myself I've been super happy with it my kids are having a blast they treat it like our own personal Toy Factory and Matthew actually got the same thing as me he got their AMS which allows you to print in multiple filaments on the same job so you can
have up to I think it's four different colors with one AMS of course before set up any ams's we're going to have to find them oh that's clever that's why it was so heavy it's inside and I don't know how to get it  it look at this dust on here if only there was some way to clean it with my microfiber shirt how did this turn into a real product you asked for it l like yo let's make a microfiber shirt and then we're like I bet are we going to sell those yeah it's a real product
here hold on uh can you do that again but let me clean the lens first okay go ahead we just want to get the clearest 4K Elijah hitting himself oh you don't have to hit yourself that hard you told me you want to oh oh wow two screws there you go here you go pull up oh scared uh we should plug it in really yeah the instruction says to remove the foam how many times I got to throw those instructions away does this just rest on top yeah uh actually it rests anywhere because you
can have up to four of these don't sit don't sit on oh my God there's only one leg on this side okay wait wait I'm not that heavy I don't know man have you seen that cake she you know how hard it to make pants for lonus I got to put an extra dumpy on it he has like King Kardashian silhouette small waist huge hips that's why we we've never come out with any decent fitting pants cuz this man it's built different this is why we never let the fashion team on camera in response to your question though it
doesn't really go on top there's a glass top that you could you can put it on top but then it's hard to remove the top and because you can have up to four of them obviously they wouldn't all fit on top so they can kind of go anywhere on top now Matthew I understand that you got like a hardened extruder or something like that so you can work with harder materials now why do you need to use hardened materials what are you making I do want to play around with like TPU I guess make like my own
shoes you can print shoes yeah huh that's cool I do this also like 3D printed the souls for some of those shoes as well you can't 3D print a soul Only God Can Make a soul Amen brother Harden stainless steel paper pack oh I was going to say paper packaging Kudos immediately followed up with the plastic  bamboo never mind I take away all points they claim a 15-minute setup but that's probably with one competent person not three people trying to appear on camera so and it's probably someone who
actually read the manual I'm trying minus keeps taking it from me now might be a perfect time to explain to Colin what he needs to do with this keyboard and then hope that he understands what you're talking about keyboard parts  together yeah okay I think he understands what else can we do while we wait for him to get his stuff together these are the novelty key caps for the um DUS dusk set from osum osumi some of them really don't seem that novelty that's just an Enter key this has a
little smiley face but that's just an Enter key and there it is the upgraded hot end is in I've got everything all cable managed now all I got to do is put the front cover and the band connector in place and we're good to go woo this is like calibrating now yeah why don't we move on to our next thing what about a computer upgrade Matthew sure let's go grab it oh well if I'd gone into the bedroom I might have found far more stolen Tech stuff we're upgrading this to a new case oh you I
think actually haven't stolen anything yeah it's kind of hard to steal something when you're working in the fashion team cuz you grab like boxes of video cards and you're just like what do you that for wait wait is the power play mat even available in Canada Christmas party got him where's your LTT store desk pad um don't have one we talked about the guy only wearing black look at look at this one there's some color yeah there was there's one color thing the plan is to
swap my girlfriend's PC oh wow I thought you were going somewhere else entirely with that yeah part of my upgrade I got a new girlfriend she's like AI she's a model you know the plan for the PC sounds great we move your girlfriend's system into your case we move your system into the new case ah yes very cool that looks extremely sexy but I can't be the only one wondering how exactly you got away with doing an AMD ultimate Tech upgrade without buying anything from AMD there aren't even any
computer parts here other than a couple of fans well here's the thing since Matthew already had excellent taste he's running ryzen 3000 Series in both of these systems he didn't really need to upgrade either of these CPUs I mean this is 16 core processor so what he really needed was to game better on the go which gets us to steam deck OLED what are you planning to play on this starre Valley okay not the most demanding thing but great if you want to get a lot of battery life
out of it and what's really exciting is we have a giveaway for those of you watching for three of these and I'm going to have the full details for you now all you have to do to get your hands on one of these bad boys is follow the link in the description the steam deck OLED features many up upgrades over the original with Wi-Fi 6E faster memory speeds improved battery life and of "course the 90 HZ 1,000 nit Peak" brightness OLED screen that is just amazing thanks AMD for continuing to
sponsor the series and giving you guys a chance to win some cool AMD Tech back to the video while Matthew and I work on tearing down these systems Elijah do you want to upgrade his security with a Schlage and code plus you're going to trust me to install your lock we're trying to find out what you're good at it's not coming out if you were actually a good handyman you'd be able to get it out stop I just want to make lus proud and I'm overwhelmed check out this this retrofit power supply is that zip tide
in place yeah it's stupid and it works it's not stupid yeah it works I took his old dead bolt out it doesn't have like the plate cut out for the new one and so I'm worried that that once we put it in there it will get in the way yes yes it will oh wait if we close it harder it won't good enough for me oh god let's see how many extra holes he puts in the door false alarm it comes with an adapter do you go out of your way to have sand bankman freed hair I just cut it twice a year Checkmate oh Checkmate
oh God yes I feel like I'm witnessing something I shouldn't be uh so right now we're feeding the filament through this thing here all you got to do is you push this like this and then you put it in and then it grabs it so now we're going to print the 3D Beni that's already pre-loaded onto the SD card that came with the printer I just realized I put it the wrong way on so this would have been on the outside I have a door stopper do you need a door stopper oh my God yes I've been trying to fight
holding this oh it's a little person yeah it's a little person oh it's like L of size yeah I did it no you didn't that is not straight at all wait it's fine isn't it does it bother you yes because in the picture it's straight it's good enough it's not my house but it's my house yeah that's fine I set the code now my neighbors and the internet knows come dox me so now I can just use my phone to tap  got him oh look at it it's a little boat oh my goodness I think it definitely needs some calibration or wrong
filament yep that's pretty quite indeed let's try a filament that hasn't been sitting out for months that was a really quick and simple transplant uh I think this is actually that side   oh no oh my finger thanks for nothing dad surprise got you a new case familiar it fits better on your table that is a cool looking case what is this uh Nano Qs from Thor Zone this is actually the pre-production unit that Adam opened on short circuit they've apparently addressed all the issues that Adam had
with that in that unboxing but not for Matthew no Matthew gets pre-production cuz that one's not coming out for another couple months or something Matt sent me a bunch of lists of the things that they fixed that they addressed feels like there should be a slider  up man is this a computer case or a puzzle box what the heck did we cut it out we just cut it out okay that's what you get I'm actually returning this one for the actual production model why didn't you say something before I
trash the package you did it so quick I I didn't get a chance to stop you and that's why I have three kids hey there bud how's it going wow good job wow and it works nice okay in go in what CPU did you have again I know we said ryzen 9 3950x because he's a baller apparently that's 16 cores right get that 16 cores woo what do you even need 16 cores for Matthew um watching YouTube you can everyone's going to hate that shopping browsing it's not it's not getting better stop also you might want
to grab a lint roller I don't know what you did oh that's far from the PC case oh okay you just have a lint roller like right there did you see how long it took him to produce a lint roller okay um I need a a pair of scissors uh it's next to Colin I need a drill a drill oh right here shut up how do you have everything in Arms Reach at a small apartment Matthew I feel very strongly that this choice of case was not very good good thing I'm  it wow that looks great good job Colin knock knock
ooh it's quite heavy wow it'll match my other keyboard she already had one this one sounds like this but this one by chill key sounds like you have these goie wall lights where are you wanting these in my room behind my my monitor yeah I want to do like a the base here and then a little L shape like that are you wanting me to do this I was wanting Colin to do it but then I watched previous upgrades where he damaged people's walls so how did you manage that Colin maybe I should do
it I figured it out those two screws in the screw pack those are for the pcie Riser which means that those two different length screws that were sitting on the table from disassembly did come from these bars but probably weren't intended to be two different lengths that's why they were throwing me for a loop cuz they're both going to the same place so I need to figure out where in the case whoever put it back together last time put the other long one maybe I don't care I think that's the answer I'm
going to put the two different length screws in here now that I'm almost done I love the look I'm kind of forgiving them a little bit but it is a bit tough to wrap your brain around if you've never used the case before okay wait but this is cool there's these screws here and you can slide the whole internal assembly over one way or the other depending on if you want a bigger cooler on your CP puu or if you have a thicker GPU that's very cool definitely some good ideas in here I installed or here
sits perfectly above my monitor and gives me more light than this room has also desk pad that matches the key the key cap set that doesn't look like it fits uh I think this goes on that so put that down oh wow you're a good something sort of dangerous to uh deliver those sick Burns while you're not able to put a case on a computer what am I good at fine you do it yeah you do it let's find out all right that's right stop you are mangling am I you're making me look good look at this a man
I'm sorry Matthew it wouldn't be an AMD  something I got this in the bag oh oh there you go yeah oh yes yes buddy oh crap what what you've got to be kidding me guess who's not getting a fan this guy this guy yay that's okay sure is ah okay let's see if it works huh yeah let's power it on yeah if it works it sits oh crap hey remember how you said that SATA drive was just for backup yep cool please tell me that you're not going to put this little dust magnet on the floor oh no I'm planning to keep it
on the desk okay I mean that looks pretty good yeah I'm wearing a belt so my plumber ass crack isn't showing be grateful for that that's why our pants when they finally arrive from LTT store.com will thoughtfully not show Plumber Crack see look at this I'm all the way whatever pants you have where belt those lights look good too bad about the brand name if I was coming up with a brand name I'd  lights that's a fair shot you uh plugged it in right yep it's running oh it is
wow that's um pretty quiet that's what happens when you don't put fans in okay now we're at the point where we're going to upgrade your sewing machine I mean it kind of looks like it needs an upgrade it's uh but the old ones are like better or something right uh yeah usually the more industrial ones are much better than like the domestic ones you might find at like Walmart or like Michaels oh so this isn't old it's just industrial yes industrial wow all metal housing and
everything okay so this is a industrial machine from site I picked this one because it's portable portable it's still heavy wow you seem to be good gravy it's nice cuz I can like when I'm done with it I can just tuck it under the desk or something so it's not like just sitting there as opposed to like other industrial machines you need a table for it CU it has an actual server motor motor attached to the table this is more flexible I can be one yeah belt driven the only problem I have with it
it's quite loud okay let's hear and it's quite fast as well oh wow she just she's off and then she's going yeah with this upgraded motor um we'll be able to have a speed controller oh so I can basically press it all the way and it'll go nice and slow at a reason I don't do this all day every day exactly I'm not as expert at this what do you SE I want to make clothes even though I design clothes I in my notes it says you want to get into cosplay why are you avoiding oh yes I
also wanted to do some cosplay as well okay what do you want to cosplay um is cloud Moody enough for you I mean he has like a little bit of color in his outfit so that might not work so you thinking Dante I was thinking more like uh Nicholas D wolfwood from Trigun so you'll be adding no color to your wardrobe then let's get the motor in there goodness that's heavy you don't even need this workout stuff Matthew just move your sewing machine around they know that you don't need equipment
for calisthenics right um no but there are some things you can get that can help they're just blocks these handles can attach here so you can use them as yoga blocks or like stretching blocks and then you can also use them as like parallettes so so what you just you do your push-up like this and so you can go lower yeah it's better on on your wrist so that instead of being flat down like this for me it puts a lot of strain here the kids today man when they taught us to do push-ups and my Marshal ours class
we do them like this see that's what I should be doing I can't do more than two on a hard floor wait have we even talked about the pants that I'm wearing that you were I think the main designer on right yes yeah so these are our cargo pants yeah designed to fit as many screwdrivers as you could possibly need to hold as long as it's two so many pockets some of them kind of us but we're kind of into that if you find a purpose for it it's there by the way I used the hammer Loop which
was a very contentious uh addition to them just this last weekend on Mother's Day to install uh automatic uh drip waterers for yvon's hanging baskets that we made for her for mother's day so I appreciate you leaving that on uh zipper pockets on the backs coming soon ldt store.com oh magnetic flaps dying he's so warm you could call him  fried do you want to guess what they're for they're for hanging yes okay oh thanks AMD this is a quarter horsepower motor sir for the torque
a and your issue with the old one was it was too fast but I guess we have like a gearing system now Too Fast Too Furious yeah so it comes with a has a speed controller so you can okay and did you make your own Supreme sticker for it or did it come with that on it no I made that did you have to configure the different hotend you installed I'm not sure okay I wonder if that's it do you want to fire up the app I legitimately  before yeah we didn't configure that we changed the hot end got it so it's
probably extruding too much still or something I don't know cuz we went to a smaller diameter we cut it we cut it in half I didn't know we changed the diameter here we go you ordered 2 and4 in hardened steel uh 0 2 only came in stainless so that is your 2 stainless so that would explain the Extrusion issues I didn't know that we had different diameters on order here okay so do you want your point4 hardened one cuz I can put that in uh if there's time to install sure but if not I can do it I'll
put it in while you fix your sewing machine how you guys doing on cable management in there we're all done H solving Mysteries we're like Scooby and the Gang can you make a Scooby-Doo noise yeah that figures okay well Colin I definitely have a couple of notes um we should really be using the the cable tie one right here not just the giant Arch otherwise this looks what the oh you jeez just rolled on to all right for those of you who are wondering what happens if you don't
configure your nozzle size correctly looks a little something like that Holy it's like a golf ball that dimples you know aerodynamics through the water yeah yeah I think you mean hydrodynamics but sure oh it's water that looks awesome though time for her maiden voyage here we go yeah it's doing donuts put it in the deepend H you're hitting the ground I think you need more water there you go stop so now put low nice nice nice and it's quieter but you can still have yeah woo could still have that speed if you
it now for the items that hoovered up actually most of the budget do you want to tell us about your camera oh yeah so I wanted to start doing like content creation fashion cosplay all that stuff yeah okay and remember kids if you want to get into content creation the first thing you need to do is buy a really expensive camera JK that's a really bad idea start with a webcam or start with your phone unless AMD happens to give you a whole bunch of money so what did  fx30 okay you know this is ludicrous
Overkill right this is like when David  webcam oh yeah this you can also use a webcam as well I know you can use it as a I'll do streaming Pop Quiz how do you turn it on hey Google turn on and then let's talk about you picked up a meta Quest 3 then I added some customizations oh googly guys not even better oh oh look at me I'm the tech tip man now I wanted to get a VR headset because I wanted to play around with gravity sketch you can draw like in 3D so right now I'm drawing the hello wow so I drew
hello and it's like wow like you want to try beat saber yeah I'll try beat saer wait wait is this how stupid I look when I'm playing this yes I'm done sir that is more like what I expected to see nice we should do like sandpaper shirt he has lots of good ideas too that's pretty great though yeah it looks way better than the the first one yeah and the second one perfect this outro to the AMD ultimate Tech upgrade Matthew Lou Edition is shot on his very own fx30 this is the very
first clip that you're recording on this extremely over I can't believe you've went with this this upgrade had a little bit of everything guys computer upgrades camera upgrades 3D printing upgrades and sewing machine upgrades I hope you guys enjoyed it massive shout out to you for watching why am I talking to that camera no no it's this camera I thought was to talk this camera yeah and massive shout out AMD for sponsoring AMD ultimate Tech upgrade guys if you want to get a chance
to win a steam deck OLED check out the details at the link down below if you guys enjoyed this video you might enjoy Matthew's first appearance in I will never financially recover from this the tour of Creator Warehouse another awkward appearance for me no you did great thank you
