CRT tube TVs have been Irrelevant for so long that I have people working for me who have never used one but in a lot of ways they are still number one I mean look at this little buddy right here zero latency Stellar motion Clarity and Inky blacks not only that but look at the way its unique properties blend blocky ugly Sprites into art take a mere 256 colors and turn them into a digital rainbow just sucks they come in such giant heavy package the wait a minute that's not a
CRT this is just an OLED in disguise really convincing though what dark magic is this retro tank 4K dark magic Hey look it's that guy this is admittedly a pretty Niche product but I don't think I care if it gets views it's really cool or at least on paper it is they claim it's the best and most versatile retro video game scaler to ever hit the market and after using it for a few weeks we're left wondering is it finally time to stop hoarding these bad boys and stop hoarding all these messages we could
give you from our sponsor build Redux they make it a breeze to customize your own personalized build with support guides and a bunch of configuration options just throw stuff in there put a power supply in there ah head to build build ru.com Linus and start your new build today you may already know that a scaler scales one input resolution to a different usually higher output resolution but like with anything not all scalers are created equal and this is most apparent when you watch your
modern TV struggle with older content like the approximately 240 P that is coming out of this Sega Genesis and I mean I kind of get it why would TV manufacturers bother to invest in a feature that most people won't notice but come on guys to show you just how bad it is let's have a look at how a "$1,300 OLED TV fares using its internal" scaler against a random CRT that we got for 50 bucks on Facebook Marketplace hey finally get a report yeah yeah okay we're good look at his face like that
looks like a picture almost like a TV feed from that era whereas that's just like a mess of reddishness why did we leave that one stretched it's uh you don't have much options when you use Little Boxes like this that's why you were going off on this when we saw this during Adam's upgrade that one no this entire video is just a slam dunk on this something you wouldn't expect the scaler to affect based on its name is the color representation but it is amazing knowing that these are accurate
displays how far off they are I mean the ice is green yeah Brandon's even even calibrated these two so we can trust that they're exactly right I don't notice any issues with input latency on the CRT obviously it's lightning fast but there's definitely a bit of leg on this top left one oh yeah we're going to swap the direct one to a retro tank ooh oh wow I didn't realize how bad the latency was on here because I just kind of compensated for it I think and then all of a sudden it's
playable now the color is not matching our CRT at all it's very hard to match the CRT on every game we can mess with it and that's one of the joys of the retrotink is that you can Tink with it all day long there is so many settings that we can get into uh including color correction and stuff whatever deficiencies or even just differences that it might have in color though there is no question in my mind that it is a super clean image and yet it still looks CRT this is just a quick and dirty mask
and filter that I've set up for this the Genesis uh this is also kind of the worst case scenario for the Retro tank Mike Chi the creator of retro tank likes composite image and there's kind of like a a Mystique to the blurriness of composite but as a general rule everything else is better and so the fact that it can make this look as decent as it does is kind of incredible you got to get a a goal man I I don't think I can I don't think I could score tying this game otherwise we
Riot no no no oh they cut it cut cut it's impossible to get everyone to agree on what looks best but I think what we can all agree on is that both of the larger oleds looked awful and they feel awful we measured about 45 milliseconds of added input latency when connecting a composite Source directly to the TV or through that little piece of crap scaler for context the highest input latency that we measured from the rest of the scalers that we're going to be talking about and showing today is one of that
there are a surprising number of options out there and many of them are excellent but they have always had their compromises like no support for 4K so the retrotink 4k's claim to fame is surprise surprise it's the world's first 4K scaler for retro games in our opinion that's not even the best thing about it power a cyclone 5 series fpga the Retro tank 4K has cuttingedge CRT phosphor emulation filters imperceptible processing delay and it has some of the most robust io on a single consumer
device that we have ever seen it's powered by USBC which is really nice it's got scar RCA and a brand new VGA port which was missing from the previous Top Dog retrotink 5x and each of these can handle a variety of analog video standards with inexpensive expensive adapters Mike the Creator retro tank even added extra composite and S video to the front which means you don't have to share your RCA jacks between your component and your composite anymore it's got toss link as well as a 3 and
half mm audio jack here which can be assigned to any of your video inputs it's got an HDMI output to go to your TV and what's this an HDMI input now why you might ask would a retro gamer need an HDMI input put well not to make you feel old or anything but the PS3 with its HDMI output came out 17 years ago not only that but we've also seen an increase in HDMI equipped older consoles some of these are coming in the form of mini re-releases some are thirdparty Recreations and some are just
aftermarket mods to original consoles the bottom line here is HDMI is the standard and it unlocks a lot of of new possibilities like pairing up your retro tank with a Mr fpga for the ultimate in Retro Gaming goodness I'm about to try it probably cry a little bit but first I actually want to show off our retro battle station here it might not look like much from this side but this monster is capable of playing any of our systems simultaneously across four TVs without any loss in image quality and a
big part of that is thanks to this guy when we told AV Pro Edge what we were trying to do they sent over this ludicrously overpowered 8K HDR 8 input 8 output HDMI Matrix switcher huge thank you to those guys and I'd love to talk about all the other little pieces that we have going on here but it gets pretty in the weed so instead we're going to have a float plane exclusive where David is going to walk you through the whole setup uh lmg g/f float plane for now let's game this is the part of the video
where if you're anything like me you're going to fall deeply in love with the Retro tank when you have a chance to customize your mass and all the settings to your preference you'll start to see how powerful this thing really is this is how I set it for my own eyes and what I found with people kind of walking around and giving their perspective is people have very different preferences to me this looks so much better than the raw Mister but some people like that Pixel Perfect Look but no right it looks
so much better this has that TV look that looks awesome looks great why would I ever even look at these and you can really see the age of these CRTs and some of the just off highlights like the the red hat yeah I can't even see any of the detail in it but this is clean yeah but also still has that CRT look to it it's a tragedy that CRTs are just gonna kind of fade away and they're going to only get worse and worse uh every time they're used and it's kind of nice to know that
we're finally getting to the point with scalers where we don't have to be sad yeah we don't have to be sad well I mean the fact that you just want to keep playing on this screen like you you don't even look at the CRTs is a good sign no there's no reason to look at them like this is just freaking awesome and what I find is so nice with modern devices is just the consistency I know when I turn it on it's going to be good with that cheap CRT every time I came back to it it would
look different sometimes it would have like scan lines going up sometimes it would be like the capacitors are going right now it's a little flickery it's actually doing pretty good um but it's like the temperature you know the way I look at it it changes what that image is going to look like whereas every time I turn on a retro ttin in this OLED it's going to look exactly how I set it holy I have never gotten all five in my  life no way am I supposed the script is just rolling we're just we're going
completely off script here boys well here's the 4K remote versus the 5x remote so they did a remote this time they did a remote this time it's actually so useful I could just be like n dog how about 1080p well it's actually well that doesn't look great but it's kind of a huge deal when I first got my retro ttin 5x it was defaulting to 1440p but had a TV that didn't accept 1440p image and so it like would come in a one frame every like 3 seconds so this would have saved you just one button
press boom that's just through the mister without the that's just the Mis yeah so it's got that super super clean sharp I mean honestly yeah sure I could play on that too yeah but it doesn't look like a CRT so we don't need to change the input although we could look at it the profile right now it's my like Mr profile that I kind of quickly set um the ones where I would start where it's the most fun is the image processing M so there's a scan line and a mask the scale line it's emulating scal lines but
there's quite a bit of control within it uh The Masks are like that simulation of you know the the aperture Grill and the phosphor lights kind of interacting and then there's a horizontal blur which I think is actually kind of like the the little salt that you add at the end to make it all kind of come together oh yeah otherwise it just looks too sharp and this is why 4K is so important for this because you actually have the pixel density on this display to use pixels as
individual phosphor colors I mean if you look at certain diagrams of how Shadow mask versus aperture Grill worked uh this is basically it it was either a grill a vertical lines like this or it was like a a perforated plate we've had Shadow mask before like even the Mis has Shadow MK but they've never been this detailed because like you said it it we've never had 4K and you need that amount of pixel to be able to push that detail that you would see on a CRT HDR is already on uh we can turn it off just
so you can get an idea how much the Retro ttin is designed for HDR displays when you add the scan lines in the mass it adds a lot of black to the image and so it darkens it a ton and so without HDR becomes really really dark with HDR it pops like a phosphor glowing at the front of a display but without it it's but with the masks you get that it really does look like a phosphor glow I really liked on the 5x that it was kind of just plug andplay I never really thought too much about it I kind of said
it once you know it works but the amount of fun I've had messing around with these settings is insane it's been so fun one thing to mention before someone in the comments does is the mister can do direct video where you get the actual resolution of the game outputed natively we could unplug and plug directly into a retro tank but it won't work with our matrixes it's just not going to play nice direct video generally has bad compatibility this looks like you've got smoothing on yeah
so that's basically what you don't like it that's a yikes I like it I like so there's a more sophisticated one you can get than than this it looks like one of those cheap AI filters that you can apply to graphics and make it look like a photo or painting or whatever it's a little more sophisticated than that but I I definitely understand why people don't like it there's no wrong options here except whatever they except that now I noticed there's an SD card but unlike the Mr fpga this is not a console
so you're not keeping ROMs or anything on there no it's primarily for updating the firmware uh as well as putting profiles on it you can create profiles on the retrotink save them to the card put them on a computer modify them but you can also download a ton online the Retro Community is very active there's already a ton of people working on getting kind of Ideal per console per game settings uh and then you can let them do the work and enjoy the fruits of their labor and I don't have to think
about it yeah exactly or I could think about it a lot you like the retrotink more than even the CRT not even close yeah yeah no question it's so bright uh the colors are so right blur artifacting is a little bit annoying I'm hoping that maybe there can be like some filter that's added onto it to prevent that but most of the time when you're in a busy screen you don't see it I don't notice when I'm actually playing I only notice when I'm watching 100% they carefully kept me away from this area for the last
couple of weeks so I didn't get a chance to check this out before but now that I have there's no question in my mind I would rather play on a modern OLED with these filters than on a CRT even if it was in its prime and literally none of them are anymore adding HDMI to the Retro tank might be the most meaningful upgrade over the 5X resolution matters a lot though too I don't know they're both really great but we haven't even seen its full capabilities let's test that Port even
further with an HDMI console that might not be retro but also isn't really properly modern given it not only can't hit 4K but can barely even do 1080p most of the time the Nintendo switch now hold on a second is it doing some kind of SDR to HDR tone mapping here it's seems to be doing that cuz this is yeah raw out of the switch um but as it is now this looks the that looks right that looks markedly better we can agree you probably don't want to put like scan lines or mass or anything on a game like
this but what I was curious was is the scaling of the Retro tin better than what the switch can do with in conjunction with a TV you can't really tell from this far back it looks basically the same but if you get up close and personal you can actually see that the Retro one will be a little bit sharper you know I don't think I'm a fan you get an increase in sharpness using the Retro tank to scale but you also get a bit more stairs it depends what you're looking at this is one of those ones where I
really don't think there's a right or a wrong answer I totally agree it's going to be a preference thing yeah like this is a bit shimer in it's dealing with alas sing whereas this is a bit blurrier in its dealing with aliasing and neither is desirable obviously it'd be great if nintend just released a console that could run their flipping games at a decent resolution but I find this less distracting I wonder if part of it too is that we're sitting a little bit too close to these for how low res this
content is that's totally and the smaller display with that pleasing blurriness the round pixels guys it makes a big difference makes this look not sharper obviously but more natural yeah like you can see that distant Tower see the aliasing as I'm moving back and forth oh yeah it's still there the CRT it's there but it's not so much less it's not bothersome no you know what I can't say that I actually like the uh that kind of jutter and that super super high motion Clarity at 30 FPS it's not yeah it's a
little distracting that's totally fair that was probably the one slight disappointment of my experience with the Retro ttin is that it doesn't save 720p gaming I thought it was going to maybe like bring it into the Next Generation not quite like obviously that's a little bit excessive but it's more for under 720p yeah I think 40p is a big use case and it does make 720p sharper but I did try gaming on the PS5 through the Retro ttin the retrotink can only handle 1080p so if you give it 4K it just won't work
uh and if you send HDR through it it'll strip the HDR even if it tries to put it back in after and it just loses all color looks terrible uh and so you want to send it 1080p SDR and then it can do its thing at the highest it's almost like it was right in the name it's the Retro tank plug a modern console into it you're going to have a pretty bad time one thing we noticed regardless of the generation of console is the input latency or rather the lack of it we measured the Retro tank in a variety of
modes and we saw less than a millisecond in the 60 HZ mode and about 8 and 1 12 milliseconds in the 120 HZ mode which funnily enough ends up being almost identical end to endend because 120 HZ is about 8 milliseconds faster than 60 HZ per refresh but wait a second did did we just gloss over the retr take 4K support for 120 htz in both 1080P and 1440p well well we have it now it even has support for variable refresh rate and support for black frame insertion for better motion Clarity so now there's
questions that we have to answer do we maximize our resolution with our scaler or do we go for higher refresh rates but at lower resolutions oh and that's why we're going to do Dreamcast and Neo now yes that looks much better to me than the than the switch did at 120 no question yeah like that looks totally great that looks awesome honestly I don't even like this on the HD crrt yeah it doesn't look right it looks smear it looks like an LCD Yep this looks great it looks better than the CRT yeah the
real test honestly is just to put people in front of the four and then just see which one they're looking at cuz different games it's not purely ergonomic different games I have 100% found myself looking at different displays yeah I think we're both just always looking at this one just not interested in looking at anything else cuz it's still got that clean look like it doesn't look blurry at all but it softens it and just just looks right when my opponents go high I go low oh no oh no no
no oh my goodness oh my goodness rude if your preference is absolute maximum motion Clarity then 120 HZ with with black frame insertion might be a good option for you but I think both David and I are aligned on that if you're planning to use CRT filters which hopefully you are because you just spent a lot of money on a device that is solely designed for that then you're probably better off sticking with 4K The Mask details just look so much better at that higher resolution and there's no
question this is the closest we've seen an OLED get to the look of his here te oh yeah did it ever occur to to us to try it on the 8K OLED no David I heard you have a challenge for me yes I do it's time to play CRT or wannabe oh okay uh basically I got macro shots of different screens playing the same game so this is OLED with a retro tank versus the CRT and honestly I give me a sec give me a sec give I've forgotten which one is which I think that's the OLED you are incorrect I don't have a sense of the
scale of these images which makes it a little bit tougher but the reason I chose that one was it seemed like the area in between the sub pixels was so black that it would have had to be like OLED black like a filter but then that's one of the advantages of CRT is that anywhere where the phosphor aren't glowing it's black OLED yeah you're right that's that's the OLED that's the CRT say RT uh retro tank oh okay OLED crap CRT okay now there's an HD CRT in the mix so there's one CRT one
retrotink one HDC the HD crrt is the bottom middle cuz it looks so ra freaking obvious right so that would be using aperture Grill yeah and it just looks so sharp and yet so so BL delightfully blurred you know it's I think the top right is the Retro tank no shoot no follow your gut no no no it's the CRT yes you were right it's got to be the real CRT on the left yes okay but what did we do to the Retro tank to make it look so weird here I maximized the filters when I said it to
like what looked best to my eye it was too clear it was a little too easy to tell got it but then when I maximize everything then it's a little bit harder to tell so that's not representative of the best case scenario for what a retrotink would look like if you dialed it in he's more just making me choose what is an actual display versus what is playing around with filters on it got it this one's tough I think that's the Retro tank top right but it looks better yes you're right these pixels aren't
real like the subpixel layout is not real it's fake but it looks like a macro of a display at all which is I guess half the point here 100% if I hadn't already seen how good the Retro tank can look I would have been blown away even more by how close it got to emulating the look of a CRT but one way that CRTs have maintain the lead over modern displays is how they handle interlaced resolution content now you may already know that interlaced simply means alternating between the odd and even
horizontal lines of an image on each frame which is really difficult to do especially at non-native resolutions on a Modern Display but the Retro tank should help us compensate we've gone PS2 then PS2 got award I chose it because you can turn on and off Progressive or interlaced uh that makes it a good test for how the de interlacing is on both retro tanks got it there's no question in my mind right now that the HD crrt running through the Retro tank 5x looks the best here and it again comes down to
that pleasing blurriness yeah but this game in interlace mode could it look better here I definitely like the increased pop from being able to run that OLED in HDR mode that looks better than the CRT no question okay so this is Progressive it looks pretty good on all these things considering how old of a game this is you can almost tell though that it's not quite right okay like the the flames in the background though and like right the extra brightness on those the extra pop yeah I might take that
over the softer looking lighting and like the sky I think is a perfect place to look where you get this vibrancy in the color on the OLED through the Retro tank you get this reduced banding almost in the appearance on the old CRT I think it's incredible that the Retro tank is within shooting distance on something that the CRT has kicked ass at before and it makes it that like you really don't need a CRT anymore there's still advantage even text yeah like a lot of the time text just looks like a
big blocky ugly mess and then all of a sudden you know you throw it on a CRT you're like oh yeah okay I guess it was readable and they were just compensating for the display technology of the time but it looks it looks right like that hit counter it looks right even up close dude it's really convincing yeah but these have their strengths too and I think the bottom line guys is that that no one setup is always going to be the best and there's going to be some subjectivity based on a billion
different factors even things like the environment you're going to be sitting in David made a really good point earlier that this CRT is not at its blackest in the blacks because it's picking up some Reflections off of our gray floor here and anti-glare glass has come a long way in the last 25 years the good news though is that for anyone but the purist of purists the retrotink 4K is going to get you so close that you probably won't miss your giant 200 lb tube TV there are still some challenges the
newest OLED displays for example you might have been wondering why are we using a C1 and a C10 ah the new ones use a different black frame insertion method that is less CRT like so you might have to go and find an older one if you care about that which is going to dang it are we going to create another bloody in Gold brush but this time on older oleds or maybe not because you'll also be giving up some brightness compared to the very latest oleds but then again for the purists so has your CRT that's been
sitting for a quarter of a century or so so maybe it's time to get with the times except it's going to cost you more than just time the good news is you don't need any of the other stuff like that fancy HDMI Matrix all you need is the Retro Ting 4K the bad news is it's $750 that is so expensive that it makes the $325 for the old 5x sound like an absolute bargain but and yes I doing that again when you consider the costs associated with building this thing it doesn't look that unreasonable anymore
the Cyclone 5 fpga in here alone is listed for around $260 on Digi key and a full board with that processor is going "to cost you upwards of ,000 000 which" totally ignores the development costs of bringing something like this to life so it's not some madeup scam number and besides the existence of a new high-end product doesn't make the more affordable or the older ones worse if anything it might hopefully put some downward pricing pressure on them in the long term and even now an ossc or a gbsc is
more than enough for most people and that last one can be had for around $50 also the Retro tank 5x still a phenomenal scaler if you don't need HDMI or that higher resolution but if you like what you saw and a lot of you apparently do and you want 4K along with the improved CRT filters the extra IO and quality of life things like the better remote we think this thing is super cool and we're going to have a link to where you can buy it down below when it comes back in stock what we do have in stock though is
