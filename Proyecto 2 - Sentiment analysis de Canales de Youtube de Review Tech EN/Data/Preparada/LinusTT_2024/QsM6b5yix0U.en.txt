snatch and smash it's the viral Trend that's Breaking All the Rules and maybe your phone this clip with over 6 million views on Tik Tok shows an elderly man sneaking up on an unsuspecting Zoomer snatching her phone and smashing it right in front of her hey Billy did you see this on the TV news it's fake news dad look it's the same guy in a different hat I reverse AI searched him and his LinkedIn employer just says he has contracts at Google and apple it's just a stunt to promote iCloud and
Google one you have the high drive right no dad my generation can't afford BMWs unsettling if true now it's time for today's Tech tip minute where we're going to be showing you an affordable way to safeguard your data watch this I press this button and instantly my photos are sinking over the internet but instead of to an expensive cloud storage provider I'm backing up to the nas board right behind me wow look at it Go of course network attached storage or Nas devices are nothing new what's special
here is the value the friendly elec CM 3588 Nas kit costs about what you'd spend for 2 tabt of cloud storage per year and its arm-based processor from Rockchip crushes the CPU in this $700 bigname NZ as a bonus it's so efficient it can be powered by just a 2 Amp 12vt input there is one more thing you'll need to know before you can stop paying that monthly subscription and we're going to tell you all about it after the break super micro if you're in need of high performance servers to support your
AI and machine learning workloads super micro is here to serve up some great options check out their pedis scale oneu and 2u storage  below despite being able to purchase the CM 3588 Standalone it's really intended to slot into their bundle $35 Nas kit that comes equipped with 22 gig ethernet three HDMI ports one in two out USB 3 USBC a Micro SD slot and the star of the show four full-sized m.2 pcie gen 3 slots how is this only $35 I mean I guess if you take away the expensive bits like the so and the ram a
PCB and some connectors it even has gpio still doesn't cost very much all we got to do is install a cute little heat sink click it into place and we're done but this ease of use is only part of the story the other part is modularity for now friendly El only has this one board but in the future who knows a SATA version for hard drives or maybe one with a PCI Express lot that would be sick and what's cool is in the future if your daughter board still meets your needs but you want more performance you
could potentially upgrade the brain of your tiny NZ without having to scrap the whole thing I mean no promises the first iteration kind of has to succeed for there to be a followup but as it stands right now I kind of love it this version of the compute board comes with 4 gigs of DDR 4X memory and no onboard storage so the expectation is you either use the SD slot on the nas kit or you upgrade to the 8 or 16 gig ram versions which include 64 gigs of emmc storage we ended up with the ladder which brought our
price to $160 it's not cheap but it's a really solid value when you consider that that's a onetime cost kind of like our LTT screwdriver HH One driver many different bits let's get these drives installed but while we're doing that let's talk about the options that we have each of these slots is a pcie gen 3x1 connection so that does limit our bandwidth a little bit but it also opens up some very interesting options for example with inexpensive adapters we could turn each of these into as many as
five SATA ports giving us support for 20 conventional hard drives we were more interested though in a tiny power efficient solid state Nas now with only one lane per Port we're not going to be setting any speed records here but realistically our 2 and 1/2 gig network interface is going to limit us long before those pcie Lanes will which realistically gave us a lot of flexibility with when it came to choosing our ssds we obviously don't want anything unreliable so we're not
going to go with the cheapest thing but we don't need to spend a fortune either so we picked these 4 TB mp34 drives from Team group for $165 each they're only gen 3 but they have a 5-year warranty and they even come with a dam cach though that shouldn't really have an impact on the relatively sequential video editing work that we would do off of this thing at a trade show or something and for that matter most Naas Duties are pretty similar whether you're using it for PC backup photo and movie
backup or even running a video streaming server with Plex or jellyfin and besides because you're configuring your own you can choose lower capacity drives or you can populate just two slots run them in a mirror for redundancy then 6 months later when you get a nice paycheck you can add one or two more so some of you are probably wondering then why do you need a NZ instead of just using external hard drives anyway well for starters these things suck they're a single point of failure and they're super easy to
lose by comparison a Naz can be shared with anyone else on your network which leads to point two having all of your data on your personal machine is something that I have advocated against for years your daily driver is the most likely to be infected by malware or to suffer a malfunction putting any data that's on it at risk with that said a single copy on a Nas isn't best practice either and you should always follow the 321 rule three copies of your data on two types of media with one of them
being off site now we usually turn to tras for these types of projects but with this board being Arm based we were forced to look for another option and eventually we settled on omv or open media Vault conveniently friendly Alex website includes a link to a Google Drive that has all the install files and instructions for the different methods of installation we're going to be going from an s d card to our emmc storage the process took about 25 minutes and at the end gave us an IP that we could use to
access the guey for open media Vault we chose raid five for a balance of protection and capacity and after compiling and syncing we were left with dang almost 11.2 tab of capacity now we want to connect it to our windows-based computers so we enable SMB the protocol that Windows uses for Network file sharing and then create a shared Drive let's see how we did different media file copying from our desktop to our tiny Nas wow completely saturating our 2 and 1/2 gig interface that's awesome I
wonder how much CPU usage is happening yeah you can actually check that we could check that yep pretty substantial amount it's not very powerful and transfer back wow there you go it's almost like that's a lot of interface for a 2 and 1/2 gig connection did I mention it's completely flipping silent barely even hot to the touch what am I even listening for there's no fan on it just whatever it doesn't matter do you know where there are fans though float plane oh go subscribe to float plane this is all
fine and good but it doesn't answer the question of how do we protect ourselves against the very real threat of snatch and smash well under the plug-in section in omv you can grab photo prism an AI powered photo library that we can use a separate application to sync to in our case we used photo sync so for just over $5 we're able to sync our photos with almost any storage solution you can think of including photo prism and what's really cool is the sync can work both ways so if your phone ever dies and
you need to replace it you just resign into photosync and you can sync back from your Nas to whatever new phone you get no monthly subscription just a one-time payment of this many dollars for the app compared to more common setups x86 processors on traz or unraid for example we did have times when we needed a little extra tinkering and know how to get things working but after Jake spent a couple of hours getting Plex up and running in a Docker container this little guy handled streaming just great
to two concurrent clients at least at 1080p it did once we bumped it up to 4K that was a different story but hey if you're not super satisfied with the playback off of this device that's okay you can run the Plex server on a more powerful machine in your house say your gaming desktop and then just use this as a beef caked out little external hard drive all you need is a network switch I am curious to see how it'll handle video editing though as it turns out the entire editing department is on lunch
right now so I guess I get to do this I am scrubbing I am starting to thing we've got our Apple Vision Pro video here this is the Facebook version of though hence the super obnox ious aspect ratio I can't even tell what the heck's going on people watch videos like this this is terrible but you know what isn't the NZ why don't we try 1/ half resolution it's not the fastest thing ever but realistically this is reasonably heavy 4K footage this was such a great moment in this video and
you can't really appreciate it at all because stupid aspect ratio yeah Facebook so it's pretty great and if open media Vault isn't your thing elex list of supported os's includes versions of Debian friendly wrt Ubuntu and even Android so what are you waiting for it's a Linus siiz Nas that can scale up to 32 terabytes of storage with a top speec price of $160 if you're okay with doing a bit of work and the value is especially apparent when you look at the cost of the larger storage plans from the major
Cloud providers Google for instance wants $600 a year for their 10 TB cloud storage plan that means it would take less than a year and a half to to pay off this exact NZ in this configuration with all the ssds and that's with us going full LTT and making a solid state NZ so what can I say other than I give a strong recommendation to this small boy just like I give a strong recommendation to this small boy oh and to our sponsor super micro their pedis scale storage servers are designed and optimized to
support data intensive workloads like Ai and machine learning they have convenient rear IO and front configurations to make networking easier they're available in 1u and 2u form factors and they support up to 32 of the latest generation pcie Gen 5 nvme ssds they also tout single socket sp5 AMD epic 9004 series processors and up to 24 dim slots that's not dim that's that's "smart plus their 2,000 watt redundant" titanium level power supplies will keep them chugging along reducing maintenance
costs and downtime not to mention there supercloud composer Cloud management platform grants you access to a unified dashboard to integrate tasks into a single intelligent solution so don't wait learn more about super micro's pedis scale servers in the description box down below if you guys enjoyed this video go check out the 90 terabyte nvme server that I ended up building and not taking home to my house it's kind of the opposite of this but it's still a fun educational video
