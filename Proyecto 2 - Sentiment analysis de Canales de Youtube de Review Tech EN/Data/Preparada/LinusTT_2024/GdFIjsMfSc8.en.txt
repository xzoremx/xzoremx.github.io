sometimes we get accused of being out of touch so we're putting that to the test today our Tech tipsters will go head-to-head in an epic showdown that's right using only their knowledge they will build a "$1,000 PC that doesn't seem that hard" well there's a catch we need the highest possible performance but we can't go over budget and we're not allowed to check the internet for pricing oh well that is a lot harder then I guess the pressure's on to tell you about our sponsor ug green check out their cute
and compact Uno magnetic power bank it features status emojis and up to 15 watts of wireless charging with a 36w hour capacity check it out at the link  description all right Lads the rules are "simple one build the best one ,000 PC" from anything on these shelves two no help from the internet and three a few other restrictions that I sent out yesterday any questions don't care go I think we go big GPU yeah 100% am4 am4 for sure I don't care about case just something cheap and decent probably like
a Chinese brand big risk but I want to go 7900x we going to way overshoot this budet some of them are really cheap how cheap like 500 bucks do we want to waste money on CPU or just stock it 3 okay and  mesh each team has their plan and now it's time to select all of our parts we're going to do a snake draft order starting with Team literal arson we have 45 seconds per part let's go okay go go let's go go 7800 XT not the XTX well we could go for a fancy with 7800 no we need to go the cheapest shiest looking
one the gigabyte looks expensive I was hoping for something that seems cheaper looking we got to pick we got to pick 79 gr where next we next I don't know try it two do this we got we have our part okay do we want 12 or 13 12 might be cheaper like we could do 12400 do we have a 12400 oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] a lot of 13 6ks oh my God we don't have any of the ones that I'd want where are all the CPUs g g  13100 they're going 79 doeses that make they're going way over budget 77 uh 7900
7800 XT that's a maybe 77 that's 7700 XT XT XT okay yeah we're good on that we're good on that CPU CPU CPU I really would rather go with this unless we want to go Intel 3 4 okay okay B 660 B 660 650 650 oh Jes oh Jesus Christ oh and this said A1 oh no no this is ITX oh God uh here this is reasonable Asus no no this one this one all right it's our turn go all right way all right yelling all right I'm looking for motherboards am4 where the freak is it right here do you think b450
Pro four good I think that's fine all right that's probably 100 bucks okay okay but we get to go again right yeah okay basically all they have AMD wise that's like reasonable right I really don't know I think it'd be safer just to go with like this yeah that is this one that's probably the best choice yeah we're going to go with the 5600 G 6900 XT or 7900 XT or 78 or 78 I think 78 78 is the one this looks like some pretty awful stuff should we just go for it or theam what let's do
it I can't I have what I want I just can't get it out what did you just do what does this require it's pretty chunk dude it's pretty chunk it is pretty chunk oh my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we're screwed we we're so screwed now that the major components have been selected we're going to round out our systems with ram case power supply Etc until we get to the most important category Flex item I need to find out if there's fans that are included with this or not so that we want to use our FX pick for fans
real quick oh God it's back no no fans so get fans okay this looks good this all work let's cheap RGB would be really good it's going to be so expensive though it's going to be really expensive I want something silly alija we can have this for $10 done the parts have been selected our Fates have been sealed now it's time to build starting with Team arson for our CPU we ended up going with the 5600 G and I think we ran into the same issue a lot of the other teams did which is when
they looked in the pile of AMD CPUs all of them were already checked out either to another project or Labs testing I don't know how much these are worth now I have literally no clue I want to say 15 bucks I put down 125 as my guess I'm feeling a little bit sick to my stomach the fact that the first component is different than I thought it was I thought we just got a regular 13100 but this is a 13100 f f is just no Graphics no Graphics that's fine so it's actually better so it should be cheaper yeah
you'll save 10 bucks probably I think we went a little overboard on the CPU we went with a 13600 K cuz there was like no we wanted a 5600 x yeah we panicked yeah we panicked there's none and then for motherboard we went with a Asus Prime B6 60 plus which is one of the cheapest LGA 1700 boards that we have in stock we wanted to make sure that our CPU runs at Boost clocks so maybe we can win big in the CPU competition that might push us over the edge yeah man  exactly and that was one of the original
things with going with am4 plat oh my gosh these yeah that's fine very w we went with the ASRock b450 Pro 4 how much do you think these are like I was going to say like 70 maybe 90 that might be pushing like a 100 13100 F and then we got our z690 plus Wi-Fi D4 motherboard it is a much more expensive board than I would have picked but we didn't see any 660 ones left in terms of our estimates we were thinking 13100 130 bucks z690 we said 170 it's probably more I think I'm going to I'm going to
adjust estimate to 200 you think so yeah which is a huge bummer for the ram chose the one that was used in the Shen build uh I don't actually know how to pronounce it but it was blurred the last time I pronounced it like this so G ddr4 3200 MHz that's style points right there St that's class if you ask me I think the anime adds five bucks so we're going to go 40 I think that's our estimate all right cross our fingers with that one y this whole build please please please please
the only thing we know for sure is that we are over budget all right so we're just going stock cooler here yeah which is nice 0 I actually haven't installed these stock coolers before boy over here okay don't do that this young does not know the ways of the when you boot up a game oh I do my computer still screams what kind of case do we get we got a fantex eclipse G 360a great case this is probably going to come in around $100 yeah maybe one 10 tops we got the fantex eclipse p300 this
right here uh it that's quality it feels kind of like junk but not in a way that's like concerning it's not going to hurt me which is like a plus I guess and we have what seems like too nice of a fan in the back I'm a bit concerned about that next is our Flex item oh yeah and Jordan I want you to take a closer look at the box that you chose uh-oh did I do a bad oh sh light strips what hey I know I I 100% would have made the same mistake I was fully reading that as LS 120 assuming 12 mil
fans this box looks like a pack of three fans this is not looking good for Jordan while he's handling all the stuff on the motherboard I'm going to be getting the case prepped uh we got this thermal take smart bm3 650 watt 80 plus bronze I think we all had the same strategy we went for thermal take bronze is it just we all consider them cheap I think so I think we were all expecting them to be cheaper than a cic or Corsair one thing that I did not realize when I picked that GPU was that
it requires an 800 W power supply so we went with what seemed like the worst 800 wat power supply but not so bad that it would actually just not work what do you think though 65 to 100 it's only 650 watt I think it's 100 tops uh $85 sure it's 650 watt it's bronze yeah thermal take uh they make some great products but they not necessarily the power supply like well that's not ther take that's thermal right oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you're right we love them yeah we do love thermal right the Phantom Spirit 120 SE
argb $40 I'm going to say 50 you say 50 cuz yeah it is the Phantom Spirit spirit's newer just going to tighten my cooler down with our LTT Screwdriver from LTT store.com oh yeah yeah don't get screwed be the one who does the screwing one thing that I was thinking mhm uh as far as I can tell there are no bonus points for noise we should go full fan speed on everything I mean we can but like what's the so just so it stays super cool oh yeah it just like might net us a couple
FPS I man I'm getting kind of worried that like we're going to be so far off on budget and we're going to like really I got less nervous when I saw Alex grab the 7900 XT I was really hoping that we would have like an XFX or a slightly crappier 7900 XT cuz this right here   be so we're banking on 600 bucks that's how much we think it's worth I'm saying 650 okay 650 for our GPU we picked a good old 7700 XT we think it's going to do just fine we didn't want to go overboard on price uh what's 7700 XT 400
500 bucks 500 Buck got be 500 probably 550 Maybe so long yeah like the board is done here the cooler is just massive oh yeah no problem okay that's good Alex Alex oh God I was like hey let's go plug it in like it's like it's like right no I think you can get it I think you can get it oh I okay we're going to need some finagling here we're going to need some finagling we almost had a budget time for a saw wait that means we probably have time to go and Laser we're not laser etching the
glass panel Alex yes we are that's we have millimet of clearance I did not think about that at all that GPU is massive so not only did you potentially screw us on price you almost screwed us on actual space okay do you want to plug it in plug it in get it posting yeah how much time do we have 15 15 okay dude we're not going to have time no we're going to have time we haven't even post tested we can post test over there you can do that and worry about the cable management I will make this art literal
art all right we're going to the freaking 105 this a stupid idea look I've had only bad ideas today let's not stop okay nothing yet hold on are the board diagnostics saying anything do we have can't read it there's a it's one of those lights that has like four options d so it might be Memory training we'll give it yeah give it a minute all right we're coming over here really really fast we have about 15 minutes I'm going to try in that time to create us a custom side pan now we don't have enough
time to do it as like a I don't even remember what it's that called I just  going uhoh good we're good light turned off good hey  is Alex as pretty as your glass is it'd be really cool if the computer turned on it really would be wouldn't it yeah we still have our dam light d light are these dead David our ddr4 might be bad uh I'm just going to hit start and hope for the best yeah this might guarantee that we totally do not win the style points if it's only half done which is
really looking quite likely at the moment Alex I need help getting the computer booted though oh you do I I literally cannot get it to boot uh what yeah so I had it plugged in I know this cable Works cuz it was powering the monitor but I tried unplugging even the front I/O to see if it was the button but I touch the pins and it does not doesn't go the lights are moving  happening you stop the at time yeah trouble shoting yeah yeah cuz this I don't think is our fault it seems like
it might just actually be a dead power  oh we're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it got most of the way through too I have no clue why it did that oh you know what happened tinan changed the focal distance of this laser I have I had the laser about as low of a power and as fast as it could get but this is the first time that we have ever etched with this laser this is what I wanted to be on the side panel just the sad Linus on fire team literal Iris I cannot believe that that side
panel exploded oh I can I totally can it's almost like we said hey Alex we only have 10 minutes left maybe we shouldn't go for this I'm just going to send it and see what happens I still don't see any LEDs yeah there still is nothing do we have a dead board kind of really looking like it Alex what do you think is more dead the motherboard of the side panel the motherboard we can still put the shards of the side panel in there we could save this but yeah our motherboard's dead so I guess we'll have
to figure out what happens next this is really unfortunate yeah okay right okay uh power button 15 seconds Moment of Truth yeah okay we got the RGB that's good that's good on we got lights yellow light Dr Ram oh it's not going away what do you mean it's sticking around we might of a ram issue no as per the rules which you can see here we are going to replace these broken components with working ones and get these computers all tuned up computers are built Windows is installed
everything's ready to go it's time for the teams to show off what they have done there's our computer everyone do you like our decoration we got some for free uh and we did pay $10 for this hypn frog so tell us what happened to your side panel Alex decided to tried to laser etch the glass oh my God and he we didn't have the laser dialed in and all of a sudden we heard a shatter so while while you were building a PC he just went to the shop to no no we built the PC and we were so confident it was
working we were like let's go laser ET it then it didn't boot cuz the motherboard was dead and then the glass panel shattered all in 5 minutes actually the motherboard wasn't dead we had the ryzen 5600 G from that random Lenovo desktop that is that has a fuse in it that locks it from going in another totally forgot about that we have a whole video on that and you can plug in another ryzen ship into that Lenova board and it will lock that as well I'm pretty sure that's wild it's crazy we
have another 5600 G but because we couldn't figure it out we have a different motherboard that David selected for us got it it's equiv value you'll still be uh scored at the original price got it and motherboards aren't super important for performance so we've kind of gone a little bit looser on that and now that he's laid that out this helped us a a lot it turns out that we screwed up and accidentally got a PCI gen 3 board this one is Gen let's go he got it so we have resizable
bar enabled we have we have the GPU running at full thing this is really good that would have been a huge St and I see you went with the 7900 XT which is not a mid-range card what uh what was the impetus for that card this was an executive decision by Alex there somebody's m is uny in a "$1,000 build I would not recommend this" GPU normally but you can get them on sale we're hoping one's on sale right now we estimated this computer costing "$1,115 what that's again hoping the GPU"
is on sale the actual price not bad not bad okay it's not bad "$1,249 27 the GPU was $700 and your" original motherboard trait really saved you was 100 bucks we're going to have a 24.9% penalty Team B me had trouble from the beginning uh we ended up making a rush decision in getting a 13100 F I was looking for like a 12400 or a 13400 something a lot more balanced but still really low price tough gaming motherboard eh okay yeah yeah so the next problem we were you know locked
into our ecosystem based on our CPU choice and I was looking for a b660 board and I couldn't find them in 45 seconds we took one so we ended up with a z690 board oh our total system guess  price so we were pretty spoton on our guest our big factor was a $270 fcking motherboard oh my goodness W 27 so that gen last gen motherb that's basically our entire overage compared to that one $170 difference on a GD mother you got a nice case though how much was the case it was $70 what godamn it's a
pretty computer though I like it tell them what we picked Adam oh team DDR 420 we picked a 13600 K which was um a panic decision uh we had 5 seconds and we grabbed a 13600 K which is probably going to be the thing that hurts us the most in terms of budget absolutely it's a great CPU except for maybe the um uh voltage issues this only has to run for 2 hours so who cares um which also explains our power supply selection we chose a thermal literally the exact same thermal take smart line as everyone else
who cares it only needs to be on for 2 hours another downside to our CPU pick was that we had to get a cooler unlike the other two teams who had included coolers with their CPUs I will say as a note to that the cooler that they used is not the included one for the 5600 G we're not going to dock points because it's RGB and it's way cooler but it would come with just the stealth with this which is a black one but will it cool down our price let's see you had the highest yes we were very cynical even with the
lowest GPU we guessed at least $350 for our CPU and we came in wow wow nice "$1,092 wow turns out we have no idea how" much stuff costs but um we always air on the side of of expensive so that's good we kind of know what it costs we were "trying to build $1,000 PC we came out" "around $1,100 I think that's pretty they" got a little bit lucky the 13600 K just happens to be on sale good job you guys so that's good you guys are the closest to the Thousand for sure that's going to be a big help
ooh okay there's no way that plof would not use an aftermarket cooler that's ploofs oh he's right he knows his stuff I'm a little bit scared at how well L knows us we were so spot on we took a break for the weekend and I've run some of the benchmarks beforehand but we're going to run our last one on camera so get to your freaking stations 3 two one go I started first I win the best part about not having a side panel I can add extra cooling it only helps if it's over why showing them as winning cuz we have
a better system duh they're not they drop like crazy yeah we're good oh yeah okay GG easy wow killed them yeah I'm so surprised that 77 to 79 is way bigger of a difference in this game than I expected yeah they're looking like 40% how do they have the fastest CPU score that's a very good question there's like wonkiness with some of the results like they have this massive drop in fps in the middle of the Benchmark this is why like when Labs is doing testing we run things multiple times to make sure that
any weird outliers are dealt with whereas this is just have fun with friends run some benchmarks see who does better but oh well we've run the benchmarks and I am shocked at the results in third place is team three with 535 out of 700 in second place is team two with 582 out of 700 and in first place is team one with 639 out of 700 that's a really high catch we'll get they only have 60 points on the table however with a penalty that cost them 24.9% of their performance their final score puts them in second
place and the winner is no way let's go wow we haven't talked about the pineapple for good taste  that it's you guys four out of the six votes yeah that means that they took a very clean Victory not only did they win after price performance adjustment but they got the best looking system hang on hang on hang on we got to deduct a point there a scratch in the glass whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa they also were "the closest to an actual $1,000 Mark" true which was really awesome tell me
how it feels to win well David it feels great you know we played a good game we played a hard game the other guys are out there you know they're giving their all every single night and like we're out there you know and sometimes you take got to take the win do the good with the bad got to just you know give it 110% yeah just like I'm going to give you 110% for the segue to our sponsor ug green their Uno magnetic power bank has attitude but in a cute way it shows you the charging status with adorable emojis
