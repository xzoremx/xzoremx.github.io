our goal was perfectly simple to create a back toschool laptop buyer guide but recommending a laptop these days is anything but simple let me explain this Dell Inspiron was the best laptop as was this Acer Nitro and this HP Spectre was "too that's because the best ,000 laptop" "is always going to be a $1,400 laptop on" "sale for $1,000 so instead of telling" you what to buy I'm going to do you one better and I'm going to teach you how to buy a laptop so that you can shop with
confidence and get a great deal on the right machine for you we're also going to include some honorable mentions to give you guys a good starting point whether you're looking for a thin and light or a mobile workstation I'm also going to be mentioning today's sponsor Lexar this entire video was shot on iPhone directly to their armor 700 portable SSD it offers blazing fast performance is IP 66 rated to protect against both water and dust and its rugged design is built to withstand up
to 3 m drops and Falls making it perfect for outdoor and extreme environments it supports Apple Pro reses recording has a unique thermal control design to ensure consistent performance and is compatible with basically anything with a USBC port and comes in two attractive colors we're going to have it linked down below the most important thing to do is be honest with yourself and look for a laptop that excels at what you actually do not at what what you think you might like to do
someday maybe if you have time so for most people topof the line components aren't necessary and a mid-range machine will not only save you some money but it could be lighter quieter and last longer on battery with that said if you are looking for performance I would start your search with gaming laptops even if you don't game they typically have the best cooling fastest processors and better upgradeability than laptops that are marketed towards professionals or creators on top of being priced more
aggressively at almost every performance tier as for the gamers out there if your primary use is school or work something with an RTX 4050 or RTX 3060 is going to handle 1080P or even 1440p gaming in most titles at least if you reduce the settings a little bit here are a couple of budget friendly options with any of these being worth picking up if you can find a good s on them not everyone wants to turn down settings though so intense Gamers should buy something faster right
well yeah but it's not that simple in front of me are two laptops one with an RTX 4070 and one with an RTX 460 guess which one of them is faster go ahead I'll wait yeah it's the 4060 see these days you don't just worry about which GPU is in your laptop you also also have to worry about the wattage of your GPU in this G14 here that 4060 gets fed up to 90 watts of power while the 4070 in this more professional oriented Acer gets just 50 watts to add insult to this confusing
injury laptop gpus share almost nothing in common with their desktop counterparts with the same names and the only way to break through this deceptive branding is to painstakingly test everything single one of them thankfully Jared's Tech has done all the work for you he tested a truly incredible number of games in gpus and has made this incredible resource for the community and there's more good news if your idea of gaming is planting turnips in stardew Valley there's a solid chance that you
can completely forget about a dedicated GPU at all many recent CPUs can even handle AAA games speaking of how do you choose the right CPU for your laptop well if you simply want the best it's Apple yeah you're stuck with the Notch and Mac OS and whether the ecosystem is a feature or bug is subjective but their battery life is fantastic and their M3 chips have single core performance that is currently unmatched by Windows machines getting a Macbook does have a couple of problems you can't play many
games and they're expensive but if you're a student or you don't mind factory refurbished there are deals to be found out there on the Windows side we're going to start with AMD whose mobile naming scheme is so bad that we made an entire video about how they are intentionally misleading consumers their most recent chips are the ryzen AI 300 series and these offer a small uplift in performance over the last generation but with a huge Improvement in efficiency with our ryzen AI laptop getting an
additional 3 hours of battery life you can watch our full review at the link down below but the too long didn't watch is that if you can afford a laptop with a ryzen AI 300 chip you're going to have a pretty good time moving back a generation though things get really confusing look at the ryzen 57640 U the most important number in there is not the seven but it's actually the 4 which signifies that this CPU uses amd's Zen 4 architecture so you could be easily tricked into thinking that the ryzen
37320 U would be similar but with a little bit l performance but remember I just said the seven means nothing it's going to be way slower because the important number is the two it's using the Zen 2 architecture from 2019 yikes so if you're looking for a deal on a slightly older ryzen 7000 or 8000 series chip they can be good bets but just make sure there's a four in this spot or that price better be really good as for Intel their new Ultra 100 series CPUs actually offer a tiny bit
less performance than the 13th gen chips that they replaced but with a big Improvement in battery life making realistically either a decent Choice depending on your priorities in the coming months Intel is going to be launching their lunar Lake lineup which they promise is going to be really really good but okay what am I going to do drive my Roadster 2 to the future mart and buy one the hard truth is Intel's a little behind on mobile right now but not by so much that you should
buy an AMD machine with a keyboard you hate versus an Intel one that's more comfortable and as long as the Price Is Right you can safely go back I'd say to about 12th gen without missing out massively on performance or efficiency speaking of we are not done yet because the laptop CPU Market was just massively disrupted by Qualcomm and their Snap Dragon X chips which offer unmatched battery life with performance that is comparable to am ryzen AI line the only catch is that these are arm processors
and if your application doesn't run natively on Windows on arm you could be looking at a 30 to 50% reduction in performance if it works at all we did a live stream where we tested a bunch of games on Snapdragon X and found that only about half of them worked and it's more than just games Adobe Premiere works but only the 2023 version at the moment and other parts of the creative Suite like after effects are currently Mia altogether so there are two groups of people then that these laptops could
be great for users who know for sure that they're going to be doing things in a web browser or just using common apps always or the Geeks who love to be the first to test obscure programs on new hardware and then work with the dev team to resolve them if you're in either of those categories hey enjoy that laptop that you only need to plug in every few days we really like the surface laptop 7 Samsung Galaxy book 4 Edge and HP Omni book X though we have a full video looking at over half a dozen different
options which you can check out down below of course if you looked at all of those and thought gee there's nothing really in my budget that's understandable and there's lots of options For You especially if you're willing to consider something unconventional Chromebooks might not be very sexy but will serve you very well if everything that you do can be done through an internet browser or through Linux apps and and they tend to be better speced for their price thanks to manufacturer saving on the cost of a
Windows license on the Windows side of things though there are budget friendly options as well and Acer was kind enough to send us over a few machines ranging from $230 to $400 to see just how much performance you can get on their most basic models the build quality of the $230 Aspire go is surprisingly okay but the Intel n100 processor that powers it is like it's not just slow it's struggling to do basic tasks meanwhile the $300 Aspire go with a ryzen CPU is literally twice as fast for not that
much more money while the $400 Aspire 3 is not a huge upgrade in raw performance but gets 16 gigs of RAM meaning it can complete our full test suite and actually seems very worthwhile it uses amd's older Zen 2 architecture so neither perform nor battery life are going to be on par with the most modern machines but it's good enough to the point where the mediocre screen is more of a concern to me than the outright performance if you have a little more to spend this HP Pavilion arrow is
currently on sale for $600 and the amount better it is is hard to overstate of course all of this assumes that you need to buy new if you don't mind giving up things like warranties you could save a significant amount of money University and offices regularly sell Surplus equipment that is pretty decent just a couple of generations older here's a listing from the University of Utah that has laptops for half of what they're worth on the used Market also if you end up with a machine that seems slow you
could potentially give it a shot in the arm with upgrades to RAM storage and Wi-Fi just verify beforehand that these items are in fact replaceable by Googling laptop name teardown if you're lucky will have covered it on short circuit or I fix it will have a guide speaking of upgrading Ram how do you know if you need to well in 2024 4 gigs of RAM is a complete noggo and despite what Apple might try and tell you 8 gigs really isn't enough either unless you're my grandma my grandma it is going to
slow you down our new starting recommendation then is 16 gigs and that's only really enough until you start getting into more professional video editing or science ific programs at which point you'll need significantly more as for the exact amount the most important thing is that however much you need you'll need to get it right now because many newer machines do not support upgrading your RAM later if the ability to upgrade is important for you then look for a laptop that supports
sodm or Cam modules thankfully storage is simpler just get a 256 gig SSD if you plan on doing video editing or you want to install a bunch of games then feel free to increase that number but if your budget is tight storage is probably the first place that I would try to cut costs especially since it's the most likely part of your laptop to be easily upgradeable and even if you don't feel like cracking open your device oh yeah external ssds are readily available like the armor 700 from Lexar just plug it
into your laptop and boom more storage don't cut your storage budget too much though a hard drive might be tempting since it can give you a lot of capacity for cheap but but these days it is not worth the performance hit at all emmc even though it's solid state is actually a similar story too it is dog slow compared to a proper SSD and it's considerably less reliable so avoid it if at all possible what you might also want to avoid is scuffing up your new laptop so it's finally here maybe
consider the all new LT laptop bag complete with thoughtful layout and rugged design got freaking love it available now at LTT store.com moving on to the display of your laptop there's a lot to consider there are four main panel types TN OLED mini LED and IPS TN is the technology of yesterday and should be avoided while OLED and mini LED are the best if you can afford them OLED excels in dark rooms with its perfect blacks and unmatched contrast but it might not get quite bright enough for well-lit
rooms or Outdoors mini LED is the opposite with exceptional brightness making it Punchy even in bright rooms while sacrificing contrast in dark rooms meaning your typical use case will determine which is best IPS is your allrounder offering generally good viewing angles color and brightness and with the extra benefit of being sometimes significantly more efficient for instance the IPS version of the Dell XPS 13 plus got almost 5 hours more battery life than the p OLED version
nice probably most importantly though IPS is going to be the most affordable making it the right choice for most people it doesn't suck now we mentioned brighter panels being better for outdoors but how do you tell what's bright enough 200 to 300 nits will be fine for most indoor use with 400 to 500 nits being required for outdoors or 600 plus for a satisfying HDR experience be careful with some laptops that might be claiming huge numbers like5 100 nits because sometimes that number will only
apply for a tiny bright spot on the display with a much lower brightness when the entire screen is bright an often overlooked aspect of a display is the aspect ratio for TVs the standard is 16x9 but for laptops the slightly taller 16 X10 or even if you're crazy 3x2 have become popular in recent years and for good reason this little bit of extra vertical real estate can be a big productivity boost for office or creative work alike and it also tends to be a better fit in a laptop chassis
giving designers more room for cooling and large comfortable trackpads as for what resolution you need we can use Simple Math to find the distance at which a panel becomes a retina display which is Apple's marketing term for the pixel density being high enough that you can't see the individual pixels here's the full breakdown per resolution but the gist is that full HD is good enough Quad HD will be noticeably sharper if if you have good eyes and 4K isn't really worthwhile especially considering those
extra pixels can negatively impact battery life and I care about battery life no matter the resolution increasing the refresh rate above 60 HZ will be a worthwhile Improvement High refresh rate displays will have the biggest impact if you plan on gaming though there are diminishing returns above 144 Hertz and even non- Gamers will benefit everything you do will feel smoother be that photo editing CAD or even just making a new folder I do that all the time but like so many other nice things it can
negatively impact your battery life one thing that may or may not matter to you is a touchscreen I'm personally a fan of them maybe you aren't but the choice is up to you unless you're getting Apple only the final factor to watch out for in your display is color a wider color space or gamut means the panel can physically produce more colors while a smaller color space can leave content looking dull and UNS saturated color spaces can get a bit confusing since there are a bunch of different standards
but unless you know you need something else aim for near 100% coverage of srgb that's the standard that web uses for those of you who do need more graphic designers colorist and like you know who you are you'll need to be concerned not only with gamut but also the accuracy of your display a poorly calibrated display might show everything with a slight magenta or a blue hue and this is usually caused by slight variation from panel to panel during manufacturing so if you plan on doing color critical work
look into getting a laptop with a factory calibrated display something like an average Delta e2000 of two or below is generally considered to be accurate enough as that's what the human eye can typically discern some laptops with excellent displays are the Dell XPS 13 plus MacBook Pro Samsung Galaxy book HP Spectre and Asus G14 and g16 I guess that would be g's 14 and 16 whatever now for a rare Simple Choice the trackpad ever since Microsoft introduced Windows Precision drivers
almost all laptops come with a trackpad that will be accurate and not slow you down although the very best trackpads are large glass topped and use Force touch instead of a physical click standups here include MacBooks and windows devices with sensil trackpads like the surface laptop 7 HP Spectre D XPS and Lenovo ThinkPad Z series will almost certainly be more difficult is the keyboard these can be very personal though so the best way to confirm that you like one is just go to your local
Big Box store and try out a bunch the first thing to look for is that your hands physically fit some 13-in devices won't have a large enough Palm rest for everyone or maybe there are some sharp edges on a device that will bother only some folks who end up resting right on them after that check the chassis Flex of the machine soft spots can throw off your typing then check how stable the Keys themselves are press the edge of a key it's a fail if you can get the corner to go too low before the key
actuates and finally just press a whole bunch of keys to see if there are any obvious differences in force required to press each one the ones that we like the most are the HP dragon fly Elite Dell Latitude 9440 and alien wear gaming laptops especially if you choose the optional Cherry switches the last big things we haven't mentioned are weight and Battery weight is pretty self-explanatory light is nicer to carry around duh but battery is more complex the standard measurement for battery
capacity is wat hours but even with identical specs you can end up with wildly varying battery life numbers since the efficiency of every single part in the chain and how the manufacturer has tuned each individual part plays a role adding insult to injury laptop manufacturers battery life numbers are almost always comically overstated and often cont predictor on the same web page all of this is to say get your battery life numbers from a reputable Source such as short circuit
and try to use only battery life numbers from a single source for direct comparisons since everyone tests them slightly differently finally there are a couple of nice to haves that you might want in a laptop plan on doing a bunch of meetings with your webcam while qualcomm's recent CPUs currently support much better webcams than the rest of the CPU makers even if not every single laptop that has a qualcom CPU has the best implementation if you're all about privacy then look for a laptop with a
hardware webcam and microphone toggle or even one of the rare machines without a webcam at all for logging in quickly look for a fingerprint reader or Windows hello facial recognition the ladder in particular was a game Cher for me and of course don't buy anything until you know you can live with the I/O if a laptop has full-size HDMI make sure it's 2.1 not 1.4 and many manufactur pies these days leave off usba a ports SD card readers and even headphone Jacks in the name of a little bit of weight savings
I'm looking at youell and I'm also looking at our sponsor Lexar the armor 700 portable SSD held up great for this shoot handling up to 4K 60fps pror footage directly from our iPhone 15 Pro reminder that it comes in two colors black and blue and you can check it out at the link down below so if you like this video maybe check out our review of the rise of AI 300 also make sure to hit like get subscribed and maybe go to our forum and ask us directly what laptop should I get we will be in there and
just have a great all day see you later
