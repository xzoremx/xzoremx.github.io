recently we looked at some of your worst tech support nightmares how do you even do what to heal the trauma we thought we'd change gears and take a look at some of your most ingenious tech support fixes like this one oh my God that's a SIM card that's sick dude so the the PCB for whatever device this is oh it didn't come with the little bracket for it yeah buddy I love this yeah I don't think I've ever seen somebody solder to a SIM card that's very clever I built a Linux PC inside an IBM keyboard the least
practical battery powered laptop I flipping love it at least it probably like thonks dude look at these arrow keys wow this is sick as hell it's added USB to it that's probably where the computer lives the double function Row god that's amazing a wrist breaking typing angle oh my goodness look at this display the keyboard to screen ratio here it's like 5 to1 or something and you can tell just looking at this thing that this is absolutely the kind of person to use a track ball
Mouse this is cool as heck cool as heck not tech support MacGyver it's a mods should have deleted this a mcgyver solution is defined as fixing something by using parts that are not the intended replacement parts or using yeah I wouldn't say this mcgyver this is just neat this is just amazing how about this one yeah all right I I can get behind that this is great it's a lot of effort you just screw the back play off desolder the cable ad Toc adapter from AliExpress that is so cool
oh yeah that's mint I mean okay well well I mean it's not mint but it it functions and there's going to be so much more really look at how we patched together this segue to our sponsor get it patched you green juice up your phone quickly with the new Uno 100 W charger according to you green it Powers up an iPhone 15 Pro from 0 to 60% in just 30 minutes plus it even Smiles at you how cute is that check out the ug green Uno  description you ready for some more uh r/ tech mcgyver oh my God no no this took me a
second this is like plastic bag Plus+ there wouldn't even be watertight like it's just easy access the tech painted it to match the house that's like pretty good did nobody stop and ask questions is that eggshell or uh hard to tell I don't actually care hard to tell the finish it just seems like a waste of a perfectly good cooler yeah oh my God a hot rod let's go yeah I'm into I'm into that I love this too this is how you get to like PC modding I'm sure this this is a video we've done this video before if
you need to put a GPU in one of these systems there is no reason why that pcie slot can't take a taller GPU you might just want to put a little bit of electrical tape based on how it's not super mounted and that's pretty close yeah that could short the back of the card that's a good Tech tip it might just fall out put a zip tie around the bracket maybe dude yeah bumping this computer cuz it's not like it's screwed into anything no at this point I feel like you should just leave the side
panel off they did put the side panel back on with the zip tie my god with zip ties oh this one's super vintage 10 years ago yeah is that's super smart super smart what is this hell yeah is that a Dremel disc is that a cutting disc it's velcro baby clever to use the washer on it too this glue offici on auto here washer this is just just Peak that might be aoxy I think that's epoxy this isxy that's a permanent fixer you know Apple would be proud I think they should come with this
standard yeah mag sa your heart out the school uses two Chromebooks as clocks literally though 100% And supported this message I am so into this this is great Reduce Reuse those are the two most important RS the IT guy at this school has uh he's been there a while Chad energy the message attached to it is also great I think if they were just in the ceiling without that message then I'd be like what the hell but props on them they said they needed 10 computers in the middle of nowhere and they wanted
an attractive drop on no budget yes there's a lot of school it guys shower rod what shower rod I'm taking notes for for the lab oh the drop oh yeah yeah yeah you see the little joint in the middle dude dude that's actually great you know how expensive the actual ones are oh I know so my brother like they bought an office building for his work and they had like Herman Miller the previous tenant Herman Miller drop things that are like two grand each 10 bucks yeah and look at
this desk look at this Cable Management yeah it's pretty nice that is a slick setup I love it oh no no no no no no please sir oh no what is this copying as much as I can this window not no that's not how you do that oh my god he has to Kickstart it that is not very good is anyone going to tell him no no with these older drives this is a 20-year-old Drive yeah that'll work dust is still a thing but I guess if you're just trying to recover it if you're trying to get as much you can see he's copying but he's
copying honest normally I just put mine in the freezer hard drives are far more they're black magic mindboggling than an SS but as someone who has had data that's in limbo I would do anything I would try anything except that that would not be on my list of things flash drive has got too hot so I installed a monster heat sink I like how they have the thermal pad thermal Pad See this won't work cuz that is not the hot part of your USB key what if it's metal it still would be so far away
the Chip is going to be all the way over here you're probably saturating the heat of the outside case of that USB flash drives can get to too hot though especially if the USB port is sitting by the exhaust or if your laptop has thermal issues this is possible and you're writing to it at the same time those things can combine to create a bad situation slow it down yeah the monster makes the it faster for sure fixing my own network I used a free ISP hotspot across the street with my coffee can
antenna wow that's an oldie this the cutest little can see that's what I did Windows 98 hold on what the hell why windows 98 that's an oldie but a goodie what is going on oh it's a background we've been bamboozled Jake 10 yeah is it not we were Bamboozled I actually love this theme yeah yeah dude how have we never made a video on cantas we need to do it did we that's cool yeah I didn't do this for a long time because my neighbor had a insecured wireless network but I didn't do it I don't
believe you did it you did it just to see if you could you could also use the can as a microphone and then speaker talk to my neighbor pointed at his bedroom user said I was the second person to take a picture of it this week that is that's hilarious hilarious I don't understand why they need the wood though look it holds it up at the bottom but isn't that what the vase amounts for it didn't have a vase amount man I oh my God I figured it out I like the fact that it's just rubber bands the
rubber bands complete the look I would worry that the rubber bands would be blocking part of the screen this is some my dad would do he'd be like this monitor well we'll figure it out goes in the garage gets a hacksaw just yeah yeah you know what no they even did a pretty good job of the cut out here man look at this I mean okay you know they went to the uh ceiling tile School of using a jigsaw I love it but they took the time look they took the time to take the front lip off cut it and then put it
back together no damage here other than the emotional damage my Raspberry Pi  screw proba has more of a thermal mass than a lot of other stuff I I don't understand why like what is going on cooling yeah but like it's a heat sink yeah they got the compound in there it's not even thermal adhesive so you just like walk by that thing a little too aggressively and just shorts the Sho out of everything well don't do that I occasionally have to deal with ir sensors that are not easily accessible
due your fixtures I extended the IR diode and created the slim Gem of remote controls you just like stick it behind something and then do it yeah that's lovely cool this how this is how they turn the stomachs of the Teletubbies on I thought it was more like a prostate exam can you imagine you go to the clinic and the doctor pulls out a Samsung TV remote and like a long wire and he's like all right oh no I said it to Spanish oh that's uh I don't know if this is the tech support this is another
I made something janky it's going to scratch your iPad though if you have to interact with this it's going to be sh but if you're just watching a movie and you don't move you're like not ADHD you don't have to like like adjust your yourself all the time this could be reasonable this is a great novelty item you should just sell these on AliExpress for 35 cents I would buy one wanted to break out the old Wii but couldn't find the sensor so I ignored Google apparently candles yeah this is this is
classic yeah what 100% this is a thing all you need is an IR emitter there's it's not a data cable connected to it it's just power that's awesome this 100% works the sensor bar is a misnomer there is no sensor in it did they call it a sensor bar I believe so how to connect can place the sensor bar those bastards they lied to us they did door exit switch press Mouse buttons to Open Door why I hope it's actually clicking a button on screen to have a program open that would be very
clever see I'm starting to feel like some of these are actually mcgyver this is great like you had to do something and so you you made it work and you it works so you left it there most buttons you have to press both they like ired them in series you have to press IQ test I'm sure they had a good reason to do it that I cannot see I sure hope so oh my God what the heck my friend's broke an SD card someone shoved it too hard broken circuit line at the bottom right oh I see yeah yeah yeah yeah there we go
only just barely yeah that's oh that's happened to me before so they took an adapter card I don't know if you've ever popped open an SD card but they're pretty empty what a boss great job look at this the little angel hair so he did fix it oh I guess because there was no contacts anymore oh and then he just reconnected the contact great job 300 vacation photos solved that's pretty dope respect for knowing how to do that articulated monitor arms are way too expensive in my country so I built one
you just built something out of wood badly I is that tech support no that looks like Dam I like how a nice 6in Gap from the wall now it's adjustable now I don't want to dunk on because they're saying like it was too expensive for me in my country you have like the $100 Xbox controller I don't know man I don't want to judge but that seems like a lot of work for what was accomplished Best Buy requires laptop to boot an OS to do a trade in oh yeah that's oh my God that is that is genius
so you stashed it internally so you could boot this laptop to get a trade in so there's a USB a port here so they just grabbed the contacts threw them onto here so that they could close the shell no I got you yeah I'm picking up what you're putting down I love it cuz Windows doesn't like to be installed on an external drive I wonder didn't say windows just say it has to Bo so this is probably just some Linux live image that is uh very very difficult to pull off I mean to be fair that's what Apple does
what do you mean all their hard drives are soldered to the computer yeah [Laughter] this is pretty good that's what I do when I work from home it's funny cuz 7 years ago nobody knew about Mouse jigglers I bet you just do your job this is so smart so you got a binder clip a twist tie no it's a zip tie and then a painting stir stick and tape genius I'm glad that it worked wife wanted a fit bit do you think she'll like it yeah with a little OLED display it's got I like how that's really never going to
break off wife wanted to fit this costs more than a podometer you used to get pedometers in serial boxes that's true but she wanted a Fitbit so if you's got a Bluetooth adapter on there no no that's just like that's not a this is not a fit if you start sweating this catches on fire oh yeah that's real Jank oh yeah okay this is good data recovery I like it extreme respect cuz that is the board from a USB key and then if you can see the USB at the end of it has broken off
of the board I'm Amazed I'm amazed that like the traces were still intact no no no like he's it broke off and then he's put it in a USB extension and then he's gone onto the pads where the like connector would go oh I've definitely broken a USB stick in a manner where like you had to like push it up to get it to work s hard drives too 100% if you ever accidentally snapped it off sometimes you could just put it back in there reinforce with hot glue and then never look at it again my building's PA
microphone was broken these were the only supplies I could scavenge at the front desk so you close it the close it to talk and then open it again otherwise you just twist them together and like put Band-Aids on them attention students due to recent budget cuts we used our last Band-Aid is that extra tips of the bandid or is that the last of the tape that they had in their building I think that I I don't know those look like really really cheap bandaids this is definitely the kind of
Band-Aids that like your strata would buy you know when you let your dad fix your car oh my god oh no here we go ungrounded extension cord this is like bloof car that is ridiculous that's so good though that is amazing wait what do you flip it to go back down no way no way this probably required so much effort that looks like a real solution not a great one I mean if it works right but I think that's real I built myself secret Bluetooth headphones in my ear muffs so I can listen to
podcasts at work sure I guess it's like a Bluetooth board with a switch and a battery you know you can just buy these right I love it they might not be regulation at their work there's probably a reason why they don't want you listening to other stuff at your job yeah that's kind of extremely un oia to actually have music playing because you can't hear like people yelling or screaming at you this is the kind of guy who's going to drive a forklift into somebody and just drag them half a
kilometer couldn't find a big enough flash drive so oh dude that's great I installed Windows from my old Android phone one time love it because you could partition them like it was rooted and I just made a partition plugged it in installed Windows off I love it that is very clever I have done horrible things before because I didn't have a flash drive uh when you don't have a flash drive man you make do yeah you find something this fan is keeping the output matrices cool if it is moved all of the
UK TV networks will fall off air asterisk damn oh my God it's on a on a stool of some kind with there's a strap there's a strap with a box and then duct tap what this piece of paper doing here that's instructions don't worry about it don't ask questions get to word youb change the color my macard dude it is cool I flipping love this keyboard probably types like now I don't care that is so cool it's not really RGB it's just colors technically it can switch colors you just have to switch slide it just
takes a long time you have to just take the keyboard off like the back CIA that can play Doom it's like one frame every 8 hours there you go RGB think different analog maybe you think less I slept through all my phone alarms today a TENS unit what's that can basically it zaps them is this really tech support as much as it is like body support might might make me get to work on time I don't know Luke used to be late for work all the time we literally did a video on wake up Tech so that we could give Luke
whichever one was the best at the end for people who are hard of here there are actually types of alarms they like vibrate electri themselves yeah they use vibrations for mates LTD store.com electrocution alarm my friend didn't know what cable he needed so this is what he took to the store it's a carbon copy baby that's me that's great that's so smart actually genius to just do an impression instead of drawing oh I wish I was that smart cuz they're like I need a VGA cable but
it's actually a db25 or something yeah that's that's very clever also like just take a picture of it yeah how did they take how did they take this photo I don't know I didn't have the necessary female female adapters are those carrots are those carrots I have definitely attached RCA's male to male with stuff before but not carrots why did they use it audio file grade carrots cuz they're conductive that carrot looks like it's been through some why is it crusty this man's got the driest carrots ever
yeah I mean if sure they're juicy on the inside like all of us used this setup for a week or two until I had the chance to grab the had to replace the carrots once excuse me my carrots are old they've gone moldy that is such a stupid way to do that poor just like this poor segue to our sponsor manscaped they just dropped their new chairman pro package and it is packed with everything you need for a killer shave you're getting the chairman Pro Electric foil shaver power shave gel and face shave Soother
