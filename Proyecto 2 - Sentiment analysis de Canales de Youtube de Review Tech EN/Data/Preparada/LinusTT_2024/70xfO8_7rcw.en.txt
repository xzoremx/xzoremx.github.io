in the 17 years that I've been a YouTuber I've acquired a lot of tech some of it has legitimately come in handy many times for our content and some I've kept around for personal reasons like this mostly working CPU Chiller but lately I found myself asking how many optons does one man need do I even have enough computers to put all these old gpus in and how much is it costing me to store all of these cases fortunately we have a plan with our crack team of logistics specialist we
are going to be liquidating everything that you see in front of you welcome to the lonus Media Group garage sale are you guys ready to buy my stuff for  go I fix it for only 48 hours from when this video goes live you can save $10 on purchases of $50 or more with code Linus fix act quick and take advantage of this limited time deal using our Link in the video description now tell me something What's the total value of everything that is out here roughly "$882,000 and what are the odds we're"
