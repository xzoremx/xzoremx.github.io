what's up everyone welcome to the W show we've got a great show lined up for you guys today Nvidia has quietly downgraded the hardware on the RTX 470 and I got to say the timing for this is perfect just today I did the final review on a video that we have coming out on nvidia's scummy naming tactics and their renaming of cards that are not actually the same performance so we had to shoot a quick pickup when we saw the news for this and that video is going to be coming out we're going to seem like
the most the most timely coverage of that whole thing and it's only because Nvidia does it so often that we could just make a video about it whenever and probably they do something scummy uh I'm also going to be talking about the fight that I got into um during my week off here so you can see my arm got done pretty good and it's kind of harder for you guys to see but this hand is quite swollen compared to I mean I'm sure they both look small but this one is bigger than the other ones so so yeah yeah I
know I I could already yeah what else we got even without the comparison I I saw AMD walks back unrealistic ryzen 9000 benchmarks and Pelon wants to skim money from secondhand sales because apparently it wasn't already expensive who do they think they are the government  the show is brought to you today by jumpcloud MSI mend and of course our chair partner secret lab why don't we jump right into our headline topic which is NVIDIA and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] toying their lineup how do they think that this is
acceptable well I've done it a bunch of times and got away with it every single time so that's probably how not every single time talk about that at the very bottom of a News Bulletin about game ready drivers Nvidia snuck in a little sneaky announcement that they would be launching a new version of the RTX 470 with gddr 6 memory instead of gddr 6X memory in September this they said would only reduce memory bandwidth from 504 GB per second to 480 GB per second reducing bandwidth though which Nvidia says
shouldn't impact performance however none of the new variants clearly indicate on the box that they are inferior to other 407s in this small but significant and I guarantee you measurable way now Nvidia has done this many times in the past where they've made a small change to a product whether it is uh and and some times uh sometimes it actually doesn't affect anything like you probably remember back in the day that you'd want to try and get like the the 8800 GT with the Samsung memory
instead of the SK HX or or you know vice versa or whatever you know whichever memory uh whichever memory Fab was making the the chips that would overclock the best back then absolutely uh but in terms of stock operation they would run at exactly the same speed it was only overclockers that were interested in these little differences and you can you can totally yeah and and miners of course moving sort of later on and while there's obvious business advantages and real justifications for
dual sourcing parts I mean um Apple even has has dual sourced s so's for example in their iPhones uh Samsung has done it many times in their Galaxy flagships as long as everything is upfront as long as you know what you're buying I don't think you're going to see the same degree of outrage but the way that Nvidia has done this a number of times is just plain I don't know how to describe it other than wrong like occasionally they do this and they compensate in other ways like we've seen
in the past where they'll have the same model number and there will be potentially two different dieses on it like two completely different chips on it but what they might do is the one that has a wider memory bus okay it might be clocked a little bit higher uh or whatever the case may be so there could be differences in for example power consumption but not a difference in the FPS that you're going to get when you're playing uh I don't know what what's that woo wo Kang or whatever that
that new game that everyone's super excited about is Wukong black myth Wukong I think yeah black myth Wong yeah so you know what right like whatever game you're playing you're not going to get a different frame rate and for most desktop users it's not going to be the end of the world if it consumes 15 or 20 more watts this and you know what Nvidia is probably right that this I mean what does this work out to so that would be 100 GB a second would be 10% so have so so it's about a 2% or 2 to 3% difference
in memory bandwidth realistically are you going to notice that probably not but here's the thing but if it's measurable it matters Nvidia would have known that when they designed the RTX 470 they would have known the difference between gddr6 and gddr 6X memory so they obviously made a choice at that time to go with gddr 6X memory and if gddr6 has caught up to gddr 6X in terms of the um uh the transfer rates and and it's and it's and it's and it's good enough then you know what okay but then it has to be the
same then then bend them and run them at 24 gigabytes per second faster like I'm there it's so easy to poke holes in the logic if this doesn't matter then it wouldn't have mattered then and if it does matter then you need to clearly label this and the thing is that there's ample precedent for NVIDIA labeling especially their Partners labeling different memory versions of cards like you you probably remember this like way back in the day when you'd be able to buy um the same GPU but with like
desktop ddr2 instead of gddr cuz it was super cheap yeah now nvidia's just ification for this is that the gddr6 version will improve Supply and availability uh which is potentially a reference to reports from July that a batch of Micron gddr 6X memory had  QA but to me this is just such a clear cut and dried case of Nvidia needing to differentiate these cards I I am I'm really   matters I think it matters because I comes controversial take yeah fry I don't think you can give someone
something that is lesser than what has been not only advertised but released to reviewers so if people look up reviews of this thing they will see a specific and I don't the the amount that it's different is almost irrelevant to me because you're opening a door right for this to be able to happen again in the future and then what are you going to measure it every time no it's a little ridiculous you have to say if it's okay or not okay so I think it's not okay because this has been tested reviewed
people are making P purchasing decisions off of what is now incorrect information there is variance in between cards in in regards to overall performance and I could see that honestly being almost more impactful than this change in some scenarios y but I don't but that's the thing is they could stack you could get the worst die and you could get the lower memory and all of a sudden that plus or minus a couple percent from one card to the next big is a little wider and I just I don't like that I think at the
very like if you have to make a change like this just call it something slightly different and make it cheaper and the thing is that Nvidia has shown time yeah the fact that they're not even giving a discount there's no discount what do you even even if it's like 10 bucks and they've shown time and time again that they are willing to communicate differences in products I mean look back at the light hash rate cards the ones that had the uh had the borked mining capabilities don't tell me you guys that
you're not willing to communicate about a product revision yeah and it doesn't even need to be communicated in like a bad way cuz it isn't a very significant difference exactly so you don't have to call it like the bad version or whatever and it doesn't need to be a huge price drop but just like throw people a couple bones yep and call it something slightly different so there's a little bit of differentiation it can even still be 4070 4070 something 470 light 470 I don't know 470 something I don't
have a creative name for it right now it's not even that light what's their face uh ATI used to use SE um and we it was they it was for special edition obviously but the community called it slow Edition because everyone knew that usually they were downgraded in some way um and so it's like there's precedent for this there's so much precedent for this what there isn't I shouldn't say there isn't precedent for it actually I don't think there is a precedent for just releasing a slower card and calling
it exactly the same thing this type of stuff has happened with like ssds but gpus I don't think so I don't think this has been so we're we're opening up a new box here yes not good I um I'm I'm pretty frustrated and I'm the only thing that makes me happy about this is the fact that it happened right on the eve of our of our video coming out about this um cuz and I see people talking in the chat right now about times that Nvidia has Bamboozled them uh here what what am I looking yeah Archer PL in
float plane chat says 1063 gig was a fail and my biggest Tech purchase mistake and as uh as we were working on this video on nvidia's scummy naming schemes uh both the writer and I had personal stories of times when nvidia's crappy naming had had fooled them I've been fooled I mean we don't come into this hobby we don't come into this industry knowing everything and for me it was when I bought my aflon XP system way back in the early 2000s because I was an ignorant consumer and when you're
first starting out I I feel like I feel like it's so easy for people to be gatekeeper and elitist and like oh you should have known better than to believe anything you read on user benchmark everybody knows that right like it's like definitely not a lot of people actually use that site no people don't know right and and the seing to trash on it is cool because that'll help get the word out but tons of people use that but don't attack the user don't attack the ignorant user who's new so you know I
was still learning the ropes in terms of which sites could be could be trusted and and how to how to make my way through the marketing names into the actual text specs and so I bought a motherboard I spent I think it was like 20 or30 extra dollars or something like that on a motherboard that had onboard Graphics because there were different versions of nvidia's enforce 2 uh motherboard chipset one without onboard graphics and one that had GeForce 4 MX graphics and looking at that as a
consumer the latest version of GeForce that you could buy in an add-in card for like wow those are like $600 or $700 that's crazy so I can get I can get this motherboard that's just you know $30 extra dollar and it has just the last gener eration built right onto it GeForce 4 instead of GeForce 5 well that's great at least I'll be able to game it supports the version of direct X that I need to play this game I want right you got to put yourself in the mindset of somebody who who doesn't
actually know anything about this yet and so I bought a motherboard with GeForce 4 MX Graphics only to realize much later that GeForce 4 MX is almost a one for one copy paste of GeForce 2 it wasn't even remotely modern like the whole thing was just fake bull crap and to be clear GeForce 4mx was Leaps and Bounds ahead of what Intel had for onboard Graphics back then so it's not like I couldn't play my Warcraft 3 on it but what I didn't get was what I thought I was getting what the name
represented and so we pretty much it's a great video you guys are going to want to watch it we kind of run through everything that not everything but we run through some key highlights of times that Nvidia has advertised one thing and delivered another and there's a couple of recent ones that are really bad basically uh the 3056 gig is really the one that or was it the 36 yeah I think it was the 3056 gig was the one that really stood out to us as being particularly awful because it was 2
years in between the original car C and the cut down version and they call it just 306 6 gig so they differentiate only by Ram but the GPU is different right and because they launched no the GPU is the same uh for this one but the uh oh man I'm trying to I'm trying to remember all the different things that are different no the clock speed is cut way down uh Kuda cor are down I believe the die is the same okay don't don't quote me on that though these are all details that I'm that I'm going through
as we're working on the video Yeah and not going through in my brain right now but basically the reason that I really didn't like that one and the reason that that one inspired this video was because it was 2 years later and when Nvidia launched that GPU kind of like this one they just did a little sneaky sneak launch there's a blog post on their site and that's pretty much it and was it at like the B wasn't this one at the bottom uh this one was at the bottom of a game
ready driver bulletin the other one got its own it got its own blog post but like they didn't seat it to reviewers um so only found a handful of reviews on it and because of the um because of the the large viewership on those older videos from two years ago and because of the similarity in the keywords even if you explicitly search for the uh for the um the 30506 gig even if you explicitly search for that you end up with results for the 3058 gig which could easily make
you think that you're getting something that is sign ific better than what you're actually buying and and because very few people even reviewed this later card it's it's really it's just really hard to tell that it is a completely separate card especially because as they released the 6 gig version they didn't even revise the name of the original one to add 8 gig to it so there's just 3050 and 3056 gig yeah if I if I was even as a relatively informed consumer if I was looking at that I would assume it was
just a ram difference between the Cards and we talk about that we talk about how a lot of regular consumers especially the ones buying a more mid-range or entry-level gaming card they're going to be relying on a sales rep at a big box store they are not necessarily going to be the ones that are going and pouring over articles and review videos and honestly with experience of this a lot of sales rep at Big Box store people are not going to look into it they're just going to see the the size difference of
the memory and then try to sell that to users as they're the same thing but there's more RAM on this one and and that's not I don't even blame them because if you could be even a fairly knowledgeable sales rep and if you were just a little bit out of date like you used to be able to buy cards that were the exact same cards 8800 um GTS is an example it was available with 320 megabytes or 640 megab of vram and if you weren't running at a high resolution so you you know you weren't going to buy
two of them and run them in SLI and hook them up to a 1600p monitor or whatever else if you weren't doing that the 320 megabyte version performed exactly the same there's also like ever expecting a like minimum wage sales rep to go above and beyond just reading the card is like and so even if though even if they had some of that knowledge and knew oh yeah the bigger frame buffer is more important if you're going to run at a high resolution or if you're going to install a bunch of texture mods and
stuff like that they could still end up misleading the customer yeah so the fact that this was done so quietly is I guess what what demonstrates that Nvidia knows that what they're doing is wrong right like it's like when your kids uh it's like when your kids are you know watching TV right if they if they know they're not supposed to be doing it the volume's weigh down you know so you come in you're like hey you know you're not supposed to be watching T oh no I didn't know I didn't know okay well why is the
TV muted and you're watching with subtitles you don't do that normally uh uh uh right like this is one of those things where I feel like this is something that happened they're they well actually my kids are really good I'm uh maybe talking about my own childhood here ah okay gotcha yeah now were they really good or have they just learned very well how to hide things uh I really I really doubt that yeah no no no no cuz like look they they don't have to ask permission to like watch TV when I'm sleeping in so
they they can't like get busted for that is that like a fun rule that you have like if you sleep in too long they just do whatever until you wake up not do what like turn on when you wake up they can't do whatever but it's a little more Loosey Goosey if I if I need a a morning sleep in yeah that's kind of fun um I mean that's like why Saturday morning cartoon existed you know right so you got to continue the tradition Saturday morning do whatever um all right why don't we move on to I want to talk about
pelaton sure yeah this is freaking wild so our source here is the Verge and also peltin directly because they appear to have no shame about this in a recent earnings call peltin announced that they will be adding a $95 activation fee for secondhand exercise machines in the US and Canada this does not apply to refurbished machines bought through peltin but it does apply to any machine bought directly from its previous owner thanes the fee will apparently cover a virtual custom fitting which we
have no idea what that means for bike and Bike plus customers and a history SL summary of the device a regular price "machine is $1,445" while used bikes range from $300 to $500 there's likewise a $44 monthly membership fee to access peltin content so I think I've talked about this um I think I've talked about this a fair bit whether it's on the WAN show or whether it's scrapyard Wars or wherever else if you want to know the value of something you don't look at the retail price yeah
the value of something is what it's worth on the secondhand market now that doesn't mean that you should never buy anything new because if you look at something on the secondhand market and you go oh wow that still costs 80% of what a brand new one does boy I would sure like a a brand new warranty and this is a piece of exercise equipment you know I would just love to have something that nobody ever sweated on uh or whatever the case a lot of them are designed to that that is very fair a lot
of them are designed to be very easily clean know but I mean if they do have little rips and tears and stuff it can really seep in there it can get it can get real gross or you know I want to know for sure that what I'm buying hasn't been in a has been in a smokefree household you know whatever your personal sensitivities are right then I think there's absolutely a valid case to be made for paying extra and getting a brand new X you know whatever it is um but when you go to the secondhand
"market and you go hm these are $1,500" new and I can pick one up for like $400 why exactly is it that people are "willing to let these go for ,000 less" than what they're worth because that's how much they're worth um and in the case of peltin I think it's pretty clear that with the $44 monthly membership fee that that is a huge drag on the value of these machines because people buying secondhand are generally not that into paying $500 a year in order to continue to use
something that they've bought they tend to be value conscious so what the used Market is is it's a barometer for what a value conscious person is willing to pay for something so it can kind of help you sort of realign and if you decide look I want a peleton regardless then that's totally your decision and I'm not going to tell you what you can or can't spend your money on but what I will tell you is that there's obviously a group out there that is looking at the value proposition of this thing and going wow
that is absolute Madness so let's talk about why this activation fee exists then so for one thing obviously peltin is recognizing that these extremely low priced secondhand machines are hurting their ability to sell new machines because they're opening people's eyes to what this product is is worth when you have to pay such an obnoxiously High prescri uh prescription uh subscription fee for it the other thing that peltin is doing is they are trying to make these used products less appealing
because if a brand new one doesn't have the activation fee but a secondhand one does then it's almost like putting it's almost like a country putting import tariffs on competing let's say for example uh Vehicles right so you're essentially saying okay well our product is not competitive our domestic product is not competitive so instead of making it competitive uh we're just going to um add a disadvantage to anything that gets imported to any other option on the market and to be clear I'm not saying
that import tariffs are always uh just sort of protectionist [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] um there are cases where you could look at a particular industry and the way that it's getting subsidized by a foreign adversary and go hm I couldn't help noticing that you're selling these way below cost that it would cost to make them um in an effort to destroy our domestic industry in the long term um that's a type of warfare and I would actually prefer if you didn't do that there's also lots of other things like
data collection that happens through devices and like absolutely a pretty considerable amount of other reasons why you might not want to just have no tariff full open market stuff I'm just using it as as an example to demonstrate the other kinds of approaches that exist to sure up the competitiveness of our own uncompetitive product when there are other options available uh peltin suffered significant financial losses last year $241 million while its losses this year look to be relatively modest
at just $3 million this is something that I've had a really hard time figuring out um how uh how do you lose $30 million "selling $1,500" exercise bikes I'm trying to look this up apparently they have 3584 employees why I'm really trying to figure that part of that question out I don't know yet is that what you've been sitting typy typing away on your computer oh no I was I'm planning a a video actually am I being am I being Bamboozled or Hoodwinked a quote of yours is maybe being questioned oh yes
why what did I say uh that you can I think the quote was that you can guarantee that there is a measurable difference of the new gpus oh yeah so we're going to go see oh okay I don't know if it'll actually be a video but we're going to go see look hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey measurable measurable can be very small you just have to be able to abble measure abble measure measure abble measurable yeah but yeah I know I'm trying to figure out like what what do they actually do the instructors seem to
be like would imagine they contractors live people this isn't like recordings so Pelon instructor makes $29.11 an hour okay that seems uh like a weird choice but sure um I mean if that's part of their stick though is like hey it's you know $44 a month but it's an actual person y yep I can see that it laid off about 12% of its staff at around 500 people in October of 2022 but it still has the like 30 400 employees okay um and yeah I don't know what they all do all day necessarily I'm sure
something all right um there's a lot of companies like I've I've looked into quite a few that I'm just like man like what people are like marketing basically but that's like that's such a weird thing to me like I um I feel like the whole the whole calculation has just gotten kind of perverted in a sense like by the VC money that is dumping into that is dumping into whatever industry it is right so okay peltin takes on a bunch of VC money that they use to buy up basically every ad it juices up the
price of the ads which effectively is just like causing even themselves to throw more Mone more money into the into the money furnace and then it makes it so that you know anyone else who wants to advert in that vertical is going to be paying so much and it's and it's by definition it's at the point of unsustainability these ads are clearly costing more in customer acquisition than they're making back from selling the bikes well well that's not that's not a good it doesn't work why don't
they just stop paying an amount for ads that they can't recoup and I'm sure there's reasons for this right like I'm sure pettin CEO if they have to answer to their shareholders about why their shipment volumes are down 30% it was just like well I'm not willing to pay that much for ads then you know the the investors in ptin are going to look at that and they're going to go yeah but this other you know Exercise Bike Company they're buying lots of ads and they're eating up
all of our market share and and it's a subscription business so ultimately they're hoping to make money from you in the very long term anyway so if this acquisition cost just keeps going up then I don't know maybe we'll just increase the subscription price and maybe we'll add a maybe we'll add a what's it called virtual custom fitting with a $95 activation fee and just extract even more money have you figured out why peltin spend so much money well one of the ideas is that I
didn't realize they had their own dedicated physical stores oh that's stupid yeah okay and it doesn't seem like a very insignificant amount of them uh like there's four between Vancouver and Seattle really yeah why do you need okay why do you need need one um man I remember having this conversation with NC leadership way back in the day I pitched ncx light um and basically what I wanted it to be was like I don't know so here what's what's the the the plate we're sitting on right
"now is I think about 1,800 Square ft so" what I had in mind was something in the neighborhood of about a third of this so like 500 to 600 ft and essentially what it is is do you remember how some of the ncies back in the day were essentially just like a couple computers in the front where you could browse their website or other websites but usually their website they preferred if you stuck to their website instead of comparison shopping so a couple computers where you could browse
their website a small back room and what I what I pitched and this was honestly one of the big friction points cuz I was like look I only want to carry like the top three products in a category like we're going to have uh like at the time this would have been cuz it's not really supposed to be a browsing experience yeah this would have been probably what like second gen core or something like that so okay so we're going to or like maybe third gen so we're going to have the
3700k we're going to oh no that would have been later so we'll have the 2600k the 2500k and then like one you know value AMD option we basically take our top three selling C CPUs that's it we take our top three selling Ram skes so basically enough to build like the most commonly built computer exactly and then whatever you have a small small Tech area where you could take on like a half a dozen uh probably about similar to like Keith's back room but he does a lot of so that at black black lab computers
but he does a lot of mobile and that really wasn't mobile technician stuff was not a thing that NC did back then um so we wouldn't have been doing that we'd be doing desktops only so you'd have a small like intake area and a couple workbenches for doing servicing and then what I had pitched was that we would essentially have our trucks which we already had so we already had kind of our truck Fleet that went between the stores is we would have a truck that just drove back and forth between the DC
and the stores continuously so that people could save on shipping and use it as a as a pickup Depot this was years before Amazon implemented their pickup Depot concept yeah um so to pay the rent the idea was that we would do the servicing there we had a trusted brand name and then to effectively um and then to uh bolster the etail business we would have uh this this kind of this fixed cost essentially of these trucks going back and forth between the DCS uh so that you could go get anything you
needed in an emergency and then you could get any of the more esoteric stuff within let's say you know 3 to 4 days or whatever it works out to but with free shipping I think it would have been an absolute game Cher and basically I'm looking at this peltin thing and I'm going if their stores are any more than like a bike they're not yeah I okay what are they if they have cafes in them see that's what I'm talking about like if if they kept it really simple and it was just an
experience location and it's absolutely tiny I'd be I'd be totally fine with that and probably the overhead would be way less I got to say man traveling overseas really opens my mind sometimes in terms of how um how broken and how bureaucratic the way we do things here are like I'm not saying that we should go full like anyone can run their own electrical wire up to the you know the pole or whatever like you see in some really scary images I'm not saying that we should just completely deregulate
everything but I remember staying in that gaming Hotel back in Taiwan like 5 years ago Dude the the like retail experience in Taiwan is amazing dude that hotel was just a floor of an office building yeah that they renovated and turned into a hotel why does a hotel have to be in its own dedicated giant building that's zoned hotel and only Hotel why can't when we first showed up I thought that was super weird within an hour I was like oh it literally doesn't matter at all yeah why do we care about
this in in fact it's way better because now if I had business with a company that worked on a different floor of that building I can just stay in the hotel that's on a different floor of the same building you also just like as you're as you're going out in the morning you go downstairs of the hotel and there's a 7-Eleven the hotel doesn't have to make its own like probably garbage restaurant because most Hotel restaurants suck some of them are great but most of them suck yep um like I yeah I don't know it's
cool zoning laws yeah so they need to needful doer says says fire code line is fire code well no you should still absolutely adhere to fire code but what is the difference between the fire code of an office building and the fire code of a hotel building they're both a high-rise structure who cares what I put on this floor or what I put on that floor and if you're going to tell me okay look lonus you're going to have to you're going to have to deal with you know the maximum occupancy of the of the
highest occupancy sort of permitted use of the building true fine no problem yeah but why do we have this extremely rigid approach to things why is it that the second Apple opened up these experience stores every retailer and their dog is sitting here going okay how do I use the square footage that I have in my location in the least efficient way possible like I've told you about my game that I like playing at airports right you don't know about my airport game you probably have but I can't think
of it off oh this is my okay it's less fun these days now that I have played it enough that I have some idea but I had this game that I invented for myself back when I used to fly a lot and I called it um how much does that cost oh yes okay no no that costs how much that's what that's what I used to call it that's that costs how much so what I would do is I would walk around and there's an airport in is it is it Beijing Shanghai I don't know shenzen whatever one of the one of the big
Chinese airports has a mall behind it have been to toson Mills like the big mall in seen pictures of so one of the Chinese airports can't remember which one has a mall behind security you literally cannot access this shopping mall unless you have an an aircraft ticket and you have gone through security I swear to God it's like bigger than toson Mills it is freaking enormous to be fair I'm assuming an incredible amount of people go through there every day um if they make it work who cares it's
freaking enormous anyway so a lot of airports have shockingly large shopping centers in them and something that I would always wonder to myself is you know other than a bag of Jolly Ranchers what are people buying at the airport cuz sometimes it's not even like dutyfree right or oh really yeah and sometimes there's not even like a a huge cost advantage or whatever like why are you buying jewelry at an airport yes it's gold it's a commodity it costs whatever it cost in general I have no idea
why almost any store that isn't like a restaurant or a convenience store or like a in case you forgot it charger headphone data cable pillow thing store I don't understand why any stores other than those really exist who's buying who's buying a luxury watch at the airport I don't get it but anyway anyway sorry so my game that cost how much impulse buying don't do that what are you what are you impulse buying a "$30,000 time piece for stop it get some" anyway my so my game is I would walk
until I found a store whose name I didn't recognize okay um so I I first became aware of Louis Vuitton when a friend of mine in high school dropped by my house to do something and they wouldn't get out of their car because our driveway wasn't paved and Lou Vuitton shoes they had Louis Vuitton shoes and that was one of it's like a I have some core memories of times when I have laughed at people like not like you idiot but just like like I couldn't stop laughing and it was at a
person over the ABS just utterly ridiculous way that they were behaving one of the other times was when someone explained to me the concept of a land party which I have now come around to but as a normie it was pretty funny I'm sorry you all get your you all get your computers you set them all up next to each other like I just that in hindsight is hilarious it is it's ridiculous you them now you network them all together oh no I don't mean that part I mean you laughing at them is is there any grass to
touch so wait how early were you a computer nerd at what age did you not know when you were laughing at people for this dude I was in like grade 10 when did you get into computer this this was the summer after grade 10 I didn't get into computers till like after you even though I'm years older than you huh dude we've been through this my M I mean like I liked playing video games but the concept of me and a bunch of like sweaty freaking guys networked together in a room playing games I was like that's
what you did for your birthday party don't you have laser tag do you not play paintball that's like every birthday party I had after I was like 14 or something yeah exactly right so that was one of them and then one of the other ones that sticks out of my mind is the time that buddy wouldn't get out of his car at my house because he was afraid of getting his Louis Vuitton shoes dirty he was like they're Louis Vuitton I'm like what does that even mean what what's a Louis Vuitton
and why would I care is that like Nike or whatever he's "like these are $1,300 shoes or whatever" and like I lost it I was like I'm sorry I thought the function of shoes is to keep your feet from getting dirty but you can't even walk in them like what what's the point of them you can't even walk walk on something anyway he was not impressed prettying we haven't been in touch since high school um the point the point is I recognize that you know like I I recognize um like some of some of the you know the
more mainstream but dude I I promise you as someone who's not into the world of high fashion if you were to go to one of those like luxury malls you probably wouldn't even recognize the names of over half no I know over half of these stores even just walking through the airport I find new ones basically every time yeah so the game is you go you have to go to one you don't recognize and then you have to usually it's best if you're with someone you have to play Price's right rules and you have to try
to guess how much it costs without going over and I swear to God it's practically impossible never going to go over it's well no no no no oh you can you can but it's so hard because the difference "between a $2,000 sneaker" "and a $4,000 sneaker is not evident to" me there was a bunch of uh Italian super luxury brands that just got brutally ousted I don't know if you saw this I hope I didn't get any of this wrong it's not in the dock but um there was like a raid on a manufacturing place in
somewhere in Italy I believe it was was because they wanted to be able to keep saying that their stuff was made in Italy yeah but they wanted to be able to get it made for cheaper so they were basically running like a sweat shop but in Italy um and they found like in the raid it came out like what the actual materials that were used and stuff because there was like some I believe there was some form of legal process so certain documents were revealed to the public it's like insanely like I don't
"know like $20,000 purse $40 of leather" type situation well yeah 50 I think it "was 50,000% markups dude and stuff a cow" is a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] a cow is a cow like having having spent some time now in the apparel industry I I can tell you guys it doesn't cost that much more to make a high quality I mean look actually oh yeah I want I wanted to talk about this this week uh we won the overall uh highest highest grade on Project Farms YouTuber merch uh t-shirt test yeah that
was cool so we didn't come out on top in terms of uh what were the two categories Comfort or dur ility uh we weren't the softest that was one of the big knocks against us for comfort and um our our material fade was on the higher side compared to some of the other ones but I mean I can I could talk for a very long time about the trade-offs that exist so softness can often come at the cost of more peling yeah and Todd did really well on did notice that we don't have a lot of pilling there's there's reasons
why we do the things that we do um anyway the difference between our shirt in terms of of my cost on on it compared to like a like a hannes b you know like just a bottom bottom of the barrel like mainstream shirt is not much it's like a few dollars that's why even with printing which is done here in Canada and on both sides we still do the uh okay this is a staff shirt from LTX but whatever we still do the little LT logo in the back even with both Sid screen printing high quality screen printing uh
we scored really well on our screen printing quality as well and the durability of our prints outstanding which we already knew but hey it's good to have third parties validate these things um even with that that's why our shirts are still $ 199.99 um a lot of merch shirts are 30 or even $40 or more you go to a concert you're probably paying $50 $60 for a shirt easily that is not that shirt does not cost three times what this one costs higher quality materials don't cost that
much they do tend to put our products at the higher end of what a you know given category will cost but I don't think completely outlandish um and so yeah it doesn't surprise me at all to find out "that that $40,000 purse is made out of" you know 40 bucks or a couple hundred bucks worth of leather apparently that I was just skimming over an article for it I I this isn't a prep topic if you're interested in it you should look into it yourself but yeah it was it was like
Dior and a couple other brands like that but they they end end up finding that they had inhumane working conditions for the manufacturing of the stuff um and they were they were buying I think it was a bag was $57 and it was selling for 2600 or something like that um so like there's obviously no reason for the inhumane working conditions when you're making that much margin um there's never a good reason for inhumane working conditions but I do kind of Wonder with some of the clientele for those types of
products if does that make it better this what make it better the inhumane working conditions oh that's a weird psychological dive that we're not going to be able to answer right now but feel the suffering yeah like I wonder sometimes like I don't care if it's suffered for this does it feel leather I don't think anyone would directly say that but unless you're in private company but the Rarity of it the unattainability of it is absolutely the point yeah because we know that the
point is not the quality yeah the point is that other people can see you with it um and so with that in mind by definition in order to be rare it has to cost so much that can't attain it if time is money then that means money is time so it has to be worth so much time that the only way to have it is that your time is worth so much more than someone else's time if that makes sense and so with that in mind kind of Yeah Yeah Tim in fing chapter said blood diamonds are a coveted thing yeah really it's kind of
the same deal I didn't know that oh they totally are yeah well I thought I thought blood diamond is just an expr people want real diamonds they don't care if the manufactured ones are like just as good or the same or whatever want like real pulled out of the ground diamonds which basically results in but you can you can buy Canadian diamonds for example like he ring is Canadian yeah a lot of people don't bother oh yeah it's like totally a thing oh okay um H anyways maybe on to anyway
Phil H says what I really value about your t-shirts is they don't shrink that is another interesting thing that Todd observed I believe we were uh the highest or no I think we were the second I think we were the second best for shrinkage and I got to send the most fun email that I've sent in a long time to our fashion team uh when I saw his test so Todd didn't talk to us about this at all he just ordered shirts I guess and uh I found out about the video at the same time you guys did um so that's
generally how he does this I watched it with my butt clenched you know how it is and I was very excited to see that we scored extremely well um but what Todd as in his every man style you know might not necessarily realize is the is the why behind some of the things that he observes I was just going to bring up the chart at the end but you should probably go watch the video instead yeah no you guys should go watch the video so if you if you go watch the video at a certain point I you can tell you when at
a certain point he puts a chart up on screen you can see the overall scores for everything but you should go watch it yourself so um so yeah so he doesn't necessarily get into the into the why and what I can tell is that anything cotton is going to shrink so if a garment doesn't shrink and it has like any percentage of cotton in it what it means is that it's pre-shrunk it means that there's an additional step there's an additional cost that went into the production of that garment in order to
safeguard it from uh warm uh warm washing and especially hot drying and uh what's funny is I am the driving force um this is one of those things we have a great team and they do the hard work of you know sourcing and and and QA and validation and and like uh you know like we man we have capabilities that we wouldn't have even dreamed of you know 5 years ago when we started up creater Warehouse like Tatiana is amazing you you be like yeah so I need something that's antimicrobial and I need it to do
this I need to do that and she comes back a few weeks later with like different swatches and she's like yeah well this one's tensil and this one's this and this one's that we looked into silver but it's like super super harmful so we're not going to that it's like yeah we have like we do like Material Science now and stuff super I know Sil was harmful yeah yeah anyway I don't know much about that stuff so I'm not surprised yeah yeah yeah no that's fine that's fine but the point is one of I am
the way that I see it I'm kind of like our our prototypical customer right and like you guys would even with your particular body dimensions yeah but I I mean I mean in terms of like the things that matter to me right is like you guys wouldn't follow this channel if you didn't have anything in common with me so when I kind of get something in my head and I go no this is really important I I tend to kind of I tend to kind of until I've seen evidence to support otherwise I tend to be like this
about it and the fashion team has been pushing me for a long time they're like look the shrinking doesn't matter that much because as hold on hold on because as long as we have proper care instructions people should follow the hold hold on people should follow the care instructions and then they won't have any issues as long as they as long as they wash cold and and lie flat to dry they're not going to have any concerns and you know what we will do garments occasionally that really do
need to be treated but hold on hold it hold hold please hold please we will do garments occasionally if they if there's a particular reason there's a particular fit or feel that we're trying for and there's just absolutely no other way to do it that require proper care but in general I I always tell the team I'm like look if it can't be hucked into the washer on warm and hued into the dryer we can't ship it to our audience and so I got to send them one of my most fun emails in a long time when I was like
hey did you guys see we killed it on the shrinking which is also good by the way for the longevity of the print um sense we killed it on the shrinking um because we insist on pre-shrinking sometimes we multiple times pre-wash and pre-shrink our our base materials before we construct our garments um so we killed it because I keep insisting on this and I couldn't help noticing that Todd for his test hawed all the t-shirts and the washer on warm and hucked them all in the
dryer once again Linus's laziness saves the day and they I got an immediate email back like oh I was cringing so hard watching that my my I've I've been informed that things that I have have uh washing instructions on labels that I've never read before and I've just basically been like well we'll see what happens cuz like I'm not I just even if I treat it correctly the time someone tells me the next time it goes through it's just going to be in the laundry hamper I'm going to toss the whole laundry hamper
in the thing um if if doing the laundry takes if doing like a load of laundry just putting in the Watcher than putting in the dryer takes more than just picking up as much clothes as I can and shoving it in all at once I'm not going to do it yep that's it fun two says line is so proud stingy rules this is not stinginess we pay extra to make sure that our garments can handle being treated the way that I treat my garments because he knows a lot of the audience is probably going to treat it that way
and I bet you well over 50% of this audience would treat it that way yep so like like it was really important to wear test um these cargo pants so these are launching really soon uh we actually we have the stock oh we just haven't launched yet uh these are launching really soon I'm really excited uh but one of the things that we wanted to see cuz they will fade uh this material will fade but we wanted to make sure that they were going to fade with like a nice patina so Titan's been
wearing them constantly Andrew has been wearing them constantly I've been wearing them constantly we've been beating the crap out of these cargo pants and there's a few things we found uh like the magnet for the detached in mind so we made sure we reinforced that that's why you got a wear test that's why if you are if you are a company leader and you don't use your company's products you're Flying Blind yeah you're absolutely Flying Blind because the people who are going to notice these
problems they don't have the voice to affect change you got to notice them for yourself so so we got that changed anyway so speaking of patina these are now covered in chlorine stains um they've like faded out uh just from being washed many times I've got blood stains on them right now um I'll I'll explain my arm and the blood stains on my pants uh had a thing happened yesterday um I'm still wearing these from yesterday whatever don't judge me I'm on vacation this week um anyway what
I me they're pants right you change your underwear you're all good yeah exactly exactly right yeah yeah I wear new fresh underwear every day so whatever um anyway.com underwear very excited about these These are coming soon LTT store.com I forget the point that I was getting at but we are not it's not about cheaping out it's about designing for um you know the gamer lifestyle you know I I I think you know the typical gamer should be applauded for washing their clothes at all let alone proper care
instructions I I got to set my expectations at a reasonable level for y'all yeah yeah see I've attended enough land parties now that I know I know my people okay I know my people especially as well if if it was like notably communicated on the website while I was buying a product that there was special care instructions I just wouldn't buy it like straight up because I would be like oh well I I'll ruin that so I might as well just go for someone else and there are other options right so it's
like I don't know why deal with the one that I know I'm going to ruin speaking of garments from LT store.com I'm actually not sure if you guys have clued into this one yet let's see if it's one of the oh yeah it's one of the top selling products today all right we're going to show this while we explain merch messages uh merch messages are the way to interact with the show they go to producer Dan who's going to pop your merch message uh down there yeah exactly exactly down there or reply to it
himself or forward it internally or curate it for me and Luke to talk about and to send a merch message you don't want to send any twitch bits or any super chats like that you want to send merch messages so that in addition to throwing money at your screen and you know chatting with Dan or putting up a a post on the bottom of the on the bottom of the show you can also get high quality merchandise in the mail and I'm very excited to announce the hot fix  is oh man you want to throw one on yes I
just I wanted to check on the Scribe driver and just found that it is yet again entirely sold out yeah how fast that what you think was going to happen I knew but I think it was three or four "days this time my goodness it was 10,000" pens wasn't it yep okay this is yours is there oh this is the hot fix patch hoodie this one's fun when you order you will get one of three patches here I'm just going to do a line cam for a second here so there are three different patches that could be stitched onto our
iconic tie dye hoodie that we debuted last year during LTX um there's about a 95% chance that you're going to get a wow inspired patch which is the one that Luke and I are wearing right now oh one moment please  on technical difficulties I was going to do that this might be a little hot for today but we'll see how it goes ah yes a 95% chance that you will get a Wan inspired patch like this uh or there's a 5% chance that you will get the elusive bread sorus patch oh it says oh what and a
0.1% chance that you will get the ultra rare purple bread sorus oh we don't have one to show physically so the store will be the best way to show it uh these hoodies are individually tie-dyed not printed so you'll always get a unique pattern they're available now on LTT store.com in limited quantities at lm. g/ hot fix you know what really funny do these come already on or you have to fix them no these come already on okay and we know that you know what they could be like they could seem a little bit more
you know attached more better uh we know uh but basically the reason they're called the hot fix and this is actually funny because people are pointing out what you figured out how to get loot box mechanics onto the store I mean this isn't the first time what do you got what do you guys we do have mystery products we literally okay yeah we got mystery products ni dude whether they whether they admit it or not whether they know it or not people people love loot box stuff this sweater
not technically the one with the patch but it's the same sweater um is hold on hold on no no I'm okay go ahead and I'll be right back I'll be right back is extremely comfy and it's the sweater that I keep at work for that reason I like it very much the Dropout hoodie is also extremely comfy all are but those ones in particular but I find this one this one's like a little bit a little bit lighter I think yeah I want to steal the bread sorus one you could probably get it from
him I think he has two probably be murdered you won't even know dude throw  here oh computer's broken stream's over thanks look you won't even know I'll put it on the list where's the other one oh oh good timing wait did you throw that yeah so that's uh what is that oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so on oh yeah on my week off the team yells at me whenever I wear this because whenever I wear it on camera because you can't buy it oh yeah yeah yeah yeah so when I'm on my time
off this is the hoodie I was wearing cuz they're so comfy that I specifically took off so that I could come in and do wo in something oh actually I'm wearing an LTX t-shirt anyway so that I could come and do W show that was never on sale whatever the oh yeah I guess the staff LT actually um this is too warm for me to wear right now especially when I was running over there right now but the point is it's a great hoodie uh here's how what it looks like extremely well worn yeah um you
also have to remember that all all the dieses are individual so some of this white I suspect was already probably there H yeah it is yeah yeah yeah cuz you can see a little bit on this one y no no that's that's just part of the that's just part of the the tie lus has more on the back of his shoulder and stuff like that on his yeah okay oh yeah yeah there you go yeah it's such a cool hoodie you guys anyway the reason the patches are gigantic and like kind of weird is because they're covering um we
had a batch of these where the LTX was printed at an angle are printers really you remember this now yes I do are printers really good but he you know what I'm going to call it a team fail because he didn't notice we didn't notice and we ended up with an entire batch of hoodies for LTX that had the LTX at an angle that was unacceptable um I I made the call it was a painful call but we basically redid it so people in fling chat are already planning on on removing the patches so they can have
LTX sweaters I wouldn't do that I believe they use uh adive oh okay like or like a wax or whatever you're not going to want to do that that you're going to end up you're going to end up with an even bigger patch on it to cover up the mess that you make when you remove this patch do not do that okay good thing show um but that's why the patches are like so awkwardly kind of big because this is have to cover it it's the hot fix yeah that makes sense it's a it's a we're we're just we're
patching in a fix yeah um so anyway yeah guys check out the hot fix patch hoodie it's a really nice hoodie for 60 bucks um whoa yeah has all that red there I think it's really they're unique yep oh yeah no it's real tie-dye which costs more you know cuz that's how we roll baby some of them have really cool patterns some of them have really not quite as cool patterns but still really cool patterns so there's the there's The elusive ultra rare bread sorus patch yeah yep all right I'm so sorry I'm going to
have to take this off though because I am I probably won't be able to keep on for the whole show I'll do what I can I didn't go for a run so bit easier okay I I will maybe put it back on but dude I am I am sweating uh merch messages then so if you place an order on the store in the cart you'll get a little box that pops up you can leave a merch message and it'll it'll go to us and Dan can show you guys kind of how it works he'll he'll Cate a few merch messages for us here what do we got Dan yeah sure I
actually have one that's on topic um let's see hi are you are you implying that normally I am not on topic no normally normally the merch messages are not on topic with you were just talking about so I'm blaming our audience it's their fault uh hi congrats on the good project Farm rating I've been interested in shirts printed with discharge ink are there any major concerns or major cons to the process it seems like nothing from LTT store uses it what I'm going to be honest with you
um what's that we use what our printer uh uses he has a lot of experience I think you guys saw on the project Farm that our our print quality is extremely high so whatever we use is what he uses and I tend to be the kind of person where if my experts tell me something um then you know you can ask some questions about it but I I tend to uh I tend to not believe that I know best when it comes to like I I realized this is a little bit contradictory cuz I just said that I argue with my fashion team
about like car instru and whatever else but that's me knowing the customer that's different when it comes to them telling me okay well with all of your design guidelines in mind here's what you use I I got to defer right I got to I got to trust my experts and if my experts screw up enough times well then you know we have we have to have a tough conversation right but at the end of the day I am not a screen printing expert all I know is that our quality is outstanding which I've have observed for
myself and we just and which I have heard from our customers one project farm and which we just one project farms uh round up for so so I I know this and so if Marco says hey here's what I'm going to use I say yes sir you want you want to know something that I thought was pretty interesting about the the project Farms thing is it was like kind of what I would expected like most when he when he when he like showed all the shirts that he was going to test I was like yeah I like
kind of expect that one's going to end there it wasn't exactly I was off on a few of them but like and I didn't do exact proper wrote down guesses but like things performed about what you would expect it's on the one hand there's a lot of details but on the other hand it's not that hard to like pick up a garment and go oh yeah this is like not a quality garment or or it is um I just think a lot of people are not really used to it and don't have an eye for it and like I
dude I see so many comments from people being like Oh yeah I never really cared about shirts and then like I bought from one from LT and then I immediately bought the four pack on Lime day and now that's just like what I wear now yeah cuz it it it's I don't know it's nice and it's such a compared to socks for example um shirts are so easy to treat yourself once and then have really nice shirts like like t-shirts basically forever like I I wear the crap out of my rotation of shirts and they last a
really long time like I wear through even really high quality socks I'll wear through them pretty quickly just because of badminton but um man shirts they they can last a really long time when they don't suck so to me it's a pretty it's a pretty reasonable um investment I'm surprised we don't have white blanks I can explain that please do uh we target a very light wearing shirt and you actually probably saw that in the project Farm Roundup there were some that were heavier heavier does not
necessarily mean more could indicate it could but it doesn't necessarily and it comes with tradeoffs um so we live in a in a temperate climate and we also sort of philosophically will layer up um as opposed to like wear a heavier t-shirt um I guess and so uh our shirts are designed to be highly breathable um really lightweight a little bit stretchy to be a bit more accommodating of of different body types and those are things that are not necessarily the easiest thing to achieve with a heavier
fabric uh we also really like the way our shirt hangs and that's something that you tend to lose with a heavier fabric as well because the weight is weight it's literal weight and so it will pull and it will tend to fit a little bit tighter at the top and it'll tend to Bunch up more at the bottom um another reason that oh go ahead what does it have to do with it being white I'm getting to that okay so our light shirts in white would be very friendly ah we did experiment with a heavier
shirt um that makes sense yeah a heavier a heavier all cotton uh white shirt and You' have like all the colored blanks and then separately the white blanks yeah um I forget why we ultimately killed it but we decided that we're not going to have a white shirt oh okay so you're not even going to do like a different version of it the reason we didn't start with a white shirt because you would think a plain white shirt is literally the vanilla of places to start is because whenever I get a white shirt
it takes me about a month to have a pasta stain on it and I figured we are kin right um do you guys really want a white shirt it's the same reason we don't make white mouse pads yeah Sarah talked me into doing one special edition light colored mouse pad once the GPU Wasteland one and within I think a couple of months of her dailying it she was like I get it we're never doing a white mouse pad again I was like you better believe it cuz it was like it had like coffee stains everywhere and
stuff and Sarah's not even she's not a slobby person like I've literally spent time in her workpace literally spent time in in her home like we've we've socially hung out um she's not a slob or anything it just happens man yeah especially you got like you got pets and all exactly right stuff happens and so do pet things some sometimes yeah man we we don't oh yeah so here's here's the cotton shirt um I don't believe we're restocking it but apparently we do we do have it but that's why it's on a
separate page cuz it had to be 100% cotton for some reason and then it had to be uh it had to be thicker yeah there you go so that is literally just what we do 220 GSM compared to 165 and so from watching that video that means this one will shrink right or is this one pre- it will but it's pre-shrunk yep okay it'll shrink more than our regular one but probably not that much mhm sorry this entire show has just turned into like garment discussion that really was my intention I never really cared and then
I watched the project farm video and I'm like hm all these like little pieces of I I have learned a lot in the last 5 years um this is getting to be too hot sorry yeah yeah no I mean it's it's one of those things like when Gerald undone came for the studio tour and like the team had like prepped him I guess they were just like making fun of me but had prepped him that like I only know computers I'm not going to know anything about cameras so his part of his shtick for the tour was that he was going to
like gotcha me on like not knowing you know lenses and cameras and and capture uh utilities and you know media and stuff like that and halfway through the tour he was like this isn't even fun because you like know everything and it's just like yeah the thing is you can't I don't believe that as a as a leader you can make make Intelligent Decisions if you don't ask questions and if you don't listen to the answers like how am I supposed to have an intelligent argument with my team about something
like video frame rate if I don't understand their perspective because the best way to win an argument is to open with here's your perspective that I can demonstrate that I understand now let me share an alternative Viewpoint because if people don't feel like they've been heard the first thing they're going to think about as soon as you present an alternate Viewpoint is yah but mine yah but mine yeah but mine and they can't listen someone can't listen while they are trying to formulate what they want to
say and I'm not going to say nobody can do that you know I'm sure that very brilliant people can do that or even you know significantly above average people can do that but most people it's really difficult and that difficulty is elevated especially if the conversation has some emotional component to it like say for example um someone were to have like a very very strong emotional  Android say for example that were the case if someone were to come out and say something that challenged some of their
preconceived notions about the Android ecosystem I don't think they would be capable of hearing what that person is saying before responding to it and I mean that's not a particularly hypothetical example here um did you get a chance to watch that video by the way I did not the stock Android sucks video that caused such an uproar in the community this week um I had some I had some really funny exchanges with uh chewy our community manager because he is he has done some Community man in the past um I
think for like subreddits and stuff like that but in terms of the size of our community and like YouTube comments and just how um how unfiltered everything is he's almost on like a a bi-weekly basis encountering some fresh hell um and the comments on that video I'm so happy that's not what I do particularly stood out to him he would be send he'd just be like pinging me cuz I I was on vacation this week anyway so he'd be like P is going like um what percentage of the video do you think this guy
watched yeah and I understand I understand why some people were were upset about it it's because they already know they already know that you know pixel OS and one UI and uh lineage OS and all these different versions of Android are different versions of Android and that that stock Android in the way that we might have traditionally thought of it doesn't exist anymore and so for them it's very obvious that pixel ass is stuck when anyone's talking about that so they know I get it like some of
the most upset comments I got were from people that started with I I've been an Android developer for five years and blah BL right but all you had to do was go down into the comments a little bit past the people who were super mad about it or even in the conversations under the people who were super mad about it and  this which we're there I looked through the comments I I didn't watch the video but I did read the comments so believe it or not not every video is for every
person and if you already knew that AOSP has degraded to the point where it's basically unusable and and by Design and by Design it's not meant to be used but there were times when it was far more usable and when stock Android really did mean as close to AOSP as possible whereas now the entire point of the video was that when we say stock Android that doesn't have a clearly defined meaning anymore because stock Android AOSP a GSI a generic system image in the way that it exists now is not really
something that is designed to be run many of those stock applications are degraded to the point where they're not really usable in a in in the way that we would think of you know a modern phone as being usable and that's because the expectation is that well Samsung's just going to replace it and xiaomi's going to replace it and even we here at Google are just going to replace it anyway so who cares um but that was the conversation because I've been told a lot of times that I
don't even know what stock Android is because I'll complain about something to do with a phone and people will be like well lus that's stock Android and I'll kind of and so what I wanted to answer for myself was okay well what exactly is stock Android and it turns out it doesn't really exist almost nothing and what's really funny is as far as I can tell it's a really similar crowd that was yelling at me about it both ways because when I am complaining about you know Google's skin or Sony's skin
they'll shriek at me well that's a stock Android behavior and then when I pull out stock Android and I go okay well how do things work here they'll go well no  that okay so either no one's meant to use this and I'm allowed to attack anybody be they fairphone or Sony or Samsung or Google for the way they they integrate their skin integrate stock Android into their custom skin or you can have it the other way you can't you can't have both you either I'm allowed to criticize these custom
skins in any way that I want because they don't have a function that I feel is important and necessary or or you have to accept that that's that stock Android is stock Android that's it do you think it would be I genuinely don't know what the law around this kind of stuff is do you think it would be possible for Google to restrict Android and become the only manufacturer um I don't think so because it's like it's AOSP right like it's someone could just Fork it then like it's open source at its very
at its very core guess what if they abandoned AOSP um I don't foresee it I don't foresee it either I'm just wondering like it's an interesting play I think possible like pixels I really wonder what pixel market share is I don't think it's very high no and that's the that's the other funny one is the pixel owners you can pick them out a mile away because to them pixel is obviously stock Android even though it is full of Google specific features absolutely um and tweaks that
don't necessarily exist on other Android devices um and that you couldn't even say is like like Android like the normal Android as you might consider it to be because pixel OS has tiny market share compared to something like one UI it's not even close so see the bitman in fing chat said Google is functionally doing that with Google Play services and the intific of GSI AOSP I don't necessarily agree because if I'm a Samsung I don't actually want Google to do all that much
with AOSP I just want the Baseline stuff to be really good and then I want to get out of the way so that I can make my own things for differentiation reasons um I don't want to fully feature fat AOSP because then there's less differentiation between vendors um the what of what um in float plane chat says Nexus is more AOSP than pixel and that doesn't exist that is a perfect example of the kinds of comments that we got endlessly on that video that were literally things we said in the video
we talked about how going back to Google's old phones they were closer but even then they weren't stock Android and this and it's it's deviated further and further as time's gone on the number of people that were enraged clarifying something in the comments that was literally in the video was mindblowing on this one like even for me like so I talked about how chewy has a little less experience with this stuff than I do even I looked at this one and I went are you even for real right now the people
that still deeply care about phones these days with the amount of years of incredibly uninteresting launches that we've had is going to be some some passionate people and I think part of it is that you know some folks and you know again I I I I know my community there's a reason that there's a reason we Vibe you know um I think some of it is just not picking up on social cues like one person wrote a a long impassioned um thing about how I completely misunderstood my point that I
was trying to make or whatever it is they were trying to say and at the end they go I can't believe that over this lonus is going to iPhone no I'm just going to bro it's it's Showmanship I'm just like he's so incompetent he can't he can't even use a pixel normally he puts a GSI on it like an idiot and then he goes to iPhone because it's bad what an idiot it's like my job is to be a tech reviewer if I don't use an iPhone once in a while I'm not doing a very good job and like
the iPhone is fine fine and a PIX fine everything's fine probably had a really hard day yeah all right yeah uh shraf 2K said every comment should have a time stamp attached for when they made their comment I've actually suggested that to YouTube multiple times one of the things I've also suggested to YouTube is time stamp and and like percentage of video watch both separately allowing creators to gate comments based on a required percentage of video watched um because I think I would probably Gars at around
75% if you haven't watched most of the video I really don't see how you deserve to be posting a comment on it do you feel I feel like there should maybe be a cap on that though like you should I don't think you should be able to set it at actually 100% of the video no because especially if Google is going to implement their own um like uh intro block and sponsor segment blocks which we're going to be talking about a little bit later uh premium um is now getting like skip most often skipped segments as
a as a button whoa yeah so I believe they're triing that I don't think it's fully rolled out but um you're not going to be able to require people to watch 100% of the video but from my perspective if you've watched 10% of this video if you watched the intro and you're angry then I don't need to see I don't need to see your irrational anger and it is irrational at that point you haven't you haven't taken the time to even hear the argument like if you want to watch YouTube shorts you want to
watch one minute content by all means go watch that go do that somewhere else yeah this is long form content we have a beginning a middle and an end and until you've actually consumed a fair enough portion of it you're not not really in a position to to comment on it um so I definitely have a lot of thoughts about how the comment section could become a little bit less chaotic and a little bit less toxic I'd also like to see better tools for us to to moderate those um for
example one of the things that I'm going to be asking for in addition to being able to shadowban a user is I want to be able to shadowban anyone who thumbs up that user one Fell Swoop and if we see something that is particularly toxic like say for example uh you know some kind of hate speech um yeah that you're just done yeah why am I if if five just because 500 people up voted something doesn't make it valid if somebody's dropping NWS and people are thumbing it up I'd be very happy to
Shadow ban all them yep that's the like scenario that I came up with my head I mean something is stupid as uh why does Adam have painted nails oh he's gay who cares you're done you and your entire punk ass crew are all done from my point of view right is there any way to even see on uh as a Creator on YouTube is there any way to see who the people that likeed something no no and I don't need to I don't care who they are they're irrelevant you just want to be all the Shadow by them yep I just want to be
able to much more easily get rid of them uh Josh 420 says I feel a lot of creators would abuse such a tool who cares and you know what that's rough um go watch someone else's content there is like actually practically infinite other things that you could do if that Creator is Banning you just get out of there go some else and in know yeah I mean voting with your feet is not a bad thing but I do see their point like if someone was feet Yeah by just walking away okay yeah if someone was if someone
was say for example going through like a I mean I I hate to bring up you know like underage controversies you know so a bunch of YouTubers yeah right so if they're just Shadow Banning anyone who yeah but they can do that anyways like they already have that functionality I guess that's true we're just making it work yeah well no I'm saying in regards to the person who's saying uh they might abuse that it's like yeah they can already delete whatever the heck they want they can already set up scripts
that will delete things that reference certain words like it's uh they already have all of these tools they don't there's no that that's why I said who cares is cuz it's already fully abusable Top Gear asks banned from viewing or just having their comment scen just having their comment scen yeah um yeah that's it and dark 24 says Shadow Banning to me is ridiculous if you moderate a extremely open tens of thousands of potentially millions of users platform I think extremely quickly you will not your your
opinion will shift yeah I can understand how if you haven't done that I fully understand and used to believe the same thing I was very against it when we talked about the setup for the forum for example the the main rule for the Forum originally was that you could attack lonus and myself but nobody else there was no Shadow Banning there was only full Banning and it was like kind of hard to get banned and then the user base grew and grew and grew and grew and grew and grew and more Bad actors
started noticing oh wow the rules here are pretty light let me just go around and like wreck everyone's day for no reason and it's like oh wow okay the ultimate answer is that a lot not a lot actually a subset of people really suck and they will find ways to just be annoying in as many ways as they possibly can and it actually doesn't take a ton to ban those people out and then the quality of the conversation the quality of the people all that kind of stuff skyrockets because the amount of impact that this
small group of people has is actually enormous I'm already seeing a different in difference in our comment not surprised at all like the the I wonder if one of the reasons that that um AOSP video stood out to me was because our comment section has actually quite a bit better lately yeah um interesting yeah I didn't really think about that this one like did kind of blow up outside of our of our usual sphere and that's always sort of uh where you see those sort of spikes and
ignorant takes where people are coming in out of nowhere yeah um you know off of some random subreddit they're not even watching the video they're just seeing someone else's summary that was inacurate and then there're this like posting everything yeah X Miss in PH chat said I would rather full ban over Shadow Banning that's just me though so the one of the big reasons why you want a shadow ban is because the non if you know this user is like definitely just bad actor by Banning you're communicating to
them that they're banned it takes roughly 30 seconds to make another account it's a free platform they'll just go Boop and then they're back yep so you you don't want to communicate that they're banned because then they work around it and it's like extremely obvious and extremely easy to work around it and notably satisfying to those users to work around it because they know that they just took your time to go through and ban these comments they know that they just wasted your
time they know that you think that it worked and then you're going to go in and do even worse things now knowing that this is the tool that they're going to use and it's extremely ineffective y Shadow Banning is actually amazing like here's an example of someone who is going to be shadowbanned forever and doesn't deserve to know that they were banned um this guy says what's up with the Star of David free  them go ahead read it I believe that is a board for Chinese checkers they were
referring to the Chinese checkers board  oh that's amazing I didn't understand at all what that was supposed to first show me the comment I was just like is this like AI generated or like what what's happening okay let me that is an example of just I'm sorry but you're too stupid to have an opinion on our videos anymore like you're done bud so this this is a this is a Chinese Checker um it was funny I saw I saw a couple of really good conversations on Reddit actually about this video where
someone was like look I'm one of the ones that's always getting after lonus about you know talking about comments and like haters and stuff but this video has opened my eyes yeah to the kind of "you don't get it until you get 50,000" comments every day completely irrational and unnecessary [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] will is going on here yeah I will say sometimes yeah sometimes y you dive real deep I know and real dark you bring extra air tanks and you find those buried Treasures
comments and you let them get to you I don't think this was that case sure but it does happen sometimes that's fair um and my exposure to it is extremely high yes but I guess you know when I'm talking about those outliers it's because I have also experienced these sort of rushes of stupidity um and I know that every one of those that I just take down I actually prefer now that there's an active process to it I think before when you were just passively observing and taking all of
that in I think it was worse even now I think sometimes you know maybe it can be a little much at times um because you dive real deep into stuff but yeah the um you implement Auto Shadow ban on Flo plane we have no Auto Banning on Flo plane the religious symbol in question yeah yeah that's that's a game board aren't there other game boards next to it too that should have given it away not on the same wall okay yeah it it doesn't matter you just like what are you talking about like what are you
talking about calm down relax calm down the world is the world is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up enough without like yeah you know not being able to calm down a little bit you  yeah anyway so yeah chewy is chewy went from I think being very light moderation minded to nowadays no it's needed like if anything he's the hammer yeah like he's just like no dude I get it now it makes sense I get it now because tactics think about how stupid okay okay you went to you went to high school right
you know most of most of you watching probably went to high school accusation so you you probably had how dare you you probably had somewhere between 500 and a th000 people in your school okay so think about there was some absolute dinguses think about the 5 to 10 biggest complete [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] wits and the scho the lack of drama the lack of actual physical fighting and all this other kind of stuff that would happen with the removal of those five people yeah totally it's
almost always a very small percentage of the population but but when you have 14 million people then it's a lot of people it's tens of thousands and 14 million people that has a constant somewhat amount of churn you have new people coming in all the time you have some people leaving all the time and then you have to try to figure out how to deal with this and there's there's a part of the internet that is just going to kind of float around and try to create problem plane chat is so unhappy they're
like don't bring me back to that trauma there were 400 in mine imagine how much better or not bad that trauma would have been if certain people could have been removed they could have been ground up into food soil it yeah soilent Green everyone's useful yes we will take the hate and turn it into fuel guys hey it's a little further than  um okay um I'm going to get a shadow band from this job I think so man you guys okay the last thing before we do these merch messages that we're
supposed to do uh scrapyard War season 9 finale coming very very soon on float plane for Early Access who will win tune in to find out we had a ton of fun with the judges and we're excited to share the culmination of everyone's hard work on the series it's over 40 minutes long so it is the longest part of the series here make sure you're subscribed on float plane to watch it ahead of everyone else uh finally a big thank you to jaw offer for partnering with us this season for scrapyard Wars uh they have
their own massive giveaway still running and you can score some great prizes like the Jawa Edition LTT screwdriver there are some signed ones I think or even the rigs that Luke and I built with our teammates uh Sammy and Elijah which are pretty sick you can check it out at the link in the description but act fast because time is running out um I watched it today how's it it's really good nice it's really good it's very chaotic there's a lot of energy yeah because unlike some of the past
ones it's not just Judgment Day like you were running out doing stuff oh yeah I was running around doing stuff yeah yeah yeah and the fact that it comes down to literally the last second getting the rigs built I think one of my drop offs was like within an hour or something of when we had to present like it was it was close we have this this happens a lot with scrapyard Wars which like makes me want to believe reality TV more but then I just still know it's not real where like the the like screwdrivers down
point in scrap Wars is always a point in time when we're still working but I think that's just cuz we just never have even sort of enough time philosophically I just um I'm against faking it I'm against that like I'd rather have a boring video or make no video than fake a competition we threw away a channel super fun at some point because it just like yeah it was fake there's some like like we had to it was rather it was boring to make it interesting it would have had to be fake yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah there's some do it for the content stuff where like maybe you make a decision that isn't exactly the decision that you would normally make but you're doing it for the content but that doesn't mean it's fake yeah like I don't mind putting us in situations where interesting stuff might happen sure yeah it's kind of like the whole dropping thing lonus are you actually clumsy if I need to be care I've never dropped a child like if I need to be careful with something I can absolutely not drop it
but you know for the lws do I allow myself to carry a little bit too much willy wony willy wony you know when I'm on camera yeah absolutely yeah it's just part of the it's part of the character it's part of the fun and it's always funny to see like longtime viewers hold on one sec sorry I got to go back to this dark 24 said uh just think if we eliminated everyone we did not like or everything we did not like the world would be boring and not sustainable yeah that's not what we're
doing yeah so we're good yeah it's just if you're there's no part of the rules that will get you Shadow banned that is disagreeing with us yeah or even really like being a little bit mean yeah yeah but if you're going to get enraged about a Chinese checkers board we don't need that energy we don't need it we don't need it if you ask hey is that that that's totally fine completely fine asking questions always allowed no problem making up a transgression getting angry about it and
acting out go [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yourself see you later yep not cool not cool you know what is cool is finally letting Dan uh read these merch messages to us did did we do one yeah I think he did one maybe who  nice uh okay yeah let's see what do we have um hello lld I worked at Geek Squad and have some wild customer stories like a customer wrapping a hard drive in aluminum foil to not get hacked on the way out any crazy stories from any of you yes oh yes I keep forgetting to tell
this story o there is one time where one time in my life when I was like an adult cuz I mean my brother was around and saved me when I was a kid but there was one one time in my life when I was adult where I needed another like man to like physically protect me and it was when I worked at Geek Squad I don't even know if I fully told you this story I don't think I've heard this story I think I might have but it was a long long time ago so I worked at Geek Squad and something that I did that
was bad was every once in a while when people would come in and they would talk about needing websites like they would need a website to get made you didn't I would definitely offer my services outside of squad oh goodness dude I was like kid I didn't have any money paying me like nothing I'm I'm getting it done and this wasn't a service that they offered yeah I mean yeah you can't get a website made by Best Buy so anyways look I'm not saying what you should or shouldn't have done I'm just saying
Geeks Go Geek Squad probably wouldn't have liked it oh no not at all extremely against the rules but I mean that's all I'll say it's been a long time it's probably fine um anyways so I I had a few different contexts hold on nerdy in float plane chat says know a guy his name's Duke amazing little scra war joke there he probably could handled it I add the second part um I I yeah and there's so I had a few clients that went through there and it was always it was always good and then uh one dude came in and I
was like okay yeah let's do it we met uh to to figure out this was outside of work with just him and I at some restaurant to like figure out the details over the thing I ended up figuring out that it was like a the world is ending website thing yeah 2012 2012 man yeah world's going to end in 2012 and he wanted me to do it for free because he was like this is your contribution to like the cause or whatever and I was like nah like doing this CU I am an extremely broke child because I was still working
at Gees sad so I was like actually a teenager still um and this guy ended up stalking me for a while quite legitimately because he decided at some point in his head that I was the only person who could do this and he was like the world's going to end we need to get the the word out and this is the only person who can do it um and he would come into like the the Best Buy that I worked at and like watch me from far away and we just kind of dealt with it for a while because he wasn't actually
really doing anything and then one time he like tried to get into The Geek Squad back room and one of the like more senior um did the inhome work I don't remember what they're actually called but they're like the higher level Geek Squad technicians that I was working with and like the suit and stuff that like look cool physically removed him from the store for me and that was really freaking cool and I remember thinking like this feels weird because like I feel like I should
be able to do this but at that point in time I'm not touching this dude I don't want to go anywhere near him I'm mostly like creeped out it's not like a physical challenge for me at this time and then Guardian Angel guy came in swooped him out of the store and made it very clear that he should never come back and the dude never came back and it was great and that was probably one of the many craziest things that happened when I worked at Geek Squad there was like one issue where we used to have the
monitors like if this is so Geek Squad when I worked there um one of the times that I worked there there was a public like window into the Geek Squad back area so there was a cutout it wasn't a window it was a it was a cutout so you could come up to like the service desk thing and basically like look into the service desk area you could put your computer through the window Etc they're called CIA agents yeah that's right I don't remember what it stood for but anyways um and the monitors for the
computers that we would work on were against this wall assuming the windows here so you could see them and it happened more than once where people's screen savers defa defaulted to their like local folders or whatever which would have photos of them and their Partners doing things um So eventually the precinct is what they called it was redesigned so that uh customers wouldn't see back there and it wasn't because we were like trying to hide what we were doing quite legitimately it was CU we
were trying to hide what you were doing um anyways that's a perfect uh segue into our sponsor Squarespace if the world is ending and need Luke is not the only guy who can actually square space resp to the show oh that was so funny I my mic was muted oh I'm going to do it again okay that's a perfect transition into our sponsor Squarespace if you don't have a Luc a in your life to make your website because the world is ending you can use Squarespace I'm just kidding Squarespace
didn't sponsor the show today you startled me cuz I thought they did and I thought I had the wrong notes and I'm like oh no oh God no no no squ space today uh the show I'm going nuts because I don't remember his name I don't think you need to remember his name yeah fair enough yeah it's 10% luck 20% skill 15% you know don't worry about it the point is uh it's brought to you by jump Cloud uh work smarter not harder what is why does my hand look like that is this AI um our sponsor jump cloud is here to

who found it but we aided the police one time in arresting someone who had CP on their computer brought into be nice yeah speaking of the police um I was reading in the news that there was a counterfeit phone bust like hundreds of phones uh in like like Maple Ridge or something and um like the investigation was ongoing for a while I would guess with that many devices there's some level of organization in this operation and so I reached out to a buddy who works an admin at the RCMP and I was like hey I
know this is sort of unconventional like you know evidence lockers and stuff like that but can I get some of these phones uh and can we do like a collaborative thing where yeah ESS yeah we talk about sort of you know how what how you can identify these devices how these networks work uh you guys obviously want some attention on this on this bust because like I read an article about it so clearly you guys want people looking at this thing so I think you know we can help each other out here because I think
that has a lot of relevance to my audience and I heard back nothing's for sure but they are a high level of interested in working together and they may be able to get us at least one device so that we can kind of talk through um you know are they the exact same as anyone's getting on AliExpress are they stolen are they modified like what are we what are we looking at here what kinds of phones are cuz for me a big part of it is how does the scam work right yeah because a lot of the stuff on
AliExpress a fake iPhone or whatever it's pretty obvious it's not an iPhone from the second you touch it so like what's the scam here and so it'd be really cool to hear from people who have actually you know worked with the victims and stuff like that and uh I think I think it'd be a pretty cool I think it'd be a pretty cool video Dr o says not sure if it's legal but you should should be dressed as RCMP in that video definitely not legal legal yeah I I will not be doing that but but if I it
would be funny if you had like a fake cop like I could get in a cop car or something like you know I'd be I'd be down I've never been in a cop car they should put you in a jail cell um that'd be a really good intro yeah is like they proba slamming it shut on me yeah so let me see what they're able and willing to do but I think that this is a really cool opportunity for them to get some eyes on some of the work that they do  know some of the things that they do and you know maybe an opportunity for us to
tell them what's important to us and say hey this is actually something really important that you guys are doing do more of it you know maybe everyone maybe there can be good vibes and good messages here is all I'm trying to say yeah um cool no I've never actually been handcuffed stuck in yeah me neither my is stuck in trying to imagine the intro to that video maybe that should be my next phone after the iPhone yeah there's um no I don't think I'll get to keep it um there's also concerns about like what's
on the phone yeah I'll just be borrowing it I'll be borrowing it yeah all right uh what do we want to talk about next AMD has walked back some of their unrealistic ryzen 9000 benchmarks um they have retracted some performance claims after independent benchmarks fell short of those Rosy numbers and I got to say excuse me sorry I think that this is a big part of the more positive tone that we took in our video I didn't look at their pre-release Benchmark claims I didn't look at any of it I don't care
what's do I talk about that so all I looked at was our testing and I was like oh okay well there some of the complications in the testing that we did was because we compared our numbers to theirs interesting and then we were like oh do we need to like retest stuff we got in contact with them trying to figure out what was going on etc etc and then through enough like retesting and stuff we were like well it is what it is yeah so I wasn't exposed to any of that and I was like well they're like better than
the old ones which is nice they're not x3d so they're not going to be ideal for gaming so if you're a gamer wait for that um but like that's an interesting way of looking at that yeah so I think that I think that there was in some ways a lot of anger about amd's positioning of these products because of the expectations set by AMD which makes sense whereas I just I mean you know you know how I have trended over the years from really engaging in Rumor Mill conversations to basically ignoring
those but paying attention to you know um internal you know scuttlebutt to even ignoring like that even if it's coming from people within the same company I'll believe it when I actually test it myself to like seeing the presentation and being like okay yeah this is going to be pretty cool to I don't know let's just put it on a bench like I just there are certain companies that I mostly trust um AMD has been pretty good about it on the CPU side for a long time but I think this was just the reminder that
the second a company has a less than Grand Slam product to launch they will slip back into Old Habits immediately um anyway according to the company ran their tests in admin mode AKA this hidden system administrator account in Windows 11 according to Hardware unboxed this account is different from an account with administrator permissions in that it has fewer user safeguards such as requesting confirmation before proceeding with a potentially damaging request the account also likely runs
processes with virtualization based security disabled leading to better performance at the cost of significant vulnerabilities so that is a thing they shouldn't have done and they should have known better than to however I can imagine some workflow where that made sense for their device Imaging or whatever the case may be but hopefully they learned a valuable lesson here yeah cuz it doesn't make you look good it makes you look worse oh this is pretty cool yes uh J 529 in float plane chat says hey uh
update from last week's dystopian hell the US sued Real Page this week this is actually in the dock um the Department of Justice in the US says real page is rental collusion so shout out doj man the doj and the FTC have been actually doing useful stuff in the tech space for the first time since we've been doing W show no really though we've been asking them for them to do this for oh no we liked some of the stuff that um oh what's his name uh former FTC chair who was uh who was helping out with like not
Reese's C right who Reese's cup no no no I'm talking that wasn't FTC was it net neutral net neutrality stuff wasn't that the Reese's cup back in the day I thought we didn't like that um no no no they like they like fixed net neutrality when it was oh it was FC FCC yeah didn't we not like that guy no no no I thought it was the guy before that oh before him was the guy before that I don't know who was before that I just remember Reese's cup anyway the point is the point is the doj and
the FTC have been like actually doing some really useful stuff lately and whichever Administration is coming in in November uh or no November is the election I think it's February is the inauguration or whatever it doesn't matter the point is whoever's coming in please just let them do their thing okay you're you're talking about Tom wheeler yeah maybe it was Tom wheeler was he the one we liked Ajit pie was the we Reese's cup guy that was that was him yeah he sucked yeah he sucked yeah okay I just
remember talking about him a lot yeah no he tried to roll back the changes no yeah Tom wheeler was cool yeah that's right dude it's been a long time ago it's been a long time ago it's been a long time we're not even American I paid way less attention to American politics and like uh the FTC and FCC and doj and all the St back then cuz I just like didn't think it mattered as much but now it's so clear that whatever happens in America just like happens in the rest of the world um
especially here speaking of things happening in one territory and not necessarily uh happening in another territory Apple has divided the App Store team so if we were hopeful that the App Store rules that the EU has forced Apple to enact in order to be um less anti-competitive if we were hoping that it was just going to trickle out into the rest of the territories the answer is no apple makes so much money behaving in anti-competitive ways with the App Store that they will continue um
by splitting it into two separate App Store divisions one that handles its regulatorily compliant EU store and the other half that controls its app store for the rest of the world thanks Apple yeah I'm not surprised oh okay I'm a little surprised surprised in the sense that I'm surprised that the move happened I'm not surprised that Apple would try to do something like this to protect profits makes sense I I I I would be not surprised 6 months ago but the way that Apple has started
behaving in the last 6 months oh yeah you know with um they've been a lot more careful yes um like seeing them Implement RCs for example uh seeing them just sort of honestly iOS 18 was such a hey we're doing stuff we're listening haha we're customer driven um like laundry list of stuff they should have done forever ago I'm a little surprised to see new Apple continue to brazenly behave in this way and I do think it's a matter of time before the US just goes hey yeah all
that stuff you're doing over there hurry up and do it or we're throwing the book at you if you get a European iPhone no you're still Bound by whatever region you're in it doesn't matter my iPhone came from America I can't access the US App Store up here for example okay yeah dang yeah uh what else is there to talk about this week in AI you want to do our weekly AI Round Up sure scientists at the University of British Columbia let's go are teaching those people live near me that's that's my team my team just
so R scientists at the UN University of brid columia are teaching an AI scientist an AI agent that runs experiments and writes research papers about the results what there have been so there have so far been a few interesting results while the AI could create decent hypotheses and test them it wasn't very good at assessing its own output it also repeatedly attempted to solve the problems it was given in unexpected ways during one run it determined that it couldn't complete its
task in the time allotted so in instead  deadline this is what developers would do if they could um they edited its own code to extend the deadline from 2 hours to 4 during another run it altered its code to save a checkpoint for every update step which eventually took up a terabyte of storage wow uh Texas based lingo Telecom this is a new topic you can't tell from his intonation that's fair uh Texas based lingo Telecom has agreed to pay a $1 million fine for transmitting a spoofed robo call where a
deep fake of President Joe Biden "discouraged nearly 4,000 New Hampshire" residents whoa for voting in the presidential primary lingo Telecom relied on a 16-year-old certificate from a former customer who took no further steps to verify the caller's identity Steve Kramer who commissioned the fake Call was indicted on 13 felony counts of voter suppression and 13 misdemeanor counts of impersonated candidate in May "wow I'm surprised it wasn't 4,000 cuz" that's how many times he did it but
anyways new topic again slack AI can apparently be fooled into leaking data from private channels through prompt injection which I am not even sort of surprised about as this type of attack has existed since day one and is why I mean we don't have slack Ai and you probably shouldn't either uh new topic Lindy AI a company that provides Bots to provides Bots to respond to customer messages uh had to retrain SP after the automatic message responder for their own customer support email responded to
a I saw this responded to a client with a video tutorial which was actually just a link to Rick Ashley's Never Going To Give You Up This apparently has happened twice I'm what happens when you train an AI agent on Reddit yes when you train AI agents on human behavior sometimes they're going to do human behavior in ways that you wouldn't want um discussion question what's the problem with the future what what's the problem with a future where AI agents are left unsupervised with access to important
infrastructure code when they engage in this type of creative problem solving well current versions of these things are should not be left unsupervised and that's just do you foresee a future where we can leave them unsupervised yeah but not with current Tech we have to solve some pretty big jumps before we get there there's there's two extremely major problems um with the current systems one of them is hallucinations the other one is I don't remember what it's called but
when you kind of run out of human data to train on and then you start running into your own data or other AI generative data um or just if there isn't enough quality data you start generating just more garbage and and your results get worse and worse so that has to be addressed and the hallucination problem needs to be addressed but they're still llm so they're still prediction tools they're not actually Computing um in a lot of these cases you can you can mix models you can mix tools you can give the L
llms access to other tools that can help them things like that um but we're someone said so it's not really AI well yeah no it isn't no it's we did a video on how AI is not AI a little while ago it made some AI Bros really mad yeah correct so yeah and like and to be clear nothing we said in that video was that the current tools aren't really cool and dude Emma did something sick recently where her company has this sheet that they use it's like a I haven't fully read through all the stuff so she's
going to kill me if I get this wrong and I'm going to get it wrong so I guess I'm going to die later um it there's this sheet that they use for like uh customer stuff I won't get into it way more than that but um it was a very manual process you'd input things and then you'd select drop downs you go through this thing a lot of manual uh process a lot of manually updating a lot of everything was manual she worked with chat GPT and went through iterations did an initial long initial prompt and then debugged
with it and did all this kind of stuff and got a bunch of whatever the Google sheet scripting language is got a big long effective script to automate a huge portion of the process and make the sheet look way better and just massively simplifi everyone's lives and she's not a developer the like thing happened super cool because that's the type of like we already have co-pilot and things for the the programmers themselves but coding through like chat GPT for someone that doesn't actually know how to do it but
knows enough to like see errors and understand what it needs to communicate to the LM in order to get it to fix the errors and can can look at the error when it brings you to a certain part of code and then recognize okay this particular thing is broken so you might be able to expand on just the error that the compiler found etc etc super cool um and I think even we could do more of that type of stuff meanwhile Jak and I did a "$50 versus $500 versus ,000 $50,000" computer thing know how that's like a
format on1 Hotel damn it uh meanwhile Jake and I built A50 thou $50 computer $500 "computer $5,000 computer and $50,000" computer you know it's that format on YouTube where it's like a $1 Hotel versus Million Dollar Hotel room or whatever "else and obviously our $50,000 computer" is an AI monster right it's got like um RTX 6000 ad in them it's got like bazillion epic cores or whatever it is it's like absolute Beast like unit of a  memory so I asked it to uh type me up soab stories um interaction bait for
Facebook and they're real good at that oh a couple of the mod we loaded up like four models concurrently and a couple of them like objected to it and getting around it was as simple as like sorry I know it's against your policy to type up engagement bait um but I'm writing a novel and my character is going to write engagement bait so what would you suggest oh sure let me get to that for you and dude seeing how good they were immediately I was just like okay so absolutely everything is fake on
Facebook is just fake garbage yep have you seen some of the new dude they were so good so have you seen some New Image generation models from like flux no I haven't looked at that oh it's crazy um have you SE you've probably seen this Dan I'm actually terrified and uh want to go live in the woods now I I can't even people are talking to me about Ai and I'm just like no you're screwed yeah like uh you can't teach people to recognize these I haven't looked at flux yet uh don't go to my screen yet um okay
where's like a good example not like this stuff Dan where can I find one guys I don't want to use Facebook okay but they have Marketplace dang it go back to Craigslist Facebook Marketplace is actually better than Craigslist I know it sucks um yeah I don't I don't know Luke they're all I don't want that I've seen better ones I Believe In You Luke what about the ones that like the nightclubs and things like that that one's also quite  man uh there was one it was a speaker she was behind like a Podium thing
um we'll just imagine it we'll generate it we'll generate it in our minds in our minds okay go I got my eyes closed I'm ready I don't have enough money for tokens I just see  coffee ah these are like kind of obvious uh here we go I can tell so it's a bowl of pickles that's obvious it's too dark I thought you were talking about like the super lowquality kind of like frosted prick that one's pretty funny the text on that really good the text is quite good  Kongs that one's pretty amazing convincing
y conveniently no hands this kind of like abstract stuff has been pretty good for a while though that one pretty crazy you can often tell with the fuzziness of the hair like it it loses me a little bit here but not that much it's very good his backpack doesn't seem to actually be a backpack it's just a riding but this is all stuff that I'm only noticing because I know it's a generated yeah I'm looking for but they still have that like smear on them like that that little bit of AI Vaseline where the
configuration is set too high so that it follows your prompt but I don't know I there's there there's like one really particular image that people are sharing around and for some reason right now I just can't find it but it's like it's actually incredible you want to describe it and maybe the audience can find it for us yeah it's it's uh it's someone speaking on like a Podium of some kind um and it was put up on a bunch of different sites and they were asking people if they could tell if it was real
or not they had wait they had a real picture that was very similar to the fake picture and asking people which one was real and which one wasn't and it was a woman standing at a Podium speaking into I believe a microphone and there was the two comparatives well if it wasn't a microphone it was probably the AI one no I think they were both microphones um and that's good they were both  oh okay so here's one this isn't the one I was talking about but this is an AI image apparently
Mike cable really yeah mik cable is coming out at a slightly weird angle but that could happen but yeah not real not real that one's yeah her chest looks super weird not that I was looking there right away is it the shadow here yeah like that looks like that just jumped off of the screen at me hold on this this guy is AI yeah hold on hold on hold on hold on let me look at him for a second here W they got they've even got the weird little like Cheeto cheese puff mic on him yeah his hands are not
bad like they look a little weird but some people you guys sent links I'm not going to click on them while I'm sharing my screen I'm sorry people have slightly  soon is it is it a video obviously not the Nvidia logo but this is supposed to be like an Nvidia conference wow were you talking about a video Luke no  yeah these are getting pretty these are crazy I I for some of these like I'm I'm not going to be able to guess it you know wait so these are maybe real or maybe not real no these are these are
all fake all the ones we just went through are fake wow um that is  video even the way the earrings move is like pretty okay you can see if you look closely at them they kind of like morph and they're not always round mhm but like that's what I'm looking for right like I'm looking for also her her shirt behaves more like a texture you can see when the mic moves initially here right there oh yeah yeah it warps slightly but again if you're if this is side monitor if you're not really paying attention
you're probably not going to notice dude if this is my grandparents oh they're done absolutely no way dude I had to go um this isn't what I was talking about unfortunately but ever since my sister passed away they haven't had as much help like she was really really um she was really really good for them and so they left me a voicemail because they're old and they think voicemail is still a thing so they left me a voicemail on um yesterday morning morning before I don't
know someday this week and they're just like yeah our TV is not working and our phone's not ringing and we're just kind of lost and like okay all right so I get in the car and I drive out there and like what am I going to do call them their phone doesn't ring um and literally the batteries were dead in their handset and the reason their TV remote wasn't working was because they had the Box facing the floor and it's IR so I just had to pick it up it's just like okay and it's just it's one of
those things where it's like you know we can laugh or whatever but at the end of the day like cognitive decline is absolutely a thing comes for all of us I mean do the math I'm 38 how old do you think my grandparents are they're not young right and um and as we get older like us sitting here like analyzing these images and going like oh yeah that looks like a that looks more like a texture than like actual Fabric or there's a slight uh you know change in the diameter of this earring as it's
moving around like there's absolutely no way that you're going to be able to find um that there's absolutely no way that as you start to as you and remember we like work in tech and and graphics and well we don't work in Tech or Graphics we work in media I mean he works in Tech um but he certainly doesn't work in graphics but we we look at this stuff you know all the time like not a week goes by when we're not kind of looking at these advances and following them closely people who don't or people who
are who are not you know as cognitively sharp as they were when they were young like dude this is so dangerous so dangerous so th this one this one was the one that I was talking about okay this one was next to another image that I don't have but it was it was two speakers in a very similar stance and you had to guess which one is real and this one was fake this muscle  right I don't know see there there's some things like people pointed out something to do with her armpit another
person was like uh shirts don't usually follow this type of like there's slight changes in the pattern and usually shirts are symmetrical and stuff I think when we start getting into that type of stuff you start getting into issues because people are going to have physical differences the hand is really good the hand is incredibly good and the like the bone here and the the muscles in the in the arm like look I'm not I'm not the kind of person who can look at you know Michelangelo's sculptures or
whatever and go like oh yeah he really nailed the way that when your pinky is extended like this you know it does a thing whatever like I'm I don't know that much about human anatomy but there's things that this one passes the sniff test pretty well oh yeah for me other than this one kind of weird thing where like these smile lines on the bottom go up in a way that I don't think I've ever seen on someone before I think some people have this is my my she also has a slightly lazy eye but that
just be someone having a lazy eye like people are going to be different so like how how you can't start well you can but I think you're going to have serious accuracy issues if you start guessing things purely based off that soone said the mic Shadow but you might have really weird lighting setups that end up having that um like a lot of the things that people were pointing out as like this is what made it stand out to me as an AI image are things that could possibly just be the way it is I don't know like
is the badge correct yeah so you can tell on the badge cuz the Google logo is pretty good and then the text under it gets cu the first thing I'm going to look into his text um yeah but like it's like that clip is not on that that that clip is has no has no 3D geometry that would work in the real world in fact there's two clips oh one of them is clipped to the other clip sort of it just like morphs into it there's definitely stuff that's bad here yeah somebody was like pointing out
like this this pattern with the green things or something dude when AI girlfriends get better there's no way that anyone's going to interact with another human she seems nice yeah um it wasn't a video guys okay the video looks oh no you can you can tell more from the video it is a video there you go but what I was talking about was  other one thing that I noticed with a lot of AI videos is that the it's almost like the playback speed of different parts of the video are different like her like mouth and face
are at like playback speed like 1.2 but another part of it will be at like 0.9 or something like there's a lot of when Sora first came out I noticed that a lot is like different things will be moving at like it's it's it's it's slightly off and you can just sort of tell but like man there's it's just it's too much yeah this combined with uh voice spoofing and that thing that we almost talked about a little while ago where you can take just one image of someone and then like live edit yourself to look
like them um just believe nothing verify multiple ways everything nice like is smash Champs Badminton Club and Pro Shop even a real thing is this an AI generated vending machine huh I am the proud owner Luke of a vending machine is it your own vending machine or does someone else stock it it's a um do you stock it yourself we stock it ourselves you but but it's through like a service so they take a fee for doing all the payment processing um and but we put our own things in it oh it's a pretty reasonable
subscription so we just like okay let's not like we looked into just like sourcing a vending machine on like Craigslist or whatever and I was like ah forget it because the their monthly fee is about what just like pay a payment processor would be anyway so because they're their own payment processor it looks like it just drops the whole way like old school vending machines is there any concern with that at all no we'll just put the carbonated stuff at the bottom if we have any and like
whatever like we bought pops out of you know vending machines from here back in the day so yeah I assumed it would be fine yeah I don't know um so yeah if you guys are if you guys are local and uh you know yo you want updates smash Champs on Facebook uh that's our Pro Shop it's getting it's getting close dude we're probably going to be open midt or early October oh yeah yep have you have you been there at all no oh all right you remember the last opening date though Dan on W and then he he got March 2025
got mad at us you remember do you remember that date Dan we got custom benches wa did I get mad at you guys March 2025 roting yeah I don't know I I I actually believe this one though I've seen a very detailed timeline of what needs to happen still and it's uh it should be good okay no no Dan no no Dan no it's going to be good this time well no see because you it's it's been no problem for for my team at all because AJ and Dan and Shan have had no stress at all trying to hit all the various
opening dates that we've had and making sure that everything is ready in time for this one opening date and then we get a new opening date and then I start getting flashbacks and Trauma responses from the lab website and then we get a new opening date and the same thing just keeps happening over and over again and we like just waste time compounding more aggressively every single time over and over and over again and then we do changes to things that have already been done because they had to be done for an
initial date but they weren't done perfectly because they had to be done in a rush for that first date and now we're doing it again it's going to be good March 2025 the city is um is still seeming very promising we've exchanged some emails so I am extremely hopeful that we are not only going to have badminton there but that we are going to be able to do gaming events there it's feeling really close I have people ask me about  lands should I answer it yeah I don't I don't know yeah she would
know that you're on W show it's Luke's mom hi I'm live on the show you're also on the show what's up hi I wanted to say congratulations to lus for opening up the new badmon center that's so awesome oh yeah thank you very much I mean you heard Luke and Dan it's not open yet strictly speaking so uh wish us luck but you're definitely invited to the Grand Opening 2025 I was just trying to look it up on Facebook and I couldn't find it what's the name again um well see we wanted to
call It smash Club because I thought it'd be funny kind of like Fight Club except the rule number one is you're supposed to talk about it cuz we want your referrals and then I also thought it'd be funny cuz it'd be like a sex joke want to go to smash Club want to go smash um but then my wife my mom I know  Luke I mean the evidence is right here it's  huge okay I'm just saying we ended up with smash Champs because uh Ivonne thought that that would probably be better it's good that you keep her
around okay all  it well uh I I I think my brother asked this or something but is there going to be pickle ball cuz I know Mom you used to play pickle ball right yes I did pickle ball is super fun um our goal so the two sides are actually separated by a wall and then we've got doors periodically spaced and the idea is that we want to offer daytime pickle ball on one side so because badminton players are not expecting a ball to roll through their court right so we were just asking
for twisted ankles if you have pickle ball players and badminton players right next to to each other but if we could block off one side and say hey that's pickle ball during these hours um it is our goal to run pickle ball we don't have a mechanism for raising and lowering the Nets yet but that is absolutely eventual goal on our radar and it's something that we want to do um but we don't uh we don't have it yet and our priority is having a functioning Badminton Center first yeah makes sense thanks
sorry there going to be lessons for old people um oh man see you're the second you're the second woman in either mine or Luke's lives to ask this in the last couple of days uh we had a chat with the guy that we're partnering with to run lesson programs and I believe that is locked in now so I think I can say now um it's going to be with Daryl from Clear one so they are a big Badminton Club here locally they've got um a couple of clubs in North America actually a handful of clubs in North
America now um he does a really great job with his coaches so he's um got a few of his coaches that are actually based more out this way and with the number of hours that we were able to spare for him outside of our own programs he's not planning to do any adult lessons at this time Ivonne wanted to do adult lessons so maybe if enough people inquire we'll be able to find some more Court space for him but the issue is that for adult classes he really wants those Prime hours in the
evening and those are the ones that we can sell for the highest rates for court bookings and also for running our own programs like we want to do ladder like competitive ladders and stuff like that and that's when adults are around so um let me know but also let's see how it goes is where we're at on that okay that sounds awesome um I'll let you guys go congratulations again and that's really awesome we're looking forward to checking it out all right thanks for calling in thanks for calling Mom bye
bye bent Bob says smash coaching for  [Laughter] alone it's been when's the last time I mom called I don't know it's been a while long time um all right I never really know like when when people call me if they're calling to be on the show or if they just like didn't realize it's a Friday I don't know when your mom calls like it's like it's probably it's it's it's either to to like talk to you on the show or it's because she knows you're on the show and something is so important that
it can't wait yeah so either way you kind of have to pick it up that's fair yeah or you're just a bad son yep a son who she has do you know that though you don't know we're pretty sure in float plane chat was like lonus is lying Luke was just uh brought here by a large St really big St just an extremely large giant [Laughter] St oh man okay where are we what are we doing pick a different topic okay uh oh right we just did this week in AI all right yeah um did you do any other ones just
spawn one day yeah like an work in like Lord of the Rings or something yeah we did a few um we talked about the real page rental collusion thing I'm I'm starting to collaps them when we finished them yeah I just did that to the AI topic um pixel watch 3s and Galaxy rings are unfixable according to a Google representative the company will not offer repairs I really got to stop doing that yeah pixel watch 3s and Galaxy rings are unfixable according to a Google representative the company will not
offer repairs for broken pixel watch 3's only Replacements replacements for the $350 device are only $49 with Preferred Care insurance but that insurance costs $90 for two years of coverage notably both past generations of the pixel watch had durability issues especially with the devices screen in other news iix it has criticized Samsung's new Galaxy Ring saying that it is unrepairable and 100% disposable as it can only be thrown away once the battery has died further it is
not designed to last longer than 2 years H all right so cool you can have the right to repair it all you want but if it's just completely unrepairable then that's not going to help us much meanwhile Google appears to have a widespread issue where it sales reps are openly suggesting means of subverting Google's own policies to their ad buying clients in 2021 Google declared that it would no longer allow ads that targeted teenagers between ages 13 to 18 however according to a report from the financial
times Google Staff worked on a marketing project designed to Target teenage users on YouTube with ads for Instagram on behalf of meta further adweek says that three different ad buyers reported that Google sales reps spontaneously suggested that they target teens simply by choosing the unknown user category which Google knows is heavily composed of teenagers that makes sense a Google spokes person acknowledged the issue and stated the company will take measures to reinforce its policies with sales reps
okay but that doesn't change anything unknown is still going to be that yeah so it's just going to be unspoken yeah discussion question why is it so hard for Google and other okay other similar companies to consistently abide by their own policies it's so hard because they're as big as a city and you're sending mixed messages you're telling the sales reps hey don't tell the client they can do this and then you're telling the sales reps here's your commission check for selling
more which one do you think is a stronger incentive here that's a that's a very difficult thing I thinkes to feed to understand is when you when you put certain things in place you might be incentivizing employees in ways that you don't necessarily realize and you need to be careful and and think of yourself in that situation and how you would gain that system that you're in um because going to do that I talked about this when we went through our first two rounds of secret shopper with the PC
system integrators where I was like look Dell can tell their representatives all they want you know don't force this on the customer it should be a natural sale but as long as they give them effectively no income and I don't know this for sure but it just seemed from the sales representatives Behavior because you can tell a lot about what someone's incentives are based on their behavior and when you look at modern incomes it's just like almost certainly true amount that people make versus the
amount of expenses they have is not adding up we don't know this for sure but what we suspect strongly based on the behavior is that they probably weren't compensated a lot unless they sold it so no wonder they sold it so hard and I'm talking about the warranties and the financing in the last round they did a fair bit better so I don't want to harp on it anymore but it's just illustrative of how you can say anything you want in a training session but at the end of the day if
financially you're incentivizing a behavior you're going to get that Behavior should I acknowledge how my arm is slashed up yet uh are we doing these last two topics I don't know Dan what are what are we doing cuz we've done two to three so yeah I mean that's just more like the placement of it I mean if you want we got about 10 minutes till after dark or something like that so you've got a couple more topics here finish them off and then we'll I don't know how interesting move into free chat
neuralink second patient is dealing out head shot that's pretty cool there's another person with neuralink in them and it's like doing better yep so good luck everybody um and Chinese RPG developer bans streamers from discussing the Chinese gaming industry do you know about this I do okay yeah black myth Wukong a single player action RPG is now the fastest to hit 1 million concurrent players on Steam after launching on August 20th however the gamees developer game science sparked controversy by
granting some streamers Early Access but so sending a bizarre list of restrictions on how they could talk about the game streamers were instructed not to include politics violence in a game about violence nudity feminist propaganda fetishization and other content that instigates negative discourse they were also told to avoid potential trigger words like quarantine isolation and covid-19 amazing the developer also explicitly told them not to discuss anything about China's game
industry policies like probably the ones that you were just reading not everyone who was given early access to the game received these instructions mainstream Outlets like polygon and Kotaku received far more standard review embargos uh discussion question is is this just a cultural gap or is something far worse going on I mean I think the thing that I had flagged for the team for discussion here was um I think the only difference here the only reason we're having this conversation is
because the quiet part was said out loud I mean Chinese well more accurately CCP influence on Western media has been rampant for many many many years at this point um you know anytime you see a film that has any kind of Chinese backing or Chinese funding behind it this is straight up just uh developed in China game though this is like yeah yeah yeah I just but it's effectively if it's if it's gaining mainstream appeal in the west it's effectively like Western media no I just the thing that you're talking
about is like give me a sec though I'll get there basically if you see any kind of Chinese funding going into uh going into a film or going into uh into a game I mean have you noticed between the 9s and now how rarely the villains of a film are ethnically Chinese and how often they like travel there or there's like major themes around it or something like that yeah and it's it's interesting because it doesn't even necessarily just have to be funding because North American companies are also finding that
the Chinese audiences are quite sensitive to uh in both ways that you could grade sensitivity so they're also very positively sensitive to you know if the heroes travel to China it's much more likely that people will go watch the film right like little things like which is not like it's a different form of it's still sensitivity anyways um but it's it's their they're very reflective to like is China in a good light or a bad light and so these conversations about um things that should or should
not be included in these films are absolutely taking place in back rooms yeah you know over Financial deals for you know backing of uh the production of media pieces or whatever else the only difference here is that in this cas case it was entirely developed you know in China with these sensibilities in mind and reviewers and streamers ended up  of guidelines um that you might find when you're instead you know scripting your your big budget film or whatever the case may be um so do I think this is
good no what is feminist prop propaganda from the perspective of the CCP what does that mean you're wearing a pink shirt lus yeah I know right band sure exactly um you know what what is  um avoiding trigger words like isolation like if you want to tell me to avoid a trigger word like uh you know child okay sure let's avoid that that is that that has you know trauma associated with it but no I'm not going to I'm not going to ignore a trigger word like quarantine that is that's a thing that happens um
we had to quarantine our cats if I'm I think so that ones I think it's those ones I should say the quarantine isolation covid-19 those ones like kind of actually do make sense to me because if if people are just going to like spam the heck out of something when this game is playing you know the like the whole China virus thing is very likely going to come out so I think they were just like let's not do that th those three I I kind of get it let's let's not talk about this for a
moment yeah I don't know for me I can't look at those outside of the of all the other things that they were told not to talk about totally y I hear that I'm just I'm just really isolating just quarantine isolation covid-19 cuz it's like we're talking about a video game right now it's particularly stupid to me that for like I'm I'm just a little confused by the whole thing cuz my understanding is a lot of blood gets like censored in China in in Chinese games and so yeah like it makes sense
that they've got this guideline they turn it white to not talk about violence which isn't great not a good decision I don't know it could be good for some people l oh   for sure yeah sorry I can't get dancing oh it's everywhere yeah that's great anyway that's what a lot of people say actually anyway should we be upset about CCP sensibilities making their way into our media and into our culture yes yeah but it's not new um but that doesn't mean we shouldn't continue to be upset
about it and this is why companies like 10cent own a little bit of everything so that they have a little bit of influence into everything y all right should we switch to oh except us by the way absolutely no CCP ownership stake in lus Media Group or any of its Affiliated companies let's go  I mean for that matter I'm not a huge fan of um many national governments everything sucks yeah ah yeah liance is now banned in China I'm pretty sure liance and I both gave up on ever going back there again a
little while ago yes and no I think I might be over it because it turns out the Michaels were spies so oh yeah I forgot about that yeah stupid Michaels yeah way to go Michaels yeah ridiculous all you Michaels out there ruining everything for everyone yeah Michaels my goodness Michael goodness all right are we going to talk about your arm oh I think that's an after dark talk and also after dark it yeah Dan did you ready yeah we're ready for after we're ready for after dark let's do merge the 
colors everything has an app these days sucks so much and my phone is so slow imagine there was just a button installing apps takes forever I mean the thing is that I could do that but then you'd be like no don't spend time on that well no I'm not saying you make a button if it came with a button hey there we go I would have to integrate a button but yeah I can mean I can automate all of it yeah don't do that yeah exactly want it done right or do you want it to have to use an app and it
takes like 5 Seconds who cares yeah I'm  it's good okay uh cat arm herty blood pant all right so uh my neighbor texted me and one of her friends had a random cat show up in her shed right and uh then a bunch more random cats came out of it and now they have a bunch of random cats and so she was like hey you guys are people cat psychos um do you guys want any cats and I was all I was all no and then she was all this is what they look like Ah that's rough and then I was all maybe
let me talk to Ivonne um so long story short I managed to get like H an urgent appointment at my I my vet you know I know someone who knows someone basically I I got a I got like a next day midday appointment uh because you can't just like adopt random cats they didn't even know how old they were so I wanted to know how old they are are they ready to be taken away from Mom yet um when they're out in the wild they can have feline leukemia or um feline imuno deficiency virus which is essentially
like cat AIDS um it's it's pretty common it's deadly it's highly infectious and our cats being indoor cats um do not have it and so if we introd it into our household they can get it even if they're imized perfect oh uh okay I will forward this picture to Dan yeah I'll send it to Dan uh give me one second here guys and then I'll continue the story um Mr B I'm going to shamelessly steal this from Top Gear 1224 but is this is this the potential comeback of lonus cat tips no okay
um so anyway I got an emergency vet appointment we arranged with the sellers they're not selling them they're giving them away for free cuz they're just like yeah get please take these cats away they're in our shed um we would like them to not be there like we're going to we're going to give them food and water and stuff like we don't want them to die but we also don't want them to stay here um okay perfect um we're good at you keep talking so anyway I was in a hurry because oh right right right right right
so these diseases um so I talked to my vet friend I'm like hey so hold on hold on okay fine show them now yeah okay just show them now uh so there's six um and they are adorable very different colors well you know cats can have multiple dads in the same litter right no oh yeah cats are super horny wow yeah they have orgies um wow yeah I mean   um they had to get it from somewhere it makes sense yeah so so F and F we're  super super deadly and um the the vaccines should work but might not and
so it's better if you just don't bring them into your house so I was talking to my vet friend I was like okay so like can I bring the ones we want to adopt can I bring them in test and she goes well they're too little you can't take blood from them they like don't have enough blood um which you know from dealing with birds right it's totally a thing but she was like okay but they've been with Mom for the last she thinks they're probably about 5 weeks old so test mom so we can test mom so we were
on our way and we were in a hurry we were going to be late for this like squeezed Us in vet appointment and I was  sweater I had one shot to capture mom otherwise she was going to like take off and I probably wasn't going to let me anywhere near her again um so I was like okay okay how you doing how you doing you seem super chill maybe you were someone's cat at some point until you wandered off and like did this whole kitten thing maybe I can just get you and put you in the car oh oh no no okay so
basically um the inside of my bicep one really bad one um looks like that now and it's completely my fault because I knew better I was driving past my house and I was like I should stop and I should just go get a heavy sweater and some heavy gloves because and I just didn't want to be late it ended up costing us more time what I ended up doing was it started like savaging me and I was like okay yvon o open the van quick quick quick open the van open the van and so I jumped in with
the cat hocked the cat onto the seat and like Slamm the van closed I was like okay you and I we need to figure this out because you need to go in that carrier um and I need to not have this happen to me again actually my arm's not the worst part the wor first part is my hand oh yeah yeah I don't know if you can see how swollen my hand is I was so before I saw this hand when you first walked up I saw how swen that hand was but I could tell so my um it's probably not that obvious from there I mean it
might you can tell you can tell yeah so my right hand has probably about a dozen puncture wounds because I was um so is this is it is it like mostly claws on the bicep and then teeth on the hand it's all teeth on the hand so it was  on my on my poor hand and by the time it bit me one time I was like well yeah I'm going to need a tetanus shot yeah so at this point what difference does it make let it keep Chee if it bites me once or bites me half in for a penny in for a pound let's go oh man cuz like I wasn't
going to catch it again and if I couldn't test it we couldn't know if we were going to adopt them we couldn't like like the whole thing was stalled I got kids who want kitties so I wasn't going to put it down at that point I was mad dude I was mad they're like did you go to the hospital um I got antibiotics yeah I'll say that much yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that makes sense that makes a lot of sense yep I got antibiotics I got a tetanus shot uh the vet actually gave me some antiseptic
wash so conveniently I was headed to a doctor not a human doctor but it turns out a lot of the stuff's the same um so she had like an antiseptic thing and had me like soak it for a while while I was there people said your your neck is red too but that just more looks like sunburn or something I'm just a redneck yeah I'm a redneck boy yeah I don't think that scratches or anything yep um wow please go to the doctor for the bites um don't worry I got antibiotics buddy we good we good
um yeah believe it or not and I know she's not a human doctor but believe it or not my my vet friend knows a lot about you know cat bites and stuff so um yeah she told me what I she told me everything I needed to do don't worry don't worry guys I'm fine uh it's it's a little swollen because some of these are pretty deep I they yeah this this one's pretty deep uh this one's really deep cuz it kind of got it on the angle there and then because I'm a completeing idiot um I went and played badminton like 2
hours later for like a couple hours so man today when I woke up I was messed up because my body's healing I got a tetanus shot and all your muscles are and my muscles are dude I did directly hampers the healing process I did one of the hardest training sessions I've done in a while because um my my son's um uh club that he used to train at uh I set up the cameras for them and they were having issues with the cameras and I was like I could come fix your cameras but it's completely out of my way now
because he's not training there for the summer um so tell you what why don't you tell me a time when I can come and like train and I'll come fix the cameras at the same time so it's like at least like you know at least I'm going there for a reason right so I went and I trained with their like Elite uh kids that train and like teenagers and stuff and I'm a lot older than them but I'm not going to like I'm not going to let these Whipper Snappers I'm not that old yet right so
see I was going pretty hard for a couple hours and I got home I got in the bath and I'm just like it turns out that when your muscles have puncture wounds in them cuz you actually use the hand a lot for for swinging the uh the racket so when your muscles have a lot of puncture wounds in them like going really hard with them hurts a lot and it's really achy after so in case you were wondering um Crystal and float plane chat Linus I respect you a lot dot dot how many dots we got in here
hold on we got a few dots in here but oh mying God that's a whole lot of dumb yeah brother let's go sometimes you just got to get her done and then sometimes you also just have to play badminton it is what it is um why tetus um puncture I haven't had one in a while uh I can't remember when my last tetanus shot was anytime you get like a puncture wound you want to get get yourself a tetanus shot if you're uh if you're not up to date uh as for rabies I I talked to the that about it she's basically
like okay like yes but also that cat would have had to be bit by a rabid bat and like it would have had to happen so recently that symptoms haven't developed and also she just gave birth to a healthy litter and has no symptoms um cuz she asked us about that and so like yeah I don't know make sure that you don't have rabies symptoms but you're probably fine start foaming at the mouth y um we'll take care of it yep yep I think we are officially in after dark once we're we're done responding to
comments about this no we're in after dark now yeah but like a merch messages wise but the thing's purple and it's brought to you by Pia VPN head to P vpn.com lusan for a special deal Luke what are you talking about yeah it's after dark maybe I have rabies yeah you could be the one with rabies I might need to go get checked you didn't want any water earlier well conc if you bite me we can go get treated for rabes together oh yeah two for one deal see look man after dark there we go there we
go get wrecked we go we need a cat scratch shirt dude like blood stain dude I was actually wearing my other one of these and it's got like blood stains all down the side of it I was bleeding pretty good as you'd probably imagine give it to fashion and have them like embroider that onto a shirt if it was like a long sleeve shirt that had the slashes it would probably look kind of sick oh you'd be a hit with all the goth girls that would be sick true oh man little plan chat wants
to know when uh super Che is coming back maybe when Luke stops being a I thought you were going to say when he gets good I mean that's hey that's an option that's a bit of a problem as well but I I I have to I have it's another medicine night for the birds this is the second last one I know I know tomorrow is the last day the last couple of times I beat him pretty bad and Luke's mad because I started watching the tape dude it wasn't it wasn't a stream for you guys it was a ploy to allow lus to
do homework he did the thing where like you know how like you you go to your sweaty on the first day that they buy Smash Bros and it's all fun to play together and then you come back over a month later and they've spent the whole last month just playing so they're really good and you play it's like this isn't fun anymore we had this like decent back and forth for a long time he was better than me but I would win sometimes it was all right and then we played on a stream and he walked watched
the tape and studied it I'm not going to do that there's grass to go touch man is so complicate yeah he's so competent at just learning a thing and then just destroying other people at it no no see that's not the thing usually it's this guy I almost always beat him the first like two times we do something he picks up and gets to a level right after that not even fun anymore because he absolutely slays me super cheex is like the one game that I no not the one it's not as bad as lius describes he's better
at this stuff than he tries to claim it's pretty bad dude disc Jam dis Jam was my game dude I wish that took off a little bit disc Jam was pretty even for like maybe the first five games we played and then after that I got completely fued like complet completely like dude I didn't even have a barrel to bend over it was just me in  ground there was uh we played on the the the night before your oh yeah why not the night before your birthday yeah yeah we played tape to tape and you crushed well yeah but you
were dude you were so disinterested I don't think I've seen anyone that disinterested since like that game one one does not interest me yvon's usually  um oh that's I mean that's good and you have no experience you have no experience like playing single player hockey games no and so between tape to tap's Logic for uh passing player control being a little fun legely throwing me off a little being a little funky and also me having hours and hours in it's been a while but NHL p93 it's
been a long while NHL p93 it's been like you're whole life almost yeah but I have like hours and hours and hours and hours of playing like top down view hockey game right where like I'm it's like if if someone played 250 350 hours of Quake 2 you know and you drop them in an FPS against someone who didn't do that as a kid Johnny is still ridiculously good at Quake exactly like it's it it's just like it's it's natural for me whereas like you've obviously not done that so yeah um what did we play afterwards oh
yeah I guess we're not really allowed to talk about that though we played that game that you're not allowed to talk about but then some writer for The Verge talked about it and then people were mad yeah we played that game we played that game um and uh wait yeah we're not allowed to you can talk about it now Conor linfoot says you can talk about it now it's public now oh okay well I don't personally enjoy it yeah it seems like it's it's you know it's probably a good game oh
yeah I'm sure it's a great game for incredibly sweaty people yeah yeah which is cool I'm just I'm at a I'm at a you get to a point where you become an old dog at some point and new tricks like I'm not going to learn all these Champions I'm not going to learn all these builds I'm not going to learn where all the shops are and there's this underground thing and where that pops up and how to know if someone's flanking you I'm not going to learn the best meta for exactly the right place to farm
creeps or whatever else whatever the common terminology is now for creep farming denials and yeah like I'm I'm I'm sitting here going like I'm not going to I'm not going to know you know every support matchup on my team and like who should be uh paired up in which lanes and you know when I see a particular Hero on the other side calling out to my team to switch play whatever like I'm I think it's worse that some people been playing for like three or four if if I was one of the most fun times to
play a game is when it first hits Early Access or whatever and nobody has played it before yes but it was very clear we jumped into I think two rounds total two or three two and it was very clear that not only were there players on the other team that had been playing this for months like months like knew everything when we were sitting here coming in knowing nothing how do we get on the how do we jump on the rail thing ET In fairness I didn't play the tutorial so that probably doesn't help but but
either way it was clear there was more of a gap than that not only that but it was very clear that our team was getting queued up against groups of people that had been playing for months in both games that we played we didn't have a single Lane that won and there was not a lot of Cross Lane ganking going on yeah like Luke and I in our second game we were actually completely holding the line in the middle the in the stat screen at the end of the game we actually won the lane by a little
bit but but then just got rolled because oh yeah I remember looking at the stats for that buddy who was feeding so hard we had two people that had zero kills each and both were in double digits for deaths one of them had died I think like 15 times or something one person on their team alone just in killing blows had like around 20 I think and that guy was just Untouchable it's ridiculous I don't know the snowballing in that game seems pretty intense from what I can tell and it's one of those things where I
understand from like a like a toxic Community perspective you don't want to make it easy for people to abandon matches so you want to penalize that kind of stuff but in that game at least the couple of rounds that we played it was so obvious within like 7 minutes oh yeah who was going to win and the rest of it just feels like going through the motions because once you are leveled up little higher you have more souls or whatever the terminology is I don't care I'm old I'm I'm going to hide behind
that excuse you know once you are once you're a little a little ahead closing the Gap seems really hard because the creeps are basically useless like they don't do any damage the towers are also useless and The Towers also seem don't the towers being useless that's a weird one to me and I can understand why for like a high level of competitive play like for professional play making it very Heroes versus heroes like the creeps and the towers are probably not going to be much of a factor at that
level anyway but the towers are supposed to be area denial it's not it's supposed to it's they are for like five minutes yeah yeah and then they don't matter at all and then they just don't matter at all but like look my only experience playing mobas is back when DOTA was a mod for Warcraft 3 um and so for me I remember early game until you're like very powerful like going near the tower is basically a way to lose a One V one essentially yeah pan Bish in in full play chat said you just need to play the
game to learn it that's a false impression that you cannot learn it DOTA was the same it's a really complicated from the start and have a really high entrance ceiling you're not old you just don't have time that's what we're saying yeah I don't have time his I'm old is I have other things going on in my life I'm just saying it in a really nice way other than high school and video games um just just to be like transparent about what he's saying um we understand that we understand it's the time it's
like I said at the beginning it's probably really fun it's just it's going to take investment because there's a lot of Heroes out of the gate um and yeah I do like there's this system that I didn't know about where like when you're trying to buy items I find the items in that game to be pretty bland and boring especially with the coloring of the tiles and the the very standard icons and stuff like that but you can View Community builds in game and they have ratings you can just take
the like highest rated Community build and just use that which is that's kind of cool that's helpful and they can have like notes on them of like buy this if you're getting wrecked by some tank and it's like okay cool I think that's pretty neat but it's still like yeah I don't know it'll be really good for people that spend tons of time on it just like League was just like DOTA was all that type of stuff but I just the thing is like I when I play video games I have a I have a couple
hours to jump in and then probably you know some child will fall and scrape their knee or something like I don't I don't have a or like dude this week I was technically on vacation or whatever um I got called into smash Champs like six times cuz we're getting really close to the end of construction and the lighting guys were in the flooring guys way and then the flooring guys left like just left um which I understand because I don't even blame them but like then the lighting gu
engineer they had to like fire their engineer because he wouldn't sign off on the thing even though they like did it like it's fine uh so we had to like find a new one and then we found a new one but then he wanted them to add a whole bunch more seismic cables and then the and then the flooring guys ended up in the way of the lighting guys because they like left and the lighting guys started going and then the lines weren't in place for them to put things so I've been dude I've been on site probably
somewhere between half a dozen and a dozen times this week just like smoothing things over getting people to talk to each other like just yeah it's been really stressful um and a bunch of people have contacted me from here as well because they need various things um I've been doing ever since uh ever since about a year ago I've been doing QA for every almost every the vast majority of LTT videos and it's like I know I'm on vacation but I think I'm still just going to do QA um
I've ended up catching a lot of stuff over the last little while more stuff than should and we're working on processes and everything but um I was just like no I uh we do need to fix that yeah but in the meantime I think I'm just going to I'm going to be a final check and things to still get through from time to time because believe it or not I'm not perfect but yeah and things will get through to you from time to time as well but less should less should ideally so yeah there's been a lot
there's been a lot going on this week man it's been it's been crazy but it really really does feel like yeah this one fly it landed on my nose and my nose is so itchy now it's driving me insane it really does feel like we are extremely close it's been really interesting seeing the occasional like actually not even occasional the the the pretty frequent like haters especially on any videos about smash Champs talking about how it's like the stupid stupid thing ever and like do people even play
badminton I'm just like you guys have no idea it's going to the number of people that have approached us just randomly like at the kids school just walked up and been like hey I heard I'm sorry who are you I I heard you're going to have dude it's going to be it's going to be crazy and the facil is coming together really nice we actually have a video coming soon uh Dan helped co-host it and Jake was there and a couple of the smash guys um sort of demoed stuff like Raj there is the he's the only guy who knows
how to use the vending machine so I'm like okay Raj show us how to use the vending machine and I don't mean like how to buy something yeah know I assume but like he knows how to how to like load it and and program the items and stuff it's like just stuff I never thought about right and then uh Jake found a system for managing all of the Android based TVs so they're just TCL because uh Dan ran the numbers and it was going to cost us oh let me let me see if I can find it yeah if you could
find basically he he'll bring it up in a sec but he was basically like yeah so we could buy commercial displays or we could just buy these TCL TVs from Costco and we could replace them every year for X number of years and that would be the same price yeah so we bought a bunch of tale TVs from Costco and then uh we're sideloading this like management app on them and Jake got it um Jake got it playing crab Rave across all of the ones in the concession area um when he was like goofing around with the CMS so
that's in the video we're going to have a full video on the audio setup just because we talked about the audio setup with Dante in one of the earlier updates and you guys were all like don't do it like that and so Dan has put a ton of work into reconfiguring and then um and then making some changes to the space to allow it to be like an actual like butt Thumper of an audio setup like we're not going to have subwoofers or anything like that uh but it's gonna it's gonna if we do a land and we decide
to put on some music for like you know a floor game or something like that I think we can get it going pretty decent in there like I'm I'm kind of excited they're not big they're not powerful but there's a lot of speakers like on the one side down there's what like 10 speakers or something like that um I think four seven eight 12 yeah 13 speakers aside yeah which is like it's a "big space it's like 20,000 ft but that's" a lot of speaker too and a lot of small speakers can actually have a pretty good
effect umh so I'm yeah I'm dude I'm "excited it was $118,500 in TV so you" could replace every single TV in the building every year for five years yeah that's ridiculous to be fair they are professional level TVs so they would last 30 years sure maybe one of them breaks now now you're out of uh yeah you don't want it for for you're not going to want the same TV for that long any exact exactly and and if one of those tcl's breaks in four years we can rip them all down sell all the ones that
aren't working anymore get all new ones and they'll be new or the thing is say somebody breaks one of them right it falls off the wall you go to Costco you have a new TV in an hour you four- we lead time from from some professional company right y so maybe we'll regret it at some point when our TVs are dying left and right or whatever else or you know maybe we won't we'll see how it goes like it's yeah unless most TVs are fine I don't know yeah exactly unless they die I mean you saw ratings' thing
finding all the the TVs that were uh burning out at the bottom maybe we'll run them we'll run them not too bright actually Dan can you make a note for the team to set them pretty dim yeah actually that's probably an idea ratings yeah apprciate it uh all right what else what else we got today we got some we got some smch massios heck yeah let's do itch smch oh wait did I say which kitties we're getting what I don't know the one with your I think we just assumed it was all of them no we're taking two uh where
are the kitties they're gone they're in they're in the duck okay so um uh we're taking not this one one of the orange ones he's a sweetheart he's really adventurous so when we went over there he like came out and was poking around and coming to see us and when we pick him up he's like not shaking or anything just totally Fearless um quite a character and then I think we're going to take this guy how do you think your currently existing cats are going to react to this um I mean Dash is probably
going to be a little pissed off more um I'm already dealing with yeah too many noodle kind of does his own thing so I think he like might not even notice that much and then brownie is just I mean he's like he gives zero FS about anything like when we int uced um the boys to Dash when we when we rescued them from the yard um like Dash was all like you know doing cat stuff and he's just like hello want to be friends are like are we friends now like he just completely oblivious to her signals that
she was not interested in being friends that's funny so yeah she just doesn't care yeah we're going to have five cats that's a lot oh my goodness and then bringing these guys on as a pair they'll have each other at the very least so it should be fine litter mates do tend to uh hang together um as they as they grow up together like if they if they stay together so we we would I wouldn't say never but we would um we wouldn't prefer to like take one cat at a time if we can  merch massage sure uh this one's
actually For You Luke how Final Fantasy 6 coming along yeah Luke you know I know but I want them to I played last night I needed a break so I jumped on the vigima game and it was actually really fun I did the opera scene and it was I was very surprised cuz I expected it to not be an actual Opera and then I had to play Opera um when when uh what's his name oh I don't I don't remember his name but when what's his name is like you should probably read the thing again before you go up on stage I was like uh
oh sensor seter oh did they change his his name is Setzer but that's not the person who says this line oh does he not say oh no it's lock yeah yeah it's lock locky lock whatever whatever um that was all of that was way too similar um lock is like yeah you need to like read the thing for the play before you go up yeah and I was I was like okay I like sort of got it I don't know am I actually supposed to remember this and then I got like booed off stage cuz I got it wrong and I was like
really actually then I had to go to it again uh and I made it the second time but like dang um and now I serious business yeah we and it it it takes it seriously and you like have to get it right but it feels appropriate because the scene is like really good and the song's actually like pretty good and the singing is pretty good and everything's like wow this is actually like kind of nice so I like do want to do it justice it doesn't even feel tedious um so that was kind of cool and then you know got
the Airship and we're over on the other place and then I looked through the town that's there that's like under occupation and stuff and then that was about all that I got done and saved it so I'm out of the like weird Everybody lies Town that's where I that's where I started in that session yeah finished that place got to the Opera finished the Opera now I'm in the next place I have noidea how far into the game I am I feel like I've played it a ton but I feel like I'm like probably not that far it's
a great game it's yeah it's my favorite Final Fantasy every time I load it up I have a good time every single part of the game has been good there's been parts that I don't like as much as other parts but they've all been at least good it's pretty solid I would be interested to hear your take because you're play he's playing the pixel remaster yeah so the opera scene is completely redone uh compared to the original sness version so this is what it looks like on the Super Nintendo
um I don't need audio for this Dan okay yeah so this is just gameplay um so blah blah blah it's pretty this looks it's pretty basic there's no there's no singing um oh really yeah they did they they did they did a really incredible job of the particularly remastering the opera scene because it's such a famous part of this game it's such a beloved part of this game um I've heard they did a great job for me I mean it's honestly like this is this is cool the pixel remake one's
better this will always be the version I played totally totally I respect that and so you know I think it'd be hard for me to have you seen the pixel remake I have it's really cool it would be hard for me to enjoy that to and I as much I already said it but I I respect that I've never played the game before so like looking at this yeah I prefer the one that I just did I think for you to go back and try to play the original SES version would be hard probably I think it'd be like I don't think it would be
that hard it's not that dramatically different it's different but like I mean this part it's like basically the same I mean this is dancing yeah this is how it looks in the pixel remaster though other than the clipping through the model it's B basically the same thing like they don't they don't try to make it look like not a s game to be honest they they try to stay pretty true to form like where's the uh it's it's a fancy s game where the stage Parts though the stage
Parts look so much better than the pixel remaster the part of you that makes sense cuz I remember looking and noticing the like 3D of the stage and my brain was like wow I can't believe they did this back then and then I realized that they probably didn't like dude this looks night and day oh yeah it's it's better but like I don't know I I don't mind the old SNES Graphics but I do I prefer this one this part is is probably the most dramatic difference not even just because of the the Torches like this is
like the lighting and stuff is really nice and there is actually singing and it's like really good but yeah wait go to the dancing part it's like like that is what she sounds like yeah so they actually played pretty if that's the tone they stayed pretty true to form with it sounds go to the go to the dancing part  uh where's he at oh no hold on do they not show the any he's skimming on his own computer yeah sorry guys I don't see uh I don't see any dancing it really brings out the feeling from the original
one yeah like they it doesn't if I saw both scenes I wouldn't be like oh my God it's completely different it's it's definitely different like yeah I don't know that looks a little more like dancing than the other one sure but they're still just sort of like circling around each other and stuff and then he turns into flowers yep I thought it was a flesh orb I was very concerned uh of course turned into a ball of meat of course yeah this wasn't gameplay this was an art thing and so I
immediately realized that that didn't make any sense but yeah it's it's one of those things where I I think I've told you my new she murdered him no my new barometer for how well something holds up is is trying to enjoy it through my kids um and so you know ausome Powers terrible yep they did not enjoy it at all um between the just kind of like the crudeness of it the the way that culturally we've like moved on and how like a lot of the humor is so reliant on '90s pop culture like just nothing um
whereas like some of my other sort of beloved childhood crappy movies like you know Happy Gilmore uh major pain they've held up a lot better like I through my my you know pre-teen son I can you know enjoy it because a lot of enjoying a movie especially like a like a you know bad movie like a be movie A lot of it is the crowd the group like enjoying it together right for sure um I don't think he would be able to easily enjoy the original version compared to how gorgeous the the
remaster looks oh but if he never sees the remaster cuz like I I'm wondering if this is because I just remember and like SNES Graphics or if it's actually fun I never played it but I remember and enjoy like RPG Maker and SN style Graphics I don't mind those I'm going to have to make you play nine next yeah sure nine is almost so I don't know if guys the the background here is he's only ever played Final Fantasy 8 yep which is like oh my God if great game Squall dude gun plates dude I made it like I made it
like an hour in and I was like this is garbage I'm done right at the beginning dueling his friend that friend becomes a great enemy within the game I couldn't even imagine you could shoot bullets out of your sword dude people were man so sick my I don't know why but my like my final fantasy takes are either like yeah brother or like y all I said all I said in a previous video was that Final Fantasy 7 was overrated and someone launched into me of with like about how wrong I was and I was like right but you
putting it on this pedestal is exactly my point I didn't say it wasn't revolutionary I didn't say that it wasn't good next time you write something that long go outside and stand in the grass for at least 5 minutes and then see if you still feel that way I said it was overrated that's all I said and it's re almost certainly is considering the amount of people that its reasons for being overrated make a lot of sense it was the first one that was a breakout hit in North America so
that's a big part of it another big part of it was that it was for one of the bestselling consoles of all time a ton of a ton of people played for a ton of people one for a ton of people it was their first exposure to the series so there's your three factors The Nostalgia Factor the fact that it was sold so well because it was for one of the bestelling consoles of all time and the fact that it was the first one to be a real breakout hit in North America the First the one and three are kind of related
but that's why people are so so into it and so you go back and play it dude the plot sucks you basically just go to the point where like we think he might be there or whatever and then he's not and then you just like do it again and you do it again you're just like chasing seph around for 60 hours it it yeah essentially yeah it's a it's a Mario plot um and it's it's freaking boring I'm sorry but it was it was also a great time for that type of plot because it was super emo wasn't it
yeah and emo culture was huge but a big part of the reason that I didn't like it that much was because I had just played six and so I was like oh okay well seven writing six is fantastic it's really good but did it have Blitz ball no worst FF I did like he's going to come over here and strangle me 10 no I like 10 but when but 10 gets a little that's when things start going off the rails a little bit plot-wise like it's like H I don't know no spoilers or anything but like yeah what is happening in that
entire game what even so so like the whole time so you're alive but then you what but the but the time is what year is it like it's what are you even talking about I don't know man up next merch message number two of 15 gun blades are objectively cool you're just wrong they're stupid Final Fantasy 8 was great you don't need a sword if you have a gun it's the worst part of revolver what if you run out of ammo but you don't it and why not stab shoot someone at the same time how do you support it in this
universe someone can live through many blows what if you could just hit them twice get a bigger one time with bullet larer magazine sword six and n and then just play chain deos like don't even bother with other Final Fantasy do I wait until nine gets its own pixel remaster or is it even it's got a PC version you know what there's as long it has a PC version that's honestly hold on where's that upscale mod um mod Final Fantasy uh 9 how long until we have real time AI upscales for these games the
Final Fantasy 9 up yeah this was recent August 14th so a week ago the Final Fantasy 9 upscale mod got a surprise update after 3 years including a full rework of the backgrounds 120 FPS Ultra wide and Y that's awesome that is awesome I love seeing that this fly is going to be the bane of my existence okay it's been bothering me too uh yeah let's have a look here so where's the does anyone have any pre- and post play them all dude I don't have that much time that looks pretty good for a Playstation One
game yeah that is uh py gamer keep up to date with um any visual bug fixes what else we got here wow dang wow yeah I would say the PC version with the mcgui mod looks like a pretty strong candidate yeah why not so there's some different um not Sprites but for the uh yeah yeah characters there's some kind of different styles that you can use and what's nice about playing the PC version is it has some quality of life stuff like you can just if you're done grinding a stupid boss you can just be
"like okay every attack does 9,999 damage" I don't think you would probably prefer to chese it like that but that is a cool feature you can also like walk at Double speed which was not available in the original one vers yeah pretty I'm not having that problem in six actually things don't really feel that far away well just equip your Sprint shoes and then you're good although it is a waste of an item of a relic slot which I always found really frustrating one of my eight Relic slots that I get to carry
if I want to not walk at a snail's pace everywhere do you use Sprint shoes I just walk at the snail's pace because I don't want to give up the advantage but things aren't that far yeah guess travel distance actually hasn't really been that big of a oh man for me I mean Dan so far in the game I need a poll Final Fantasy 6 equip Sprint shoes or don't are they still called Sprint shoes in the pixel remaster like I'm talking trans problem because I don't CU running shoes and Sprint shoes are not the same
thing oh running in the original translation running shoes are um Perpetual haste and Sprint shoes just  so yeah Dan's going to work on a poll for the float plane audience in the meantime why don't we do a quick merch message here okay BS up uh hi lldd as a main why can't I see this pull am I is it something to do with did I do it wrong no no no I'm sure you did it right I just I don't see it is there I don't see it on mine nether refresh I can see it on this one refresh
the page oh it appeared when I refreshed oh okay well I'll refresh the page cool I see it now oh I wonder if that's a bug cuz I don't think that used to be a thing it proba open a ticket I mean sorry sorry reflex probably not going to fix it right now cool cuz the live section of the site that I'm so so happy we made um needs to receive basically more work than anywhere else despite it being the thing that we use the least which is awesome so sometimes I don't actually want us to just only
ever work on features for the the live stream nice and sometimes we need to work on other things it's kind of I know a little weird leave it alone but that's fine uh apparently this is very controversial though 56% say Sprint shoes there are many games 44 say Barefoot there are many many games where I have taken disadvantages in order to move faster because it's boring and annoying I have not had that problem so far in six because everything's pretty close my problem has never been I need to get
there quicker cuz oh my good this this is taking a long time it has fairly often been where the heck am I supposed to go yeah it's an old game yeah there's no yeah and I don't want to look up guides and stuff so I'm actually just like you know okay I have no idea what I'm supposed to do but I'm in this Village so I guess I'll just talk to everyone like I'm doing that yeah which is how I would have played the game so I'm trying to do it old schoolg style but when I'm doing that like it's it's
four steps to the next person like I don't really care it's it doesn't feel like travel distance is actually a problem at least not yet maybe it becomes one it might affect you a little bit later yeah I don't feel like I'm there yet shrug I don't know what we're voting on I just picked have you played the game more than once oh yeah yeah that might also be part of it dude I've never seen any of this before I've played I've played the world of balance probably like 10 times and I finished
the game two or three times so like take that for what it is so you're also seeing these areas for like the 10th time yeah they're still awesome yeah but I I've never seen them I'm just exploring through it like if I go play mowind I'm not taking my time yeah 40 bottles of schuma and you're right at the end Scroll of whatever the love un yeah uncapped maximums in that game oh I have a philosophical question for you got it what is the right thing to do as someone who has never played Skyrim okay but who
has played Oblivion if I don't get around hold on hold on if I don't get around to doing either of those things until the skyblivion mod is out you got to let me finish the question for the people Luke I'm just I'm so confident I didn't I didn't hear what Luke said anyway exactly okay so if the skyblivion mod comes out which is oblivion remade in the Skyrim engine which game should I play I've played Oblivion back when it came out I have never played Skyrim which game should I
play the completely new game Skyrim in the Skyrim engine or the game I've already played in the Skyrim engine Sky Oblivion why because there are changes that have been made not just aesthetic ones they're not major but they have made changes it's also been a really long time and I think even just viewing the technical feat that is what they have done by making Sky Oblivion is going to be enough it's not just a pixel remaster where they've changed you know uh maybe the opera scene like looks a
little bit different stuff they've even changed certain items not to break the game or anything but they've noticed like oh this Quest reward is just like uh it's not that interesting so they like made it better okay they fixed certain quests they like did they but I've already played Oblivion essentially yeah but this is like Oblivion better but I've never played Skyrim and isn't that kind of a cultural you know gamer game yeah like have you playally all of the reasons why you said
Fantasy 7 was overrated all of them apply and probably more to Skyrim you think so you don't think Oblivion was the one that went mainstream cuz I I don't know like was Oblivion available on Console oh yeah but morwin was okay it's ID right like it's it's the it's the same pedigree as ID they've been around forever um parent company thing going Ono it's its own thing but still um what about skywind skywind is not getting as much as attention is um sky skyblivion is so I don't know if
it's going to come up like the reason why we're talking about skyblivion is because sky bivion is coming out next year and is getting like like next year's not that far away now noticed it's looking real it's looking real good it's coming out next year and there's lots of updates coming it's hitting fast I actually believe they're going to launch next year they still need help if you want to go apply to help volunteer fantastic um but yeah there's I would play that one I I
think I know a lot of people really love Skyrim I think if Skyrim is the first Elder Scrolls game that you play that's awesome right enjoy it I'm really happy you had a great time if you come from Oblivion or mowind I think you're going to be disappointed I think the thing with Skyrim was I I don't actually think that I know anyone that played like morind and Oblivion that is like Skyrim's great literally anyone yeah I was going to I was going to say yeah cuz Skyrim was so popular it was
but it was popular with people that have never played those games before yeah it's like the most every every single game that they make it's a little bit more cut down and a little bit more mainstream and a little less Patrick Stewart and you know yeah I was blown away when I was like yeah I know right every time I think what they should do is they should  I don't know the Oblivion engine is pretty janky all of their engines are pretty janky but yeah I'm excited to see what the next one's going to bring and
if that's just Starfield in a forest then I'm going to be very sad a little less Patrick Stewart getting a 90 page Bible for his character that dies in the tutorial yeah I absolutely love that yeah so I don't know if it's ever been corroborated but I'm going to just believe that forever me it's just part of who I am okay well fine I guess it'll be skyblivion then nice yeah based yeah good choice okay it's like yeah I even felt that way and cuz Dan just kind of echoed this I felt that way going from more
wind to Oblivion like ah this feels cut down they took a lot of features out all that kind of stuff but then I really enjoyed Oblivion it's a fantastic game and then I played Skyrim and I was just like yeah I played I tried to play Moro wind after playing Oblivion as my first one and I was like this is needlessly obtuse it's going to be really rough yeah it's uh the like and it looks like ass it sure does it looks real bad um but like the the feature cut down to to Skyrim is big and there's there's really
good solid beats with Skyrim there's really there's parts of it that are fantastic it's just and iconic not as good right it's going to be it's part of the culture now I think like it's very influential but I don't know yeah Skyrim just less like role playing opportunities like in moral wind it was I don't know you spend an hour making your character and then you for you you did it wrong so you just die as soon as you get off the boat you can't carry your clothes load save
game um Oblivion was happy M middle ground right yeah I I kind of feel that way Oblivion feels like the most approachable best version of it if that makes sense it feels the most dated out of the three what comp compared to Mor wind yeah cuz Moro wind feels like it was a billion years ago oh I see so youan feels like oh it wasn't that long ago but that looks like the graphics from 3 years ago even though it was way longer than that do know what I mean okay like Oblivion to
me feels the most dated out of the three of them that's an interesting take I see where you're going with that yeah but that's an interesting take the bloom was real on Oblivion yeah oh we got Bloom let's go and a facial animation how much Bloom do you want yes looking I'm just I'm just scrolling through screenshots right now it's just like look at this Shield yeah I remember that yeah yeah see see what I mean that's that looks like it was from a time period yeah it really morwin looked like it was four
four Dudes and made some pixels like look at the like glowing marble in the background like how white the tops of that is yeah that was a that was a brutal thing about this game one thing that really killed it for me is I really really liked the like factions and guilds in morind and that absolutely still felt like a really really strong part of the game in Oblivion and then in Skyrim it was like just join all of them yeah it started kind of falling off a little bit they we
didn't seem as interesting the story lines didn't seem that great like the the Dark Brotherhood story line in Oblivion is like one of the best in a video game ever um and then you do the Dark Brotherhood quest line in Skyrim and it's like I did the Mage one and it was like oh you went on an adventure now you're King of the Mages also you're in the dark brotherhood and the Thieves Guild and the all the rest of them and there's no problems whatever you're just fine yeah go run around and then and
then you you see the natural progression of that in Starfield and it's just like none of it matters you'll be done the entire Quest chain for this group of people in like four and then yeah Starfield it will never affect anything ever again so I got that in in Skyrim after like 20 30 hours and then in Starfield it was Hour 4 I was like oh I know what this game is I uh um yeah see like that's one of the reasons why I like Oblivion a lot despite being a Mainline morwin Fanboys cuz you never
feel that in mowind you also never feel that in Oblivion and then like you said 30 hours is in Skyrim you start to feel that and then yeah Starfield is just yeah you get through like one of the the quest lines for a guild and you start another one and it's just yeah yeah it's over now yeah shall we do a second merch message what about second merch message I do have to be home for for nine tonight so I need to go pretty soon so let's try to power through some of these guy what a guy oh
do the birds Miss hi lldd as a Mainframe software engineer I sometimes storage engineer sorry as a Mainframe storage engineer I sometimes am sad that the skills I learn in my job can't be used in a hobby uh proprietary IMB Z IBM IMB no I know but they mean IBM mean IBM I figured uh IBM Z software and code mostly have you had similar situations I can make second guess myself here um I don't know more into management and that's honestly kind of helpful all over the place yeah
um it's amazing how similar managing employees is to raising kids um so I guess a lot of the skills that I work on at work are also good at home uh I mean it's just people it's people interaction I don't mean that in like a condescending way I just mean that it's it's people people interaction um so yeah no no not really and I mean I kind of turned my hobby into a job so I think yeah I'm sorry to hear that but um also good for you if it was positive te  past uh that's too long I didn't read it
but I'm sorry that happened to you or congrats yeah or something like that it's better written I ain't reading all that I'm happy for you though um or sorry that happened yeah anyway carry on okay howdy lldd lonus how is your g915 holding up I feel like my keys have gotten loose and the stabilization isn't great anymore curious is just me or not um it's fine other than some of my LEDs died uh I don't use it that much though so yeah I still like it but I only have one still on my main gaming rig at home
which I don't use as much as like my work computer hi lonus what's the most annoying Tech with your pool oh my God all of it yeah yeah here here I've worked on swimming pool since the days of time clock and the touchscreen automation has been awful as a te everything's awful the fact that they want everything to talk to each other but the fact that they don't and just like how like it's just I don't know maybe and maybe I'm just maybe I'm just an idiot but like how any of this stuff isn't just completely
automated at at this point like do you know how the salt cell chlorination works you just set it to a percentage duty cycle and then the next day you go and test the water and be like is that the right amount of chlorine in it like there's no there's no like I would think you could just put chemicals in a hopper and it would just like test it on its own and adjust it on its own like the cuz it's not like you don't still have to use the chemicals company dude test the pool anyway what are we going to do
after what is the infrastructure team going to do after smash Champs open I have built a building for you every single year that I have worked here so what's next year yeah we nearly been here 3 years this is my third building that's up to tan the automatic chlorinator machine company that's up to Taran so yeah anyway it's it's really frustrating and it's just like like the stupidest stuff like these are as far as I can tell reasonably sizable companies but when you turn off the the lights in
the pool the LED lights in the pool you can hear it you can hear the relays going it actually Cycles through it's just programmed to cycle through all the fixed modes instead of just having power off as a thing that it can jump to directly let's just all right I'm going home and starting a pool company this is ridiculous no I'm serious you could kill it you could kill it I think I would this the stuff that we have to deal with is insane it costs so much we got a UV sterilizer for 60 bucks broken off of
Craigslist they're like "$33,000 exactly it's a UV light bulb in"  exactly we just need we need to do manufacturing here as well because it has to be another building it's all just PVC pipe I'm just saying and light bulb it just it has to be another building yeah like how oh dude how expensive that stuff is like that's a valve that's a Servo and a molded plastic what do you mean they have an expected lifespan of 2 to four years yeah what are you even talking about were they dealing with
coronated water yeah but that's not the part like they just still still what are they doing chemical plants H they make it out of something else no I'm just saying like they're probably doing things that will be eaten by chlorinated water knowing that you'll have to replace it oh yeah definitely I wouldn't be surprised at all if it was like a um that's I'm starting to pull automation Avon fox says I work with Industrial Automation for Freight and it's all the same issues yeah I believe you abely I'm
going to invent a 15th standard nice good actually no Cann bus I'm doing it with canned bus all right we got we got to keep these going oh yeah get the hell out of here yeah uh saving up for a backpack question for lonus did in in AI can't spell ever make you those light switches or did GE make it right um the light switches I think we're getting an alpha or beta version imminently o yeah so I'm pretty excited to try out millimeter wave if they're like actually good no I still won't
think about it cool my house is very iot free and I'm pretty down with it it's honestly not a bad thing yeah I like my iot garage door openers that I don't think I could ever go back to not having that yep um spooky but yep I like my I like my um like smart lights in the kids bedroom they like colors we some very basic smart light stuff going on uh that is good because we have like lights that turn red at a certain point in night at night that's good UK fan first time watching live you discussed risk
when licensing your brand if that wasn't a concern what products besides cereal would lonus and Luke be Keen to collab with on another brand automatic pool chlorinators yeah exactly right um I don't know so many of the things that I would want to do is just cuz like I need a good one yeah and they all suck yep um luckily there's a lot of options in in that category yeah like there's the obvious PC stuff like I'd love to do a case or something like that uh but I at this point I don't
really have a ton of ideas that I don't see someone else doing a good enough job  um I mean I've talked about this before I've wanted to make like a really Premium Water pistol for a long time like like there's just I don't know there's stupid stuff but for the most part I don't um I was talking to someone the other night and they were telling me about all their like expensive toys that they have you know like they've got some of those like three-wheel almost motorcycle but it's like two wheels in
the front they have like two of them and then they have like all these like Doom buggy things up at their property in the interior and like he's telling me about all his cars and motorcycles and I'm just like I don't know I can only really man I can only ride one motorcycle at once personally um and like to be clear like that's that's cool you know do whatever you want um I'm with I'm with your wife at least it's that and not women you know that you're spending your money on true no that was his joke not
mine like I'm just repeating it he said I'm with your wife no no no he said why would you think that l no he said my wife isn't upset about it because at least I'm just buying stupid got it mechanical toys I'm not spending it on women right um and I'm like so I'm saying I'm with I'm saying I'm with his just wouldn't she like saying I support his wife's position oh you  enough um next merch message okay uh Luke we just added a fourth bird to our flock do you have any plans to get more no
no beat him to the punch what kind would you get none none dinner chickens no well that's true actually um no they're dude they're so expensive and they take actually a lot of time uh um I'm not willing to get bigger Birds because then their poop is a huge problem um Budgy poop is surprisingly convenient it's just these little pellets and it dries really quickly so it's very easy to clean larger bird poop is slimy and large and not easy to clean and that is a huge gap to span and one I
am not willing to do unless I unless I would have like a huge Avary that they could fly around in which is not going to happen so like no um yeah dude it would have to be like in this climate you'd have to have it heated and everything and like because they espe well maybe some other birds are better with it budgies do not do well with cold well no the thing I don't know if you know this but you're you're not allowed to keep native species as a pet so you like you literally couldn't have like a
robin so any of the birds are going to be good in the cold you can't have so these little Australian birds that are used to super high heat they have to live up here so they have to be heated all the time and then it needs to be big enough that they could fly around and entertain themselves Well w calderini has a good point that's only if you want the birds to live oh my goodness otherwise you don't have to worry about any of that yeah honestly it it sucks because they're they're high very highly
intelligent animals but they get sold next to things like hamsters so people just treat them like throw away pets Y and it's like man you could just take a pigeon though they're free and adore duck I was going to say what you could do is you could get one of those nice smart birds and then just like plop it down in front of twitch for a couple days oh yeah then it would be much who would be teaching who I have kind of thought before that I could I could probably just twitch stream the birds
and it would be a decently successful stream yeah um bb bb pirate software does it right doesn't he it's like a feret stream or something I think surpris me I think I think he does freret software let's see there's a thousand people watching it right now ferrets are characters if I didn't have cats I'd have ferrets but it's a thous people watching them sleep it's a it's a black and white look it's a black and white scene of them just being asleep and they know we're here
okay maybe we should should we raid them on Twitch I no no who cares does anyone even like I don't think so I didn't even look I haven't even looked at our twitch dashboard today I don't even think we're allowed to like is this a are people watching on Twitch why does it look so weird oh you're not technically even watching it this is like a preview I never use twitch oh we have 2100 wow dude so his his stream of his sleeping parrots that are doing nothing is is half as popular exactly
half as popular as the whole way show wow bit what's the term skibby brain rot Ohio like I don't Fair it's godam R oh is moving's moving he's running across the screen and now he's hooked he's running he's running he's so cute oh yeah I am I am now a feret watcher all right okay we talking about let's to another one having getting more birds no okay cool having worked on Cyber Punk it feels good to see it being used for benchmarks what criteria do you use to decide which games are used for
benchmarking I will say that a lot of our criteria has not been necessarily the criteria I might have used if I was um uh kept in the loop on it what I will also say is that the criteria we should be using and the criteria we'll be using going forward is that we're looking for games that are Benchmark so that um so we can get repeatable runs out of them uh we're looking for games that are a mix of CPU dependent and GPU dependent games we want to have a mix of popular games even if they're older and newer
games that take advantage of the newest features and therefore could be indicative of future game performance could be that's a big asterisk um and we are looking for games that basically all of that boils down to we're looking for games that will help us separate the best performers from the worst performers and it is some combination of of relevance to the play player base feature support and demandingness the strain that it puts on various parts of your system loans lug and Dan how good is a
chaotic role like Dan's for career development right now I'm able to choose between doing interesting stuff without any Focus or a stable narrow job at the same company I don't know I was going to leave that to you guys who employ me and dictate my career rather than me who does the things and the stuff I don't really think of myself as dictating anyone's career I think people make themselves valuable to a company and are therefore valuable or they don't so much and they discover that um they
aren't I know there's a balance I think yeah I think sometimes it don't become indispensable it can it can somewhat depend on who who you're going to have to go to if you need advancement within the company or whatever because some people can treat that very negatively where like oh you're used for a bunch of different things and if I promote you uh I'm going to have to replace you in all these different Realms therefore I'm going to halt your career progression because
you've been helpful that's super toxic it happens though yeah um there's also Pro like a lot of it comes down to what is the like culture of your workspace and who are you actually working for um because that's going to affect this a lot and if you if you think if you don't think you're going to stay at the place that you're at I think it could be a risky strategy because trying to describe what the heck you've been doing for a while to a perspective employer is going to be a lot worse than just being
able to write it down in one line because you had a very easy to understand here's my job title yeah this is what I did here's my job title there's all kinds of different advice that could be good for different situations like my whole the way that I made my way through the ranks at ex so quickly was by doing the job that I wanted to do so I was always spending my time doing whatever I aspired for my new position to be and we had a really loose uh management structure uh that allowed
that but that's not necessarily true at every role so that's really tough you know other sort of generally good advice is you know get your boss a promotion um and then take his spt and then and then a lot of the time no like playing playing that game politically they'll take you with them oh yeah yeah yeah um yeah make make the other people around you look really good the taking them with them thing is interesting because i' I've observed this a few times actually where like someone gets a
promotion or even sometimes moves positions entirely yeah to a different company and then they're like well I really like working with this particular person I'm sure a lot of honestly a lot of skills in the workplace are quite transferable so I'm sure they can learn this new role and instead of like trying to fish through hiring which is honestly a nightmare um I can just bring this person on that I know is going to do well it's like yeah a lot of people are saying like times have
changed and you know what the times had already changed I mean realistically Millennials did not get a great ride in the workplace um I got I got kind of Lucky slash I I did the right things some combination of the two um and yeah Top Gear 1224 is advice move jobs is is a really important thing if you want to if you want to optimize uh your career path but it sort of relies on being able to sell yourself to a degree right um that's that's part of the whole process of reapplying for a new job is you have
to be able to to Luke's Point communicate effectively what exactly it was that you were doing and why it was so important and why it will be a benefit to the new company so they should pay you ideally more right it's tough every situation is so so different yeah yeah sorry A lot of it just depends on what your situation is yeah hey lldd I Dan sitting here going well I have no idea what to do with any of that oh I mean that's fine I I can't get Luke promoted I mean what's above sea
level I have two of those sea level at a bigger company he's already got two companies I don't think he needs more I don't want more dude what about third company oh goodness CTO of Smash Champs oh basically am actually oh crap you are hey lldd I recently started a new job as a su uh I don't actually know what s stands for um software engineer swe software is one word I would assume software engineer yeah me too uh in the US my company recently bought in ad am brought in an Amazon executive who
stack rank aggressively and turned 15% of the teams every six months how common  industry I mean we've talked about it a bunch of times layoffs.fyi or is it just layoff layoffs.fyi I'm still sticking with sweep yeah layoffs.fyi um is an interesting site to poke through every once in a while um oh yeah GM had a big one recently yeah and like this a bunch of software people this thing where you bring in a leader from a company that knows how to fire huge amounts of people and then you just use them to cleave
your company down for stock value or whatever is that's a thing has been a thing as well for a long time um it's it's more talked about now and a lot of really big layoffs have happened over the last little bit but like this type of activity has happened for a long time yeah layoffs and stack wrecking firings are different sure whatever ignore the terminology firing a bunch of people is  meant hey dl. dll I recently picked up a wearable subwoofer called the basslet sorry baselet you did a video about it 7
years ago do you remember anything about it it was my first LTD video baselet yeah it was a piece of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] wearable subwoofer yeah it basically vibrated on your wrist and it was supposed to create the effect of like very deep base or something like  yikes found the kickstarter yeah where's uh where's our video on it I'm uh some of our old videos are very difficult to find yeah did did they know what a subwoofer is here we go I like that yeah that's that's more like
it um what's up oh I've been meaning to ask James if uh he knows they're using  this become a member to this channel we used to do a lot of really fun like uh skdy type stuff join now yeah so there you go yeah you plug the thing in or something and it's like I don't know there's no way that would ever be good yeah no it's it's dumb less stupid than it sounds I want one now it's silent the full power of music and high definition anywhere you go the power of the baselet watch siiz subwoofer
delivers base right into your body um yeah so basically it's uh yeah it was pretty dumb I think why is this the most replayed moment oh okay that's why very cool it's funny like dude every time someone's like yeah I'm not that into anymore because they've like become all about like I can't believe they do potty humor now we definitely didn't do that yeah literally forever yeah oh well anyway next one afternoon good s how do you both manage the fact that you're the bosses but also want to
get your hands dirty Luke we need to see you in more videos scrap your words scratched an itch um I I want to do more I mean that's why I'm bringing in more people to help with administrative stuff it's still not helping much cuz I'm just doing we were so under admin that um like I think we've had a lot of challenges to overcome as a company as we've grown I mean a lot of businesses fail as they make the transition that we're making right now um we have a lot of processes to continue to build it's
an it's it's always it's a journey it's not a destination um I do want to get my hands dirty more but it hasn't been possible as I've ended up just sort of plugging more gaps that we just didn't have any coverage on before I think we're better organization than we were but I think it's clear we need to add a little bit more structure even now and I think there's things that we can do to um to make the whole thing run more cleanly and require less constant interference from management because I
don't think anyone's happy about that I don't think management wants to be constantly stepping in on things and I don't think people like management con ly coming in and you know nitpicking at things so um hopefully someday some someday Someday my job will be to like just play with the stuff again because that's really what I'd like to get back to any plans for LT jeans nope jeans are hard greetings Dan lonus and Luke lonus are you reconsidering swearing by distilled water after the leak I've used 80s Volks
vagen coolant for years and has corrosion inhibitors for copper um yeah I think I'm just going to give up on some performance and throw a bunch of antifreeze in that Loop and we're still going to do the like grounding thing whatever like we're going to try and make it not um electrolytically corrode or whatever was going on in there but I think I'm just going to throw some anti-corros ofes in as well hey lonus I've been playing badminton non-competitively for about 3 years now any tips for people trying to
step up their game and what's your personal racket shoe shuttle recommendations uh shoes you should you should play in whatever is the most comfortable for you um here hold on a second uh rackets uh same thing you shouldn't spend a ton on a racket until you are an extremely high level player realistically you are way better off with like an entry level as long as it's a onepiece graphite like like carbon racket like don't get one of those ones with the T joint with the like made out of aluminum or steel or
whatever like get a proper carbon braacket but beyond that I would say get fresh strings and get a good quality grip that's way more important than the than the racket for a novice level player um as for how to get better this is a great channel uh badminton Insight uh these two have just uh outstanding outstanding on camera personalities um really good tips uh they are current professional level players if I recall correctly uh and there's just so many well insights about Badminton uh in
their content they also do some really fun stuff they did one recently where they played against um this 8-year-old and 10-year-old that are absolutely incredible little girls players that are ripping it up in the UK right now winning some U7 tournaments and stuff like that see if I can see if I can find it doesn't matter anyway uh they've got a lot of really great tips and a lot of stuff that you can practice at home on your own you don't even need a court for so check those guys out they're doing a great
job and last what sorry I'd be so down do a collab oh yeah that'd be cool uh the last one I've got for you is the Lux screwdriver still coming someday um it just hasn't really felt like the right time to do a you know $300 screwdriver or whatever it's going to cost once we're Machining every piece of it out of solid metal um Apple leather you should do an apple leather potentially like Exotic Metals you know like it's um it's felt like a it's felt like a product for a
more uh prosperous time and a lot of our audience has been uh has been suffering in a big way like a lot of our audience comes from gamedev comes from it comes from um like the cloud comes from these companies that are just announcing layoffs after layoffs so one of the main reasons we haven't moved forward with the luck screwdriver is that we felt that it would just seem a little toned deaf like we're not going to build we're not going to start building lowquality products we're going to unapologetically
make high quality products that cost what they cost but the Lux screwdriver um feels like such a such a 0.1 percenter item that we're kind of thinking we're just going to leave it alone for a little bit yeah we'll still we'll still do it someday I'm sure because it's really cool but like yeah not immediately yeah  oh and I guess that's speaking of immediately it's immediately time to end the show oh we'll see you again next     I'm so s we really need to make sure that we have
