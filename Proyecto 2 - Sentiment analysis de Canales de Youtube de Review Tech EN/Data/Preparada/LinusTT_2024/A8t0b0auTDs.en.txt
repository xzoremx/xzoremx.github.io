what's up everyone welcome to the W show we're going to be talking about all kinds of great stuff but of course the big headline topic is that Intel Arc doesn't suck what happened I don't know how to make sense of this world anymore because it doesn't suck and I'm excited and it's not just me people are actually excited the whole industry seems genuinely hyped about building a gaming PC for the first time in flipping years so I know we already made a 16 and 1/2 minute long video about battle mage but
I talk more I want to talk about battle mage some more time to Yap especially some of the observations that I've made about people's comments on it and about people's viewership habits on our other videos as a result don't look at the dock he's trying to SPO I didn't I didn't I open a new tap I open a new SPO all the things you're hurting the laptop we're also going to be talking about LT and short circuit have they gone too far with the clickbait oh the world it turns out is not actually
upside down what unless you're in Australia in which case it's not news is the thumbnail like good for them I think so I think they can see it better what else we got today oh right I'm supposed to do something yeah you're actually supposed to have the dock open and be looking at it yeah but you got mad at me so I you didn't even have it open I opened YouTube uh okay uh you can buy a car on Amazon that's weird and there there's like almost no other  topics Blu-rays battle mage buying a car and then hang
out the show is brought to you today by MSI vessie and Squarespace and of course our laptop partner LG our rap partner dbrand and our chair partner secret lab why don't we jump right into our headline topic which is of course Intel Arc battle mage Against All Odds it's great did you watch the video yes well yeah well I don't know I don't I don't know if you watch our our review of a GP eight talking to you about it and I reviewed the video okay well I don't pay attention to these things
Intel finally what do you mean we weren't talking about it I know but you not pay attention you have any idea how long my week's been this week it's been crazy I was really surprised you were up yeah well I didn't have a choice I was I've been up at the beginning of days I've been up at the end of days it's been a very very hectic week Intel finally launched their anticipated Ark b580 GPU this Thursday and across the board reviewers and the public are impressed it is built on the latest
generation of Intel's XE architecture and provides a great value with 12 gigs of vram outstanding 1080p performance and even strong performance at 1440p in our testing it provided a 20% uplift over the RTX 4060 while undercutting the 4060 on price at just $249 the card offers a compelling value if you can get one one note I will put out there is some other reviewers you know we don't always test the same games we don't always test the same games in the same way some of reviewers have found uh
slightly different performance like maybe the 4060 does pretty well in like some random title like if I remember correctly Wendell said comparatively it did pretty well in Starfield or something I don't know maybe just check out his video I mean dozens of people are playing Starfield yeah with that said we don't necessarily choose games for our suite based on how many people are playing them we have plenty of games in our suite that not a ton of people are playing Benchmark well because a lot
of the time you're looking for consistency and you're looking for games that represent something so they might represent okay we need to evaluate Vulcan performance or if there's a particular feature we want to look look at like Ray tracing we need a game that um supports various implementations of super sampling we need this we need that so a lot of the time The Benchmark Suite is not just down to what games people are playing but it's down to what exactly it is we're trying to test I
sorry one I'm going to interject really quick my flight back from France when I was going to the bathroom mid-flight uh as I was walking down the hallway thing I have to go sideways I saw somebody on a steam deck playing Starfield no way I knew it was Starfield because they were on a loading screen when I came back from the bathroom they were on a different loading screen I was like yep I really wanted to stop and like talk to them like why why but but I didn't I just left
them I left them be anyways so Intel reference cards immediately sold out most aib partner cards which are priced around $10 to $20 more are also sold out hopefully restocks will happen soon I have a short conversation um with someone at Intel I don't want to get them in trouble but basically I was like please tell me you have lots of stock coming and I'm not going to look like an  $249 we are expecting weekly replenishments on the reference card and working with Partners to offer steady
availability I said okay you got to control the channel tell the boys come on there will be money to be made later don't this up we need momentum seriously passing that along verbatim hell yeah I don't know that they have any power I don't know that they even know anything this is the janitor I was talking to the janitor at Intel's Graphics division that's that's the only person I know there I'm not important enough to have any like you know high up contacts or anything like that but what I what I can
say is that I co I have said what I can to the janitor at intels hard about hey gets it done don't get greedy here you need to buy some market share your partners need some market share Sparkle is not a relevant GPU maker there there's there's GPU partners that are running away from Nvidia if you're nice to them right now like be a valid option but with that said I mean I'm telling Intel don't be that nice yet true there will be time to make an extra 10 bucks it will come oh I see
what you mean yeah yeah but you got to control Channel bying not now the buyers yeah not now now is not the time to look at the market out there and go o this card is priced attractively we should we should [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up the pricing and price it less attractively just win just win win the hearts and minds of Gamers it's important right now you've got x amount of months until 50 60 comes out we don't know how long genuinely that card will come out and then that's when you know
we'll see how you're doing now it is worth noting EU viewers have pointed out that the card is being sold at the same price as the RX 7700 XT in Europe which is a 400 doll card uh the b580 it's good but it ain't that good that's another thing that Intel and their Partners need to get figured out is global competitiveness for this thing needs to be good with that said given they can't keep the bloody thing in stock I can see how it's a lower priority but guys make as many as you can please
um this is in my notes Pat gelsinger's fasting and praying paid off yeah I just opened this up um every Thursday I do a 24-hour prayer and fasting day this week I'd invite you to join me in praying for what is this what am I even looking at right now hold on a second I don't "really for the 100,000 Intel employees" as they navigate this difficult period Intel and its team is of seminal import to the future of the industry and the US this is actually incredibly important uh
and I do want to talk about this later and I have to say that I just want to shout out that I hadn't read this tweet yet but I think some of Pat's tweets have been hilarious I haven't looked at it and I love that he's just out there tweeting about the company immediately after leaving dude I just I want him back already it like can they just hire can they just say look we were wrong oh wait battle m is sick maybe come back can they Sam Alman this and just be like bro I'm sorry can we just have you back
because we didn't get it this is like the first thing that has come out that has actually been like Pat's Vision start to finish actually no he came in after he came in a little bit after but like okay so that's not the first thing the point is that we are only now starting to see things that he actually really had had a hand in I mean it has the same problem as politics where you'll come in as the you'll come in you'll set a bunch of things in motion oh we didn't make enough quarterly
profit see you later buddy and then the next guy or gal comes in and it's like oh great job all these all these products are doing so great let's count beans oh I'm inheriting this garbage heap time to work on that for like fixing that for 3 years and I get one year maybe to like reap some of the benefits of what I did then I'm out probably like G okay I'm just uh anyway I'm jazzed uh okay what else we got to talk about besides the question of value the other big question for Arc
was game compatibility while our testing was relatively smooth except for cyberpunk 2077 Ultra Ray tracing which crashed uh problems are still present as many reviewers did encounter issues in a variety of titles apparently Starfield is still a problem game for Arc gpus I think that's one of the reasons why the 4060 did comparatively well that makes sense so it might be good to wait a bit let the early doctors help Intel sort out the bugs but also looking at how dedicated Intel has been to improving
their drivers on the first generation Arc Alchemist cards that was actually crazy you should you should buy a product for what it is right now you should not buy a promise etc etc etc however I do believe that promises can have varying levels of credibility and I think that if intel were to say we are very dedicated to improving the drivers of our gpus I would say that that is a credible promise and you know it doesn't always work Starfield isn't new and Arc gpus like if I remember correctly didn't even
work in Starfield when it first launched wasn't that a thing I don't remember I don't remember it was bad whatever it was it was bad and it's still not good so like they're not completely acing everything again don't buy things on future promises but if you know effectively like what games you and your crew play and you can look at how those perform based on some review that's probably checked it out or some number somewhere on the internet that you can find you might be able to see hey this
works for all the games that I play right now um so maybe that works for me and then cool yeah now I want to come into sort of a a transition topic from that and this is that my job is so much easier when there are good products and they're a great value like do you have any idea what it felt like  py sorry uh to wake up in the morning actually that has not aged well no it really I was just going for the Kesha lyric okay yeah uh that wow yeah shout out Kesha no I don't by the
way and neither do you I forgot that I forgot that P Diddy is also Puff Daddy I caught myself we're we're improving you know it happens over time we work on it we work on things has she changed the lyrics we improve we learn we learn cultural references hard [Laughter] pee sorry dot dot Justin said that that got apparently the lyrics have changed casha has announced this is from August that she will re record her hit song Tick Tock changing it from wake up in the morning feeling like pidy to wake up
in the morning feeling [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] P didy so that's something all right yeah I mean she's highly relevant these days yeah um any who the point is where am I going with this no oh okay uh the don't yeah her her career my my understanding is is sort of a sad story actually yeah I mean I don't anyway okay the point is the point is um I woke up in the morning with a 99% like ratio on a video feeling like a respectable human yeah feeling like a feeling like anyway um we didn't need an elaborate
hook you know oh yeah or a weird thumbnail or or like a like a it felt good to watch a three-day shoot or you know it just all we had to do was execute we got our briefings the labs team did a great job the writing team did a great job the production team did a great job the editing team did a great job the business team did a great job we s sold our sponsor spots it was like it was like a breath of fresh air like this machine felt good this machine is is built to survive anything but boy
does it ever run better when tech companies make a product that anyone [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cares about and wants to put in their fcking computer when you take out the like discarded kitchen grease and you put in some actual gas and it's just like oh wow wow it runs nice now we're cooking like dude it is it takes me back to years ago oh yeah like like it it is such a stark contrast when when we were when I was sitting in script review okay and I was working on the intro with the
with the writer for that video and we were going through and I was like no no really when was the last time there was a $250 GPU that anyone actually wanted to buy oh seriously not that they were like forced to buy because there wasn't a valid option whatsoever I think this is why a few different creators all included like 1060s and stuff in their reviews like because that was the last time time it's been 5 years and like I I had this line that I is this the like Mark that like the the
co era is over maybe like finally dude I had this line I had this line I put in the in the intro that I was like almost half of the time back to normal that lonus Media Group Inc has existed oh that's rough there hasn't been a budget like a a value GPU launch worth writing about there's been nothing 1650 was like kind of okay but they cut it down it sucked we knew we weren't getting the value that we could have gotten like dude like we've gotten we've gotten like how many products in 5 years
have we gotten that have blown us away with their value like sure okay Oculus Quest series you could make that argument but what did you give up for it right like it wasn't just Intel's not asking for anything in return here's the GPU give me $250 that's it we don't take your personal data just play video games fck yeah you know that's what the review felt like I think my my favorite part was when you you ran out of like positive things to say so you're just like blah blah blah what I don't
remember exactly what you did but it was great I was I had read the script so when I was watching it I was getting to that point I was genuinely like what am I going to keep saying cuz like I know what these graphs are and then then yeah you were just like I thought it was awesome well it's like I you know I just I want that to be the case like it's do you know how unfun it is to whine about things and and you know how unfun it is to feel like to feel like a shot messenger sometimes oh yeah like I
remember the amount of flak that we took in the middle of like 40 series when we basically came out with a review of some card I forget what it was and we were like well realistically in the current landscape this is a deal I don't like it but it is and we got Pitchfork over it and the number of people that were messaging me dming me leaving comments and they're like lonus you need to hold these companies accountable you need to put pressure on them to lower the price like I don't I don't have any power I
don't have that power you think you think Jensen Wong is watching my video going hm yes lonus how should we price our GP he doesn't care what I think we have to all try to work on it but it almost doesn't matter when they're just selling it all the computer anyway it doesn't matter at all because at the end of the day I can whine about microtransactions I can whine about overpriced gp% of people buy them I can whine about a lack of innovation in the tech industry I can wh about all these
things it doesn't matter as long as people buy them money talks and at the end of the day I'm not buying gpus so I can offer my opinion and they might take it under advisement but that's it and so I'm sitting here going like on the one hand yeah I hate getting shot as a messenger but on the other hand boy was it ever nice to just upload a video with some really great news and have people be like wow good job but that's the reason I'm bringing it up is like yeah I think our team did
an EXC job of executing on that video but on the other hand I want to make sure that we are giving the credit to where it is due which is the great work that Intel's software team has done that Intel's engineering team has done and that Intel's management however not present they may or may not be now maybe other than the ones involving the removal of yeah how someone special how good the job the people who have supported this project for this long yeah there we go now it's clear that
this discret desktop GPU would have been killed ages ago if that was the whole picture uh Intel needs a GPU product for the data center they need a compelling GPU architecture for their mobile devices and that's what battle mage gave them because it doesn't it didn't it made lunar Lake their their new their latest mobile chips it made lunar Lake more competitive as well they finally and and that's one of the reasons that hopefully knock on would we are going to continue to to see new uh new
architectures going forward Celestial is apparently baked so they're they're they're they're working on um like the hardware level stuff now but apparently the design is is is is is is I I think baked was the word that was used but um there was a little bit more Nuance hold on Celestial baked Intel hold on I'm trying to find the quote Tom Peterson confirms that uh druid is already in the works and that the hardware level groundwork for Celestial which includes architectural layouts and prototypes is
done speaking of which wow Mr Tom Peterson T So Exciting yes yes fantastic job of communication around this launch I didn't feel like there there's been so many times throughout the years like back when I used to do review stuff and and even more recently where you feel like you're you know getting the wool pulled over your eyes including in the past just to you know sorry guys but give you a little bit of a rib from Intel y this time no he showed us charts where they lost because they're like here's a huge
amount of games this is how it did sometimes it did poorly usually it did great cool like it felt like I was getting actual information not I like we were getting actual information leading up to a launch that helped us understand what should be happening during the launch at all like it was very open transparent which is which is really helpful for us because at the end of the day we're going to figure it out anyway if your product sucks so like so you might as well help us and I think tap
gets that he's been around forever yeah um and it's just it's very it's very helpful I think having his influence on things yeah because it's not like we don't want to tell the positive side of the story as well yeah we loved doing this this was great we want to tell the whole story and the more information you give us the less time we spend just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] trying to find what you're trying to hide from us and the more time we can spend working on Crafting a message that
helps communicate the product because at the end of the day that's what we want people to know we want them to know what's bad about it what's mid about it what's good about it which ultimately should be what you want people to know that's how marketing is supposed to work you're supposed to come to us with the marketing materials we're supposed to read it interpret it test it and then present that alongside our own findings to the audience yeah and then they can make an informed decision it's about
informed decision making and so often it feels like a battle and uh this time it felt like uh you know we were on the same side almost like it felt like they were genuinely trying to help us make good content which sounds like that should be pretty normal but it's like super not uh so anyways I just I wanted to shout that out because I appreciate it there's a couple other uh there's a couple other kind of comments on this topic here um this is amazing this is a direct quote
from Adam sgard from the writing team this is the first full-blown positive CPU or GPU review that I've written in my three years here at LT did a great job of it yeah he did a great job I mean like considering you've only written negative work great job of writing a positive on he's only ever worked with lemons you give this man some lemonade he's going to put that powder in the glass he's going to Stir It Up ah delicious right yeah um but yeah after years of creeping price points low
part availability and cool but expensive Tech I feel like it has broadly deflated interest in the hobby which makes our job as content creators so hard do you guys think we want to reach for like complex uh video Concepts and like you think we want to react to stuff on Reddit no we'd love to be we'd love to be making videos about cool new gpus and CPUs and RAM and cases cool stuff that's what we that's what we want I mean people wonder why our content has diverged from a strict focus on PC
hardware and building PC Building PCS is because there's nothing to make videos about and no one [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cares man we've uploaded videos on like how to build a PC recently that have just bombed because people don't care they don't want to do it but here's what happened immediately oh did those types of videos crank up did you see the screenshot that I sent to good for the culture watch this watch this did you did you see the screenshot I sent to the approval chat okay watch
this watch this okay so this right here is this right here is a me not knowing how to use an iPhone hold on where's the where's the thing the approval chat where's my where's my screenshots here they are I like your watch here they are check so oh yeah my little unicorn uh okay here we go here we go here we go the labs concept so here's the arc b580 okay so this is the next day and so we got obviously some recent videos upgrading my Big Brother's PC rented in Airbnb look for hidden cameras and you
know some stuff anyway uh the point is here's as we go down the list we've got how to build a PC the last guide you'll ever need some other crap how to build a PC the other one the older one the last guide you'll ever need immediately it's almost like entry level computers are good for once in years it's almost like it's a mistake to turn your entire product stack purely transactional price everything feature everything for what the market will bear it's almost like that's going to kill the enthusiasm for
your products in the long term it's almost like when someone comes in with something that's legitimately exciting instead of just seeing everything in terms of total addressable market and optimized profit to expense ratio blah blah blah it's almost like you can create new customers by making something that's exciting and gets people talking gets people looking into into it gets people exploring and wanting to learn thank you very much Intel and this is a really really important thing that I want to bring
up guys Intel Arc is going to force the incumbents to react Nvidia and AMD are very likely to bring their cards down to a price that is competitive with Arc don't forget when you're recommending a $50 GPU to a friend or building a new machine don't  happen we've talked about this so many times in my opinion there's a value to that people root for AMD so that their Nvidia card can be cheaper yeah but now Arc is not just like a crappy option that we hope will become a good option someday it's a legitimately
good op a solid option right now it's a solid op option was building a computer for a friend or something in this price point I would probably throw this GPU in I might check what games they play make sure it's going to run well but you know you should do that anyways we've just gotten a little soft on that because over the last years basically everyone's just buying Nvidia cards and they pretty much work on everything which is cool but it's not that much of a lift they want to play like rocket league and
League of Legends and something else like you're probably fine sweet if they want to play Starfield just tell them don't bother Steve j3d here in chat says I just had some somebody asked today about what Nvidia to get for under $500 I told them to look for a b580 Nvidia doesn't have real Options under $5500 dude $5.99 used to be like an ultra card like that was a top tier card that's very highend that's now basically where Nvidia starts having a valid option at all cuz I'm not I'm not counting these 8
gig vram cards especially now that Indiana Jones and the uh what is it what's the sh what's this a great CC suggestion from LG community in full plane chat yeah great circle chewy but sorry he said can you combine it with an APU and use that to handle older games that the b580 might not be good for yeah possibly actually that's actually not a yeah bad strp cuz Intel does struggle a little bit with especially some very very Legacy games yeah but modern CPUs can probably handle that actually that
actually ties me right back into um one of the other things that wanted to talk about here um I want to call out AMD where are current Generation ryen 3 chips where are they I understand people can buy a last generation chip or whatever on in some ancient architecture or like a two generational chip for your value segment but like what the heck you used to have value chips you used to launch the entire lineup ryzen 7 ryzen 5 ryzen 3 like the whole thing was there and also
you had thre thread Ripper for consumers remember that like remember getting people excited about products and making stuff because it was really cool and because it would Delight your customers and while we're at it where are your non-x ryzen  hello we talk about this this I think it's an upcoming video but we talk about AMD shift and strategy where they used to launch them at the same time the X and the non-x expence and then then they started launching the X first and
following up with the non-x at a lower price but like pretty comparable spec "and now for 9,000 x has been out for" months we have x3d where the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is the regular one no you can just pay for X we're we're doing a lot of Intel praise right now but it wasn't even that long ago that intel was the ones on top being big jerks oh 100% just not even bothering to invest in R&amp;D and make make new chips with higher core counts that's what allowed AMD back in the game and
massively jumping prices and doing things like that so it's like it's this this like remember who got us here comment a lot of it's like I will genuinely make purchasing decisions based around who's like currently yeah it's like what have you done for me lately you should never have brand loyalty yeah that doesn't mean that you shouldn't let a brand influence your purchasing decision it just means you should ask what have you done for me  oh the people that influenced the
decision that you liked all those years ago might not even work there anymore yeah yeah like I don't know uh this is a really good line in our notes instead of just producing enough to meet market demand why don't you guys make something cool and stimulate market demand please um there were some Adam uh did this topic he says here's some good value products that we've covered talking to AMD with that last L the yeah yes uh also just the tech industry in general uh but just did is why I clarified there
here's some good value stuff that we've covered um 2024 Mac Mini if you ignore the expensive storage upgrades but that is a legitimately exciting product I am legitimately excited about the 2024 M4 Mac Mini Mac minis have oddly been pretty good but yeah especially 2024 oh man his other stuff honestly Adam I don't know I think you're reaching I think you're I think you're you've got the the modern tech dystopia perspective here cuz he's got the x3d chips in here and they're yeah they're excited but
they're like really expensive um meta Quest 3 VR yeah we talked about that and also pixel a series question mark like there just man there hasn't been there really isn't a lot uh I I tell this story all the time but like when people point out like oh a lot of the stuff that goes on LTD channel is just like entertainment stuff these days it's like yeah it used to be really easy and now it's really hard now we have to we the writing team production Team all kind of stuff has to
make stuff interesting before stuff was just interesting stuff like this Intel card would just come out all the time and it was like oh sweet I don't know throw it on bench play with it a little bit yeah it's great sick cool see you your games run faster so easy there's no downside yeah nice and then now it's like oh man okay we got I don't know I'll I'll I'll do some I don't know whatever thing I see people complaining that we we don't do enough GPU reviews and CPU reviews like what are we
supposed to review where are they like we get a new family of gpus like once every almost two years what am I supposed to do with that I can't keep reviewing it if I did you'd ask why I keep reviewing the same GPU I  gpus I don't make gpus don't come out that often that's a 4060 that's a year and a half ago if we look at the 4080 it's 2022 that's 2 years ago November so it's even slightly more we still don't have a 80 yeah what do you want us to do two years and the prices don't even come
down so someone in chat review it [Laughter]  no but yeah so like okay back in the day when it was like 8 months between GPU Cycles oh yeah that was a long time ago though that was before we were even in media but fair but still still annual Cycles were nice it's a little easier annual Cycles now when it's every over two years like it's it's I don't know I don't know how when it's going to be but it's going to be over two years considering we just saw it's already been over two years what do you do in
the meantime and when that's happening to every vertical Y and when a lot of other verticals just feel like they're kind of maturing out a little bit um and like to be clear I feel like our team does a really good job great job um fantastic job they're killing it but it's just it's so hard CU you have to create the the concept uh instead of just having cool things like we would we would walk into the office there'd be a pile of interesting things in the corner yeah every day it was just like oh okay s
yeah we we'll have to prioritize which cool interesting thing to talk about that is not the problem anymore oh man anyways anyway anyways Dan we've done two topics okay thanks I'm a little swamped oh oh what are you getting merch message inundated today what's even going on today it's been 40 minutes and I've had 200 it's been 40 minutes that's a while wow do you uh look at us go hey it's wano I can dance all day is it is it the is it just cuz we're close to Christmas and people are trying
to get stuff look at the top Banner of the site uh precision multibit screwdriver bit sets and ends are restocking back orders are live now oh  help okay well let's do a couple merch messages then if you've done two topics that makes sense when's the modmat coming out uh there's my merch message new year   sorry when's mod man coming in hi lld great to see the Precision screw nope that is an incoming sorry I'm losing it uh it starts exactly the same hey lldd just wanted to say the MCM product
Suite is phenomenal finally had a chance to redo my setup when I moved and I couldn't be happier what's next in that product category I need more oh uh we are I think we're working on a smaller power brick holder um like for like little tiny power bricks the current one uh is a little bit tricky to use on really really small stuff okay uh I believe we're working on I think we're in the early stages it may never see the light of day if it doesn't reach our quality standards but I believe we're in
the early stages of a like an arch with like a flexy middle whoa so that you could kind of stretch it out and have it be like flatter or put it together and have it be like taller it may not end up making any sense um I know that we are what else El are we working on I oh this is cool now that we I've been promised that this will be coming very very soon even though I've been asking for it for like two years um could you like bungee between two magnetic ends I don't know maybe then you just take one end
off to access the cables and put the other end put the end back on that would be very complicated tooling I don't know about that okay maybe it's a cool idea um one thing that I know is coming is we create all kinds of like cool 3D printed internal tools and holders and adapters and all all kinds of cool Stu like we have uh for the for the little um uh quarter 20 threaded uh power bar holder um MCM like magnetic thing uh we have a little screwdriver holder that can go onto it and then you can just like put
your screwdriver into it and so I've been just super irate every time I see stuff like that and I'm like yo why don't we share any of this with our community so we are finally going to be publishing like a like a repo of just like all the cool stuff that we design internally store like maker add-ons um not even because a lot of it's just like stuff we just use internally that has nothing to do with maker like are like our CPU holders and stuff like that you're 3D printing it isn't it like maker to yeah
sure I guess so just your Sonos wall holders are up there yeah yeah so we're so so we are finally going to be publishing that bloody thing um I love the idea of like oh lost my little the little plastic thing my CPU came in I can 3D print a new one that's sick and we have those and they're awesome yeah they're they're already designed so yes we should we should definitely do that uh oh tian's apparently in the chat right now and he says possibly question mark so I have no idea what that means
but uh keep up the good work t no that was to the bungee thing oh really oh okay cool cool but he said that before you said oh what you said oh a big part of the of the like MC M line is going to be our cables to go with the cable management stuff yes I'm very excited about our cables dude the quality yes the quality yes I'm I've been I've been overdue to kind of modernize a little bit I'm still on type A for a fair amount of things and I've it's not too much but a fair amount of things and
I've been I've been waiting I've been waiting dude they are um someone I don't know who doesn't matter someone's going to cut them open and they're going to be like damn they're just their quality nice yeah quality inside not I'm I'm really excited about them all right damn all right I got one more and then we'll do some announcements okay uh got the OG screwdriver happy to get the stubby and precision just started a new job any advice how to help myself stand out and become more valuable for the
company man okay I got some I got some Shameless advice why is it Shameless because a lot of people I think are too modest and they feel awkward about sort of claim your work pumping up yeah pumping up their own achievements when you do something that like goes well talk about it I think that's honestly one of the biggest issues that I saw like back when I was at NC right cuz like as as the CEO or chief Vision officer whatever roles I've had here uh I have you know I have a lot less visibility into
too every single is doing and um and it's a very different perspective and then being like a rank and filer at NC I had my sort of bottom up perspective and what I will say is consistent between both of those perspectives is that whether it's the the individual contributors that are working for me or whether it's my peers that are working for the company is there are people who do great work super quietly don't stand out don't point out anything good that they do possibly get
passed up they don't get the recognition sometimes they do sometimes they do but often they don't but that relies on their boss to be kind of awesome and pay attention and be on top of it and let's face it come on folks is your boss awesome and on top of it and always paying attention to what you do in like a positive way don't don't Dan Dan don't  no Luke just said no no I did not I like working with Taran Leave Me Alone um so  bait that's what I want you to do if you think you're doing a great job then I
want you to make sure that you tell people about it make sure that they know don't be boastful don't let it be constant just you know slip it in once in a while especially if there's if especially there's someone higher up the wrong present um and if you don't think you're doing a great job and you don't have anything to talk about then kind of maybe figure that out that be find find something good to talk about yeah you also don't want to yeah you don't want to be annoying it shouldn't be the only
thing you talk about but bring it up claim your work oh and another this is actually really great disorderly says when I did tech support one time I went on vacation my boss volunteered to do my job when I got back from vacay she gave me a raise um that's actually a really key Point as well is take your PTO take your time off and make sure that by the time you take it because it sounds like you're in a new job so you might not be eligible for a little bit make sure that by the time you take it
you're hard to cover for that is impossible to ignore if you take your time off why would you and the team why would you say that what no not put obstructions in the way that's 100% how a ton of people are going to take that that's so many people that's not the way so many people that's not the way that's not the way he means be so good yes not like don't do documentation or whatever else the company doesn't let's get off this topic the company doesn't implode when you take a day off Top If your
manager notices that you're not doing documentation or that you're not doing good documentation you might just get fired for that reason so be careful yes and just be difficult to replace cuz you're good so take your PTO and be be in a position where when you get back people are grateful to have you back because they're like man I don't know how we do this without you that's that's what you want people thinking about you it's very annoying when AJ goes on vacation because he doesn't document
anything I get messaged all the time and I'm like GH that means do that means he's doing work oh yeah he's like that's good doing whatever he's doing don't  Matt really good he doesn't need to do anything more M doing great JoJo web says okay I'm going to unplug our company server and go on vacation thanks for the tip luk you give such great advice   funny okay what are we supposed to be doing then merch messages we only did one though wait we never explained merch messages oh oh leave a merch message you

them to release something new that's faster and better so that people need RAM and motherboards and and and graphics cards and and okay well I'm spending anyway I'm going to get a keyboard and mouse like we've we've been without a driver the bus has just been cruising down the road with no driver for years we need someone to drive it and it's like Intel sure as heck not doing it on the CPU side but dang it the GPU division stand stepping up and I'm loving it all right um Dan what are we

Luke when when we first started teasing the commuter bag when we talked about it on W show being like okay I'm hoping it'll be like I'm hoping it'll be like 150 to like 180 and then I'm like all over this thing and I was I've been dude it has been so hard for me chat chat's saying good price it has been so hard for me to sit here and not be able to tell them okay $149.99 yeah yeah it's good price people are saying good price okay oh dude no no no like this is huge W price oh dude
dude dude dude dude there was a Reddit thread a while back where people were like there's no way dang you're you're hoping for you're hoping for a dream uh a dyslexic Stoner 240 said terrible price could have done 14997 so what's 97 you're you're two cents too high oh okay I'm s I'm sorry sorry I'm so sorry I'll do better next time dyslexia Stoner you should have played into the joke and done you could have done $149.99 did we announce when it'll be available was that in the
thing uh December 26th December 26th boxing day here in Canada which is kind of like what used to be our Black Friday you can sign up um there's a site lg. commuter and this is this is really important if you're interested in the commuter bag you should go sign up now for the launch notification lm. g/c commuter because at launch for a very finite something we are doing something we have never done before with a new product launch on LTT store what are we doing and you are going to want to know
right away because oh we're not telling them because it's finite I don't even know what it is finite means not INF finite H so it's limited it's outside of finite yes oh yeah it's out finite yep don't let your friend be finite while you are out finite wait in no the point is sign up for the thing yes uh all right um finally fire pole what is that it's a pole that's fire oh no way W hoodie V3 whoa there are two options Dan can you uh can you help the people can you help the people respond to the poll so
let me explain let me explain you it tell meish it I want to explain there's two different possible Vibes for the upcoming Wan hoodie V3 this one is more like the original sort of w hoodie the V1 and the V2 it's got the orange accents with the gray on the black um that's cool it's also got just an updated design very similar fit to the older ones but a little bit updated uh it doesn't have the same sort of bunching in the sleeves so it's a little bit easier to kind of roll up so
there's a few little nice to have it's covered in pockets all the things that you love about you know Wan hoodie but here's the thing the WAN hoodie branding is not orange and has never been orange the W branding yeah hoodie the W branding the the The Branding for the WAN show has always been kind of red it has never been orange yeah like not not these bars on the side of merch messages he's talking about the the logo over there this here yeah cuz that thing under it is is a
there the hexagon the beston that's down there yeah um so so that's to c25 did we do that on purpose or did we just screw up no the W show branding has just always been read okay yeah so this is actually more true to the W show mhhh they are the exact same hoodie the only difference is that this is actually based on the wow colors and this is gray and red is more like the black and orange you know when hoodie colors so Dan go ahead you guys are going to decide we're only making one of them so
we got red and orange yes okay I'll do two minutes okay here comes the pool somebody was asking for a Firefox option I did Firefox poll okay show results all right so we're gonna let you guys uh we're gonna let you guys Fest on that for a little bit and then okay what should we do in the meantime I think we're out of announcements oh yeah finally so we could do another topic we could do a merge message one more topic there isn't a lot of topics we might want to hit a merch message whatever you want Luke
whatever for you let's do two merch messages sure uh line us Luke and Dan with meta offering the option to reset your algorithm should YouTube also follow suit maybe end the brain rot once for all I don't think that'll end the brain rot no it won't end the the brain rot will happen again I actually had a conversation with my son last night because um he watches a little bit more YouTube than I'd probably prefer we he's at the age now where you know we don't want to just like cuz I could I could just lock
how much he can watch it or whatever but he's he's getting to the age now where these need trying to get him to make decisions these need to be conversations these need to be decisions that he makes and it's like it's like um you know the analogy that Ivonne was drawing when we were discussing you know just parenting strategies was like it's like when my parents told me I couldn't date the only difference was that they just didn't know yeah right and so we have to accept
that at a certain point kids are going to not listen to everything you say and and you've got to arm them for that right and so one of the things that I was talking to him about and I I pulled up my Google Newsfeed and I basically went so here's the thing it takes a ton of discipline um but you can actually tune these algorithms because a lot of the shorts that he's getting fed it's shorts in particular that are kind of worrying because he's been watching more shorts um and a lot of them are pretty like
kind of educational and sciency so he's actually been doing a good job of what I asked him to do which is hey if you're just watching you know brain rod on YouTube that counts as screen time you need to talk to us about it but if you're watching educational content I don't mind you can do that whenever you want so he's actually been doing a good job of tuning the algorithm a little bit there's so much really good educational content on YouTube too is yeah but he's also clearly still getting fed brain rot
garbage and so what I did was I pulled out my phone to use as an example to show him like Hey look if I if I'm looking at news about if I click on something about the Royals or whatever it's going to be full of just like gossip bull bull spit for a long time and if you are super super disciplined you can actually tune these algorithms to feed you really good content and so I showed him I was like look okay we've got sort of politics world events um Tech uh we've got like like all the
things that I that I sort of generally generally follow and without exception there's like actually no junk in my newsfeed anymore but that takes a long time and I know cuz I just had to retrain it cuz I switched from my work account to my sorry unless you're an X oh well yeah sure um what happened to the poll oh the red one oh okay it wasn't even close it was like 69% red nice um anyway so back to the back to the conversation about around just like algorithms I I think that it would be very
beneficial to be able to reset it right but to Luke's Point having gone through that process very recently of retraining mine because I had to I switched from my work account for my Google um my Google account like my main Google account on my phone to my personal account and the reason I did that was because there's certain functions that don't work in Google Assistant if you have a Google um what's it called Google Gite if you have a g Suite account and I just got tired
of just like stuff not working and I was like finally like okay fine I'll just retrain this piece of garbage because my news feed sucks on my personal account and was like really finely tuned on my work account um so it probably took me like three or four months to get it to the point where a I've retrained my brain to not see ads in the feed anymore because my work account didn't have any and my uh my personal one does so I had to train my brain and then also trained my feed to not give me garbage that I
don't want to read uh oh the other thing that typically ends up is like science especially like astronomy science and um and like uh Material Science for some reason I've clicked enough things about like lithium batteries that it's like oh hey there's a new graphing you know whatever and like are you interested in this so I end up with a lot of that stuff and it takes a really long time so I think it's a double-edged sword is the bottom line answer to this I think it could be a really good thing if you feel
like things have gotten a little bit out of control and you like want to do a breather and reset but I also think that it could you could be better off if you have the discipline re tring it yourself so we we kind of had a conversation with him about like yeah this is this is a feed that can be useful but it actually takes so much more discipline when things are just kind of being served up in front of you compared to going out and and seeking content like the way that we used to so I don't know how much
of this is going to stick I don't know how much of it's going to sink in but trying to have these conversations it'll come and go a little bit too I I've talked about this on W show before but I my one of my favorite lines about this is like life is constant PVP um and I think sometimes people get lulled into thinking that it's not and that's like actually dangerous like it's when you're randomly scrolling things there's a war going on that you're not necessarily super aware of and it's
trying to learn about you trying to learn about what's going to keep you scrolling trying to learn about what's going to get you to buy something trying to learn how to all those different things it's constantly analyzing it's trying to tune for you you need to be aware of that and I like to to think that my kids you know take me seriously as not just like some you know okay Boomer like part of the conversation too it was actually a bit of a longer chat was like look I'm not this is not
fearmongering I work in this world I live and breathe this world I go to conferences in this world where I look at graphs about this world about engagement retention that's all they care about you are just a number and I think that something that people in general never mind just kids can't necessarily be expected to wrap their brain around yeah sure yeah you are just a number to an organization like Google you're for sale you can be bought you're even just a number to a lot
smaller organizations than gole that that's fair to say just because they're at the top of the mountain doesn't mean  um yeah yeah it's pretty wild um I Lang man says I'm not a number no we we know you langly man you're definitely a number to a lot of companies though yes which is our Point Kap says are we a numbered to you guys I think you are I don't think I recognize your username but like Crystal I know just it takes it takes time to surface yeah the fulling chat's a bit
smaller of an audience you can recognize some people um but you know it's it's never going to be everybody you can't you can't retain like I don't know unless you have some crazy brain you're not going to retain all these different names now they're all asking me if there's numbers how many are asking I mean h get it that's a number are flow plane users numbered they're probably numbered they're probably numbers in the database there's customer IDs yeah so yeah you're you're 
number now they're all fighting over who could be number 69 if I'm going to be a number I'm going to be a cool number I'm going to be the fun number do you remember do you remember the the small amount of politics over employee numbers very early in the company for us yeah did did I did I pull like a power trip and take number one or did I take like I'm number one on the health insurance are you oh that's interesting CU I think I like I don't remember may maybe I just it's been so long one problem that I
have is once once my memory gets past a certain point I genuinely can't tell if I'm just like making it up or not right cuz like I don't know if did I dream this like cuz my brain was like oh I like helped set up the health insurance and I thought about it longer I was like that sounds really unlikely it was probably entirely of no you totally did not do that I promise you why would I think that yeah I don't know I have no idea yeah I don't know maybe I like looked into it but didn't do anything
with it I was still on hers for Costco that's probably why I was probably still covered as a spouse because then we didn't have to pay extra for it I I genuinely feel pretty cool when I'm like going to the dentist and they're like what's your number I'm like uh one that's pretty cool that's it's genuinely that's kind of an alpha move it's pretty cool I kind of like it actually I like yeah I I that's probably my favorite part do you know your employee number as well are you two I can't
remember if I like I can't remember if I took one or if I took 69 or if I asked to be or something I remember talking Tov I think my employee number is like not good cuz I went to admitting that he doesn't fil out his time sheet oh then I know it's three there you go you're three yeah I I wonder if yvon is two then whatever it is probably wrong I technically moved a float plane at some point but I think hey um you're live on W show one sec I bet you uh hey I have a question
for you yeah do you remember my employee number cuz I remember I was like kind of a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about it and I uh like I I wanted a particular number or something um are you talking about for like our um company benefit number no no no not the benefit number just like our internal database like our employee numbers like what we use for seridian and things like that uh yeah live yeah you're live right now by the way but just like that's fine just like whatever my employee number is I just remember
it's not one it's not are you are you 1337 then cuz I remember there was a conversation between you and I about that wait so it's not one and I was upset that's all you remember about it cuz that's all I remember about it too so this is yeah okay I can check why aren't I number one or something like that like yeah it sounds like something I would whine about okay yeah all right okay thanks lady okay bye okay bye I'm looking it up oh what how would you know I have ways what do you mean you have
ways don't worry about it well where are you navigating to don't worry about it nothing Dan I get nothing he says he has ways I ask where he's navigating toget it you are one I am one yes oh why do you have that oh you know why do you have everyone's employee numbers  everything I'm pretty upset I'm  close oh man who's too or I just locked it I don't probably him probably I don't think so cuz I cuz I went to okay unlock it now we need to know this must be known who's 69 yeah
who's 69 we need to know okay hold on what is this oh two is two is no longer here at the company anymore unfortunately 69 is though who wins 69 is oh that's so sick and it's someone who would really appreciate it he probably would he probably knows he will know cuz it's going to be in his stuff yeah it's probably on his time sheet yep the one and only Adam saard notice how I'm not even up there I think it's cuz I got moved you're three for float plane media Inc which is weird
you and Avon are probably one and two no so you're yeah that makes sense yeah so wait why isn't why isn't he v no no no wait what oh for float plane yeah I bet you you and Aon are numbered for float plane cuz if not it doesn't really make any sense that makes sense that makes sense okay when we technically made float plane I think it was literally only AJ and I like day one of actual float plane maybe Yuki was there I'm not sure yeah okay I don't think so there's so many
peoplei a contractor do matter this is wild dude yeah it's wild Adam and I started very very same sort of time absolute absolute wam what a week for Adam yeah I know right amazing employe number kills the review got to write his first positive review of a P or GPU what a week oh man that's sick did we just find out that Adam's just a number Adam is a number but he's more than a number he's also a word [Laughter] number oh man Bas number uh okay what are we even supposed to be what are we supposed to

for I'm sorry not I don't even understand what's happening thanks very actually hold on no no wait hold that thought this is actually a really good question Jade 529 in float plane chat asks why do you have Heth Insurance numbers in Canada because we have health insurance yeah it's just that everyone has to pay into it in order to keep the deductibles and the premiums down for everybody yeah cool medication um medication used to be completely subsidized and they pulled that back so you can get even
more of it subsidized With Private health insurance but you don't need it I have this is the first job I've ever had health insurance yeah really I've been in contct my like entire working career that makes sense yeah yep yeah no it's a it's a it's a whole thing like health insurance health health absolutely costs money here it's just that it's like u a more for most system gets to luckily be somewhat of an afterthought yes oh yeah we don't think about it at not everyone
no some people have to some people still have health health costs that are quite high Y um but even even them as far as mying goes they are they are mostly well taken care of to be clear there are big downsides to the Canadian system oh yeah 100% we are at like a dire crazy need for more healthcare workers um there are there are some notable lacking points yep um I I know people personally who have had cancers Advanced through stages because it took so long to get the appointments that they needed but the
flip side is I've never met anyone who just has their bones at a bizarre angle because they broke their arm and couldn't afford to have it set yes yeah every time I've had something you know something like that some sports injury when I was a kid or something we went to the hospital I got my stuff taken care of and we left there there was no credit card machine on the way out none of our health insur CEOs have been gunned down in the street yeah not one yet and M messages you switch Camas SAR Mario costume
hi thanks for finally restocking the bit case Luke how is your final fantasy Journey going oh come on man get it together here why you guys this week darn it okay so I was I was approached by a member of the HR team Dan hold on I don't think my headphones are working all I hear is excuse Excuse excuse here I oh yeah I've got a wine in M sorry excuse I was approached by a member of the HR team that informed me that starting this coming Monday if I took my man vacation time I would have
to take the whole rest of the year off okay that's not really going to work cuz I have to do things but I am going to take some of it off and I don't have any plans so I'm going to beat Final Fantasy before the end of the year Final Fantasy 6 specifically he's been working on it for since it came out but yeah what part are you even on have you have you Advanced at all from the last time we talked about it no where you at I forget I can't even remember anymore I'm the the the main
character we went and saw like how they were born essentially okay uh and then we have to go fight those dudes okay which is kind of how the game works but you know um yeah so yeah I will have time I have no major plans yet uh that's not spoilers obviously the main character was born at some point that's not a spoiler come and fighting dudes in an RPG spoiler for that game like come on came out like 1994 at a certain point we have to be able to talk about things yeah um I'll get to it it's
like in Jaws they killed the shark oh no spoilers I've continued speaking of ancient content I've been continuing my like old movie thing I I finally watched Groundhog Day oh for the first time ever have you ever seen Groundhog Day as far as romcoms go it's awesome oh yeah I'm not a huge Bill Murray guy but maybe part of the problem is I've never watched Groundhog Day cuz he's like super charming and the the script is really tight and it's just the pacing of it is really like like fun and upbeat
like I I really am not that much of a not that much of a of a romcom guy but it's it's kind of awesome yeah love it nice yeah so and and what was great about it was it turned out that in 1985 they knew how to make decent movies it's just that the Breakfast Club wasn't one of them that's all dude dude you really like poking that Nest a little it deserves to be poked so he ruined my weekend I ruined your weekend wo how you ruin your weekend Oh I get okay oh yeah you made me watch it I was like that
ruined your whole weekend yeah my weekends are very easy to ruin oh you got to be less affected by things my guy everything hurts all the time well it's actually a spectacular does not let me be hyperbolic ever I was I wasted a lot of his time on his weekend because I wasted whatever time he spent finding The Breakfast Club I wasted whatever time he spent watching it and I wasted  going sitting crying on the floor so far I am converting people one at a time who watched the movie a long time ago and
are like yeah Breakfast Club yeah and I'm like okay here are all the problems I have with it and so far I have ruined it for Reese from Logistics and Dan already because they've gone back and watch and like yeah yeah I have no idea what I saw on this before I remember liking little bits of it and stuff but like I I came out of it being like the ending especially well the ending is like the one part that everybody loves about it really the start was amazing I I thought the setup
was actually really good I was into it 10 out of 10 that was probably the scripted part the main thing that I didn't like God yeah the character development of the one what character development well no there's there's one that it's you wish it didn't happen oh yeah oh my God so many people people wish that didn't happen you mean the girl with the legitimate mental illness who puts on some eyeliner and is now acceptable yeah that one's like what are we doing what are we talking about here
what Avon Fox are those like conspiracy theories what what did you realize the whole thing was a Dream by Claire or the main female character what that is no that's a that's a yeah that's wow that's a reach I don't think I accept that that's that's that's a reach dude anyway um anyway Groundhog Day excellent so yeah and Dan I have uh I have one of the things you recommend Red Line red that's not even old though that's from like 2007 oh God I didn't actually I just thought it was
a good movie you should watch I didn't know how that was that was so long ago shut up that was an incredible like three years ago shut up Luke 1990 was 35 years ago Oh No 3 years three years still a child you did you know that in a few weeks it  2000 Pentium 2 came out a couple months ago it's all okay the 1080 is technology is Cutting Edge a quarter of a hundred years after the Millennium how does it feel and the iPhone still has bugs yeah PS PS PS3 is a retro console that
was one that blew my mind a little while ago it's like the Wii it's not just outdated it's retro the we of retro come out dude how how many years ago did the PS4 come out it's not retro but it's going to get there I'm amazed that anybody knows what your notebook is dude the PS4 is so old there's probably people watching this that weren't alive it's 2013 well yeah I don't know if too many 11year olds watch the one I guarantee you there's a couple there's probably a couple yeah it's like PS4 is
like my dad's console yeah we had that when I was like Uncharted a kid yeah oh my God the Nostalgia for so good oh man jeez Jake's Uncharted five I'm so nostalgic people are trying to mute you mute me I mean his voice is so much lower than mine I'm sure that Dan could just put a filter probably uh okay what what are we suppos we doing right now we could do we could do another merch message sure I don't know uh wow Dan's been too busy interacting with the show here and uh his incomings
are it's getting a bit it's get a bit much um HR my boss is laughing about how much work I have to do um I don't have to do it that's you're my boss he's not technically wrong because you can tell him he doesn't have to do it it is Tech but will you actually I should message AJ about that CU L will get angry if I talk to him that is not true stop it oh my God AJ goes all these people are pissing me off the hi LLB great to see the Precision screwdriver back I meant oh my God CH
that's what he meant uh great to see this Precision screwdriver back 80 now  shut straight read it read it your self then shut shut shut should I wait for the 50 what should I shut down shut up your face my cheeks hurt just put some more  this okay 82 HR went home an hour ago I can't do anything abuse on the weekends it's it's  I have to do one every 13 seconds for 4 hours that's great if I read them I get behind great to see the Precision screwdrivers back in stock should I wait
for the 50 Series to release before getting the new 470s or by now before Trump tariffs does the same apply for used that's like that's almost like Financial advice it's oh God here I go okay fine I I think that the incoming Administration is actually starting to figure out how tariffs work again I think they may have forgotten cuz it's been 4 years um I strongly doubt that we're actually going to see like the the rhetoric has kind of cooled down a little bit now that now
that some reverse rhetoric has started and it's like hey like we will do this we can just actually stop like sending energy to like Minnesota so like I don't know um that the inauguration in like January you might need some energy um so so now that now that that's been kind of kind of happening really a really interesting sorry a really interesting side effect of this whole thing has been the the national the rationalization of capabilities uh like one that one that came up recently was H what was
it I don't remember the exact example that I'm trying to bring up but like in this whole sort of sometimes actual sometimes pseudo trade War that's going on uh when you stop countries from being able to import things you know instead of just not having it they're learning how to make it that's happening in the US that's happening in in other countries uh and I think it's going to start backfiring in big ways as we like you when you go like oh okay we don't want you to be capable of this thing so
we're not going to give it to you and then they're like okay well now we're not reliant on you for it anymore and we're going to have it anyways and to be clear I'm not saying that Canada should stop exporting energy to the states I'm saying that we should have bilateral cooperation and so we should work together that's a good thing it's it's it's good it's good I wonder what the wow this is probably H do I even want to bring this out yeah no the water are we thinking the same thing no what happens
if you stop a river forget it uh the point is just that the point is that um I am hoping I am more hopeful that between now and January Common Sense will prevail and we will not be in a tariff fueled trade War immediately and hopefully things won't just uh go up in price immediately because of no reason other than because we thought it was a good idea um I don't know what 50 Series is going to look like and if I did I wouldn't be able to tell you but what I will say is
that if you go kind of Google the rumors it's rumored to be coming pretty soon and if you know Blackwell is anything to go by like nvidia's data center products um the generational uplift could be pretty good that's all I can really tell you um if your price point is like 4070 super is based on how Nvidia has launched previous families and how they've kind of launched the top end cards to start and then trickle down as they go it may not be that you can get a 50 Series immediately at that kind of
price point however once the new family arrives it's possible that we will see some compression of of pricing and down below them to make room for the new cards so we will also see how they decide to respond or not respond to Intel given a new family only arrives every couple of years or so now I would say we're close enough to the rumored release now that I would probably hold off if I'm looking at a highend GPU if I'm looking at a lowend GPU I'm buying an arc battle mage right now if I can
get my hands on one so 470 or so I'd say you're I'd say you're maybe in the  band um another one yeah maybe sure sure with AI chips dominating nvidia's Focus do you think modern games can adapt to use more of the additional compute from tensor course the B100 has 20 20ish times more tensor core tensor flops more than standard graphics on a 4090 I mean I think that's what we're seeing in the form of you know deep learning super sampling and frame gen we're we're seeing those tensor cores being used in
gaming um like nvidia's GeForce division is is getting this hardware and they're kind of going okay well what the crap do we do with this stuff so I think absolutely we're going to see more AI built right into nvidia's products whether it's uh in terms of like um video encoding I wouldn't be surprised by that whether it's in terms of gamer friendly features like background noise reduction I don't know that we will just see straight up compute from tent CES integrated into
games like in the form of like enemy Behavior or anything like that it' be kind of cool I Ian I'd be kind of into it but I mean looking at how finally with Indiana Jones in the great circle we are getting a game that requires RTX and I don't mean that in a bad way I don't mean like oh it requires RTX cuz developers are lazy or whatever I mean it's actually fulfilling the promise that Nvidia gave us back with um GeForce 2000 Series where it was going to be a boon to developers because instead of having to
do all these weird tricks and hackery to get lighting to work they were just going to place light sources and place in-game elements and the light was going to bounce around naturally like it would this is the first game that's actually doing that and we're what like 6 years on from RTX 2000 I forget what the exact timing is um so yeah we've started to get these AI accelerators on our on our gpus um but we are still probably a few years away from anyone developing a game
that assumes that they will be there and a big part of the reason for that is that while Nvidia has been baking them into their gpus for a long time everyone else was a little slower on the uptake and we're only now getting like integrated processors that have ai processing on them neural processing units um so and I don't know is is there much in the way of neural processing on any of the current gen consoles cuz I don't I don't really think there is I don't think so I don't know a lot about
the consoles I could be wrong if we were going to get like AI powered enemy AI for instance then I think you'd have to see a console generation that leans heavily into it and that encourages developers to implement it at this point do you think you would need a handheld that could do it no not that impactful yet I don't think so no I think the I think the the TV console still matters enough for at  generation interesting are we doing one more or we doing topics yeah let's do some topics yeah
why not all right topic time hey do you want to talk about AI there's been some AI stuff this week sure Sora yeah Sora is out and there is other AI news open AI 12 days of announcements continued this week with Monday's release of Sora the AI video generator that blew everyone's Minds back in February and they gave it to a couple people and then they stopped doing that probably because I realized how expensive it was uh put that in myself um I definitely thought this is from Riley I definitely thought
it had been longer realistic AI video is so normalized that is yeah that is very true uh to the point where I really question a lot of the stuff that I see these days uh I don't know anyways uh chat gpg plus and pro subscribers have access but of course Marquez brownley had already been playing with Sora for a few weeks now um and then there are some of his examples are you bringing those up I'll bring them okay um while he brings those up on Wednesday open AI regifted a present in the form of chat
gbt integration in apple intelligence which Apple shipped along with their other AI features this week most importantly male categorization which is maybe nice and could also lead to you getting in trouble because you didn't respond to any wow it's a fake news report oh wow yeah the background's definitely not perfect text is not right but if I wasn't paying careful attention plug plug pug I like the text personally oh do you see the tech reviewer check out the tech reviewer  up
wow whoa where' that phone come from yeah yeah whoa whoa he's a tech reviewer and a magician closeup magic expert yeah wow that's smooth I mean now I kind of you know what's funny you want to like edit that dude we totally have a video coming where I pull that I'm going to I'm going to go find it in Trello right now uh while you continue talking about things so you're I'm out on screen share for a little bit here yeah also on Wednesday Google announced Gemini 2.0 which is demo which
it demoed powering an updated project Astra uh which I will open up really quick uh oh nipless cage says you should probably look at the news that broke at the top of the show about open AI yeah I don't I don't know if we have that anywhere in the dock uh I will try to get to that maybe we'll get through these notes and then I'll try to see if we can get something on that um but it is potentially relatively big news but we'll we'll have to see um the there's the project Astra assistant with
realtime video input as well as AI agents for gaming and controlling your browser I don't I don't know if I want that but we'll see uh open the eye answered by adding realtime video input to chat GPT advanced voice mode on Thursday Friday's announcement was a nothing burger just projects in chat GPT uh elsewhere in the AI verse Reddit is talking uh is taking on Google and chat gbt with Reddit answers oh wow that's actually a great idea a new AI powered Search tool meant to replace adding
Reddit to the end of your Google searches which is a lot of mine um a literature class at UCLA is planning to use AI generated textbooks 2025 but it's way but it's way better than it sounds that's not the sentence that I expected to follow that up uh the textbooks made by kudu a company that collaborated with the courses Professor Who provided course notes presentations and other material from previous iterations of the class to generate the textbook over the course of four months
kudu charges students 25 bucks per semester to access the textbook digitally that's I mean it's a lot cheaper than buying some of these textbooks interes um providing an alternative to paying through the nose for barely changed new additions of traditional cheex textbooks interesting that's not that bad okay well I mean we'll see it depends on how much it hallucinates we'll see how their final exams go and then we'll evaluate it from there yeah build this uh agent orange
instead of you know a random cleaner um AI company Artisan AI company Artisan Drew criticism for buying Billboards through San Francisco that say stop  okay we're going to we're going to look at that for a second are you kidding me wow wow wow I don't know if you heard about this but something happened to a healthare CEO recently um anyways uh advertising their sales rep AI agents Artisan CEO J Artisan say it Luke class war The Artisan CEO acknowledged the are somewhat dystopian but also so
is AI and they gave the AI laser eyes what is happening is this real they did it has laser eyes yeah it's creepy what are they doing what is it I don't know dude I don't know um anyways yeah did you did you you're still looking for that thing okay so I'm going to try to pick up an article on this no I've already got the uh blog post from I'm I'm so sorry I'm going to try hard uh sushir Balaji yeah yeah yeah um the 26-year-old open AI whistleblower who was found dead this is his last post
on X I recently participated in a New York Times story about fair use in generative Ai and why I'm skeptical that fair use would be a plausible defense for a lot of generative AI products I also wrote a blog post about the gitty details of fair use and why I believe this to give some context I was at open aai for nearly 4 years and worked on chat GPT for the last one and a half of them I initially didn't know much about copyright fair use Etc but became curious after seeing all the lawsuits
filed against gen companies when I tried to understand the issue better I eventually came to the conclusion that fair use seems like a pretty implausible defense for a lot of generative AI products for the basic reason that they can create substitutes that compete with the data they're trained on I've written up the more detailed reasons for why I believe this in my post obviously I'm not a lawyer but I still feel like it's important for even non- lawyers to understand the law both the letter of it
and also why it's actually there in the first place that being said I don't want this to read as a critique of chat GPT or open AI per se because fair use and generative AI is a much broader issue than any one product or company I highly encourage machine learning researchers to learn more about copyright it's a really important topic and precedent that's often cited like Google Books isn't actually as supportive as it might seem feel free to get in touch if you'd like to chat about fair use machine
learning or copyright I think it's a very interesting intersection my emails  website and he actually he wrote like a little paper on it on his website um yeah which this is the only thing on the website uh which is really good cuz yeah no fair use is a super super not a good and stupid defense um for training your models with copyrighted works it it doesn't it fall it would fall apart immediately unless absolutely you manage to get the case um    what else we got in AI news did you make
it through everything else I think I made it through okay well um you want to hear about other crazy stuff did you find the thing in the Trello thing I did find the thing do we want to show that or something so we did a video on ferroelectric RAM um and we did like kind of a silly  hand okay so wait for it wait for it this a good video by the way hold on hold on wait for it okay so  thing okay blah blah blah something  that W I don't know we were just on set and oh that'd be kind of fun we should
just do like a silly like uh I just thought it'd be kind of fun that's pretty sweet yeah just the fact that it was so similar to that AI generated video that Marquez had yeah that's cool people are unsure if it's editing magic or magic magic who cares that's part of the magic magician never tells you how they did their trick speaking of freaking magic dude Google announced Quantum breakthrough with their Willow Chip have you looked at this no you I Linked In The Thing early in the week I thought
you would look at it I've had an incredibly really busy week I can't use that excuse I used the word incredibly uh uh oh there it is uh Google has created a new Quantum chip called Willow that can reduce errors exponentially as it scales up a major breakthrough in Quantum error correction uh Willow performed a computation under 5 minutes that would have taken one of today's fastest supercomputers 10 septian years to complete showcasing its potential for solving complex problems beyond the
capabilities of classic computers uh this is genuinely a new form of compute uh by all accounts this seems to be a genuine Breakthrough by Google in contrast to their much debated Declaration of quantum Supremacy back in 2019 uh and maybe their uh all it takes is what is it all it takes is attention or whatever that article was that really sparked this whole AI thing and then they weren't on the Forefront of it despite writing the article on it anyways uh however Google told The Verge
that their chip won't break modern cryptography so everyone can just chill for now for now until Willow 2 what else we got and then nation states come give us money please oh this is funny Microsoft recall preview doesn't honor privacy settings recall is back in the windows insiders program after being pulled in June over lots of backlash massive privacy concerns Etc the new version allegedly encrypts screens that it captures it's supposed to filter sensitive information and that is
enabled by default this prevents it from recording apps websites showing credit card numbers Social Security numbers and other important financial information Tom's Hardware tested recall and discovered the filter doesn't work very well credit card info and a random username and password and notepad was captured despite Capital 1 Visa being written alongside the information a loan application PDF in Edge was recorded including Social Security name and date of birth and they created an HTML page
with a web form that said enter your credit card number below with fields for card type number CVC and expiration date and it captured this too it did work for some real world Commerce sites that were tested like poni and Adafruit only the before and after screens were captured leaving out the credit card information in those cases and when Tom's Hardware reached out to Microsoft for a comment they were directed to a blog post which states we have updated recall to detect
sensitive information like credit card details passwords and personal identification numbers when detected recall won't save or store these snapshots we'll continue to improve this functionality and if you find sensitive information that should be filtered out for your context language or geography please let us know through the feedback Hub we've also provided an option in settings that we encourage you to enable that will anonymously share the apps and sites that you prefer to be excluded 
product nice hey at least the new version be a database of all the smut on the internet I mean do we need another one Luke I think that's just called the internet yeah with Facebook to their credit the new version is opt in instead of opt out oh that's a lot better and you need to use Windows hello to open the recall app to see what it's recorded that's something that's something making it opt in solves most of my problem with it to be completely honest the files are encrypted and could
not be easily opened without actually biometrically authenticating or using a pin so that's the good news but also like you know yeah don't turn it on but hey you can buy a car on Amazon Amazon is launching Amazon Auto with initial partner Hyundai to make buying cars easier than ever really they have plans to feature other brands in the future you pick your car trim options browse local availability at participating dealers with fixed transparent pricing get an instant quote
on your tradein secure financing check out and schedule a pickup time should we do it what should I buy a Hyundai on Amazon why I don't know maybe I want a Hyundai you ever think of that I don't think it's going to be like an interesting experience no I don't think it's going to be I really don't I don't know but people are saying yes people want it yeah but they're going to say yes to any hey do you guys literally 100% of you use Firefox do does literally every single Flo plane user
use Firefox is this that scab again is that true what what do you guys think whoa they're saying yes no way that's crazy imag imagine that that's wild 100% of an internet user base all using the same type of browser you're kind of a  right U okay two things one this seems like a kind of a weird business Vision to me because what was that I thought there was like a buy a car online company that popped up during Co and then people realized it like wasn't making money at all and it just super
died probably I don't remember and then also so this isn't the first time you've been able to buy cars on the you could buy yeah that you could buy them on eBay that was crazy this I don't know it's just like a big box compared to what they normally ship it in I guess it's not a big box how do they drop it off and he knows big boxes no uh do big box Enthusiast no do you think it's goes to the Big Box store do you think it's an individual like flatbed that drops it off do you have to
go pick it up somewhere you probably have to still pick it up at local dealers so you still have to go to a de so then like what's the point they can still try to sell you some you know undercoding why did we do this I don't know I mean I didn't seems like a stupid idea have LT and short circuit gone too far with the clickbait um have they flow plan the topic is and this was written up by Elijah oh good yes folks we did see the Reddit thread titled what happened to  and of course float plane says yes 
anything he's so happy right now I'm glad you make him happy do you enjoy do you enjoy pleasing  whoa yes see this is what we're dealing with over here this is this is what we're dealing with okay oh my goodness um so the what the hell did I walk back into do you guys need a minute I think it's more like what did you walk in on oh I need a minute the op was expressing some frustration with some of our recent titles being lies some examples are the most recent AMD upgrade titled upgrading
my Big Brother's setup and it wasn't your and short circuits video titled this is a weird shape for a phone with the op explaining that the first lines in both of these videos had something along the lines of he's not my actual brother or it's not an actual phone some comments as well are talking about us lying about renting an Airbnb for the video where we rented an Airbnb and tried to find hidden cameras the reason this is even a w topic today is because we would like to discuss with the
community why our titles are the way that they are and talk about how even if a fringe minority is upset about the titles we as a business are always experimenting and seeing what sticks and what doesn't um Elijah says because believe me if it doesn't stick we adjust  title how that made it out the door man I approved it why like oh man I thought it was funny oh I saw I saw one of the community posts about that and I was like that's fake I can that was that wasn't us and then I I'm like man like
that's that's crazy that like so and I was reading the comments I was like no I can tell you the context that exist that existed in my brain that made it so that I thought that was a funny title because I've been trying to make a video called the background was tense hold on I okay I I didn't notice that oh yeah that was I I did not notice that I would I would not have I didn't notice that but the the background that existed in my brain for why we made the decision was that
I've been trying to convince the writing team to make a video that's like Brand X doesn't care about poor people for a long time because so many brands have abandoned their low-end products we we no longer have like a current gen $130 CPU this was not the way we no longer have a current gen $250 GPU at least until Thursday and so I was like apple who has completely forgotten about poor people forever I mean when's the last time they even made an iPhone SE like honestly I iPhone so that was my
whole thing Apple finally like remembered not everybody has "$1,300 to spend on a phone and like a" "$1,500 to spend on a computer that wasck" out so we can't have our like genuinely decently affordable headphones either that was where I was coming from finally Apple made a computer for poor people they like remembered that not everybody is a dentist and yeah it didn't land it didn't land anyway no um there's some discussion questions here but first I would like to correct a couple of
misconceptions the first one that really got people mad was the Airbnb one okay and that's the one that I actually most take exception to because in that video let's have a look at what this title was okay hold on where where are we at okay here we go here's the title here's the thumbnail I rented an airbn be to look for hidden cameras okay there's our here's our thumbnail device finds cameras okay I rented an Airbnb I did we shot this video in an Airbnb that we rented really
really step two I looked for not going to lie when I watched it I was like that's not his house step two I believed you rented one I looked for hidden cameras I did you just didn't find any well yeah obviously not because like we had to ask for permission to use a place as a filming location yet numpties and no one's going to be we had to tell them what we were doing yeah like that's fair and like some people were like well you should have like rented a bunch of airbnbs and search
them all it's like the vast majority are not going to have any hidden Electronics in them I'm I'm sure it's a thing that technically happens but actually finding one like there's I literally rent Ed an Airbnb to look for hidden cameras what the do you want from me and to show you the importance of titling on YouTube this is how this video was performing when we had the initial title what was it um I think it was this uh device can detect any Electronics even when they're off oh
yeah the new title is way better which was a super straightforward straight shooter title yep then we changed the title of the video I forget exactly where we log it somewhere and it went show went from being a horrible underperformer like the worst thing we'd uploaded in a couple of weeks to being an over performer so you know what yeah if my title is literally accurate and you're just like you're just like mad because we didn't find a camera that we didn't put that like I'm sorry it was a really good
guys if if they didn't actually rent an Airbnb I don't think they would have been I think they would have been lazy enough to just use like the kitchen set or your house I don't think they would have gone to painstakingly convince you that it's a a different house but not actually pay for an Airbnb dud we drove all the way to like abbottsford or something like we actually like rented an Airbnb and went to an Airbnb and shot in an Airbnb we put in the work for crying out loud and then the funny thing
about it to me is that other than that Reddit thread almost no one was mad about the very next day us uploading the video with Lucas where it was like upgrading my big brother setup okay he's not actually my brother that was a good joke it was just guys is joke is joke op are people actually upset about the brother just the one guy okay um and then as for what was the other one the uh the weird shape for a phone yeah so with the phone one the the only reason that I called it
like a weird shape for a phone was cuz it's not a phone it doesn't have a SIM slot and I acknowledge that first line of the video cuz like like they said um but what it does have is it has a Snapdragon processor that is very similar in performance and capabilities to a modern smartphone and that's why it's so expensive it's like a $600 Game Boy thing um but it's like it's got a touchcreen and runs like full fat android even though it like has a Game Boy interface that honestly kind of blows like the form
factors like there's a reason nobody makes the Game Boy anymore other than people who still make the Game Boy um which there a few which there are a handful doing but it's not ergonomic it's it's it's a very old very dated very not ergonomic design yeah um and so I just I just thought it was I just thought it was amusing I think that is probably the most sort of valid complaint where people were actually mad and it was actually kind of misleading and I'm sorry and we fixed it um but
yeah we're we're always trying stuff because we never know what's going to work and this ideating on titles is also incredibly freaking hard and I think people don't realize that and it's frustrating because when we name something like that uh that um nonlinear Junction detector video when we name something literally what it is or what it does it performs like crap nobody watches it it's a great video it's educational it's entertaining it's a good length it's very like just like eat
some popcorn watchable like for crying out loud I don't know guys I'm just I'm not going to I'm not going to apologize for having to put good content in shiny packaging um and yeah like we're we're going to we're going to fly too close to the Sun sometimes and we're going to have to sort of correct titles or we'll just have a or we'll upload a or we'll have like a straight shooter title that we're going to have to you know lean farther into into making it more clickable but it's just part of the game
and it's frustrating to me because I wish I could just call the video nonlinear Junction detectors explained these things are so cool cuz that that's what I felt about it that's what I wanted to call it that's I was the one who came up with the title that was like this detects any Electronics even if they're off but nobody clicked it or it detects hidden hidden spy devices even if they're off or something like that I forget what it was but I watched the the video I think I might have
clicked on it before the title update um because I was interested in how it found Electronics when they were off and if that was in the first title that that's probably why I clicked on it so that's that's another thing is like you might get a different type of person but the type of people that want that first title just aren't as common so the video will perform worse I wish we I wish we could ABC titles as well or pairings of titles and thumbnails and stuff like that and not even lock into
one but just have them be different depending on you know what YouTube knows you're more likely to click on like I'd be super down for that of time yeah I was just thinking like what what if you had like five different title and thumbnail mixes for one video and it just served what it thought that user would like the most to the individual user instead of AB testing sorry I wasn't really listening but the Airbnb thing says it was apparently actually kind of a pain because accounting was all over
it oh that's really funny uh anyway Elijah says uh this is my thoughts on the whole thing and linked to a Reddit post is it his Reddit post  Elijah okay one of our rules in the writing department is don't insult the audience and I know I break it once in a while but that doesn't mean you can uh okay what are we supposed to be talking about no it's not apparently it's not his Reddit post no it wasn't it was someone being very rude oh I know it's not yours Elijah but you linked it I
like the title at the very least what everyone no it's this one no I think he no no I think he Oh I thought it was the top response that he linked no okay fine yeah it's fine okay put down your keyboards and just enjoy the content there you there we don't look at the the top response fixed I got youah you're good okay good um yeah yeah we can go back okay yeah we're good thanks Elijah uh Blu-rays dude LG has discontinued their Blu-ray and UHD Blu-ray players this has been confirmed by flat fins HD LG Korea
excuse me didn't confirm if this is a definitive and Final Exit from the optical disc player market so this could leave the door open in case they want to make a return but they haven't made any new models of Blu-ray players since 2018 and it's no secret that sales of Blu-ray discs and players are on a very Steep and steady decline and our discussion question here is physical media especially for movies is seen as far superior to streamings due to factor far superior to streaming due to factors 
compression what are we are we just not going to have like a definitive quality version of new films anymore I think so will streaming will will we see a high quality streaming service that comes in to take the place I don't think so either people won't pay for it and if they do one person will pay for it they'll rip it and then everyone else will just download it like kind of like with Blu-rays okay this ended up being less of a main news topic more of a short conversation but anyway that's a thing
that happened which is which is a bummer because yeah Blu-ray versions are like definitely better and look way better and especially as display sizes continue to scale it's going to become more of an issue like I was um uh we did some sponsored spots for Amazon Luna uh earlier this week I was shooting those with Sammy and um you know nothing against Amazon Luna latency feels pretty good it seems pretty cool it got some great games on it but I fired it up on the 150 in TV that I have in the theater
room and I was like oh that's a lot of compression and that's just the nature of the beast when it comes to stream content as you blow it up bigger and bigger those those color banding blocks or those compression blocks get more and more noticeable I do think that local AI on our devices will help to smooth some of that stuff but but you don't want those weird Wheels in F1 maybe what I'd really just rather have cuz it's garbage in garbage out is not garbage to go in and then I could AI it even better you
know like if you wanted or not or not I've been seriously thinking buying a buying a Blu-ray of uh The Grand Budapest Hotel cuz I wanted to watch that with Emma and I was like well I want a good quality version of it so like you heard it here first folks Luke considered buying a Blu-ray how'd that go for you thought about it didn't end up doing it so yeah okay well you're part of the problem might might still do it well I haven't acquired it any other  YouTube has broken video title links on
publisher embedded videos and the source here is the Verge um here's their article YouTube quietly made it so that some of its web embeds are worse including ours here's why you can't click on the title to go back to YouTube on our videos and this is an issue that I have to confess I had not considered at all what YouTube embeds on some websites like The Verge no longer let users just click the video title to open it on youtube.com or the YouTube app this is because YouTube changed its
YouTube player for Publishers to remove branding which apparently includes the title link according to YouTube Publishers who want the link back must use the standard YouTube player which gives up ad Revenue so uh YouTube uh player for Publishers allows you to put your own ads on it I didn't even know that YouTube participated in the like no as just like a white box solution for like video Eds on your site I like I knew like Vimeo does stuff like that I know there's other like bespoke ones
specialize in like yoga courses and things like that I had no idea that YouTube even did this anyway if you use a default regular YouTube embed that then YouTube will make more money and Publishers will make less YouTube says that this change is to protect advertisers and partners because they don't have visibility into the ads that are served in the YouTube player for Publishers but publish like The Verge are frustrated um because they can keep wait hold on because their options are
to keep the links broken so people can't navigate back to YouTube or they can switch to the standard player and lose revenue or they'll have to use another player that likely won't have a YouTube link anyway and it all just kind of sucks um oh just tell them no yeah forget we've have enough topics uh Riley forget it put put your keyboard down go home I I haven't listened to the podcast fully yet but uh Dan on the labs web team shared it with me um I don't know did we talk about this did we talk
about this uh no I don't think we did yeah they have a podcast on this that talks about like how they make money and how they've made money over the years and like how running a ADF funded business on the internet in current year is really hard and things are going to subscription models and stuff super interesting I'm like a little bit into the podcast haven't listened to the whole thing I'm planning to finish it off this weekend um but like Yeah The Verge is being public and transparent about
things right now which is very interesting to me I don't know how many other people but it's very interesting to me um it's cool because like honestly I look at a lot of these sites including the Verge heavily including the Verge and I really don't understand how they make the money that they make knowing like how many people they employ and like how much of a showing they've had at like shows like CES and stuff in the past like man like your stuff is getting this much traffic to pay for all this that's
crazy um so it's it's cool having them kind of show behind the veil a little bit um so our our conversation here is like what's the deal cuz I honestly I I kind of agree with YouTube that if it's not a like if it's not supposed to be like YouTube if it's you know player for Publishers but okay yeah it has YouTube on it this seems to me like put your own ads on it like they have like a branding issue here cuz I I wouldn't want that to be YouTube branded if I was YouTube and
I have no idea what ads are going to be on it or what okay I get it but on the other hand I totally see where the Verge is coming from where in their mind this product has been degraded and they were using it and that's just the nature of this everything's a subscription everything is as a service world that we live in where whatever the deal was it can just change unilaterally and it's not up to you like from my point of view I don't even really see the product as degraded if anything I would think if I
wanted video embeds on my site not having YouTube branding all over it would be a plus but if people like the YouTube interface and that's where they want to watch it and engage with other viewers then yeah I can see how it could also be a minus I I think this is a I  sides like I can definitely see why if you're using something you like the way it works like it it could be something as simple as like the YouTube Creator Studio mobile app like it used to have a way that um from the dashboard here I
could just slide in from the side and select which channel analytics I wanted to see now I have to click this then click this then click it so they just like added extra clicks and I hate that but I'm sure for someone it's like better this way maybe I don't know the mobile app development team no offense but you guys um you'd be better off if you just hadn't touched it for the last like five years but that's a separate conversation they've fixed some stuff but they mostly just like have not
improved um the things that I think are actually important for interacting with your community but yeah last topic I would say that I'd be happy to have calls with you guys and you know talk about ways that you could fix it but we've done that and you didn't listen to any of it and now it's worse sorry sorry sorry sorry uh last topic um I don't know it's kind of boring Nvidia brings back GeForce land so they're promoting probably a GPU I would assume what wait it features a 50-hour gaming
Marathon that's a that's a specific number and it'll be on an aircraft carrier and it's us only oh yeah the last time they did one of these was a long time ago and they did an aircraft carrier land so that was cool for the 400 regular Gamers who are allowed to go yeah or everyday Gamers sorry was the term uh discussion question is epic whale land collab yeah yeah they'll bring the ship we'll bring the whales the whales yeah all right what else are we doing today I think that's it for
topics after dark are we after dark yeah oh this is hilarious trending on X Elon Musk pushed for open AI profit new email show so you're not mad that they switched to for profit you're just mad that they didn't do it for you oh I think he also did still want it to be open he just also wanted it to make money if I remember correctly these aren't new emails yeah oh no I know maybe it's more reinforcing or something but we've known this for a long time you think Elon didn't want to make big
dollars what are you talking about yeah  yeah yeah let's do it oh that was quick I was waiting oh I was waiting I wasn't sure if you're going to Branch off into something else that's fair bye Sammy bye what why do Sammy still why are you still here there's lots of people still here oh yeah we started show on time it's only like almost 7 which is like pretty late or whatever but like very early for us yeah very early for us to be on after dark yeah M we don't got to get Luke home for
eight oh wow yeah you're going to be home before 8 today yeah that's good  chocolates that wasn't even a joke I don't even are those like do younger people even know what those are after eight yeah I know I mean  bed oh man oh boy no I don't think we're going to stream super checks tonight Luke's all salty cuz he's bad at it he won't play with me anymore okay it's it's the it's the smash bows problem okay if you those smash bows if you I did screw that up if you own smash bows
or or potentially Bros uh and you play it a bunch if say say you you go to the store with your friends and you buy Smash Bros and you go home and you play and it's all fun and then they go home and don't play and you grind and then they come back and you all play it's not going to be fun we played Super checks and we streamed it one time and the one time that we streamed it lonus studied the tape like a Collegiate athlete or something and then like figured out how I play and jumped up in skill level a
bunch and then it like wasn't very competitive and that's just so lame so  lame my goodness oh man you were already better barely though yeah and now but that made it competitive and fun my goodness I I told you to study the tape too I told you I told you I was studying  ridiculous I told I told Theon I tried to get him in [Laughter] trouble no is just cheating by being better than me at everything that's not true no there's lots of things he's better than me at the usual curve is
that if we fire up a new game depends on the topic I am better than Luke for like 25 minutes maybe not maybe less and then he is better than me forever after that it depends on the type of game that's usually how it works though depends on the type of game that's usually how it works there are some I like I don't I think it would take me extreme amounts of time to catch up to you in super Commander the Supreme Commander Supreme Commander yeah no super Commander it would take you like a TENS of hours yeah at
least but what are you snickering at D but but that's a game that I have so many more hours in so if we actually look at the Curve the moment of starting to play you're probably better than I was at that period well cuz Ela said tens of hours not hundreds of hours so it was like a slight compliment I think yeah well no what that was I was what I I have like many many many many many hours in that game like back when it came out and stuff and it's it's the kind of game where like there's so many
variations in strategy that the only way to be good at it is to have played a ton of matches the skill ceiling is like infinite so being good at it in tens of hours is fine yeah one of one of the the most wild things to me is cuz we've played like on the internet with Internet people before one of the things that like hurts my brain is that you're so much Beyond like myself and your son who will play you sometimes that he seems like a god to me and then we'll play against internet people and he'll
get stomped and I'm just like oh dude I'm not even good like like I was pretty good in like 2007 or whatever right then those people some of them still play yeah that's how I feel playing factorio like I got I've got nearly a thousand hours and I'm like bad at it there's some people who are just Bonkers yeah the the one that hurt me that way for forever was Joe and I used to play the crap out of Rocket League we were very good at Rocket League diamond in rocket League champion at one point in rocket
league but a specific type of Rocket League the hockey one yeah yeah we go to try to play with the the soccer ball had no idea was happening nothing worked at all I was so lost I don't know whatever um anyways okay well let's get some merch messages in you guys any memories you care to share about the PC you built in the Denver Micro Center I go there a lot and some people still remember your visit was that the weird like we water cooled it wrong one what I think it was we built like a
super weird I was trying to come up oh hey I'm reminded of this uh we sponsored DIY perks let's go go watch DIY perks video after this nice yeah he did like a weird surround sound laser thing it came out today I haven't had a chance to  um oh I watched this before work dude videos are so SI let's go DIY perks is my idol sponsoring all the coolest YouTube ERS we are sponsor of DIY perks let's go that's awesome hell yeah yeah yeah um okay what was I searching for uh my first center I don't know here
let's see if we can let's see if we can find this so this is this one was fun but this one was in California dude I could if I was a conspiracy theorist I would think this video is staged like how perfectly the whole thing turned out it 100% was not she just happened to be the first person who asked us about that PC and bought it for 20 bucks um I don't think I've seen that video oh yeah this is the one yeah we just built like the stupidest computer I forget I forget why oh yeah because I think it was
because it had to be their demo so I was like this is hilarious I should like build it wrong so I put like really weird like cooling stuff in it and stuff that's such old light has moved  forever well they dragged me all the way up to Denver oh my  butt oh my goodness that's great oh man anyway um yes I remember that I remember the team being a lot of fun I remember them being super cool cool nice no I'm not talking bad about Denver I'm just saying it's far away he doesn't
like traveling yeah okay I understood immediately what are Linus's mods on beat saer oh uh just like better song search and like uh the leaderboards and uh like I don't I don't care about any of the mapping extensions or anything like that I just I just like to hit notes so I I'm super boring in vanilla when it comes to beatsaber modding it already breaks often enough that i' keep it minimal are you able to share how successful your Black Friday week was  sold I don't know sure it um
uh be careful how you do so it's your decision to do so yeah yeah Luke should I not curate these types of messages anymore no I mean it's his company is it though yes yeah   um see if I can find the uh did someone just kill my internet I just got I just got logged out of my gwe did some do that Luke my hands didn't even moved it wasn't me it's AJ AJ's here though what what the heck I'm so sorry Shopify went down oh no I'm not saying he did do that I'm just saying he could here we go post event summary do
docx I'm not going don't worry relax that would have been horrible relax uh okay so we beat our revenue forecast by 30% which is enormous which is huge um a big part of that was uh down to the the deals we were offering the uh hard work that the team did to get uh hold on I'm just going to open this with Google Docs instead of the preview um huge shout out to the team um man I it's one of those things it's a double-edged sword I want to call out individual contributors but I don't want to miss
anybody because then if I do then it's like yeah double suck that gets really rough to be honest but I will say that the um the team at CWS so uh Sarah Ry worked especially hard on like the landing pages and newsletters um R work really hard with the production team on a couple of shorts also awesome like that super long shaft one um genuinely just performed really well videos yep yep those were just good videos um huge shout out to the entire creative Warehouse team like obviously
the design of the products packaging like everything um but also like uh Nick and Dave uh who worked on a lot of the like nitty-gritty of the promotions um but anyway so yeah so how do we do um yeah we beat our forecast by 30% we hold on key results let me just see if I can find a thing here uh the float plane Early Access um was hugely impactful we "drove almost uh 1,500 new float plane"  cool key uh key offers under perform recipients the email uh eblasts performed really well uh we apparently had a
58% open rate on our email campaign which is like enormous what I don't remember the last time I opened a marke email from anyone um and an 18% clickthrough rate which is like if there's any people who who work in that industry let people know in the chat how mindblowing those numbers are that's absurd um one of the things that I've pushed really hard about our newsletters is that we don't spam people we like send meaningful newsletters so that they're good we also saw very very
little abandonment um or like a a deregistration from our newsletter so yeah let's go um uh challenges uh we oh we had some promotions of our products go live with influencers for stuff that we didn't have in stock that was funny that's in one of our that's one of our challenges uh but that just it was what it was the timing was what it was we wanted to sponsor these creators anyway so we don't see that as a huge deal even though we obviously could have sold a bit more stuff if it was in
stock um I think we moved through about oh I don't want to give this to you guys wrong so I'm going to say I "think we moved through about 20,000" screwdrivers Kuro sets tuna in full playe chat said normal open rate is about 10% and clickthrough is 1% yeah also belrick said 18% is me and that's just not true actually stupid and what are you doing L this sorry sorry what's your click and open uh oh for Black Friday Cyber Monday open was 58 and click was 18 yeah yeah so that's
insane more than half of a marketing email sent out was opened that's nuts to me personally that is completely oblit itating like industry industry standard numbers um yeah mystery screwdriver was a huge success so we moved through um some inventory of screwdriver colorways that were not selling particularly well what was really surprising to me about the event was the the aftermath I was expecting a huge hangover on LTT store sales not so much it did no it like just didn't happen oh like we as soon as the
sale ended sales were as good or better than before the event started which I and then they've been kind of like creeping kind of like up since then it's just I guess like wild just people in the shopping mood I mean one thing that time of year one thing that was funky was that Black Friday was um really late this year it was like almost as late as it can be so I think there's just been a lot of pent up like shopping that people just weren't doing cuz they were kind of waiting on Black Friday to to go um so
anyway there's a little bit of inside baseball you guys Raiden 428 in full plane chat said 58% is borderline sus congrats and honestly that's where I keep getting stuck onto it I don't really do you opening marketing like how did we get over half of people to opening a mark open a marketing email because it's really good they're good deals what do you want from me people were buying backpacks that came with a keyboard in it that's pretty cool like what do you want from me that's pretty
cool did it come in the back oh man no it shipped separately that would have been such a pain to do I have actually goodness I have actually pitched like maybe someday if we discontinued the backpack and we only had like a handful left doing like a a loot box sale where you buy a backp no no you buy a backpack wow and then the the staff at Creator Warehouse like inventory just like put a bunch of stuff in it as much stuff that fits in it and just ship it wow and just like you get whatever's in it I don't
know the logistics of doing something like that are completely stupid but um but okay here's here's funny here's an additional part of my argument like I I have a feeling a lot of people are just like autof filtering newsletters even like 58% open rate is crazy but we specifically drove people to sign up for this communication like that's part of our communication philosophy is that we are not sending people anything they don't want so that's why the regular newsletter I've stressed to the team
that it's supposed to be content and any promotional materials need to live alongside content it's opt-in only yeah okay and then when it comes to our heavy promo uh newsletters we used to have it set up so that you were only signing up for that event and that event only we changed our teas sees so that now it's our like heavy promo newsletter list but that newsletter list is is still we still treat it as sacred it's it's a sacred cow you don't Slaughter it because it's tens of thousands of people
with an open rate like that it's crazy oh yeah you don't screw that up it's crazy I think the reason why I'm reacting the way that I am is because especially I think more than ever this holiday season when I bought Christmas gifts stores just started spamming me like there was one store that the day I bought something I got four to five emails from them yeah and oh people they violate the crap out of can spam incredibly not okay cuz like we have a supposedly super strong anti-spam laws
here in Canada but apparently there's just no enforcement like I was getting text messages emails from companies I haven't engaged with in ages Delta Force paintball who I left that one star review for sent me a bunch of stuff just like you guys yeah um but yeah no we are not into that and that doesn't mean we'll never do like a card abandon an email here and there or whatever else but when it comes to like our promotional newsletters if you get an email from LTT store I want you to be like
ooh something good could be in there yeah we work hard we work hard for that someone asked this is an interesting question I don't know why I haven't Dove down this rabbit hole before but um Ry saww said how do you measure that an email was opened so we're not doing the measuring it would be some type of Analytics tool I I'm assuming that what they're doing is there's like a picture in there and when the picture is served to you they they know I don't know but honestly I don't know yeah it's a whole
thing yeah I've never pixel correct says zo yeah okay yeah yeah yeah yeah okay it's just a pixel not a picture okay trackers let's go yeah all right Dan makes sense it's just I never thought about it hi lldd I started a new job as tech support manager at a small streaming service oh cool I just got tasked with also managing inventory shipping and receiving and I'm having trouble finding balance any advice you have two jobs at least two um dramatically different ones too yeah I
think I think there needs to be an honest conversation about getting you more resources because you can't really find balance when you have two jobs I mean based on that they're a small streaming service it sounds like they're probably a small company but um yeah I think you should basically tell them well look here's the situation I have two jobs do I have two times the salary and obviously you can't present it in exactly way but there needs to be sort of a plan can we put together a
road map where either my workload stabilizes to something resembling one you know role or is there going to be some kind of compensation adjustment as I do I have any do I have approval to higher resources to help to balance this like what what is our plan to get things to some semblance of normal or will I literally be given double the compensation to work twice as many hours because these are these are the only three p path that are going to get us to or the quality of both is just going to
suffer and like I think I think mentioning that bit being like basically inevitably this is going to happen of these other I'm doing my best I care about my job I'm working hard but I am I am frustrated yeah I am frustrated by the fact that I don't have the time to do things to the level of quality that I believe got me this promotion in the first place yeah and and I think that'll be a disappointment to both of us you know frame it as that help me help you yeah good advice
lonus thanks wow there's a change you've done this for a while yeah it's almost like I've had conversations with people  recently Nick from the lab yeah that's crazy how many titles do you have Luke three I think hi LTT do you guys know if the LTT water bottle has any type of synthetic coating or lining on the bottle interior the gloss around the mouth of the bottle seems almost unnatural not that I'm aware of it's a gloss around the what is it just polished oh yeah that's just polished
metal bro yeah just looks nice yeah yeah all good if it's stamped that might be from the tool oh it's like injection molding the uh surface finish uh next up is for Luke I'm a business owner starting a custom software project and hired a full-time recent graduate Dev how do I ensure he's making progress on the projects and not playing Starfield all day well if you shouldn't have hired him if he plays Starfield at all so um uh do do check-ins ask to see progress there's a difference between
something in prod and something in like a local environment get him to show you what's in his local environment what he's touching at the time that doesn't mean it's going to be actually necessarily close to ready again I just said there's difference between what's in the local environment and what's in prod do not go down the route of trying to count lines of code or things like that but there's also no reason for someone to have no commits in a week um like there's there's different things
that you can kind of look at there are you you could have a developer on your staff that works in the negatives in regards to lines of code who is potentially your most valuable person uh lines of code is a bad metric um and you hired a new grad so expect them to need learning time um ask them be be communicative about what they're doing and if honestly if what they're doing is learning that might be legit um but talk to them about what they're learning like engage with them
about what they're doing um care and pay  fine if you could develop one LTT version of a core computer component CPU motherboard storage Etc what would you pick and why motherboard yeah cuz it's like the most sort of visible one it would look cool I'd make a cool looking one I feel like you could also actually potentially have some impact there that is cool yeah like more PCI slots I don't think we're going to make a better GPU how about any PCI  please hello linas I have been extremely
excited about LT USBC cables can you talk about anything that makes them stand out and what went into their development man we sourced cables from so many different manufacturers um we debated endlessly the validity of our product as uh as one that needs to exist I have pushed extremely hard for the creation of our cables they don't make any sense in the like current landscape because they're going to be expensive because um every every individual conductor has its own shielding like
they're a co-axial style cable rather than a twisted Paar style cable uh which adds bulk which is not desirable yeah that's going to be really thick is it adds weight which is not desirable and it adds stiffness which is not desirable however we're able to counter some of the stiffness by using like that really nice hobbyist grade like silicone OU sing um and what we get for going with a coaxial style cable is we get really great signal integrity and really great power delivery it'll still be cheaper
than audio file cables and it will still cheaper than audio file cables and that's kind of that's kind of our whole thing is like we price things at what they cost to buy a premium product but not what people obviously are paying for snake oil luxury products but yeah it costs more than some like and you might not want that that's why cheap cheap jfg kxy Tech cable on Amazon right so that's that's what we're making we are making really nice inspec cables with good signal integrity and good power ratings
um and that's that's it that's all there is to it we're not going to make any kind of claims that aren't true about them we're just going to tell you exactly what speed and what wattage they run at right on the connector that's it I'm very excited hi W.D are there any technologies that you thought would fail but we actually successful here's mine I thought dual slot gpus were janky and would be rejected by the market but boy was I wrong um I thought that AO coolers were kind
of a gimmick but the thing that I underestimated was the aesthetic component of people posting showcase builds and especially I underestimated the importance of them in shipping systems yeah shipping an octu nhd15 and a completely built system is not a good idea period um and so you have to go all the way back to um the acitech lclc the lowcost liquid cooling like it was originally developed as just like a cheapo like solution to to get something cooled um cheaply with water like it was
not a premium product at all so this is the original OEM acitech version that pretty much everyone in their dog uh licenses because it's patented I think acitech and then kulit owned patents on it or something like that so unless you unless you license from one of them or you found a work around that's pretty much what you're stuck with and what's funny about it to me is that when the ace attack lclc look at this when the lclc launched um it was not particularly well received cuz it
really like didn't perform that good so here's the LC DC compared to just like a basic like cooler um like what's that Silverstone n6 it's not silverstone's not even like uh this is not a particularly well-regarded cooler from a not particularly well-regarded cooler brand okay this is the pro but whatever it's just like a basic not even Tower cool like downdraft style cooler um so the lclc is nothing special um like really at all and then it wasn't until Corsair well are they cooling a GPU uh I don't
know I think they're cooling a GPU so it doesn't matter that particular review they might have been but the point is that it didn't perform particularly well and it wasn't until the corser H50 came out that all of a sudden people got enthusiastic about it and I couldn't I still to this day have not really been able to figure out why people went from being so tepid about it to being impressed by it when all that was changed was that one of them was branded acch lclc and one of them was branded Corsair and
you can actually see like the comparison is only against the stock cooler and even then um like it's obvious that if you just had like a decent cooler in here this would not look very impressive um I really think it was just nobody heard about it until it was Corsair branded and then when it was Corsair branded they're like I can have water cooling and they didn't look at the graphs and they just about it yeah I I mean I guess but that that was basically how AI coolers started was as
a complete nothing burger that no one kind of cared about other than that you could get your GPU temps down which was kind of nice and then it turned into their high performance coolers and they have never at any point really outperformed high-end air coolers meaningfully for most people there there are cases where like a triple AIO is going to perform all but the gigantic bulkiest of of air coolers but uh not much for me it was this isn't really it is a technology but it's in a specific
use case I guess the massive price jump that came with like addressable RGB fans I thought the community was going to be like I don't care Oh but there're because of the price I guess is why they cared they really did they cared hard like 120 bucks for three fans like when I saw that I was like and then everybody bought it okay guess I am wrong sounds good lonus how do you manage your kids game time at home I find that the 30 minute rule doesn't work but I still want them to have fun
um they earn game time for extracurricular activities so if they do I think it's an hour of extracurriculars they get 45 minutes of game time or something like that and then if they are buttheads or whatever then they lose game time they're like grounded from from game time so pretty much like that de lus Dan and oh yeah go for it do you know if you blanket ground them from game time for a certain period of time do you notice a reduction in the activities that are in them game time um
no not really that's cool yeah they're they're pretty good kids actually my kids are mostly not but heads cool sorry keep going no uh dear lus Dan and M leier external drives will list a USB speed and a drive speed for example we could have 10 GBS per second and 3500 megabytes per second how do we know  speed uh the one that is 5 gbit per second or 10 gbit per second is the USB speed and the other one is the drive speed that's a really good question never even like occurred to me that if
you have no context for these numbers you'd have no way of knowing which is which um I never really thought about it before but yeah it's also I can see how okay those particular numbers are obviously conflicting because 3500 megabytes a second would be like 3 and a half or like 4 gigabit or 40 gigabit or something like that like it's not like those numbers are not would not be on the same package but that's a PCI Gen 4 nvme drive right something like that pretty much yeah um what can a newbie data engineer
do to better help the team this past year my name has been sent to different teams on the project to beat of help  inexperience jump in look through the code base try to see if there's things you can help with attend the meetings um be ready to accept that if you like kind of suck and aren't ready to contribute that you need to find more experience ask people what you should do to pursue that experience if they're not giving you things listen in the meetings to the things that
people don't want to do and then try to grab those um such key career advice like be the indispensable person who does the stuff that no one else wants to do but but don't be stuck there forever yeah it's just uh you you're you're working on becoming liked on a team like people want you to be on the team and then you know you can try to ditch the the garbage jobs eventually um a common one is if you have if your team has some amount of code coverage basically no one likes doing code
coverage so if you volunteer to do some of the code coverage and then you don't do a horrible job of it most people in my experience would like that if if they do have a requirement of doing code coverage not not everyone does for for for tests to be clear more the first comment I see in response that is code coverage sucks exactly so volunteer to do that do their documentation yeah like this is yeah if you make one of their lives like way better due to you being on the team
they're probably going to want you there more uh and then you know eventually you work up to being a peer instead of just doing their dirty work it's also a cheat code to understand what they're doing yeah yeah hello hello D from Scotland making a tricky question to answer but when doing collaboration videos like the one with electr boom how do you typically split the video Revenue love the show oh that's a good question um so I read this in advance so I already have this ready there we've done a few
collabs with Electro boom medy is amazing the first one we did was can static kill your PC and in this case we uploaded our video which was edited by our editors and shot by our camera operators and scripted by our writers and uh we kept 100% of the revenue from that and medy uploaded this video which was his separate video kind of featuring um me as a as a talent in the video as well but with his own writing his own editing and he kept 100% the revenue from that so it is a tricky thing
because it's kind of unspoken like nobody really wants to be the one that's like hey who gets the money when you work together on a collab I think by and large the YouTube Creator Community is think it beneficial for both sides is pretty um is pretty uh common common good minded you know pretty magnanimous about the way that they approach collabing collabing is an inherently winwin thing or at least it's supposed to be there have been cases that have not been yeah I'm sure yeah what I was
going to say was I'm sure there's exceptions to the rule but honestly in all the experience I've had seeing this both externally and internally yeah no I don't think anyone's even asked ever but I mean one of the things that I go out of my way to ask is like hey uh you know what do you need out of this um yeah absolutely do you need me to be available to help you with a video like lwig for example he just like came up here he wanted absolutely nothing in return I'm like
okay and you know but but when he called me up for to do bro versus bro I'm like yeah I'm bro I'm there you know so one so yeah so so there's kind of this there's kind of an unspoken hey did this transaction make sense for everybody okay it's tied a neat little bow uh nobody really owes anybody else's solid but there's also an unspoken hey that really benefited one of us more than the other does does either of us kind of owe the other a solid um so the the wireless ESD straps medy
just was like thrilled with the first collab and loved it and was like yeah I want to come do another one um and so I kind of owed him a solid so when we were trying to do an upgrade for somebody and we were thinking of a creator that we'd love to do an upgrade for 10 months ago we were like oh why don't we do a tech makeover for medy pretty local too which helps yeah so that was the way those ones worked we kept 100% of the money from these but medy got a sick Tech upgrade and very helpfully came and uh
and some speed holes in his walls some of his fun gadgets for us to play with um and that's I think that's all the videos that we've collabed on yeah so Med super cool and is I think a perfect example of how without asking for anything he gives freely of his time and expertise and I would like to think we try to take a similar approach and everyone was happy as far as I know I mean we're still on speaking terms so yeah met him and his family down at open sace super cool yeah so so cool awesome
people yeah yeah just like actual good people that you should feel good about supporting yep hey lonus I like that you have a CPU tower in one room and runs of cable to three other rooms what is the current best cabling to run for this purpose previously have run HDMI and USP 2.0 or 3.0 for this um I've been okay happy with my display port but I sometimes wish that I had run HDMI just because I find it can be a little less flaky about picking up a signal when the system's already running
HDMI that is other than that man USB is tough um as long as you only need to do USB 2 over ethernet is fine but if you want to go really long distances over Optical you have to use these like expensive uh media conversion kits and stuff and it gets kind of it gets it gets kind of tricky um how long did they say they were going again to three other rooms no that's what you do to three other rooms previously have run HD M so what are your your run linkes uh mine are in the neighborhood of around 50 to 60 ft I
think oh no I'm sorry I misinterpreted this I like you have my CPU tower in one room and runs of cable to three other rooms got it uh yeah best cabling is oh man see the cost is tough for USB CU you either have to do individual fiber I I would say I would say I mean infinite cables has a lot of really good products for this um I would I would definitely endorse their products in general and then I would probably go fiber optic USB to a dock um and then I would probably go I'd probably go HDMI
right now but we're on the verge of gpus that support newer display port standards like the new uhb standards I don't know how many uhb cables exist yet though so that's something you'd probably have to look into for yourself but I'm I've been very happy with uh infinite cables Jake Jake would be proud I promoted infinite cables shout out infinite cables yeah do you think anyone will create SSD technology that will be as good as 3D XO no I mean someday somay maybe but it
looks like we're on nand flash for the time being I I miss optain actually I don't miss optain I have optane in my uh in my machine at home I treated myself to an optane I was like I'm going to have an OP  do I don't even have a current gen uh like 40 series GPU I went AMD cuz you know that was out of spite I had to go AMD yeah it was you didn't go optane out  optane they're so  now oh man hey DL what are your opinions on all the different types of screen protectors plastic glass and liquid my
family keeps asking me about liquid screen protectors and I don't know what to tell them well tell them glass hold on we we did a thing it actually works surprisingly well it did but still I have no idea if this brand or product even like exists anymore probably not um here it is 12 years ago let's go what a thumbnail I know right real world test dragging phones behind my motorbike lius Tech tips in the title I know right freaking wild so here you go liquid armor invisible whatever here's some dummy
phones and uh this is me filming yeah notice how I don't Zoom yeah yeah yeah he just walks look at him walk that's a Luke foot put that on your weird foot fetish website yeah I had those stupid white shoes for so long and then he had to run cuzz I was like you know on a motor vehicle um yeah and then we inspected them and we found that they were like oh why did we do a Blackberry they were just dummy Foams oh okay that makes sense yeah just like the key this filming quality is this the
best it can do oh no here we go okay look at those shoes oh those are motorcycle boots what do you want from me but yeah we found that like you could actually the the film was still on there Focus On The Ground Luke was still on there yeah yeah yeah Luke doesn't that's a I don't think I ever touched the focus no it just was what it was yeah it was what it was it was raw it's raw this is  time the camera that I learned on uh was it that you couldn't change the zoom no you couldn't change the
Focus right yeah yeah I don't think it had manual focus yeah yeah and there's a scratch on the lens anyway incredible you've come so far no no I mean the the company has come so far okay I was like I I never got better at filming you work in it now this is what we were using at that point stereo microphone let's go yeah I think our was white or something though wasn't it nope oh not even a little what what was that cam some sx1 is one I oh the the good optain deals on
New Egg seem to have dried up I was just checking there was a while there where you could get like some pretty sick opan deals on Just Like Old optane drives but uh it does not appear to be a thing right now do you know how many do you know how many of those cameras you could buy with the three that we're doing on  lot4 well let's like use them for a change then there you go yeah we should do we should do like Matrix bullet time just buy like an incredible amount of those cameras and just put them all I
bet I want to get PTZ in here so that we can have like one camera and then it can move and zoom between you guys PTZ Point tilt Zoom oh or pan tilt Zoom P tilt what we talking about hey there's deals on eBay though 350 bucks for one and a half terab Data Center Drive dang let's go oh I just wanted one from my swap Drive oh well just get these little guys these little guys are cheap they're cheap but yeah I treated treated myself a little while ago to an optane nice yeah I deserve it
yeah okay what I think about the si2 that was silver before that uh we never had one of those we had some camera that was white we had some uh like Sony handicam silver thing for maybe that's what thinking yeah yeah okay yeah yeah hey w. Dill question for all three of you what has been your favorite tech or related product that has had a big influence in your daily lives this year daily oh my Snapdragon laptop it's not perfect it has problems occasionally but um the battery life is a GameChanger for me
there I'm going to go with that daily life it has to be Tech not software Tech favorite tech or related product I would  Tech Luke really likes the new lid for our water bottles mhm no he doesn't he whed about them I like a lot of other things the reviews are really good though people like them that's good they're easy to clean that is good they're sanitary that is good Luke's just not a guy who cares about sanitation no I just already cleaned my water no I get it I get it you're just a
dirty boy a dirty Chicken Boy I need to start I need to start eating something else I can't I can't uh I got to escape this whole chicken thing  never Christmas bird Christmas bird I I don't think there's any particular piece of tech that had like an outstanding impact on my life this year to be honest all right then the laptop I have for work is super normal nothing  changed my computer got a lot cooler yeah he's a Bulbasaur computer does it like work now yeah it worked the whole
time well no you had issues with it at first oh yeah whatever I fixed those okay so it works now yeah yeah and it's still cool like all the stuff still in it and everything generally you know some of the Moss decided to leave um it was real moss so like yeah no there's still real moss in there that is still green oh yeah Moss is crazy yeah um and there there's some there's some stickers that I had to trim and every once in a while one of the stickers will decide toh join the fans and then I have to
trim it as well yep that makes sense I mean we did sticker bomb your fans so yeah I'm probably going to have to do that again this weekend cuz it is ticking again and it's doing the type of ticking that I know it's not actually bad it's it's just a sticker in the fan so I just got to go in there and Sh and then it's fine how about the nine Pro uh don't I have an eight Pro that shows you how much uh he thinks about it and I how life-changing it was don't like it that much yeah all right
cool as someone who is the techie of the family how do you recommend to handle overwhelming requests to fix various items and electronics say no politely sometimes also I need the opposite I parents like won't tell me when there's a problem with their computers and I'm like you've been dealing with this for so long and you didn't say anything like oh that's actually funny or when they'll or worse when they'll buy something without asking if it's any good and they'll just
buy absolute garbage want to bother you yeah no bother me you're bothering me now this bothered me so much more another one is like you want to like upgrade someone's computer but they won't like sort their files so you can get them a new drive it's like come on help me help you please oh man I have I'm supposed to Emma's supposed to be on Geodude now computer name it's old amethyst computer oh she won't just like move her files to be fair in her defense commutes for 2 hours a day and is studying and is
working full-time she has no time like literally at all but you have a cool computer  oh man howdy dll I recently bought my first dbrand skin this week due to the quality of your products consistently promoting their brand how did your relationship with dbrand get started um I wanted a custom skin for an xeria Z2 or something like that uh D Brand's head robot actually tells the story better than me cuz he remembers it a little better than I do um but  they they like moved Heaven and Earth to
get one of those phones for me because um let me see if I can find the original email chain brand uh cuz like they H we're basically like just kind of a a like a like a like a starting out brand um oh this is hilarious I had I just found a I just found a vacation responder to debrand can't reply to your email having a baby regarding debrand custom Linus Tech tips Experia Z2 giveaway so why did I why why did they why did they reach out here's a to-do list I sent to myself here's a to-do
list from me to what Nick that's just like stuff to do switch to Z2 employee evaluation form man this is wild this is crazy Patriot project what even is that review Luke sample guide I don't know Roomba script did I ever review a Roomba Channel super fun what is the last word there Gilly yeah g oh yeah I forgot about that spilly wrong this is great um sorry sorry old emails are hilarious I love doing that every once in a while uh okay oh okay here's the Outreach oh this is so funny dude you've
never you've never heard dbrand this polite hey guys hope this message finds you well this is [Laughter] old we're reaching out to see if you'd be interested in doing a giveaway of a custom Linus Tech tips branded Xperia Z2 you can check out the different material Types on our new website here we've found that the Xperia Z2 is a prime candidate for our skins the glass surfaces are prone to scratching but they're also ideal canvases for textured skins they apply easily and can be
infinitely removed and reused oh really that must have been an old feature if you're game just let us know your delivery address and we'll get working on the custom skinned device talk to you soon signed a robot uh I said that sounds appealing do you mind if I work the giveaway and dun messaging into a review of the Experia Z2 it would be similar to how I did this one and I linked our HDC you're also way too formal this is so old is this 2013 uh 2014 high Linus that would definitely
work for us would the device be skinned throughout the entire review video we'd obviously only ask that it is if we only ask that it is if you genuinely like the way the skin feels and the purpose it achieves adorable 2D brand from Linus the device would be skinned throughout Linus perfect can you send over a vector file with your logo so we can get started also do you have any preference in materials and oh this is is great so you you were starting to lose some attention span near the end there uh
yeah k k those big single letter K energy I I hand it off to Ed um yeah wow this is uh yeah this is crazy so yeah apparent he's I've heard I've heard the story told such that they like moved Heaven and Earth to make this happen because they were believed very strongly in like influencer marketing very very early on like that's did really well they were way ahead um and like I guess they reached out before they even like had one of these Experia Z2 phones I don't know why they reached
out about the phone maybe I mentioned it on Twitter or something I don't remember oh but yeah no it started out very cordial and now it's devolved into what it is now so um so them sending you phones with skins on them to do like reviews on is has been there from the entire start yeah yeah since 2014 and they've been really good at like their um at like their product imagery and stuff like even way back then there's an xeria Z2 with you know their cool uh kind of leather looking
one and they used to have like a brushed metal one because that was cool back then but it isn't now all right what else we got few more here hey D long time listener first time live what is your favorite or most interesting computer build that you've done or been involved with including any you've had to disassemble to put back together man I don't know we kind of did a video talking about a lot of these recently yeah maybe check that out yeah I think that's probably the best way to
answer this question is to just link you to a video yeah or best builds or something yeah I think I can find it reacting to our best PC builds ever this one right here yeah it's good video Ro L hair it's good time I lld trying to get a deal on an RTX 490 and try to eBay there's many new cards for under $800 from China I know it's likely to be a scam but how would the scam work since eBay has buyer protection that's a really good question and one I've actually been trying to figure out for a
long time cuz I've run into the same thing with like entry level cards as well we've covered those scam gpus a number of times and I get it when you're buying from somewhere that doesn't have buyer protection um and the way that those those like cheap scam cards work is they are functional gpus they're just like old say do are they just hoping that you don't know um but with something like an RTX 490 so the idea is that those those scam ones they like work well enough to work for a bit and
then you know give them time to get your money and like run away and disappear whereas with something like a like an RTX 49d I don't really yeah I don't really understand um how that would work yeah see here's one here so apparent a supposedly new 4090 I don't know maybe I should just maybe I should buy one why don't we find out how the scam works there's a video yeah all right sure I'll buy this scam 490 right now I'll I'm going to send this to procurement and uh draw my
credit card which we're not mean so that means he'll buy it on Monday please buy this okay and then yeah let's let's see what happens all right cool people are saying no core no vram but like buyer protection so like should I get should should I get my money back probably right oh hey uh Pia VPN it was down there oh there it had our vanity Banner was yeah the banner was there oh you just wanted to like say it yeah I mean they're they're our bpn sponsor what do you want okay
Daniel yeah yeah nice they paid for this show too went after dark there it is oh nice sick Pia are they Bros like dbrand no they're Bros in a completely different way yeah they really are though yeah they are just like I don't know who are you do whatever you want here's some money I guess yeah it's kind of bizarre like d Brand's very high touch whereas Pia is just like he you have a portal log in why are you talking to me promote it like however you guys think is good like I mean we're paying
you we're probably not going to watch it  yeah take notes every company it's actually like it's kind of wild yeah it's pretty cool well the new W hoodie have the thumb section my wife stole my old hoodie no I hope not yeah okay oh it's gone this time sorry it was very polarizing and we've decided to not have it this time yeah interesting yeah evening jents ordered the Precision screwdriver and the AI told me that the bits from my LTT screwdriver would work not the case can you guys fix that cuz I
trusted that LOL H you trusted what the AI apparently our AI on the store what or email must be email because we have email AI responses uh yeah they are different shank size um sorry about that uh I I'm I'm assuming that we'll take care of that uh yeah contact support yeah tell them you want a human that is an option in  yeah hey LTT random business question I recently took a position supervising 17 people and it's tough to do efficiently how many direct reports are you generally comfortable with managers
having 6 to8 Luke yeah is that per company or hey uh yeah in that regard I'm doing okay yeah but you have sub managers so technically you only have like one or two no no that's not correct some company let's just carry on that's not even true in one Department he does well I still think you should write a book on management uh my best friend owns a recycling company and has offered me free parts to make my hex OS server what do I even want to consider when I get servers at cost per
pound I would say Energy Efficiency so rather than NE because obviously this is older stuff right so you're not going to be looking at like a you know 12 core processor or whatever so if you're if you're going to have something that's basically just going to be a storage server then I would say get something with fewer cores that uses less energy um get the newest thing you can um I would look for something with pcie slots so that you can put HB in so you can add more drives in the future um what else
would you consider I mean if reliability is is really important to you maybe find an actual server that has a redundant power supply just could be loud in fact Jake and I filmed a video this week oh man we built the coolest server we took one of our old 45 Drive store inators and we converted the front to nvme left 30 hard drives in the back and then upgraded the back so that we could fill it with uh like pcie to the front Bay things and then hbas and then we put a GPU above it just for compute that you
can't even like access the rear IO of and like we put no to a fans in and we put a custom front pan oh dude it's so cool anyway the point is uh what was I talking about recycle computer stuff power efficiency oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah one of the things that we did was I don't have a redundant power supply anymore we just put in a high quality single power supply because the ver power supply was so flipping loud that's probably okay I would I would stress test the things that you're getting out
of the recycling area smart smart burn in Yeah couple more oh oh hold on uh a a robot from debrand feel like this from watching the show uh can be infinitely removed and reused for what it's worth this statement genuinely did apply specifically to the Experia Z2 due to the glass back surface of course low surface energy bond between the adhesive and the non-porous glass surface okay thank you very much for the clarification didn't care didn't really ask but uh you keep doing stickers you absolute mad 
yeah too long didn't read I'm sorry to  whatever my God hey D any more tall versions of the apparel coming soon for Luke danine sorry what are there more tall versions of the apparel coming soon I in the last merch meeting I advocated for or something that's upcoming that is not getting a tall version but I tried look it sure sure you did but minimum order quanties are hard and it's they have to grade an entire another set of sizes how many of the how much total sales went
through the tall blanks I don't know no no okay I wonder we we got our foot in the door Dan we got our foot in the door yep the new blanks I heard not immediately maybe but eventually maybe those are coming they're going to be talls which might mean that we might have more colors than just the black T-shirt yeah my understanding was that if the talls did okay then they would exp we're going to get more baby steps we're get more I saw someone ask about the the like Wan shedar sweater in tall size and I was
like no that's like that's not oh that's actually the one yeah that's the one I was talking to them about they said no I assume not that would be brutal that's a pretty complicated gar isn't it pretty rough yeah like I I I appreciate that that we're we're getting there and we're actually taking the baby steps now I understand it's weird I understand it's a little bit Niche it's nice to have some stuff that does actually like fit me though I know we're working on um so
it is it is cool I do appreciate it I Al there's also the the cargo pants we getting in 32 length if I remember correctly yeah that's exciting too yep what's a waste well different waist have very y oh okay so we're doing a whole another size and grade of the cargo  way oh cool I don't know what you're talking about that actually looks really sharp I don't know what you're talking about wow I I really like that color actually I don't know what you're talking about wow that looks genuinely very good
it's like a purpley blue this is a very early sample no no promises it looks great though I get all kinds of stuff that just like never sees the light of day so like I don't know yeah I watched uh the the flow plane exclusive with Tatiana talking about like the socks and  she was going over how you would send her different pictures and stuff I was like yeah this all this all just sounds like lus this is all completely believable I've sent her some horrible pictures oh she yeah she she said as
much yeah did she okay I didn't watch that it was it was honestly a really good video yeah I have sent her some awful awful pictures that nobody should ever have to see I look I I was like I'm all about consent yo so like I was like hey hey I did not send you pictures of what this did to my feet um because nobody needs to see that and she's like yo I for product development purposes I actually do need these pictures I'm like oh no all right brother I don't know I feel like she said not that in the video
what I okay hold on W I take exception I take exception to this I take exception since I watched it but I I thought she was like you know I don't need to see I don't need to see your blisters what's going on with Miss devage here hold on a second flagging for super soft flagging for hold on careful what you're hold on a second care what you're saying socks hold on don't think out loud I I would not send people a horrible picture unless there was a reason here we go uh hold on oh here I found the
thread one session two hours and I have a picture of like what happened to the socks they are immediately like scuffed this was a this was a sample that I rejected you can see how they fuzzed after 2 hours of playing badminton I have uglier pictures on my phone of the red spots and blisters caused by the slipperiness of the insides they slip like dress socks they need to be less slidy can show you if you really want to see but in a nutshell it hurts LOL she says this is Tatiana
thank you for letting me know although kind of disappointing from the vendor that the issue is not really improved I'm going to schedule a call with the vendor to better communicate her requirements and that this cannot persist if for to continue sampling with them very professional emails uh she was I think pretty new uh at that point Highline us after relaying the above info to the vendor they have some follow-up questions to better tackle this issue one your shoe size and your
routine movements during your 2hour session two they want photos of the whole sock or just feel free to bring them tomorrow during me merch meeting and I can take the photos to send out three also I want to know the position of the blisters and red spots on your foot to make adjustments to the design thank you for your help with this I said size eight attached footage of this Thursday session I put in my backpack photos of feet attached not for faint of heart I do not have nice feet LOL she
says thank you for the warning lol and the video I'll grab the socks from you tomorrow and send all these points out to the vendor she asked for it she asked for the position she did I'm but I'm what I'm going to get coordinates I'm going to put latitude and longitude on  South I think sending the picture at that point is reasonable but I am just saying she didn't technically for picture I'll let you guys be the judge it's hard yeah you can't do everything anyway Tatiana is great she's doing a
great job and we do have a strong candidate we do have a strong candidate for maybe an LTT sock at some point yeah heck yeah yep last one I've got for you tonight hey there D getting the Precision driver in bitset I'm really looking forward to using them at work what product that you created has the has  what product that you created has impacted your work that we  screwdriver yeah like I use it like every day float plane is that fair is that a product I don't know I mean it is
kind of oh I mean I love my I love my Northern Lights desk pad I've just like never thought about desk pads again after having the Northern Lights desk pad too like the the thickness is perfect the woven edges is like looks  uh wait did we actually do a newsletter for the first time in a while how did we miss this February and then November um oh this is cool uh yeah I'm going to say screwdriver  screwdriver dude screwdriver has been crazy screwdriver has like changed our
company like uh I think we're I think Nick was saying we are like well over a quarter million screwdrivers sold now which is like what that's pretty nuts yeah it's like genuinely pretty nuts like we're like a screwdriver company with like a media production team attached to it like it's crazy we aren't the media company is still the uh the bigger one but it's big dog yeah it's wild it's wild it's also hilarious to see people still talking about how it's a $10 you know Ali Express you know
rebadge or whatever like um on DIY parks's video he's promoting the screwdriver as part of the sponsorship and like some of the replies are just like I don't know how anyone could be gullible enough to buy that it's like I don't know how you could be gullible enough to read everything you read on the internet because you're you someone lied to you and you just have been uninformed for two years yeah enjoy that yeah um yeah are there like I so I'm trying to think like go watch reviews and then
I think like is there any actually negative reviews I don't think so I don't think so it's a good product what do you want so like yeah but some people are just like mad they're just like mad about that they don't like that yeah they just really want it to be bad yeah okay manifesting does not actually work and again it might be expensive oh yeah sure yep it is expensive for a screwdriver yep yep cool see you again next week same bad time same bad Channel  NS you have to
