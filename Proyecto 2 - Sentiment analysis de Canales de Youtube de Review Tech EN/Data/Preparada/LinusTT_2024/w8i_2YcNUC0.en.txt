welcome to the we oh sorry no I just I got confused there I I always ask how they're doing and stuff and I never I I thought I thought someone was talking about I thought I I thought I could hear them but I couldn't just like always we got a great show for you guys today this just in you can't Bing Reddit which on the surface of it is all is just nonsense words but yeah when you go a little deeper it looks pretty bad yeah search engines other than Google search are now unable to produce results from
Red it more recent than a few weeks ago we're going to talk about this in a little bit we also are going to talk about I don't know um oh LTT is AI now uh yes a bunch of our videos were used to train in AI so I guess we'll chat about that what else we got for today uh Olympics one the Olympics of Esports including League of Legends rocket League Street Fighter Tekken iRacing NBA 2K and FIFA and more maybe other stuff is happening I don't know also Olympics two we have multiple
Olympics topics apparently the Canadians spied on opponents with drones I mean that's kind of technology related right what are we doing what are we up to um what's going  that I did not inspect the topics ahead of time  the show is brought to you today by ag1 Squarespace Greenman gaming and of course our chair partner secret lab you can't bang Reddit that's right search engines other than Google search are now unable to produce results from Reddit more recent than a few weeks ago likely
because Reddit has been blocking indexing Bots from other companies Google of course has an exclusive contract with Reddit so when we had those conversations about how on Earth is Reddit going to be making money um maybe this is how apparently this is one of the ways not just licensing the Treasure Trove of data that they have to AI companies for training their models but also by apparently making any search engine other than Google n unusable I mean everyone knows the trick searching
for what it is that you need to know and then appending Reddit to it in order to find an answer because search engines are basically just sponsored results and garbage now despite maintaining a market share of nearly 92% Google apparently felt that its near Monopoly over search may be threatened by advancements by rival AI companies such as open AI who recently unveiled their search GPT prototype and apparently they entered into this agreement now our discussion question
here is what kind of of precedent does this set for the rest of the internet and the answer is a terrible one I mean I don't think this is even I don't think anyone in good faith would tell me that I'm being all slippery slope fallacy about this when I say that if Google were to say for example extend this to only allowing a YouTube video search result to be uh surfaced by their own search engine if that happened I would not be able to find any useful on any other search engine or if Microsoft were
to make an exclusive deal with uh oh I don't know uh okay various news media so that you could only get results from them by searching through the start menu on Windows I mean turning the internet into this fragmented walled off Garden is bad enough doing it with content that was user gener that you didn't even pay to create is so much worse there also I think I think as you were kind of saying this probably does start an arms race we we were struggling to think of one but flow
plane chat and I just lost who said it sorry but uh flow plane chat pointed out stack Overflow like if Bing gets GitHub and stack Overflow and Google gets Reddit and YouTube so you've got the developer search engine you've got the you know angry person in their basement search engine yep y Okay so gole Google gets YouTube Reddit and like Twitter okay sounds good then we can have like the Boomer search engine which gets like Facebook and yeah uh I don't know what else but something dude this is
terrible uh P Porto says Microsoft already owns GitHub so yes that was his point but it's not it's not restricted from Google at this time yes so if this starts an arm race they might want to restrict the search results from Google um I like I'm just I'm trying to think and like it just sucks it just sucks yeah this there is absolutely no argument that you can make for how this this is a this is a good thing and this is something that anybody should support now fortunately um f the FTC apparently has
already caught wind of this and is hold on I'm going to double check this because it might have actually been uh something else Google Reddit hold on hold on hold on hold on I'm just going to make sure uh into deals licensing its users read almost a month ago the arrangement will give hold on hold on okay I'm just going  sure given the novel nature of these Technologies we're not surprised they Reddit Road okay no this was around them licensing the uh user data for for AI
platforms so I don't think it's actually related to this particular one but thankfully Reddit licensing their user data is at least on the ftc's radar and hopefully they can uh they can continue to um keep an eye on this and make sure that this doesn't become a thing handyman says Han float plane says but money lonus but money I don't know Cory's the name says reddit's destroying itself I've been using it nearly daily for almost 15 years it's very rapidly declining it'll
be dig soon and something will replace what what will replace it I haven't seen anything gain anywhere near any kind of momentum and Luke and I have talked about this but the the incumbent momentum feels so much greater today than it was even 5 years ago yeah because of the historical knowledge that's that's the value of a site like Reddit it's not even the active user count today necessarily it's the users it's the user generated content that's been posted over the last 15 years there question an answer so
that discussion there's also been a shift in how people use the internet um users now are more or less unwilling to go to a variety of websites users will have their small subset often a very small amount like five to 10 sites that they actually go to like you might be a person who goes to Reddit imer YouTube uh twitch and Facebook I don't know but you like do not use websites outside of that uh it's it's a it's a huge thing a lot of it is user behavior and it makes it really really really
hard for alternative sites to show up because um like if you wanted to start a alternative of YouTube well people aren't going to get off of twitch and YouTube they will not get off of those websites to view yours even if you have like the best version of a certain type of content they just won't watch it yeah we talked about this a fair bit when we were discussing the challenges facing gun creators on YouTube right now like the obvious solution to people who don't know what they're talking about is well
why don't you all just go upload somewhere else their strength and numbers they've tried that multiple times but your numbers are so small yeah they're small and they're meaningless numbers and when you're dealing with stuff like video delivery on the internet the cost savings comes in massive massive volume yeah Yahoo search ask Chiefs well this is the thing though it's rested this is what opens this up very obviously to antitrust like I don't even know I don't even understand why
Google bothered to try to sign this deal because they're already dominant today they don't have uh like a nent competitor to crush right now that uh you know they could they could effectively Force out of business while any L any antitrust litigation makes its way through the system right like why why bother with this right now because of open AI search GPT is what is what this uh sure but you're not going to starve you're not going to starve out open AI I mean they have Microsoft
backing they're literally either are they behind Nvidia or ahead of Apple I I don't know where they are right now but they're one of the three most valuable companies in the world this isn't some startup that you can damage by buying protection for your Monopoly until they just go open AI is not going away anytime soon so what is the point of even doing this I do think I do think Google's in a really bad spot in general so they might be kind of grasping at straws search has never been worse uh
Drive search is functionally useless gmail search is really bad like all the search products right now are rough um dude never mind the search product Google can't search for [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] right now yeah do you remember okay this one this one can do it gmail search the search bar at the top of Gmail dude dude I was I was I was trying to find um okay there's a Trello card we use Trello for task management well some of our teams do we have some streamlining to do the point is we have
a Trello license um I was trying to find a Trello card and it used to be and this is a super convenient feature that you could just start typing in the top of chrome and if you typed in keywords that were similar to the URL of a page that you've visited in the past it would just autop populate and it would find it and you could just press press enter so what I was looking for was a card called lmg review so that's what we call my final review pass of an LT video uh once
everyone else has done like quality and fact checking passes and I'm looking to see if I catch anything um so I just wanted to go to that tab I wanted to go to that card it's one that I've visited a 100 times and I typed it in and nothing then I was like does this just not even work anymore at all and then I typed in perpetual which I think you probably know what doc I was looking for yeah so Perpetual is what we use for finding the wow document the Perpetual wow live stream document
it's one that I promise you I promise I have access at some point to another on every computer I own because um either you know I'm reviewing topics for the next week or I'm using from a weird location yeah yeah that's I I definitely have accessed it and it didn't come up and I was just like this is this is flipping unbelievable it used to be so consistent in general right now actually seem like they're genuinely getting worse not not like they're just getting older and certain other products are
improving like they actually feel like they're declining in in value and quality um and they're just shutting down things that they have like recently their their URL shortener um got gotten rid of officially I think for a long time now you haven't been able to create new shortened URLs but I think they're the old shortened URL non working yeah um so like they keep shutting things down and making what they have actively worse um dude can you can someone Google okay out
yourself is anyone from Google watching right now yeah can you explain to me please in simple English so that I a  can you explain to me why it is that when I go to docs.google.com it is so flipping hard to find a doc that someone just shared with me compared to if I go  why why is that why is it the interface  OBT guys let me know if you if you disagree Porto yeah it's so bad it's so bad but like even even the search in drive.google.com is garbage well yeah sure but that's that's a completely
separate level of like it's it's a different level of garbage the fact that someone can share me on a doc and I literally cannot find it in docs.google.com drives me in just baddy I don't know how to deal with how angry it makes me I don't want to make our company leave Google workspace because there's things about being in Google workspace that I like a lot like I really like Google Calendar for example um but drive search might be one of the things that like nail in the
coffins are are workspace license um because it's actually so bad that it's starting to to noticeably negatively impact people's ability to do their job um which is wild um yeah and and it's it's just it's stupid stuff like here check this out okay why is the interface different when I'm in docks what is this this is this that's what this is not this this is where I would go for sheets or what see see look this this is what the drive interface looks like why don't worry this is just the The WOW
account there's nothing okay just chill all right wh wh why why is this why is this set up like this I don't get it they should be the same obviously East Coast Sunrise that interface hasn't been touched in a decade well one of them has they should be the same obviously um is it a problem with the file organization or naming schemes no because I mean look the thing is that a lot of the time uh you know a cloud drive is not particularly organized because you might not be the only person
who has access to it so even if you have the best of intentions for keeping everything perfectly laid out and perfectly organized it doesn't always work out that way because people are going to be sharing you on drives sharing you on individual documents sharing you on the document then sharing you on the drive and and you don't always have control over that so making the interface intuitive is super important making it easy to find a recent document is super super important
I have this persistent problem um where whenever we do quarterly reviews internally I try to find the folder that I'm supposed to dump quarterly reviews into um but if I search quarterly review despite one of the folders in the tree being called quarterly review it will not come up I can go through every single result that comes up through the search I can skip through the do everything it will not come up despite the folder being called that in Drive you'd think it would come up it will not
so the I had to get the person who shared me on that folder to send me the direct link and then I like starred it in Google Drive so I can find it in the stars because it is genuinely unsearchable for me if I try to search for the tree that it's in then it's problem because someone else made this folder structure so they used um as an example uh I'll use something that is is slightly different but as an example they used uh a folder called infrastructure it's like how many how
many times do you think a folder named infrastructure has been shared with me a lot and then when I search for it there's like 40 of them I'm like I don't know which one is the right one so I always have to go back to this it's like man how can it not find quarterly review like the sure I'm going to have a bunch of documents called cly review but let me sort by documents and folders and I'll find it instant M but no it just doesn't work why oh man I could have found that with like
File Explorer on Windows XP this is ridiculous well you know I was actually I actually have this in the video Concepts bin right now was Windows XP as good as we remember it being no probably not I want to I want to make that video because I feel like there's these Nostalgia glasses for Windows XP Windows XP search was kind of a piece of garbage probably it was not very good could you index back then uh was that Windows no you could but it took forever which part of which was because we were all on
mechanical storage at the time but it took forever and it it was not perfect PR sure I ran indexing back in the day oh yeah yeah you run it it wasn't but I also like enjoyed doing things like that like defragging was so cool watching the little animations and stuff yeah yeah yeah I I saw something the other day that I thought would be interesting to do a video on but I was I was the reason why I haven't brought up with you or or James is because I haven't thought of a title that makes it worthy of people
clicking on it but what the heck were briefcases oh yeah I saw I this this uh this popped up for me recently as well I saw a short or somethingone like no one ever used these properly and I remember like no this was for like moving things or something yeah it was it was um it was for like your floppy disc so it would automatically sync to your floppy disc or something like that yeah it did it had some form of automatic syncing functionality yeah it was it was something like that I never once used it
and I didn't really understand what they were for I looked it up at some point and it was essentially like sink toy or something like that which is cool actually which is pretty cool but the functionality was extremely limited if I recall correctly yeah so if you had an external hard drive it kept your apparently it could also be used for like photo backup and stuff like that later autosync with Zip drive yeah okay there you go it seems cool but it's just really weird witty
Willis says it was clunky at best I hated it yeah yeah I the fact that that was one of the like first options you had for like a rightclick contextual menu was always baffling to me as uh someone who didn't work when operating systems that had that feature were were a thing I was like what could this possibly be for one thing to remember too about like the like was Windows XP bad thing when I compared the search like if we want to go for Windows 7 even that's from 2009 dude I hate how long
ago 2009 was and like the search on Windows 7 for finding files was actually fine that was fine so we don't have to go as far back as XP but we can go back to the point when I was in high school at this point I think that Microsoft Engineers are just Ming on Windows search okay so I agree but we're currently talking about Google search like I search which is actually worse yeah no no really nothing is worse than Microsoft I searched for an application I had installed and it
literally opened up a web page like I I searched did you just press enter right away I I searched word for word like I search word for word in Google Drive and it doesn't even find it at all character for character it's gone as far as I can I typed in an application I had installed and I pressed enter and it opened up a web search no no Google is not there yet I don't know dude if you press enter to fast it'll just find a completely different it'll open a new window no it just won't find it at all
well I don't know let's agree that  nice uh what are we supposed to be talking about right now Dan get the can you get this thing back on the tracks here topic two topic two okay Luke what do you want to talk about oh oh yeah oh this is where I got my wires crossed this is what the FTC is actually uh conducting an investigation into FDC won't let me be um the FDC is conducting an investigation into surveillance pricing that's an interesting name for it dude this is freaking terrible
everything why is the news always bad you know what no no next Wan show I I'm doing it right now I'm tasking the team to have all good news W show only good news W show next week only going to be enough news dud 20 minute W show let's go no no we'll have to make the news if there isn't enough news positive sentiment does not sell all good news on W show only good news W show let's go okay there it's done all right f is conducting investigation into surveillance pricing AKA individualized
surge pricing where an algorithm leverages data on a single users demographics and past Behavior to quickly change the prices offered to them and potentially offer some people far higher prices for the same product while this is know with while this is a known tactic in the gaming industry surprise surprise it's unclear to what extent this practice is being used by other Industries the commission announced that it would be ordering eight companies including MasterCard and
JP Morgan Chase that offer products and services that enable businesses to uh engage in surveillance pricing to turn over information about the impact these pricing schemes have on privacy  protection rough dude like I don't even know where to begin to talk about how not okay this is yeah like it's it's it's one thing to it's one thing okay if you're walking around a Walmart or something like that and I'm not saying Walmart is doing this in fact I think they specifically claim
they're not doing it but who knows uh but it's one thing if you're walking around in Walmart and they realize that like all of a sudden there's a run on  um I made me grin so much it hurt my face yeah that's a long story don't wor about yeah um um so there's a run on toilet paper and they they kind of go okay surge pricing and they've got uh they've got these like remotely configurable price tags and they can like configure the price it is an entirely different thing if you're
on your phone looking up diarrhea treatments and then as you are in the store and as you approach you the individual approach the the Shelf the price like ticks up before you can get there they're like oh he has this now cuz you absolutely need it they're not stocking up this is a reactive purchase let's charge more uh they're going to buy it they're not going to RIS driving somewhere else yeah like this is okay so let's let's use a more real world example okay less hypothetical okay Uber right they've got
surge pricing during times of high demand and low Supply supposedly uh where prices prices go up during Peak travel hours okay what if instead of it going up because generally speaking a lot of people are using the service what if it goes up because you get a text from someone about a personal emergency and you are talking to them and you don't have your car and Uber goes hm interesting and doubles your price now that again actually is maybe a little bit far-fetched on the other side
because they would have to be tapped into you know whatever coms you're using and they would have to be able to put all that contextual data together but I don't think that that is necessarily and a completely impossible outcome I there so there's we've probably talked about this on W show before but in Finland there's speeding tickets that are based on the offender's income which are based General by that was cool this is not cool this is not the same thing this is rough and this doesn't feel like it's
going to be designed to uh like pray on the wealthy this feels like it's going to be designed to pray on the vulnerable um like almost guaranteed so that's that's rough lion kings it guy says yeah lonus is literally talking about bereavement flight rates except instead of giving a discount they could just take advantage of you and because it's so difficult for a third party to come in and investigate this practice without a whistleblower pretty much deliver ing the algorithm or
the code to investigators because you can't observe it from the outside right every individual just gets their individual pricing and the individual um manipulation from the service it's really really hard to figure out exactly   yeah someone posted in phili chat uh that I I lost it but that we're like acting like this doesn't already happen um maybe there's a miscommunication no this is this is being investigated this absolutely does already happen y um yeah uh the um float plane chats got some
examples though TC and DC says Uber could notice that you get in your car every day from a Swanky office building that address could go up over time um that is actually a great example uh techie 93 says if they know you're getting a call from someone at a hospital um all they have to see is man that's crazy I think well okay I think that's already built into standard surge pricing stuff I understand it's not necessarily a surge but I think they already have that going like location
based pricing um I think that's existed for a long time what they're currently talking about is more individual based your your habits things like that not necessarily like yeah they could notice oh sorry sorry sorry sorry I I miscommunicated that it so they notice you getting in from a Swanky hotel pretty frequently and then they just raise your prices in general yeah I'm just saying the hospital one that that's been around for a long time uh or that type of thing has been around for a long
time but that might not even be location because I could be I guess they can see my destination but uh like they might be able to tell like okay you went to the hospital yeah and you you go to the hospital every once in a while but this time you immediately called another Uber to like a store so like you you forgot something it seems like and they're like oh okay time to charge them more this is brutal man I hate this so much like I actually I actually hate this um yeah surveillance pricing it's rough
I'm sorry guys in other good news or not uh this week yet another YouTuber was threatened by yet another company called DCs again it's a different company but still uh this time it was Stefan fiser of all off-road 4x4 Adventures who reviewed lfp batteries manufactured by Deep Cycle Systems that's the DCS while fer reviewed while Fischer's review was initially positive he later found that the batter's capacity degraded unexpectedly quickly over the course of the next few years
Fischer heard similar reports from other off-roading enthusiasts so he tested the batteries and likewise had independent testers validate their results uh validate his results sorry these tests showed severe capacity loss fiser likewise reported on DCS customers who alleged uh who alleged that dcss RMA processing uh sorry RMA process testing consisted consistently resulted in Rosy capacity estimations leading to the company to refuse to replace faulty batteries DCS is now suing fiser for
defamation okay I'm going to unword salad that a little bit yeah basically he found out some customers were having a negative experience with dcs' RMA process um where DCS would get the batteries basically go oh no yeah we estimate that these still have good capacity and then they would refuse to replace them yeah according to Lewis Rossman DCS also retroactively changed its warranty on its website to reduce coverage without changing the last updated date rough uh which reads as
June 2021 Rossman likewise says that the pages archiving um this change appear to have been removed from the Wayback machine though they were available via other archiving servic how do you remove something from the Wayback machine I think you can request it but I'm surprised this one would have been approved um in response to commenters who were concerned about the lawsuit DCS claimed via its Facebook page that it does not Sue reviewers over product reviews when Fischer's lawyers sent a
complaint to dcs' lawyers the language was slightly altered to claim that they don't suit uh over reviews that they view as   wow where where's the good news oh right that's next week right mhm cuz none of this is good news do we have any got to have something so basically um I don't know anything about Deep Cycle Systems batteries I don't know anything about the company I'd never heard of them before this this is my first exposure to them uh but what I can say for sure based on this first exposure is that
they are theys so if you were considering anything from Deep Cycle Systems then you should probably contact them let let them know you were considering their product and that you found out about this and you're not considering it anymore um wiy Willa says good news scraped Wars is amazing so far hey glad to hear that let's go bad news uh part two is not coming on the original schedule I reviewed the cut earlier this week and basically um maximum respect to the team I mean you guys you guys saw the the the
spit polish mirror shine that episode one had um absolutely fantastic they're doing a great job really good um part two not there yet um and so basically we went back to the sponsor we're going back to you guys and we're pretty much going to say hey yeah we had a great plan for when it was going to come out and that great plan is going to be later difficult thing to edit yep take some time it's a it's a ton of work and like I said absolutely no disrespect to the team that's working on it they just need
a little bit more time so we're going to take a bit more time and you guys are going to get it when you get it sounds good and uh we we are hoping that it's only going to be an extra one week since you looked at me three rhs in the air I said you're crazy sorry uh it's only going to be an extra week Point exclusive V1 probably not uh I don't think absolutely not yeah no it's not it's not there uh we no no no also don't really think there's value there we'll we'll give you the product
that that is good yeah and like you guys got you guys got your exclusives man we've had a ton of people signing up for float plane I think we've had it over a thousand since scrapyard Wars went up and they are definitely they're definitely getting some value the first extra is twice as long as the episode itself and people are flipping loving it and then there's an entire dedicated extra for uh Elijah's haircut which I haven't watched yet but I am so excited the fact that they captured his his
wife's reaction oh yeah people like that um the fact that they captured his or the fact that Elijah captured his own wife's reaction at the end of the video is amazing yeah so good uh see yeah yeah you know what I'm not going to oh wow you guys really really can't see it oh well y I'm not going to I'm not going to spoil it it's pretty good lm. g/f flat plane um oh man he said he'd do something at 3K I think he did actually but it's not there yet oh what did he say he I don't remember eyebrow slit I
think what eyebrow slit oh what I think he said he would do that why if it did 3K I think oh uh okay it's not there yet oh you okay I mean do we have anything in our in our on camera personality contracts where people have to stay  presentable like I no it's a valid question it's a valid question I don't think so yeah because otherwise I'd be  trouble yikes oh man all right um are we still on topic two no I think we're supposed to probably do merch messages or something at some point yeah why
don't we do merch messages and yeah all right I'll explain what they are the way to interact with the show is merch message man what an awkward show so far today we are you know it's funny like last week I was like in my flow why did we end it early last we before I've been meaning to ask you about this I was absolute garbage and then this week I just man I have no idea what's going on I have no idea what's going on uh no I don't know last week I was having fun and I wanted to leave him wanting more
fair enough it was yeah late that's fair um yeah merch messages so the way to interact with the show is send a merch message it'll go to producer d right I got to explain how you do it uh that's producer you know we'll get to producer Dan later first you go to LTT store.com you add something to your cart and then in the checkout you'll see a little box where you can leave a merch message it'll pop up down here or it'll oh yeah look at that let H okay well anyway um you can be anonymous or you can leave
your first name and last initial for a shout out hey there you go it'll look kind of something like that thing up there um it'll pop up like that or it'll go to producer Dan who will forward it to someone internally or reply to it himself or who will curate it for me or Luke to respond to so why don't we show them what a curated merch message looks like sure I got one here from Luke lonus is a blonde nerd you did not actually no uh okay yeah sorry uh how about a real one uh lus what are your kid what
were your kids' reaction when they saw your new hair coming oh my goodness I've been actually meaning to I saw one of them I've been there's easier ways to make your children cry lonus yeah I um I've been meaning to grab one of them from the security footage cuz it's really funny my my elder daughter M goes I like your  better okay it's basically the same thing she said when I shave the beard doesn't she ask you too like how long like how long until it goes back and yeah yeah yeah she asked me if I'm going
to dye it back and like like you know I don't know well how long do you have to keep it like that yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so she's all she was not into it she's she's only around a decade and she's already got all kinds of thoughts on her dad's style so I guess we're headed into some pretty uh uncomfortable conversations as she makes it into her teenage years and figures out just how  okay lonus what are your thoughts on Career progression from an SI that does retail exclusively I assume that's a
systems integrator so you work for a retail system integrator man it's tough because I I I don't really know I don't really know how to say this in a way that's not sort of mean but building computers is like not a super value career skill um I would say that fixing them is a way to potentially make more money but not at like a not at a at a at at a retail chain or anything like that like they're they're not going to pay you um anywhere near the rates that they're charging
customers um and what it really boils down to is that if you want to escape that sort of wage ceiling in computer technician work the only way to do it is to set out on your own and and adopt an entrepreneurial spirit and try and tackle it that way but that is not going to be easy very hard um he it's worded interestingly though uh exclusively does retail stuff or something like does this person own the SI um that I don't know I can't really tell I doubt it I I I don't see how
you'd survive as a computer store that just does nothing but put together new computers yeah yeah um Cory has the name says Sy system integrator makes putting standard components together sound way cooler than it is um nowhere near as challenging as it once was I do think that that also is a little dismissive I mean I think that a really good eyeopener would be to check out our tour of Puget systems from a number of years back they show the kinds of processes and the kinds of tools that you need to
develop in order to be a a a well-oiled machine because it's more than just putting systems together you have to support those systems you have to ensure that excuse me sorry you have to ensure that they make it to their destination in one piece you have to have processes for um compatibility testing stability testing it it you have to build relationships with vendors you have to manage your you have to manage your credit and cash flow like you're running a business right
um it's not as simple as just buying computer parts and putting them together if it was everybody would do it and that's sort of the bottom line is you have to figure out what your personal value ad is and try to extract as much of the money that you're generating as possible I some some people in FL plan chat have said this but getting into some some level of Enterprise it is probably the closest related work but it's not 100% you'll need to you'll need to train um but yeah thanks Luke
yeah yeah give us one more Dan sure announcements let's see here have you heard DCS is suing an Aussie YouTuber we just read that one I missed that sorry hey Linus I've been a longtime viewer and finally pulled the trigger on the backpack I'm currently working a sales job as a college student and wondered if you had any tips from your experience oh man I mean the biggest thing for me was that I was selling something that I was really passionate about it's not really selling it's
more talking to people about stuff that you think is super cool and and a shared interest and as long as you as long as you can find a way to do that if you can if you are a super you know Gearhead for example and you can find a way to sell cars for for a living um well okay that might be a little bit challenging especially if you're most of the people coming in to buy a car are not going to be shopping for the kind of car that I think a typical you know Gearhead would be
excited to talk about but as long as you as long as you don't mind just sort of sharing knowledge and and and talking with people about about cars or about cameras or about computers or whatever it is that you're passionate about um I'd say that's the best way to both enjoy what you're doing and succeed at what you're doing there are going to be challenges um you know we got spiffs and we got guidance from HQ on what we were supposed to be pushing and I got to tell you I never even looked at it I didn't I
didn't bother reading any of that stuff I didn't pay any attention to it whatsoever because um the way that I saw it I would just you know do my thing and i' customers would be happy and they they'd love it and they'd come back to me and that would kind of wipe out anything else and in reality that was probably pretty naive of me um what's more likely is that NCI just wasn't organized enough to keep track of which sales reps were pushing what they're supposed to be pushing and so they just never really
noticed that I was only selling the stuff that I really wanted to sell um apparently Gearhead means something else other places okay it it would just mean like car Enthusiast um here so so I don't know what else mean like steroids I have no idea call steroids gear yeah Ethan Bez says yeah SUVs everyone's buying SUVs yay so exciting yeah exactly like I remember the outrage when uh when Porsche stopped just doing uh you know sports cars and all of a sudden they've got like the ma and the Cayenne I think
Cayenne excuse me and I think those are their some of their top selling models nouns like uh uh are they even an Enthusiast brand anymore totally totally get it but I don't know you got to find the fun in in like educating people I I remember taking my my aunt and uncle shopping and one of the things that I was really hammering on was that I wanted them to get a plug-in hybrid they do so much of their driving just like padding around in the city they Park in a garage and they wanted an SUV
sorry sorry they wanted an SUV but they wanted um but they wanted something a little bit smaller than the Grand Cherokee they had before and I was like look you guys you know I know you don't have a ton of experience with them I actually even forget exactly which which one they got I think it was uh it's that mitsu bishy uh pH SUV what's what's it called again yeah the Outlander P Outlander phv um so I took them to look at it and I was like look you'll be able to do so many of
your trips on battery just remember to plug this thing in when you go into your garage and like no one at any of the dealerships they' been to before I went with them had educated them on the advantage of this like people just didn't understand plugin hybrid is such a such a wasted thing no one ever talks about it well I still have to explain to people today that there's a difference between hybrid and plug-in hybrid yeah this the name is really stupid it's bad I don't have a better name to be honest
with you like I understand why the name is what it is because depending on the design a lot of them bear more similarity to a hybrid than they do to an electric vehicle yeah but having it called something so similar I think is extremely confusing to people Wei U yeah it's amazing what a difference branding can make to people's understanding of it when they and I think I think this is something that we we ended up doing one more video about branding nonsense um even though I'm I
didn't want to do any more like mad videos but it was one that we had started work on a long time ago um and it's uh it's looking at nvidia's most recent transgressions so I'd say the the 3056 gig is the most recent one in fact I think that's the last card they launched so we look at the 3056 gig and we kind of go okay now hold on a second this is clearly a completely different card um so while the community got their way with the with the 4080 12 gig um where they kind of went hey this is
not a 480 this is a completely different GPU aside from having less memory Nvidia took all of that feedback threw it in a fire and immediately kept doing it and then we go back through their history and we look at some other examples of of nvidia's very deceptive branding and I actually tell a personal story in the video about one time Nvidia Bamboozled me before I was knowledgeable enough to understand how to how to research this stuff and how to learn the differences between things so in response to your
question find a way to get excited about educating people about something that you're knowledgeable about and that's probably the best way to both have fun at work and succeed in your job I used to kill it at Best Buy uh yeah I bet and yeah like you were saying you would get pushed things like oh oh sell a bunch of this sell a bunch of that I always ignored it but I used to go on trip like when my mom would have to go buy something with Best Buy I would ask to go with her just so I could walk around
the store so like working there I was all excited cuz I could around be around computers and stuff we grew up mostly in the country there wasn't a lot of this availability around so a Best Buy existing within reasonable driving distance was like cool to have at all and then the fact that I worked there I was like yeah this is awesome um so it was was really easy to sell stuff cuz people would come in and ask one a laptop then I would just have a conversation with them about what they
needed and like why I thought different solutions would be good or bad for them give them a range of options they pick one of them and then we go for it and my customers are often really happy and it was usually pretty easy like I wasn't really actually trying to push the sales but I'd have conversations with them about what software do you need and pretty often it was like oh I do work stuff so I need like word it's like oh well Bonk here's word get that spiff they want it anyway get that spiff but
they literally they wanted it anyways y they would have left the store less less equipped so like I I don't I don't think I ever sold a single service plan thing except for when the customer asked for it I would never push that ever cuz I didn't believe in it like at all I never bought one ever myself so like well I bought one technically but then abused it but anyways that's St St Wes 13 says with a plug-in hybrid aren't you taking on the issues of a gas vehicle and the issues of an EV in one package but
aren't you taking on theit advantages of a gas vehicle and of an EV in one package yes you are you're also going to have more problems with the ice drivetrain and if you're often driving within distance of your electric which he was talking about in this specific scenario um then you're not running your your ice drive train as much and never running your ice drive train is bad yes but as long as you're running it regularly should be fine uh Mavs guy says and the iishi pH is arguably the
worst of the bunch fair enough but this was a few years ago um yeah like I don't think rap 4 Prime was even out yet so it was it was a while back it was a while back my hybrid can't have a spare tire which sucks it probably can you just lose lot of trunk space I mean anything can have a spare tire if you're creative enough yeah you put it in your passenger seat trap it in Luke car tips everyone there's technically a solution to practically everything you just might  it all
right Dan what are we supposed to be doing right now do you guys do announcements now do you do them later no it can penetrate the batteries in the in the case of a collision okay see there's still there's still Solutions just strap it to the outside like they do on Jeeps strap the batteries to the  I'm gonna put a spare tire on the back of my car when we leave here immediately nice y back of the tyan good yeah good you can put it like on the trunk like they do with those like off-road
Porsches yep yeah I oh that would be sick yeah my my car like a thing my car will no longer be a Tiant it will be a tyan it will have new capabilities that's what I that's what I always joke with my kids whenever it's like in the shop or disabled for some reason or another right now yeah I always I'll tell them it's the Ty can't okay In fairness In fairness it hasn't actually needed to be in the shop for a while but I also did get this extremely terrifying warning when I was a few
blocks from home the other day um that has not popped up again so I have not taken it into the shop um I haven't even googled this yet cuz I forgot about it until now um here want to want to read this for us chassis error continue driving possible with adjustment see owners manual what does that even mean what is a chassis error uh and then there's another one uh okay second work uh second uh message chassis error visit Workshop oh wait is this the same one visit Workshop oh yeah
no visit Workshop continue driving possible with adjustment I yeah so maybe that's fine maybe it's not good I've got an SOS warning right now SOS Telly Aid disabled drive to Workshop what is SOS Telly Aid I have I have a giant button in a center console that just I've never pushed scared it's a giant red button under like a flip up hatch yeah it would be one of those like OnStar things or whatever basically yeah yeah perfect good job Dan uh all right should we jump into oh should we jump into

building a better PC and having a safe place to build it so that's why we created the modmat in coll collaboration with Mod right the creators of the original and patented modmat for just $59.99 uh we're this is the oh we've got the latest version of the graphics here now uh no this is not the latest version uh the radiator guide has been updated a little bit to look a little bit more like a radiator there there's a few other little tweaks um this is a fairly upto-date version super excited about it
though so don't forget to sign up for that as well all right what do you want to talk about what are we supposed to do Dan you just tell us what to do we'll do it sure more topics we're going to do it more topics okay uh oh uh LTT is AI now sure more great news according to a leaked spreadsheet released by 404 media AI video generator Runway was likely trained on a a large amount of popular content such as YouTube channels including LTT Pixar and AMC Theaters and multiple Disney run channels the
document appears to be a curated list of recommended media for scraping comp for scraping compiled by several Runway employees yikes uh the company appears to have been looking for certain kinds of content and video Work LT was linked to the keyphrase using a laptop that makes sense I guess while there was also a spreadsheet labeled cinematic masterpieces that included uh individual channels and videos with particularly high production values including student films it's unclear if the company
actually scraped pirated content but the links to piracy sites are included in the document I've this has been a thing for a long time in in early model training stuff to be clear uh 404 media found that while the Runway video generator wouldn't create exact Recreations of real people It produced results that were very reminiscent of some YouTube personalities video Styles when their name was uh imputed included either way uh shortly after 404 asked runway for a comment their video generator stopped
producing these results convenient uh a former employee claims employee claims that Runway used open source software with a proxy configuration to avoid being blocked by YouTube while they scraped the videos uh this is standard practice for scraping to be clear why would you know that I would why do you know that Luke can you explain why you know that please Luke uh when reached for a comment a representative from Google reiterated its stance that a company train it AI on YouTube videos
without permission would violate YouTube's to I know that this is going to be a controversial take but yeah as in you're not surprised yeah I'm not surprised me neither this is this has been genuinely happening since like the beginning of this AI scraping stuff I'm pretty sure we talked on the W show about how much pirated content was being used to train models like a year ago um people are saying Luke why I I didn't do it for this reason relax um yeah I heard something I can't find
it right now I heard something about cloudflare doing something some some anti-scraping thing but um Cloud flare bot management is designed to block content scraping attacks yeah so I think they're working on that um which is cool it's always an arms race I just I I'm I know that there are creators out there who are very upset about this um and maybe part of it is that I've just come to terms with it over a longer period of time like I'm not surprised by it it's still not good uh it's still you
know illegal but the reality of it is that it was never going to be any way other than this once you upload something to the internet the expectation that if it appears on someone else's screen they can have it yes yeah it's it's like it's like sending it's like sending nudes via snap and then being like Oh Auto delete but I thought it was going to disappear but but you're not allowed to do that with it you're not allowed to keep that say it again if it appears on someone else's screen they can have it
it's just how it works it you'll never stop it because you know maybe they'll lose some of the quality but they could just point a video camera at their screen yeah like it it doesn't doesn't matter they they'll lose some quality but they'll still do it they used to have uh move early movie rips at one point in time where just people holding video cameras in theaters yeah and people would download those the video quality got to the point where it was pretty good it was the audio that was the issue yeah
yeah once the once the cameras were like on a tripod you know it was it was fine but a lot of the time like it'd be on a campc yeah and so uh the the the worst ones the worst ones not saying that they still do it not that I know anything about this uh but the worst ones I would imagine uh were the ones where they had especially like a stereo microphone on the camera like you know how some camcorders would have stereo microphones and there' be someone yeah there'd be someone like off to the right that was
like eating popcorn the whole time whatever uh did we say the the price of the screw I don't remember what it is that's why I haven't acknowledged it I don't know funny yeah I don't know someone will um so yeah I I don't know I I think you can be annoyed about it but I think letting it like consume you is not the right way to go companies are going to work on anti-scraping stuff and like realistically okay I I upload this content to YouTube or I upload my post to Reddit or whatever it's like okay so
some VC funded [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is benefiting from this and it's not the VC funded [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that I intended yeah and and and and you know it's not that simple want my VC funded [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to have all of it yeah like which no like which billionaire are we rooting for I just unless it's a fight to the death I'm afraid I just can't get that invested yeah yeah and and you know what it's that's not that's not it's not that simple right like obviously Google at least split some of the revenue back
to the creators and and that is really different than like what were these guys what were these guys valued at these Runway guys who I I never used their service I might have heard of them once before but it was like billions of dollars or something yeah yeah billions of dollars they generate like zero Revenue as far as I can tell I'm sure they' generate some Revenue oh okay they were trying to raise $450 million at about a $4 billion valuation that doesn't technically mean they're worth
that much yeah there you go so it's like these guys are you know worth whatever but they're not they're not sharing any of that money it's not even it's not even real money it's all just like paper VC money right so I'm just looking at it going yeah and um none none of this surprises me and I just don't think anything is going to change that much um Michael mcen chzn in float plane chat says the cam version of Avengers endgame was actually awesome because it had all the audience reaction to cool
stuff like Steve picking up Thor's hammer and stuff that's pretty funny that's actually really kind of neat that's that's pretty cool it's like theater experience it's like having it's like watching with friends but you don't need anys friends was very convenient for you yeah honestly though dude I haven't watched a movie in the theater room since I got back from my last trip oh in the theater room yeah so it's been like weeks oh wow that's actually surprising yeah I I I wish I found more
time to use it with that said it's summer and without even thinking about it our family has kind of a seasonality to our activities I I was kind of feel toward the end of the winter I was kind of feeling like man we just default to playing video games and like watching movies all the time we should get out more we should get out more and then summer came out and I'm like why do I even have a theater room we never use the bloody thing so it's probably fine probably fine yeah I I genuinely I'm
sure there's something that I did in between then but the last time I really remember going to the theater was the last time you and I went to a Star Wars  dude that was that was a minute ago I just stopped caring no that's not true it was also with you though and I'm 99% sure this was actually the last time no we went to go watch Barbie oh yeah Barbie was sick though yeah yeah okay before that was probably Kingsman prob Star Wars I haven't been that into Kingsman 3 sucked movies in a while I
used to go to movie theater pretty often in like the low 20s well you and everyone theater industry struggling hard yeah super hard a lot of stuff releasing I'm just not that interested L Music 996 in float plane chat goes I used to cam LTT content just because I missed the 2000s okay dude what the is going on I already knew about the trend where Zoomers are buying like retro digital cameras right like you know how Millennials got into film cameras cuz they were retro and like Polaroids bad digital cameras
are buying like crappy digital cameras hope no no no this gets so much worse this gets so much worse okay they're buying like crappy digital cameras for the aesthetic mhm i h the the idea of spending money on this it gives me physical pain um we did colins's AMD ultimate Tech upgrade and we didn't even make it to the computer before I just about had my eyes roll out of my sockets by one of his purchases okay he bought a little video input box that has a little screen on it
has a little battery on it and a Micro SD slot that plugs into the output the  camcorder see I broke his brain people are going they're acquiring like old tape camcorders and then they're they are getting these micro SD recording boxes so that they can get that like that like behind the scenes early 2000s skate video I was going to say aesthetic I hope they bring back fish Islands skate videos cuz those were sick I was looking through the like peephole on my door the other day and I I got nostalgic
for old fish Islands skate videos I like yeah all right anyway things were cool oh man oh man tape cam quarters are brat says east of East you know I embrace it do what you want yeah do what you want but get some get some yeah somebody mentioned super eights get some super eights why not why you got to spend poor amd's money on that how much was it like how much are these old camers going for I have no idea I can't imagine there's actually honestly even that many that are like in good condition
still like getting a good quality one in good condition is probably pretty hard I swear I swear every single time I try to open up Facebook it asked me to log in again it used to be one of the least annoying Services probably you shouldn't be logged in that computer is that because people keep logging me out I actually don't know I Blame You people good good job whoever when in doubt blame you people yep uh enter ZIP code what do you mean ZIP code you must know approximately speaking of
blaming people I'm going to give Dan some credit here one of the first things I tked no one of the first things I tasked Dan with when uh we started working together was to fix a Wan show I haven't even thought about it yeah that's that's the goal yeah in like a super long time yeah isn't that nice I don't I don't freak out the entire show anymore yeah I I just I I realized like I don't even remember when but I was like remember when that was like a problem yeah it used to be really
stressful sucked I refinished the table today oh yeah sort of I did my best attempts were made you should have seen it before yeah did you see the picture yeah yeah the the dye bottle or the bleach bottle like foamed and overflowed and wrecked the finish on the table I bet you guys didn't even notice though especially cuz my water bottle's there to sanded it stained it and oiled the table oh it needs filling probably would have said don't bother doing that it was really obvious like extreme yeah but I
would have just done this yeah that's cheating no it's fine okay well anyway here's uh here's what cam quarters are worth oh my goodness okay yeah I was talking to wait that's actually a super eight isn't it yeah whoa I was joking oh yeah no these are like  work Beast I was talking to Mark and uh he's convinced me that I think we should go in for the purchase of a CRT camera um you know that old media if you've ever seen Acura or something like that where the bikes are going past the
screen and their lights have giant Trails behind them yeah that's a real camera that can do that and it's a CRT tube camera mhm which is kind of insane I think those should be everybody for nothing no not for not for you oh just for personal use oh yeah yeah yeah okay well you guys enjoy that I just well then do whatever you'd like yeah you can do whatever you like um I am I no it's the children who  wrong I honestly no it's the children who are wrong you know what's messing me up CDs
are invoke right what is up with that cassettes vinyl f CDs no it's good it's it's just a light it's just it's just an MP3 with extra steps it's great it's Spotify but you have to store it somewhere no that's good unbelievable unbelievable that CDs are trendy imagine we came back to Cons with cartridges I can't that' be so sick dude the switch still exists I'm not even dead yet yeah I haven't used it in a long time oh laser disc let's bring back laser disc laser disc I bought a a friend laser
disc for for his birthday actually nice  right be like CDs actually sound so much better than streaming I mean yeah if you don't you could but you can stream fls like you can stream high quality files you don't have to stream the lowest quality thing and realistically you're probably listening to it on your airpods anyway so I don't know okay okay if you're if you're talking about the better quality of you know CD recordings then yeah you're probably not but still all right what are we what are what else 
uh we could talk about the Canadians getting caught spying with drones yeah what's going on yeah so a coach for the Canadian women soccer team has been suspended following an accusation from the New Zealand team that the Canadian side used drones to spy on two of their practice sessions notably the Canadian women's team is the defending gold medalist and ranked eighth in the world while the New Zealand team is ranked 28th it's like really media reports have surfaced also that the team might have
used similar tactics at previous tournaments including the last Olympics which has the potential to affect their past title now Canada soccer head Kevin blue says that the Canadian men's team also attempted to use a drone to gather information during their recent Copa America tournament in the US their coach Jessie Marsh has denounced the practice as has John Herdman who coached the women's team from 2011 to 2 18 and the men's team from 2018 to 2023 uh Christine Sinclair
who was the team captain in 2020 denies that players had knowledge of this spying the Optics are terrible yeah for this and the evidence is probably not on the drones though is is got it the evidence is nonzero um and I think that this this raises a ton of questions about fairness in sport and how technology should because they got caught which means there's others doing it almost certainly which means there's others doing how long they've been doing it and one of the people that was
interviewed about this and talking about like how uncomfortable it made them that they were being asked to record this but you know feared retribution and didn't want to speak out or whatever was talking about how yeah they don't always use a drone like if they know where the team's going to be practicing they can just like get a hotel room yeah there's so just because there wasn't a drone flying over your practice doesn't mean that a competitor wasn't watching it considering it said that the coach had
denounced the practice like the way that's worded this sounds like it's like a huge deal um that's a different coach so head coach but but saying that what I'm saying is the way that that's worded it sounds like this is more of a global thing I'm sure other teams are probably also doing it as I don't know and I don't want to deflect the ones who that's fair enough we're the Canadians that's fair enough yeah simp that cont um and I don't know man so they beat New Zealand in their match
already are we just going to are we just going to yeah what do we do yeah what what do we what do we do with this and it's not like 100% confirmed dude dude dude dude French authorities got the Drone oh they they caught they caught a Canadian soccer uh like I think they were an associate coach or something I forget exactly who it was but they caught someone affiliated with Canadian soccer retrieving the Drone and found footage of not just that practice but another one so it was not like oh yeah I
don't know maybe I'll like do this one time no this was an effort that was made not cool yeah I mean if you get caught cheating you should get you should get tons of crap for it yeah the coaches coaches were sent home man rough for the team will we ever have an Olympics that isn't just full of Scandal no man you see the anything with that level of competition you see the dressage uh athlete I don't know I've never really understood that as a sport the way that some other sports are yeah it's like
competitive making a horse contort its body into weird positions while you ride around on it in yeah no yeah I have not uh speaking of the W show doing really good apparently it's down so we'll get that sorted out when Dan's gone pretty soon yeah that figures um anyway why don't we jump into our next  here which is oh how's the LT screwdriver holding up the first college sports game in 11 years I'm actually kind of happy about this one after launching last Friday EA's college football 25 is already looking
to be one of the biggest games of the year having sold over 2.2 million pre-order copies this is the first game in the series in over a decade after the last game NCAA Football 15 was cancelled during development a major factor in the Hiatus was a high-profile lawsuit by former NCAA players that the series had used thousands of student athletes likeness without payment or permission all of which is really bad but uh we'll get to that soon so the National Collegiate Athletics
Association had strict requirements preventing student athletes from making money from sponsorships or leasing their likenesses which is terrible because it wanted them to be seen as amateurs uh which would Shield universities from needing to pay them or compensate them in case of injury also terrible EA wanted an exception to these rules but when the NCAA refused the game company proceeded to use the likenesses with the names of the athletes removed the suit was settled with EA paying 40 million
and the NCAA paying 20 million in Damages so basically it was a competition of who can find the best gaps in the rules to exploit student athletes and keep as much of the reward for themselves as possible this is pretty normal but in in May of this year the NCAA reached a legal settlement that allows student athletes to be paid freaking finally it's very good paid for their work EA jumped into action and "contacted around 11,000 student athletes" "over 10,000 of which have agreed to have"
their likeness in the new game over the course of three months the company used cuttingedge AI projection software to create 3D avatars of each of those players who will be compensated though okay so someone's getting paid even if it's not the artists mhm and have the opportunity to make more money by promoting the game EA has also promised to prevent users from adding players who didn't agree to be included which as someone who's generally Pro modding though I am mixed
on uh I'm not mixed on it if you can add in other madeup players sure okay sure yeah okay they said specifically AI players that didn't agree to be included I know but if as a modder I can add in a madeup player then I can add in a madeup player who is a real player sure right okay so I'm I'm just saying if EA specifically puts in counter measures against adding you know my own modded players no I'm generally not that chill with that I agree but it the way it's worded it sounds like they're they're
probably making so you can't like name players after people name custom players after people that don't want to be included stuff like that I actually I kind of like that approach I like that that's how I read this I'm I'm not sure if that's what's going to happen create any likeness you want and import it into the game but you can't just make them that player yeah um so our discussion question isn't this ideally how these kinds of R disputes should work I mean it shouldn't take 10
years this problem shouldn't have existed in the first place uh the way that student athletes are exploited is deplorable it's disgusting um but hey I'm not going to and and yeah everyone who participated in this basically sucks however however I'm not going to knock progress and this feels like progress to me I'm happy to see it yeah yeah rivan says no to Apple carplay based really no I don't care I just knew you'd react that way dude no I strongly disagree I hate it um their CEO says
that rivan will not be adding carplay to their vehicles as rationale they explained that carplay reflects Apple's ethos of a controlled ecosystem and wouldn't be consistent with the rest of the infotainment system in particular it would require drivers to exit out of the app before they could access other important features like opening the vehicle's front trunk rivan will however be integrating many features offered by carplay into its own system our discussion question here is why doesn't 
button that is the real question here is why I need to use the screen to do that in the first place big agree no my screen in my car should absolutely allow me to use Android auto or carplay or and don't quote me on this but I remember having a conversation with someone where they basically were like yeah I don't think anything would really prevent you from doing a pip like like running carplay or Android auto in a window and maintaining some interface around it not having Android auto or carplay is not
anything that anyone says it's because they want to have the data instead of giving it to Google orle certainly and fair enough just understand that I will never buy your car because I am not interested especially seeing what just happened with Fisker I am and like rivian is by no means immune to the same fate as Fisker they seem to be doing a lot better they seem to actually they seem like they're going to make it so I'm not saying I'm not saying rivan you know going bad or
anything like that I'm just saying they are absolutely not immune to disappearing at some point in the next 2 years 5 years 10 years 20 years doesn't matter I want my infotainment system to be just plug in and run whatever updated device that I'm running at that time I do not want to be locked into and beholden to your software updates not cool and I will just never buy a rivan ever and uh good for you I guess has a a poll on that website called X um would you consider buying a
car that does not have Android auto or apple carplay uh and almost 60% of people said "no with almost 200,000" votes so there you go you have just locked yourself out of 57.6% of the market good job if I was an investor in rivan and obviously this is an imperfect pull and you know sampling and blah blah blah blah blah but I would say if there was a demo that overlapped more perfectly with rivan's potential customer base than marquez's show me one show it to me yeah really right like these are these are
these are Tech interested people EV interested people I I assume they have a lot of interest that align with Mr Marquez brownley himself um I'm sorry I I just don't really I just don't really buy it uh Dan did you make that poll yes it's too softly worded what's our poll uh car with Android auto or apple carplay yes it should have it or no I'm okay without it okay I don't even see the results but that's fine it's it's even more strong yes it should have it as like 75% but um it's not like I
refuse to buy a car without it and the thing is that I'm not even I'm not even saying that I'm not even saying that I want to have to use it there are things that I prefer like buy a long shot about Tesla's interface the fact that my nanny stupid Android auto won't let me input text while I'm moving drives me absolutely bananas in a lot of cases it is far more distracting to try to vocalize and address for example versus just typing like two numbers in and then having it autocomplete for me and and
going um Tesla so just vastly Superior in that way what just don't worry about I'm asking  Luke should rivan have Firefox on their infotainment system really mean 77% of people so far saying yes this is what FIP plane is here for yeah yeah all right every you every user on FIP plane uses Firefox 78% now and you as well yeah yeah it's official I do I do use Firefox now for person new news Intel has a plan do they they say again they have discovered the cause of the widespread instability issues affecting
their high-end 13th and 14th gen CPUs or I should say especially high-end an issue with the micr code algorithm that caused the CPU to request elevated operating voltage beyond safe levels the company says they will deliver a patch addressing the problem in August uh this will not repair processors that are already crashing due to pass damage but it should prevent further damage on processors that are not Intel has pledged to replace CPUs for all affected users it is not yet clear whether some
CPUs have suffered invisible damage that may cause them to fail prematurely in the future Beyond Intel there's more bad news in CPU land AMD has delayed the launch of their ryzen 9000 Series CPUs from the end of July to mid- August after they found some kind of flaw in the first batch of chips during final checks although I say bad news because it's like bad news for amd's bottom line but it's actually good news the fact that these didn't make it to customers means that the reputational damage is
just oh yeah AMD you know bunged up there delayed their launch compared to AMD shipped broken products to their customers yeah so I'm I'm I'm I'm pretty I'm excited to see how ryzen 99000 shakes up we haven't tested it yet obviously because nobody has working chips then nobody can test it uh but based on amd's claims looks like it's going to be pretty good and being able to just put it in as a drop in replacement for ryzen 7 000 pretty exciting I don't have an x3d chip so I'm  it yeah thanks Luke good
contribution yeah do you want do you want to do you want to tell the uh the story about why you're talking less today I can yeah all right so once upon a time lonus never let Luke talk on W show and whenever Luke tried lonus immediately started talking again anyway and basically what's the point of even Luke being here none of us are sure sorry but I've just been here the whole time so just no one really wants to change it um yeah it's like that picture it's it's like that magnet on the fridge
like no one even remembers who put it there anymore it has no significance at all but everyone will put it back because it's like just supposed to be there it falls down you always you always put it back there yeah um yeah no I I had dental work done recently and um it it didn't like heal fully properly so Dental damn my I shouldn't be making him smile it's actually really mean he's in a lot of pain I'm sorry Luke so my my gums and my jaw were like inflamed not infected just
inflamed and swollen um but as I've talked about on W show before I have weird what ustation tubes or whatever they're called um the the swelling of that caused my ear to kind of crush a little bit I guess I don't know and then I went swimming after last W show this is the theory this is the theory that the doctor has not not me but it makes a lot of sense um I went swimming and and maybe some of the pool water had a hard time getting out so then I developed an ear infection because of that I went to
my dentist because I thought that made sense cuz I had this pain in my jaw and I was like maybe that's causing the pain in the ear and the dentist was like yeah that's probably what's happening so just like here's a here's a little manual squishy water thing and like clean your teeth out after you eat stuff and just keep the area really clear for a while and it'll it'll heal up so I thought all the pain I was feeling in my ear this whole time was because of the tooth stuff so I've had an untreated ear
infection for a week and just been in pain constantly the entire week um and I finally I went to the doctor today to get like a second opinion and he was like oh yeah nice your ear is uh not doing great so now I'm on antibiotics and some other stuff is going on I have eardrops and all this kind of stuff but that started today so uh the pain kind of comes in waves so right now we're we're a little we started the show low right now it's kind of high and I suspect it'll go back down
pretty soon and that's just how it's been going this whole time um so yeah that's where I'm at I was supposed to fly to Wisconsin tomorrow I am no longer doing that oh yeah yeah that's not happening CU it's already a problem for me like even even when I don't have an ear infection my my ears popping coming up and down is like already an issue right um so like now it's like the yeah the doctor was like yeah no you might rupture your eardrum you're not flying I was like okay well it's a good thing you
checked yes cuz that's pretty scary yeah and like last I checked when you're like "you know at 40,000 ft or whatever it is" immediate Medical Care not really not awesome not really an option yeah um  I can't I I don't think I can say on the show what I was going to go do there because it would be a spoiler for somebody else but it was going to be cool and I'm sad it's not happening now that's a bummer it's all right I'm just collapsing topics we've already done yeah yeah it's like pretty
much everything we have the screwdriver thing and we have the companies using co-pilot I want to do the co-pilot one all right corporate early adopters of Microsoft's co-pilot AI assistant say they're still struggling to integrate into their workflow one widespread issue is that it needs to be fed lots of data in order to work effectively but if the wrong information is included that can make it a target for hacking it can also wind up being a back door for employees to spy on their co-workers or projects
elsewhere in the company unless its users are willing to extensively rework backend labeling and permissions for this information yikes that makes never thought about that actually yeah like if we dumped the contents of our server into a large language model it would be a disaster you'd be able to ask it about things for sure yeah why not of course co-pilot apparently does well when summarizing and Distilling information but struggles to understand the context of certain requests it can handle commands that
only involve one app but struggles when dealing with multiple apps though these companies report better results when employees are specifically trained how to use cop I thought that was the whole idea behind AI assistance behind digital assistance in the first place was that it was supposed to be natural interaction I've resisted roll outs um in the company that don't involve people that are going to spend a decently significant amount of time learning how to use it properly because of this type
of stuff there's a I thought this was going to talk about a previous report that came out of Microsoft that's actually super interesting they released like a a some form of like research document on early adoption um to to co-pilot in businesses and they talked very transparently actually about how it was in a lot of cases bad they're like yeah people's output is higher but their quality of output is lower and their total errors is higher because they're just submitting
AI work and not properly checking it and the whole thing with AI work is you need to read through it because it looks convincing but it can just pull information out of nowhere that literally doesn't exist and make stuff up um so it it can be a problem so you want to be careful using it in different uh different Realms and you know what else you should use our sponsor what do you have for breakfast this morning if you answered Bagel Bites and chocolate milk I have some bad news for you that's

Linux okay uh Luke what is your take on so many bugs making it into production products lately the crowd strike outage secure boot exploits it seems like nobody wants to validate before deployment anymore are we supposed to be after dark right now Dan no oh we're still in the middle of the show uh when you're promoting moving as fast as possible more things are going to break um I don't know there there's been bugs shipped in code for all eternity and there will be more moving forward I
think people's expectations of levels of Polish have practically always gone up um the the crowd strike thing I mean if you look into I don't know do I want to go down this if you look into the history of the the CEO he was uh the head of another antivirus company when there was another massive Global crazy issue um so maybe there's some attachment there um I I'm not sitting here trying to project that this person writes all the code and pushes all the code and makes those
types of decisions but it could be a situation where they're pushing for Speed maybe a little bit too much and those types of issues are able to slip through I'm not sure but those types of envi environments can cater to that type of problem um companies used to QA before releasing software and games yeah they still do um I don't think it's fair to say that they they don't anymore and I don't think it's fair to say that they actually really did in the past there's lots of
cartridge games that released that were literally impossible to complete I'm so far ahead of you I'm so ready what Final Fantasy 6 has a very famous bug uh the evade stat on the SNES version does absolutely nothing yeah it just it just your evade stat can be higher it can be lower it doesn't work it doesn't do anything how something like that would have made it into a finished game yeah it's wild it's is mindboggling until you consider that software is buggy and people are human and bugs exist and
there was no way to patch it once they started shipping cartridges that's it see you later I do think patching things these days is more convenient so people have put less intention and less value into pre-testing I wasn't done oh okay because we all need an update on whether you're ever going to finish playing that Bloody game yes I am uh I actually have a very convenient excuse this weekend uh cuz I was supposed to be out of the country and now I won't be so maybe I'll play it
now oh you mean an excuse to play it as opposed to an excuse to not play it no I'm going to ask you next week and you're going to be like yeah I was going to play it on the plane but then I didn't take the plane see I'm also way ahead of your excuses L you want you want to know  funny the controller is packed in my bag for the plane cuz I was going to play on the plane you want to know something really funny yeah I shot a video with David this week he's liquid a ton of his
retro collection which you guys will actually get a shot at uh so I worked I worked this up with David where it's it's not like it's not like a business negotiation there was no handshake but um he was he's uh liquidating a lot of his retro collection because he's moving into um a new place and I was like oh well maybe we could do like a tech Hoarders episode but you know I always I always believe that deals should be win-win and so I was like okay normally it would be a little
bit weird Optics wise to like use the platform of the company to promote a personal sale but if the company's getting a video out of it and also like we're going to do a follow-up video on his like Retro Gaming cave at his new place that has a lot less memorabilia but has like upgraded gear that was funded by selling the memorabilia but then it's almost like an ultimate Tech upgrade but entirely self-funded but then the company could maybe contribute like some resources
like laser time and machine time to make some cool decor and like so figuring out how to have a how to create some synergies here so anyway I was shooting this video with David and uh he was he was he came to me partially in addition to all that because he needed some help and the help he needed was the kick in the butt that he needed to get rid of a lot more of it than he otherwise would have um where was I going with this I completely forget where we where we started here talking about Final Fantasy
6 right so so there were a couple of things so one I made him get rid of so much more than he planned he I've seen David stressed we've worked together a very long time man he's got he had his 5 years might be did he start pre-co he's got to be darn close did he start pre-co I I think so then yeah dude anyway he's he's got to be around there somewhere the point is David and I not only worked together for a long time now but we've worked together a lot I tend to work with the camera team more than anybody
else because that's what I spend most of my time doing is shooting um so where was I going with this right I've seen him stressed dude you will you have never seen tension like this in an ldt video where I was like he brought me in to like push him to dehorty his situation but he collected all this stuff because he like wants it and he had already sorted it before I got there and like was open to me pushing him harder but was not enjoying it um but one of the things that I did to to kind of help
ease it is I was like okay I told myself before I came here that I wasn't going to buy a bunch of this stuff because I I I love the stuff too and I was like no no no no no I'm not doing this no matter how convenient it is that he already has like pre-modded consoles and like all kinds of thing that I would love to collect um but what I told him is that if I buy anything I will buy it for um I think it was it was either it was either 2x or 3x like sticker so there were two things I
bought I bought a copy of Final Fantasy Tactics for the PlayStation one that's cool which I should have done ages ago I have played through that game partway at least half a dozen times and I've played through it all the way twice yeah not not only is that a cool game that he'll almost certainly play but it's also cool because you've talked about it like forever and I have never bought that game yeah and that is even by my own sort of you know piracy ethics code not okay uh I needed to buy a copy
of that game at some point by the time I played it it had been out of print anyway like there was no there was no time at which uh squar soft I don't think they were Square Enix yet would have gotten any money from me for it and me buying this used copy doesn't give them any money in any way um but at least I own a physical copy of the game I have definitely owned it now um so I bought that and I bought a SNES controller and I told him it's because I'm sure Luke is never giving me mine
back I will sure well in case you don't  now that was a really long story really boring by apologies I think we got Precision screwdriver cost oh do we Okay what is it I'm surprised I want I want you to read it to make sure that it's right well where do I read it uh it's under the how is the LTT screwdriver holding up section of the document oh okay um oh no I can't do that no no I got it I got it I got it wait I don't got it where is it I don't even see it under the oh sorry under the title of it
oh is it really that I don't know I to what part of I don't okay my kids do this all the time they'll say where's mom and I'll say I don't know and they'll say is she upstairs I'll be like what I just tell you well no here here I'm asking I don't know for BS detector already sent me a screenshot from something that Nick light said okay cool okay it's $29.99 so then it's was it $480 off something like that yeah okay so it's going to be 25 bucks for  nice really does that seem right that's
what I was saying it's like all metal machined and stuff that's what I was saying what the expensive bearing and everything we haven't even talked about some of the key benefits of it um this is a really cool product and it's it's little thing just like with the chat's like you can't take it back like just like with the screwdriver you guys um it's not like we invented screwdrivers it's not like we invented ratcheting screwdrivers it's not like we invented ratcheting screwdrivers with bit storage
in the handle like but that doesn't change the fact that a product can be much greater than the sum of its parts and uh I think we're up in the "neighborhood of around 150,000" screwdrivers now like absolutely colossal numbers I'm probably I'm probably underestimating I'm making sure that the number that I say is is what we've sold and the reason for that is not because people just are suckers and fall for influencers or whatever the case may be it's because it's a really
good screwdriver it's greater than the sum of its parts it's well balanced it feels good in the hand it's durable uh people absolutely love it in fact we've got a whole topic um based on uh people on Reddit just posting how much they love their screw drivers I'm a technician at a science museum I use the something out of it people are showing this thing being absolutely beat up to hecking back like you can tell this one is shiny this one is glossy uh from use uh I okay it's a beater screwdriver I do
other percussive maintenance anyway the point is people absolutely love this product and it's because we care so much about little fine details and on this one one of the big ones and it's really hard to tell from here but our Precision bits are about the same length as you would find in the industry standard but the actual shank is much longer and hex is much shorter and if you've ever used a Precision kit then you guys will probably know that occasionally they don't reach deep
enough and it's pretty fraking annoying and uh we felt the same way so we designed our Precision bits to reach just a little bit deeper we couldn't go too long on them someone asks if we can travel with these well if you travel with another one you can travel with this one because they're exactly the same length as other people's bits but the usable depth on the skinny shank ones is significantly greater um and we couldn't go a ton longer because there's going to be durability concerns for some
of the really small ones like it is not a substitute for just like a long shaft fixed um like a fixed bit screwdriver um and and as you go like as you go really long there'll be too much wobble and stuff like that like there's other design concerns but we've got a super strong magnet we've got this longer shank and I think you're going to find that the day-to-day usability is noticeably greater so yeah just just really excited about uh just really excited about this product and yeah
pricing downright reasonable I I legitimately just didn't know what the pricing was going to be that doesn't mean nobody ever talked to me about it at some point I someone probably told me at some point not top of mind yeah just it's just been a while yep yeah finally freaking finally I feel like this thing's been basically ready for so long and then it is freaking finally actually ready was manufacturing stuff that held it off CU I feel like it it was everything yeah I mean I told the story
recently about how it turns out that the uh the measurements of these small bits are not industry standard so the standard I man tinan or Kyle would remember the standard is to have it be the right measurement on no on the bit side and then have the Tolerance on the screwdriver side but everyone else has the right measurement on the screwdriver side and then the bits are smaller to account for tolerance or something like that so we had done it the right way but it turns out everybody else does it the
other way and so there was a risk that our standard sized bits with their tolerances would occasionally be too big for other people's uh ision screwdriver and we're like okay well people might want our bits they might buy our bits to put in their existing kit because of the longer the longer shafts and they might discover that like they don't fit or something like that so we didn't want to deal with that fair enough so we had to  anyway uh are we going to switch to after dark because I think we're pretty
close we're we're out of topics out of  is it's no longer dark we just changed the yeah we just changed the logo now people didn't like the that we were sitting in the dark on lmg Clips which makes sense which makes sense when you take it out of the context of the show it's yeah it's kind of stupid yeah I get it I get it you guys are reason but we do this now yeah yeah it s like a you know dark kind of works dark purple yeah oh it's a light purple Ghost type mid purple 
uh okay I got some BR brat purple brat purple no Brat's green you haven't even listened to it I don't know suck not brat no not at all not Bret uh okay I got some merch messages here let's see uh question for lonus do you still frequent beat saber which platform have you settled on watching on a quest 3 I haven't been playing much lately because the majority of my exercise has been swimming lately although Ivonne did beat saber for her for her cardio last night and we are still on PC I'm still
on the valve index it's just it's the best overall package the big screen Beyond is super cool and there's lots of other really cool headsets from the lake of varo or vario or however you pronounce that uh the quest 3 is super affordable and practical but I already have an index it's a little frustrating that that is true and the index released in 2019 yeah but it's it's outside in tracking it's which still the screen is good enough it's the best dude the nearfield speakers on it really good
they freaking Crush yeah they're outstanding like what what am I going to do I'm going to like apple Vision like what am I supposed to upgrade to dude at this point I would buy like a screen upgrade for my index yeah over a lot of the other options that are out there so I just I just keep ending up back at the  index is based I hope Deckard gets new says katos I heard Deckard is supposed to be inside out though I'm not interested in wearing a phone on my face y I just want an index with a better
screen that and the index Comfort is so good like it's just it's just it's a  package hi W.D just built first PC with me and my brother it's a sick basement gaming rig nice what was the first PC that you built what OS did it run mine runs Fedora 40 love the new scrapyard Wars first PC I ever built ran Windows XP uh it was an Athlon 2500 plus Barton core I overclocked it to the same clock speed as a 3200 plus which I believe was 2.2 GHz or like 2 2.3 something um I had 512 Megs that's right Megs of DDR one
memory running in single Channel um cuz I you know thought I might expand later I had a 120 uh gigabyte which was very common back then 120 gigabyte uh SATA drive I I spent wow uh yeah I spent um Less on the I got I got less cash I got the two Meg cash 120 gig one instead of the 8 Meg cache 80 gig one I wanted more capacity versus more cas I wasn't convinced that cash made that big of a difference I had a soultech MRN L motherboard uh enforce enforce 4 chipset um I had an ntech
lanboy which had a smart blue 350 watt power supply and then I reused my old peripheral so I had an old CRT from my uncle's old computer which was unironically fine um and then Microsoft natural ergonomic keyboard and just like a generic I probably had a ball Mouse at the beginning I don't even know if I had like a generic laser mouse yet but at some point I got like a generic Logitech laser mouse and then I used a uh piece of A4 paper as a mouse pad for actually I I went through some upgrades to
everything else before I ditched the A4 paper mouse pad my my first PC was my first PC that I built myself was Windows XP I had built stuff with my dad that was earlier than that but realistically how much of that was my own doing is probably very small like my dad was doing basically everything at that point in time and if you're asking What GPU did I have I didn't that's why I got the MRN L cuz it had onboard GeForce Graphics which spoiler alert remember when I talked
earlier about how Nvidia Bamboozled me once before I was very knowledgeable with their misleading naming GeForce 4 MX was a lot closer architecturally to GeForce 2 than it was to GeForce 4 it wasn't even direct X8 if I recall correctly really y so that was when they got me I spent extra on this motherboard that I thought had like I heard GeForce 4 was good I didn't know anything yet so I got this onboard Graphics that I thought was like you know yeah it's on board but it's
like good it's a good on board it's GeForce I didn't know I didn't know it sucked yeah that branding was frustrating I remember that at the time yep hey lonus I'm the head lifeguard at my pool and my manager has been pushing me to do more desk work how did you handle the similar change in your life as lmg grew wish there was more space for newon I guess newans I don't know I don't know it's some days I I like and appreciate you know having a greater impact through you know team
building and um you know and all working together like that sense of group accomplishment like that's really good you got to kind of learn to enjoy that as well but there's days that I really I don't even have a test bench in my office anymore yeah like that sucks I like tinkering with things you know um that's way more fun for me like I'll get i'll get caught up on set sometimes they'll be like telling me okay yeah you got to stop like troubleshooting this and go to another shoot let someone else
fix it I'm like yeah but that's lame like I want to fix it um and I I don't know I I think as a as a tinkerer i'  hey all I am a truck driver working on transitioning to Tech I used to run ha in a VM my main gaming PC the riot games anti-che would freeze my PC any thoughts on anticheat breaking things when you say ha do you mean home assistant I'm assuming so I I don't know um yeah man I I am so I was thinking about this the other day oh yeah I remember I think it was you who flagged some someone
uploaded some tool kit or something that had a gaming PC in it on Reddit I thought I thought you showed it to me yeah and uh you and someone else were both like yeah we should totally do like like seven Gamers one CPU again but like a mobile one yeah yeah the problem is that it doesn't work the compatibility would be basically as bad as like a steam deck or like a Snapdragon because anything with anti-che just immediately craps out when you're using land rig so who cares just play old games can you
play Halo C yeah but if yeah but if you're going to play hell yeah if you're going to play old games why don't you just oh man I don't know why are you going to build like a Cutting Edge AMD epic like server thing with a bunch of modern gpus in it to play Halo Combat Evolved Left 4 Dead to Halo C maybe some rocket League sprinkled in there um yeah but you could play that on a bunch of laptops like that's my that's fun who cares what do you mean it's no fun the gaming is the fun yeah building the
computer is the fun though I don't know I'm just I'm just over it now that antiche just locks you out of any modern game as soon as it detects a VM I just I think it's I think it's dead and I've had this debate with with the um the guy that used to be at unraid and is now at ashtech who was like really passionate about that stuff and really helped us get seven Gamers one CPU over the line um his new project which investment disclosure I invested in because I think he's a cool guy and his team's cool um
no offense John not because I haven't necessarily a ton of confidence but yeah um the point is that uh I've I've debated with him and I've just been like dude I I think it's dead he's still really like passionate about virtualization and that kind of a use case I'm like dude it's over um if you're you know take the money do whatever you want but please don't do that it's I mean it's over for competitive games with antiche but there is a lot of games out there that don't have have that H yeah there are but
there aren't a lot of high-end games in general right now and most of them like you're talking about actually having a need for the hardware most of these competitive games that you're talking about um won't push it anyways sure but the one that killed it for me was we were going to do the land Center at home with that we were going to do a like a five Gamers one CPU setup and then Jake and I set it up to do the proof of concept video and we tried to launch Halo infinite and we couldn't play it like oh
there there is definitely games I'm just saying like there's a there's a lot of stuff that it wouldn't necessarily apply to there is also a lot of stuff that it would apply to yeah and the last thing that I want to do is you know just it's hard enough to all agree on a game MH and get it working MH adding virtualization and potential conflicts with anti-che doesn't make it better tape to tape got an update I know goes Manuel goalies in the AI is way better Manuel goalies brother guess what
our Squad got an update oh yeah [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Colin Place dude he's like yeah I heard you guys talking about it and stuff but I like never mentioned it I was like dude it's like the only game I play right why didn't you say anything our biggest problem I've been playing a ton of tape to tape we have constantly rotating players that's honestly a huge problem so so we so Squad the squad now you me Elijah Yvonne we've got Chase in the squad uh David plays oh he's probably
killer at it he's good at like video games he well yeah he's like sweaty as all hell and also like played hockey for years fantastic uh and then and and now we've got colins so we've got like we've got like seven people that we can draw from when we want to do a run now hell yeah that's actually exciting did I miss anybody that would be super embarrassing if I missed any there's other people that um wasn't it Angus got pretty good there Angus got pretty good at the yeah there's other people that have
kind of dropped in here or there but I don't think they like would practice yeah yeah yeah so yeah yeah Colin like plays like he almost beat me nice yeah good and he he might have the game got interrupted because he was running some kind of like weird music production software and it like ripped the audio device away from the game think think it caused a crash so that the crash will probably get cut from the AMD ultimate Tech upgrade just because we're worried people will get confused and think it
was because of AMD or something it's not right um but it was actually because um I forget what the tools caused called but it like that tool had an error to do with the audio device like right when the game crashed on the other screen so we're pretty sure it was because of that yeah yeah anyway tape to tape let's go last one I've got for you here can't wait to get that backpack question for lus has anyone failed to recognize you now that you are blondish uh man I can be wearing sunglasses and
like a hood and people will stop me in the street I don't think I don't think they need the hair color I don't know what it is I don't know I don't know what makes me so what we met we met last weekend uh impromptu just walking past each other in a parking lot and he thought I was a  okay oh no ow you deserve it yeah how can you tell that story what's wrong with you it was really funny that's not even related to what they were saying they were asking how recognizable I was it
was genuinely really funny that's horrible I got double tap so hard oh my god look look I have talked about this on the show before I have a really hard time recognizing people out of context I'm really bad with faces I'm bad with thingses I'm especially bad with faces and I'm especially bad when I see them out of context I wasn't expecting to see Luke just walking out of a restaurant I was heading into and when I see someone wearing an LTT shirt I looked at the shirt first when I see someone wearing a
shirt it's not a completely crazy thing for me to assume that they're a viewer and they're just like waving at me and so when Luke just randomly waved at me and was like hey lonus I saw the shirt and I was like hey it was pretty quick it was a pretty quick double tap and I had to I I didn't realize it was him at first I fig I figured it out pretty fast yes yeah I recognized Emma  L yeah why you get a man it was funny to be fair I had a similar type of reaction I just saw you first so I had enough
time to like process it before I actually said anything cuz what was confusing for me was that I saw you and I saw all the kids um but ion wasn't there and my brain didn't like immediately click in cuz like your hair I had sort of forgot I had just done it but I like forgot yeah so I was like what like we also had a kid that wasn't one of ours so that probably Factor there yeah it was a little odd which how does it make me feel I don't care at all like it's not just like a YouTuber thing that we it was
legit thanks for watching see you again     god oh oh
