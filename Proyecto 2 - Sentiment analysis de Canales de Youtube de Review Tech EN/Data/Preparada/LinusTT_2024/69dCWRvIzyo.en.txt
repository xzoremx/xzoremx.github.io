this is lwig you may know him from his ever popular live streams gaming content and chess boxing events yeah I did that did thing good job behind him is a PC that plays Minecraft and behind him behind him is all the servos solenoids and relays that are going to be punishing him for playing the game what especially punishing him when he does something wrong wait what do you mean punish how what what is my ass what is that the trick trick part is only you know exactly is it which effects we've
created and no one knows ex I don't know something just went in my ass I don't what you mean you don't know do you know that happened are you controlling it I know that because you told me is that the button no that's from my teleprompter is this you too that's a truck I have a few guesses as to what's going to happen I'm willing to bet that if you go underwater it's going to have something to do with this swipe bedet that we've got here yeah that's literally dripping water right now as
for the spikes in the seat I mean hey if you play your cards right you might never find out what they're for or if you play your cards right you might find out a lot okay depending on what kind of cards you like a man I wasn't ready for this okay but what you will have to be ready for is this message from our sponsor War Thunder you drive tanks you pilot planes you do the pew pew it's both fun and realistic and you can play for free right now on PC and consoles using the link below simple why have
days like today when you can have bit days like this it doesn't matter the point is off the top when we started carrying lwigs line of swipe bed on LTT store.com we knew we had to do something cool to promote them I thought we were just going to do like a one-on-one no thanks to the team at signal RGB it ended up being surprisingly simple their Universal RGB Control software already features integration with Minecraft so they generously helped us adapt the code to instead of say turning your lights
red when you take damage um to send a call to an esp32 that can trigger well any number of fun effects so I have to play the game and if iuck up in the game you're going to me up in real life and a and a real big ass company worked on this so H hop up for a second first I'd love for you to take a look at at what we've created yeah so I'm noticing instantly we got two swipes mounted which I can only imagine is like when you watch a 4D movie The only effect that they give you which is spring you
with water oh we have so much more than one then they have oh can you not oh like that's not going to trigger later I know that's I don't know what's going to trigger it that's the issue is I don't know what's going to trigger it I don't know what this is that's just scary to me I this is I'm pretty sure what you attach to an Xbox 360 to say slurs online I don't know what this is this is just straight up I'm scared to touch it is this an airbag I mean don't crash and you won't
know okay all right this is just a gun why do you have a gun why is it pointed at the chair am I the only one sitting in this uh are you sitting in this I actually don't know the answer to that oh man with that out of the way take a seat want you have a seat right over there okay to get things started we wanted to put you onto a fun little map based on Wipeout or tashi's castle in Minecraft okay all right okay Tanner who is the games master today is providing instructions from here on out where
exactly would you like me to you're going to want to take probably two steps back why would he have to take two steps back what because he signs my paychecks okay that's actually a pretty fair point Tanner you know I'm really good at Minecraft good we actually do know that ready for it [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Gamers around if we were to do a one-on-one you wouldn't win a single game at what was that for that that was a  rectum that's your sales pitch swipe B LTT store.com okay all right it's so it's a
it's basically why is your countdown okay is it a parkour map there we go yeah it kind of looks like it par all right go down the water okay yeah but I wouldn't go all the way in the water you know okay all right yeah all right get up here oh I didn't do it that time I let's have a little respect for the game what is that that's just start air compressor in the shop that's nothing so I know if I touch dude it's Aim so  F do you notice that I'm noticing um that I'm having a lot more fun than you
that I'm not even hitting the water and it's setting off I think what's happening is when you when your state changes when you go in water or go out of what you are you dead you think it's when my state changes and it's not yeah can I tell you something privately it's not that motherucker right next to us pressing a goddamn button I tell you what I'll hold it I'll hold it I'll hold it wait how so wait if I do this well don't do it though well let's just test it I mean yes oh God what did you think
was going to happen oh God get out of the water okay stop stop all right let me Focus that's your product eventually it'll run out if you don't want it to have such outstanding P cleaning power then maybe you should design it with a less powerful jet I couldn't I couldn't dream of that world the good news is I'm fing electric so we're on to the next part what dude it teleported me it was a checkpoint it teleported I didn't know that happened oh my God I'm going to swim all

a 100 games I wouldn't lose one to you really not one stock in a 100 games hey hold on a second I forgot about this when you challenged me and you said you would beat me at any game yep we still have to do that so what am I coming down to La later or what and for what cuz I kind of feel like I should take him on in Minecraft based on how good he is at it what did I do you took fall damage yeah you need to come to La we're going to do a bro vers bro okay all right do you have your games list yet yeah what I
go shoot I I think I listed them on the W show shoot what I think one of them was beat saber okay yeah that's fine I think one of them was ano 1800 okay which was not made in the year 1800 it's just about the year 1800 it'd be impressive though you know what um I'll take you on in TowerFall towerful yeah what is that game it's platformer com like it's a 1 V one platformer game can I keep it a stack with you keep it a what can I keep it a stack with you a stag a stack a buck can I keep it 100 100 of what a
stack is 100 100% Can I be real can I be honest yeah of course I am not going to come close to beating this game yeah yeah no that's fine I have been slowly mining gravel just for like the past 10 minutes while we've been talking making no progress and I it just ran out of pick finger slipped let me try the last map this map was inspired by the map called 11 ways to die so they added some cool new updates must be at least easy difficulty don't no that's yeah I'm nervous man you're doing great I don't
know how to I'm getting upset I'm getting mad I'm getting and you know how I get when I get angry so you picked a game where the object of the game is to die but my object in real life is to not die see you keep saying you but I had nothing to do with it uh can I die in this room how do I kill myself oh but if you hit the harder ground does that hurt more yeah that's going to take a really long time how do I kill myself okay just don't eat the food right yeah oh my God he sounds so defeated what
have you guys done to him you saw how much energy he had when he came in here at least hey we're getting good luck with the RNG the gun hasn't gone off in  while you just had you have to say no I  it okay you get it woo hey he likes the butt puncher way too much all right I did it I'm I'm done I'm I'm done I'm done man I'm done you know what we're going to win you know what we're going to beat we're beating wipe out what we're going to beat wipo no we're not beating white oh my God stop it's the only game
