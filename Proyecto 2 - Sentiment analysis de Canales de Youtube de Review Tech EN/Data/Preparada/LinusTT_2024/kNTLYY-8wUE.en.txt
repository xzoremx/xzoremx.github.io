the core i7 14700 K may not be particularly cute but everything else is welcome to the cutest PC everything about today's build is s tier adorable starting with the motherboard I mean just look at the colorfire meow b760 m now stop looking at it not only is it more Ginger than Rose we were turned off in a big Way by its lack of features and settled on the Mac sun icraft z790 in white it's more feature Laden for sure with more USB and PCI expansion slots but it is definitely the first of our
cute cost casualties the MSRP is fine at $260 but the lowest price we could find in the wild was closer to 350 that is more than double the price of this similarly featured but decidedly uncute MSI z790 board luckily though the same is not true of our 32 gigs of ddr5 5600 megat trans for Corsair Dominator platinum in our opinion these have one of the classier implementations of RGB out there and the specs don't suck that much at least compared to other Dominator platinums next up is our teeny tiny 1 TB
2230 Sab envm SSD look how small and precious it is perfect for something with limited space like a steam deck but for a full-sized rig the $100 price tag means you could get a more attractive deal on a bigger and better drive even if you were trying to do a cute build wipe this cute segue to our sponsor Ridge Heads Up Guys Father's Day is right around the corner and if you forgot don't worry about it get up to 40% off Ridge at their father's day sale using our Link in the description and
pick up a great last minute gift we were somewhat divided on how to tackle the big box I mean there are novelty cases like the yes and cute pet case which I mean are unique and there are lots of regular boxes with colored vinyl stickers that make them Ka but the more we scrolled Instagram and Tik Tok for ideas the more we noticed an overwhelming Trend the case itself was rarely the focus it's the inside that counts so the idea is we're treating the PC cooler c3t 500 more like an art
gallery than an art piece and it's slightly smaller size when compared to to most ATX cases should keep the proportions correct on our desk but David what the heck is this just a white build no no no the aiio is white with a screen you know we already did the all  baby okay as long as you don't mind paying the extra and pay extra you will the Corsair IQ link h150 irgb with the upgraded LCD screen module with high resolution display looks absolutely incred incredible in any themed build
though I can't say the same for the cas's pre-installed fans I mean they're all right they are RGB and everything but the QX series from Corsair is a lot more pleasing to the eye with 34 LEDs per fan for smooth lighting effects and daisy chaining for Less ugly cable tanglish the only thing that's really not cute about them is the price it's ugly  you can't argue with the look of it though I mean this is clean funnily enough though our first real individual aesthetic piece the seic vertex Sakura
1000 watt is a power supply that's going to end up being stuffed into the back of our case never to be seen again which is a shame because oh my good goodness C Sonic has attended to every detail here creating a power supply that is as cute as it is performant wait no way even the cables are accented pink saving us the cost of custom cables from a thirdparty vendor that is a big win for our budget or at least it would be if this wasn't a very limited run item that's currently
going for about triple the price of the black model also really guys you got one black connector and it's going to be front and center in the middle of our build on our GPU that is whatever a cuter word is for bummer tushy here thankfully it doesn't really matter since our GPU is going to be using these classic 8 Pin pcie power connectors let's go ahead and get everything cabled up shall we now it's time to meet our GPU the powercolor hellhound Sakura 7 800 XT like the non Sakura version it boosts to
2520 MHz with 16 gigs of gddr6 memory and has an LED color switch but obviously its most important feature is its colorway now the hell hounds of Legend aren't known for being adorable but this is so cute how high was the cuteness tax on this one David uh it wasn't too bad it was less than $100 more than a regular hellhound that's a lot more to pay for a 7 800 XT but hey at least it comes with this adorable anti-ag bracket that's going to serve us very well when we're decorating the case now for the
finishing touches boop boop there were two peels on that now that our computer is adorable all we need to do is cutify the space around it because H this simply won't do time to paint oh okay that is a cute color apparently it's called pinky promise now to be clear there's a lot of things I would have done a little bit differently if I'd been the one in charge of getting all of our painting materials and all that but doesn't really matter we are just doing an accent wall anyway I'd hate for you guys
to get bored literally watching paint dry here with me so while I do this David is going to show you some of our cute peripherals let's start with Logitech and the g705 mouse it's sadly not used the hero sensor but it still has light speed connectivity for nearly LaGree performance and it's well constructed if slightly small for bigger hands but perfect for cute hands it's part of a well-rounded cutesy Aurora lineup and we grabbed the matching g735 headset for our setup with its
similar soft lines and matted white Plastics punctuated with tasteful RGB and if you want to take your cuteness a step further you can get the pink ear cups pink boom mic from Logitech or these universe cat ears that fit on uh pretty much any headphone for just a few dollars as for the keyboard we are going so hard with the unzi c68 high-fi mechanical keyboard one of the sweetest  seen I've actually already put in the mixed pastel Seaglass linear switches from Omni type and these absolutely
perfect in every way cat-shaped meow meow Squad key caps from kboom and meow Bang those are madeup words I mean all words are made up the cherry on top is going to be this white cold cable from cable mods lus has gone to shoot another video so that means I can finally think straight again and we can do the most important part of today's video which is decorate both our PC and our setup let's  I think this looks absolutely incredible and that's not just thanks to me I had a
whole Council of cute come together and help me pick the parts for this and so I want to have their reactions to the finalized setup and we're going to have that over in exclusive at lm. g/f flow plane but right now I want to see what lonus thinks oh my goodness I feel like I'm moving Between Worlds wow you know I think I could get used to this what a relaxing Vibe MH how's this keyboard is it actually any good she Clacks she Clacks she move okay well she's all right there are so many layers I see
we've traded out our Bulbasaur bushes for Ivysaur flowers yeah we've evolved this is a nice touch by the way yeah LT store OG pink and white water bottle bottle hardly even noticed it there first thing you're supposed to notice is the desk pad what do you think it's the cutest thing I've ever seen I can't even complain that it's not from LTT store we need to make something like this I actually do agree with you we need to do some more Kawaii types of products is this a stream deck skin or is this just
like a special cute version of the stream deck no it's a special one Elgato actually has a Neo lineup of Hardware that's designed to be super easy just plug andplay very aesthetic uh they have a a webcam light a mic and I think it just kind of Blends into the setup in a really Pleasant way one of the pleasant surprises I had was actually setting up this monitor I really like this base it's white with speckles it looks great evnia is Philip's new welcoming gaming brand okay and they have really good
monitors this is a 41 in 4k 138 HZ monitor it's so lead and everyone who walked by was commenting on how good and it looks and feels but they also had one that was kind of considering a 34in cutie OLED you know cutie oh I just thought you me you wanted the best panel Tech no no cue oh I love the heart back there that was Glenn he made that happen that is awesome so there's a ton of aesthetic things I mean oh my goodness the secret lab chair is adorable the Titan Evo with
the pink plush but also the memory foam armrest very oh and they've got like soft it's really nice I'm so ready to launch my eirl career one of my favorite random touches is this random beo switch dock we don't have it plugged in right now but it's a dock and you could actually have your screen play through it and we even got a switch case to match is I mean it's cute it was supposed to be pink but the by the time we ordered it the pink was out quality I mean no no don't to worry about quality
it's cute did we run into a lot of things like that though there wasn't too much um the tradeoff is there is very little that is budget in this build do you want to know how much it's worth I already have kind of so that's that doesn't count I brought that from home okay tell me the computer was around "$2,500 that is not that bad other than" that the GPU is not what I would expect for a system of that price when I spec a very similar system that was not aesthetic it was
"$1,700 yeah so a big premium there so" you could basically afford to have a 4080 super instead yeah actually maybe even better you could get a 7900 XTX and a 14900 K I could putot that into my budget so did you also do a not cute version of the complete setup I did not because if you're not doing a cute PC why do you need a cute setup right I mean the Dorito dust should be enough decoration yeah Doritos dollar your decorations a dollar the whole setup minus a few things that weren't included
"$10,000 shut up yeah shut up how much" are these those are nothing these are like $6 a piece it's the monitor what is it where's the where did the money go the lights everything how much were these uh those are $200 there's a few things that I got that weren't included so I will show you the total right now on screen it should be a little bit less what about this n it's like 5050 bucks where did all the where'd he go I honestly don't  jeez scared the pants off me what do you
think of that Mouse you know what it's a little small yeah even for your hands even for my hands yeah no no no no no I trying to get over water these are the cutest key caps I've ever seen I can't say I'm a huge fan of the key switches are you you're a I'm a TCT T guy yeah these are linear you sure are I do like the key caps though they're actually pretty high quity for being gimmicky yeah they're so cute they feel great I think the cutest thing though is that as we game and our fans ramp up
there's a breeze that blows through our cherry blossoms oh yeah that's satisfying oh I feel like I'm a three-year-old with those games again you know where you're putting the shapes in the hole this is very relaxing I like this genre of games oh I meant being in this environment I thought you meant being next to me uh you're part of the environment David I wouldn't spend this kind of money on it  oh oops um but it's definitely something that I can appreciate and enjoy now that
I'm sitting in it far more than I would have thought that I would oh oh God that's their house Linus I know I swallowed it all up into the abyss oh my gosh how big does this hole get oh  delivery I need to play this game I think I do too and I need to tell you about our sponsor rocket money it's a pretty terrible feeling when you look at your bank statement and there's fewer dollars in there than you were expecting that's this isn't right and with more and more platforms switching to
