good thing that didn't make it into the show oh it might have what's up everyone and welcome to the W show we've got a great show lined up for you guys this week the big topics are of course that Bitcoin is not a Beanie Baby No in fact not the SEC has told us no Bitcoin is not in fact Beanie Babies also Bing sales might mean a pivot to allowing additional game stores on the X box not to mention uh handheld okay this seems like we're off to an interesting start oh right I I'm sorry I'm doing
three today because I forgot about the headline topic that isn't in the dock oh I hate Facebook Marketplace and I want to talk about that it made me extremely angry today I want to talk about what Solutions there might be to that but yeah anyways my topic I guess will be Sora goes to Hollywood oh my no you can do two topics it wasn't the writer okay I'll do two Google ordered to ID YouTube users oh yeah that should have been the biggest topic and this could actually be a huge deal yeah we'll talk about 
that the show is brought to you today by ag1 Ridge and vessie all right why don't we jump right into you know what Let's do let's do the YouTube topic the YouTube thing yeah this is kind of a big deal okay so there's been actually YouTube's been in the news for a couple of things this week uh there was an analysis done on them that um their evaluation might be somewhere north of around $400 billion which would make them more value than Disney and Comcast combined which is funny because YouTube
seems to kind of fly under the radar a lot of regulatory stuff like Google or alphabet gets talked about but YouTube it's like I don't know yeah man like I don't know it's just YouTube right like whatever um YouTube is a flipping enormous company if if it were its own company um but with being a big company comes big responsibility toward your users and I don't know if I'm convinced that Google is doing everything that they could to take care of YouTube's users let's have
a little listen I guess Luke do you want to read us through what exactly happened  this maybe I'm just naive but this really surprised me really yeah uh anyways I'll get into it we'll talk about how it might surprise or not surprise more in a moment but Accord by the way Dan I think my monitoring is dead um according to recent unsealed court documents Federal investigators have ordered Google to unmask users who watch certain YouTube videos uncover agents sent links to these videos to a
suspected cryptocurrency launderer under the Alias Elon Musk whm the government then ordered Google to provide extensive information on anyone who watched the videos between January 1st and the 8th including names addresses telephone numbers user activity and IP addresses the videos were tutorials for mapping using AR software and drones which have "been watched over 30,000 times" altogether so that's the biggest problem there are plenty of problems that we can talk about but that's the number of users
that got caught in the crossfire of what supposedly was supposed to be a targeted sting I'm wondering if if H I'm wondering why you would do that and I'm I'm I'm I'm guessing that it's because they didn't want to send a video with like zero views so it would look suspicious or something I don't know no I think people just actually watched it Luke they uploaded this video and then people like H this is interesting well maybe almost anything can get views on YouTube right that's true yeah yeah yeah
uh in a separate incident investigators ordered Google to provide a list of accounts that interacted with eight YouTube live streams after noticing ing a live stream camera near the sight of a bomb threat one of those live streams was posted by Boston and Maine live which had around "130,000 subscribers again it's unclear" whether Google provided any information in this case but a Google spokesperson claimed that the company has a rigorous process for determining whether law
enforcement requests are legally valid or inappropriate and overly broad privacy experts have described these orders as potentially unconstitutional because they treat innocent people as potential criminal suspects simply because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time violating their fourth amendment protection from unreasonable search and their First Amendment right to free speech and free association so here's the thing not only were they in the in the wrong place at the wrong time and you
know sorry I have a bit of not chocolate stuck in my throat it's really deep back  um not only are they kind of put grouping people into buckets based on who they're associating with and where they were and at what time I mean there are certain situations where you know what too bad that's kind of valid you know like if you were if you were in the in in in Hitler's you know planning room for the Holocaust you know what I I'm afraid you're kind of you're kind of complicit
at that point complicit at that point if you're there there's probably other reasons yeah exactly more than just location you're probably ain't you probably ain't completely innocent is all all I'm trying to say right so so yeah okay uh fair enough you were you were in this like very very bad place at a very very bad time and there's simply no other reason to be there at that time you could maybe kind of make an argument there that doesn't mean it's constitutional or whatever I'm not a
legal scholar but what it means is that there might be some fire where that smoke be yeah but YouTube just a random YouTube video especially you might not have even been there it might have been on autoplay just some random live stream "of an account that has 130,000 subs or a" video on like AR software and drones I've watched AR software and drone videos yeah but I'm talking autoplay Luke yeah oh yeah definitely yeah and you might have not you I might have legitimately not even been in that room
it's like if someone took your phone and was like I'mma play Pokemon go with this guy's phone and they just poke go somewhere and they end up at like a rally for you know some kind of you know hate group or something right right yeah and then people are people be like yeah you're Associated I wasn't even there I had nothing to do with this there was a Mewtwo there what do you think I'm supposed to do exactly ex are you kidding me it was a shiny one it's crazy yeah so so this is lonus needs to chill
with his hot takes this is not a hot t hey this is terrible the fact that simply by watching a video and Again Luke you can become a suspect I shouldn't even even even I think the the word suspect might be too strong but you you're on a list you shouldn't be able to be on a list based on that you watched a video about a knife one time because that's the thing and I know I'm about to hold on hold on I know the slippery slope argument has all kinds of problems but this is one of the slipperiest of
slopes because there's all kinds of stuff that you can watch just because you have an academic interest yeah like this isn't like how to use a drone to bomb people okay okay I was really I was legitimately curious about those um uh th those add-ons that you can get for handguns that make them automatic uh okay yes where they called Glock something I for yeah yeah yeah switches uh and and I was like I was learning about it because I saw someone alleged that uh right because oh some politici
there's a bunch of different ways to do it someone tried to ban them I think you're talking about Swit yeah but some someone was talking some politician tried to ban it or something and uh I saw someone say uh yeah like they might as well ban 3D printers and then someone else was like well actually the 3D printed ones are going to last for like one round or three uh and like you know really it's it's these modifications that people are that people are manufacturing and selling anyway the the
point is no not bumps STS it's it's a it's a hand it's a hand handheld one um you can do that it's guys don't worry about it you can do bump STS with a pistol it's not what he's talking about though it's not what I'm talking a bunch of different ways to do it it's unimportant the point is yeah don't worry about it not bump STS it was something else I know what a bump stock is uh that that's a different thing um anyway the point is that I was like oh yeah so so like what is this piece how
is it integral to the handgun such that it like it obvious ly couldn't be involved in the actual combustion and expulsion of gas yeah uh but why is it that then as a it couldn't be 3D printed I I was just curious about it and you know how we joke like you've made the joke I've made the joke I mean Dan's probably made the joke at some point we joke about how like oh yeah reading that article or watching that video I'm going to be on a list yeah but what the actual yeah I probably just am
apparently yeah because just cuz this is the first time we're hearing about it does not mean that this is the first time this has happened it almost probably means that it isn't the first time it happen and there is literally anything on YouTube yeah literally anything yeah quite yeah quite genuinely I don't think there's been anything that I've looked for on YouTube that I didn't at least find something like heavily related to you know like I I got on a kick for a while
of watching um Scythe mowing on YouTube YouTube it's actually amazing it's crazy have you never seen this I'm on it I'm on it I'll look it up it's actually wild it's super efficient it's really fast um I mean you couldn't get that close to the ground with it could you oh no you absolutely can yeah this is like totally a thing look how low that is I mean and look how fast that was one little sweep got a big Arc I would have to be pretty sharp hey I think so yeah and like in in
the way that you're doing you see how she's piling up all the trimmings too yeah it just happens like automatically it's good for you it's like it's it's cool and she's like there's people that go like Fast she hers looks relatively small and she's going a little bit slow there's  Fly Fast mowing fast like this this oh wait is that a comp ition shut up is this a competition let's go dude Scythe vers this has 19 million views 19 million views dude dude how is the how is every
Niche something that has 20 million VI videos with yeah like tens of millions of views or whatever okay look at this look at them fly this is freaking wild yeah buddy doesn't need a shirt and look at look at how much there's so much Gra grass coming off that's a huge pile on the side and they're really going pretty quick especially when you consider the horizontal width here because you'd have to do quite a few passes with a mower to actually do this dude dude I would picnic on that lawn yeah it's 
yeah what the heck how have I never  this okay yeah it's sick all right all right man the they they know what's up yeah yeah to be honest okay uh sorry what are we supposed to be talking about right now right right nich is on YouTube so I um I don't know what to say other than not cool YouTube not cool US government and probably every government yeah oh man speaking of governments did you see the uh those drone picks from North Korea drone no someone freaking went to the Chinese North Korean border just
some random person was like in China for some reason uh they evidently are not there anymore but they were just like they just casually headed to the North Korean border casually flew a consumer drone just into North Korea man their cities are like Stepford Wives as like it's weird dude it's unsettling it's like it's like if you told AI to generate a city and it just had no idea about like traffic lights what yeah yeah it's crazy um yeah guys look it up on Reddit look it up on Reddit I can't uh I can't
remember the person's name or handle or whatever but this is like going pretty viral viral right now so you should be able to find it pretty easily um yeah check it out tons of this yeah yeah there's like a ton of coverage of it but look look look look look um you don't want the footage just get like some yeah okay fine you can look at the footage you want like highlights no no just it's 40 seconds long just yeah just just make it big I I'm not going to bring it up on the show 
like I don't know man and there's like there's like not a wait what I'm noticing that there are actually intersections what what's happening right there I don't I don't know there's like barely any cars though uh I didn't I didn't see much like close up or anything but apparently there's like not a shred of garbage anywhere cuz I don't know I guess you get executed if you like dude oh speaking of which I couldn't help and then Japanese cities so clean oh yeah there like a wind storm
and it still was cleaner than our cities like at the best of times y anyway yeah any wild wild they could have they could have been freaking like disappeared for this I am amazed that they were ballsy enough to go to the border and just freaking fly a drone and the thing is like it's not they didn't stay that high all the time oh really oh no there's like there's shots of people like like cuz they they were flying low enough that people could 100% just see it wow that's pretty wild I've told you about
the I think on Wow even of the uh the "1,000 Volvo cars that are in North Korea" yeah yeah we talked about that's a fun rabbit hole if you're if were bored oh man supposedly footage is from 2020 during the pandemic yeah I mean I guess if I was going to do something like this I would probably sit on it until I am way the heck away Kina and anywhere that it could be a problem um yeah dude anyway that's wild yeah super cool yeah that sucks that's frustrating that YouTube's doing that um
but sometimes like what are they going to do oh speaking of North Korea man North Korea has come up a lot lately uh Tanner got his hands on there there's this North Korean uh ad for uh like a Wii Clone game console like did he get it uh we're GNA play some games oh yeah yeah main main line ltte Channel video that's exciting trying out the North Korean we we clone I'm I'm legitimately very excited about this video that's going to be coming in the next little bit that's got
to be great do you think any of them are going to feature their like their leader whatever his name is I don't remember right now any of the games yeah I I'm not going to talk about the games at all but man I I just I've I've ended up North Korea's just come up a lot for me recently I I just went down the rabbit hole where where Kim Jong eel uh so so the current supreme ruler whatever his title is his dad uh was like a film buff and wrote a book about film do you know about this have you heard about
this no so I I I read a little bit of it it's like very thank you Captain Obvious for the most part but uh be he was such a film buff that he and I I guess this is a compliment uh kidnapped an actor and a filmmaker from South Korea and like held them for over half a decade and forced them to make films in North Korea yeah it's like a whole thing man it's wild dude it's freaking wild you like kidnapped them and like showed them his Movie collections like how completely utterly like stunted
do you have to be to think that that's an appropriate behavior you know oh my goodness they managed to escape on a trip in Europe yeah yeah like to a film festival or something like that wow yeah so they they like booked it for the the US Embassy like like there should be a movie about that there really should there probably is I'm sure someone's done it but no it should be like a big production man because you got all you got all your acts like laid out for you every everything's chill then and they
captured her but only to like eventually capture him cuz he was the director like oh anyway what are we supposed to be talking about uh next topic oh sure yeah oh right uh do you want to talk about Facebook I want to talk about Facebook yeah okay so we also did a video this week where we were analyzing the uh very good faith honest uh listings that people make for selling their computers on marketplaces like Craigslist and Facebook Marketplace and I think that Luke and I both shared some frustration
with how um difficult it is to find even just sort of separate from the video we were just we were browsing Facebook Marketplace as part of that exercise but separate from the video um we were both really frustrated with how hard it is to use Facebook Marketplace and how fixable some of the biggest problems would be so I'm sure you guys have seen this so one of the things we ran into so spoiler for the the PC listings video was people "who had listings that were like $220,000"
for this basic computer or like "$100,000 for this old Gaming rig or" whatever else and what we figured out pretty quickly was that these weren't necessarily scammers who thought anyone "was going to pay $110,000 for a core i5" system with a you know GTX 360 in it but it was more people who were okay not scammers but certainly not helpful um who were trying to game the system in order to just get exposure for their posting I mean mission accomplished we ended up making a video
about it which is probably more than they expected but um you can see how common it is for people to put a really high price on something in hopes that someone will sort by Price high to low and just see it and then if they happen to be interested in the gaming PC who knows maybe they'll message you about it well that reminded me of one of the huge frustrations that I have on Facebook Marketplace and I don't really know anybody at Facebook so this is my attempt to get someone at Facebook's
attention if you work at Facebook if a relative works at Facebook if you know anyone who works at Facebook and has any influence on the Facebook Marketplace team for the love of all that is good ask them to fix this okay Luke uh bring bring up bring up that posting I just showed it yeah yeah let's have a look at this okay so we got gaming piece uh one Canadian dollar okay this is categorized correctly Electronics desktop computers uh I've got a description in the second slide you want
to flip over to the second slide let see how this description is looking flip on over here okay yeah that looks like a pretty complete accurate spec list I have boxes for everything hey super cool appreciate that uh "$2,000 not looking for trades or offers" had it for three months well hold on a second because that said $1 can we can we can we can we go back to the Wi can we go back can we go back go back go back to the Wi cam no no no we're good we're we're good I realized I
have controls too um and there's a lot of these this is like a huge problem here here here here here back yeah back to Luke's laptop like there's no way these are all $1 yeah click on it click on anything click on click on $1 click on free anything yeah this is $121 or best offer some other thing asking $75 uh click on click on something else that might actually be a dollar PC building advice sure this one here we go here we go here's another one $800 $800 okay so or or same value in Gold Mint or
same value in Gold Mint Condition okay there should be a yeah that's a really that's a really bad grammatical error you really did obscure the meaning of what you were typing there um and so oh right right right right right no no no we're going back to your laptop okay so Luke yeah these are these are misleading posts these are obviously meant to to to um convey something that is not in fact true so why don't you find one of these and report it because that should be a thing you can do because this
completely eliminates the usability of the sort by Price functionality of Facebook marketplace right you like you've got prices minimum to you know whatever range this has broken the functionality of the site so go ahead and report one Luke I want to find because some of these are like doesn't matter click on anything just click yeah okay okay go ahead and go ahead and report it uh there should be three dots somewhere you are not logged into Facebook yeah this could be a problem a
limitation uh I I don't see how you would report something if you aren't logged into the service in order to report it and I am going to absolutely lose my mind right now because I am uh logged out of this thing for a reason and I have no way of getting my login information right now ah am trying to do a video podcast and uh one of these days I will get good do you still have to say video podcast no I just like it nice yeah I like the needless clarification I respect that um
okay let's see if I can get this code hold on tofa incoming yeah I love I love two Factor authentication so much it keeps my things so safe except when you know I get SIM swapped or whatever hey did you see that recent thing with um uh who was it I think someone had to pay a settlement over Sim swap oh no no no right right right right right right some manager at a mobile at a mobile provider uh admitted to facilitating Sim swaps for a grand that's how easy it is the humans the humans are always the
weakest point my brethren yep drives me crazy that's brutal you can build the best system for anything ever and if you don't take all the humans out of it it's doomed to fail drives me nuts or from the what but to the you did not T-Mobile manager took 2K for any Sim "swap yeah $22,000 oh I'm sorry no no no" I think this is a different story oh really they're talking about how they knew them oh my God all right here we go uh how do I what well where do I enter the login
code oh no there it go oh wow okay yeah sure I have to exit that in order watching lonus log into things is like an actually very entertaining Pastime because takes so long someone yeah someone recently tried to I know I just entered a code I wait what from an because you set up two Factor authentication your account is temporarily locked what do you mean locked what do you been talking  know okay here we go all right I got this i got this let's put that away and let's go on Facebook Marketplace let's
go shopping shall we it's shopping time uh okay it's always fun to it's always fun to look at my Facebook oh this is uh this is actually surprisingly funny look at that a Snap-On thing why is that funny I don't know there's definitely something funny just cuz oh all right let's keep moving wow um w wow even dad is like come on look I'm just I'm just saying grand for a Fallout guy uh tell me you wouldn't pay that much tell me you wouldn't no chance dude it was made for promoting Fallout 76 when
it launched these were never sold in stores Luke never sold in stores you got to rip the sign off of there okay you got to take the 76 off that's brutal ouch all right so let's find a free computer case ah yes boom wait a second wait a second do you recog guys this that thing's such a piece of trash no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no wait wait wait is it not wasn't this the brush aluminum panels that like immediately stained the second you use them wait hold on a second I oh 2013
case is it I thought this was uh hold on a second hold on a second okay guys we're about to go on a little side quest right yeah yeah yeah yeah no no I'm I'm bit Phoenix Pandora we we did a review of it yeah oh wait hold on I knew I'd seen  look oh man they stole our Bros at Hardware Canucks they stole their thumbnail for their Facebook post that's rough how much you want to bet that this that is a really you know I should have noticed cuz it is a way too nice photo a Facebook Marketplace photo yeah yeah
yeah yeah freaking awesome aome uh anyway not free send offers hey I did this video0 in stock okay hold on we're we're off the side quest now we're back we're back to the main quest okay so here's here's where you go you can report this listing in accurate description oh whoops okay well that's not actually what I meant to do uh hold on well anyway I mean it kind of is but it's also not the description of it is accurate that's what it is they're not really promoting a business they're not
selling an animal they don't have no intent to sell it's not weapon or drugs it's not sexualized content it's not discrimination it's abusive or harmful it's not really a scam it kind of is a little bit not 100% but a little bit they need a specific report for failure to disclose the price you'll see so many things on Facebook Marketplace which overall I actually really appreciate existing it is so much better than the old days of like Craigs List and people I don't know maybe having an email in there
maybe having a phone number maybe responding to people like it like the system maybe being a real person like Facebook for all of its flaws steals so much of your data oh that it knows that you're a real person and is pretty good at connecting real people to other real people but this has become a complete play on the platform it's actually unusable at this point and I even if you're like if you want to sort from low to high you you like can't get out of the drgs here no you can't because there's so many
listed for free or $1 or whatever like fake listings exactly you can't really get to I came across this because we we did that video recently with the PS5 killer where we built a system out of just the cheapest possible components that we could get um targeting $500 for the completed build but but still being decent for gaming and what I what I ran into was compared to when I did it a little while earlier like I don't know maybe a year ago or something I don't remember the last time I sorted by
lowest and searched for computer cases because you can absolutely get just ratty computer cases for free or for 10 bucks cuz people are just trying to get rid of them it is 100% a thing but the problem is that and they still exist they are still all over Facebook Marketplace people just trying to get R to prove a point not that long ago about how you you can get computer cases for free and it was hard to prove because there's so many like stupid listings that I actually couldn't find one but
they are out there yes it's just it takes flipping forever to dig through all the people free custom PC Building and upgrades that is not what free means click on yeah click on that one actually that's a service I'm offering a completely free PC Building and upgrade service the service is free the parts are not I've been finding I have a lot of free time okay that may actually be free maybe maybe it also might just be a scam I don't know who knows uh the point though is that that is a thing that's
absolutely out there but it's really hard to find because people are just inserting their random stuff that isn't free into my like free stuff that I'm looking for so I'm I'm just real frustrated with this and if anyone from Facebook is watching this I'd like you to know that this is not okay this harms the user it has no benefit to Facebook whatsoever if anything you should want people posting what these things are actually worth because I'm sure that that that's data that you're mining what
was the last price something was listed for what was it using Machine Vision or whatever on the pictures and uh you know who was it sold to who was the last person they were talking to like all that stuff is absolutely being mined by Facebook and so it's not helpful for your data collection to have people listing stuff for free that is not in fact free so please please fix your stuff and thank you very much this is this is a sidebar thing we've done two topics this is a sidebar thing but uh PC
Builders free Z we are young entrepreneurs anticipated to build your computer you're giving away a uh video that's coming soon DM for more info prices negot do better postings than that um yeah we we're we're we are definitely going to be hiring someone on like Craigslist at some point oh we're not going to do it soon now because I you know we're talking about it on W show and I'd like for it to be a surprise I don't want anyone baiting us but uh yeah I I just we're we're going to pit like Craigslist
versus Facebook Marketplace versus kiji or something yeah like or or some we'll put some we'll put some kind of fun spin on it but something along those lines or like me versus uh me versus someone on Facebook Marketplace who volunteered to build my computer no guys I'm not saying this is a price bait and switch it it it might be what I was pointing out is that like if you're trying to start a business by like working on computers write a better post than that yeah no one's going to message you we are young
entrepreneurs anticipated to build computers DM for more info no one's going to Care there's so many different offers like this like write a better post I don't care or wor worst case scenario rip off someone else's better post CH anything is better than that do something yeah yep cuz man it's not even it it doesn't even matter how good your computer is at that point people will assume it's bad because if you can't be arsed to write a decent description then what are the odds
you're going to C be ARS to Cable manage my computer yeah the photo is also terrible as well like clearly not yours you clearly ripped this off from somebody yeah so like I the whole thing just sucks do a better job anyways I'd like to see I'd like to see how you know your um selfstarter entrepreneur business goes oh wait I can see how that goes let's watch Luke Mo laon someone brought up this video apparently it was uh how they were introduced to the channel really yeah I ran into someone a
couple days ago in the this was the first video they ever saw yeah cuz not many people saw this video Yeah he was like yeah I watched summer jobs and I was like what he was like yeah you and line is like mowing things and like picking berries I was like really cuz this was supposed to be a whole series like we had a whole bunch of ideas for um man why did I think this was funny Mo grass Mo Problems I remember Yeah man cuz we take care of the problems we mow them we mow the grass we
mow your problems they're gone problems be shortened oh man ah why do you let me get away with this stuff cuz really you're yeah this is one of those things where it's kind of like what I was talking about before where PR sure I just showed up and the shirt was there where there's certain places you are at  complicit basically a Nazi what I I really liked this series I'm I wish it did a little better to be completely honest oh yeah I wanted to do way more of this kind of stuff what's
funny is there's creators that effectively do this now as their whole thing and they are very successful really so it's the problem is ended up I think we were like early or we just suck yeah one of the two so we have good good ideas and bad execution yeah what am I even looking at here why why is this why is this the viewership Spike because people are coming back after the adpot come on now no but that's too big oh that's way too big of a spike I have no idea that maybe it's that this is
finally where I managed to get someone to agree to let me mow their a long time I had forgotten in between painting houses and doing this series how very very very much work door to-door sales are you better get used to just constant rejection what was that that was what someone said from inside their house can't come to the door I'm naked okay like okay sure I also cuz I I had done the mowing lawns thing and lots of other stuff when I was a kid as well and I think when you're like
12 there's a much higher chance they're just going to be like yeah whatever sure yeah when you're like just some grownup dude yeah with a mo mo mo grass Mo Problems shirt or whatever I think there's a much lower chance to that you literally made yourself with an inkjet transfer the quality was not good it was not good yeah yeah SB mowing dude's whole channel is going to random hoses with overgrown Lawns and mowing it for them um I think he does that he does it for free I think I I've I've actually
heard of that and those are like extreme overgrown situations we were just going to people's houses with like Lawns that were probably mostly fine yeah like he he tackles some you can't even see the sidewalk and he's like clearing it out like this this is a kind of a different it's almost like restoration videos yeah yeah definitely a thing some of these videos have a ton of views dude I know I know someone who watches these just for like almost like relaxing background noise yeah I can see
that yeah this is great she thought I was crazy till she realized there's a sidewalk there who like what 23 million views I know right dang I know we got mow more Lawns there's so many niches no we got to mow more side walks yeah that's true um all right next topic I don't know Dan what are we even supposed to be doing right now he said next topic I think yeah but he said that cuz we thought we had only done one sorry next topic yeah topic two is also just another topic if you're uh
too far along uh no we've already done two topics Dan okay you want to move on or you want to do a third topic yeah yeah yeah yeah okay well merch messages I guess okay cool let's do it uh merch messages they're the way to interact with the show don't send a twitch bit don't send a whatever the other things are called Super Chat you want to send a merch message because it will come up down here like Trev John B so sorry is it Trevor or is it John no it's TR Trev John Trev John got

amazing or what it's pretty amazing absolutely love it all right have a seat FL plan's going crazy have a seat right over there oh wow I know yeah we're um this is a huge wow I'm Too Tall now we're actually I'm too I'm Too Tall which is like I haven't felt that way since I was in Japan I actually didn't I didn't even I didn't even notice until I was thinking about that um you know Europeans will often talk about going to Japan and feeling out of place and I was like well I don't I
found my people yeah exactly every everyone seems exactly the right [Laughter] size um yeah so bread Source I have a feeling Dan uh that there's about to be a uh an order explosion iect people didn't realize that the pins were as amazing as they are and as usual the pins are not limited edition they're not limited print they're not numbered or anything like that but I have no idea when or if we will ever make these designs again so uh if you want one you should probably move
pretty quickly and get any pins that you want do you know if we're still doing the pins of my birds I have no idea okay H yeah that would be a sarra question sarra got it sarra takes care of that for anyway Dan do you want to hit us with a couple merch messages sure thing uh this one's from Dylan hi lldd what is the worst stunt a company has tried to pull on a consumer in your lifetime oh wow I mean dude there's like man what what what what what was uh uh who who was who
was the defendant Johnson and Johnson in the in the baby powder thing where they marketed that powder specifically for babies that it turns out is like bad for your respiratory system oh wow like and didn't they try to declare B hold on hold on before uh Johnson and  settlement uh Johnson Johnson will pay $700 million and then didn't they try to didn't they try to pull a move where they were going to like declare bankruptcy or spin it out to a different company or something in order to claim
they had no money or something I don't I don't remember all the details but like dude no no no no Johnson and Johnson reach his deal for 8.9 billion talc settlement facing a flood of lawsuits claiming that their tal products cause cancer I mean there is no such thing as a worst thing that a company has done um because there's always a new bar man I I'm sorry I just I have no idea how to even respond to that what's next um how would you guys recommend dealing with the possibility of your
company being purchased by a huge investment firm I'm scared oh interesting so is this a I get I assume I think it's their company is going to be purchased not lmg okay well you know who would actually be best qualified to answer this question is Luke because for me as a as the owner of the company how would I feel well there's no risk of that we're not a publicly traded company so there's no possibility of a hostile takeover the only way to take over the company is to reach an agreement with me to buy the
company but Luke I'm sure you had a lot of things going through your mind back when we had the offer on the company and I talked to you about it where I think the the the goal of the acquiring company and obviously my goal was for the company to continue to be a good place to work that I would want to work and my friends would want to work and that would keep making money for the acquirer because otherwise why would they buy um so you know knowing that in good faith everyone wanted the company to be
good I'm sure you still had some concerns yeah I mean I'm pretty sure in in without mincing words I said I didn't think I'd last more than two years something like that yeah I I don't remember exactly what I said I hadn't planned to mention that I don't know I just no no no no no I mean I I mean it doesn't matter the deal's dead I just mean throughout the deal that's not something I would have mentioned I I mean I knew I knew that I said I would give it a shot you know but
I just I was like I'm but like what were your concerns not made for this world I don't know you hear like think about Facebook and Oculus yeah right like this this is a story that has repeated itself many times throughout history we are going to buy this company we are going to make no changes we're going to do it exactly the same way that the leadership is going to stay they did it because we recognize that the the success the strategy that has brought them their current success has has been so
effective and we respect that and we blah blah blah blah blah blah everyone knows what to say it's actually funny how probably easily okay we haven't had a chat GPT moment on the show in quite some time yeah I'm going to ask I'm going to get you to talk about you know sort of how you were feeling a little bit more and I'm going to ask chat GPT to write up a statement for me announcing my mega corporation's takeover of a small competitor nice yeah we'll see how that goes um but
yeah I just I assumed it would like I don't know I've always had some amount of issue with us like becoming a big company um but I think we've done a lot of the the right things right if that makes sense and it's been okay um there's some parts of being a big company that I still don't love but there are also some parts of it that I think are pretty freaking cool like we can do some pretty insane things right now that would not have been possible if we were still 10 people like how would we have made
screwdriver would have never happened um so there's there's there's positives and negatives but I often do shift towards small company now when you have big conglomerate consuming small company that isn't like this reasonable growth rate where you can kind of get used to the size increase and start understanding how to operate within this bigger thing and try to make sure that you keep the the benefits of the small team within the big Team all that kind of stuff that's a
sudden massive takeover of a ginormous company that is going to impose a lot of big company things onto the small company whether they say they're going to or not it's like going to happen uh because they have to be responsible for more stuff that big companies ought to be responsible for so I thought it would kill the culture I thought it would kill my drive to be involved in it and frankly there's lots of other things that I could go do if I wanted to but I don't want to but if that happened maybe
would have wanted to because in no small part I was rather certain that he also wouldn't have lasted I wanted to try to yep and I said that I would have as well um and you might have I don't know I don't know I um I'm a little bit more convinced now that you might have been able to really compared to then I was pretty I was feeling pretty burned out back then I think that's a big part of why I was entertaining it at all um and I think honestly I think going through that process was part of figuring out if
I still had it in me uh I I don't know that that would have been my exit strategy regardless of whether I was done or not I might have just hung up the screwdriver and said see you um but like I I just I think I think it was just part of figuring out okay what's worth more to me doing this job or a giant bucket of money yeah um you know some days I'm just like uh I don't want to get up but that's work right you also have to like the the decline that you see in people after
they retire yeah is like pretty intense oh dude I'd be so bored and there's some people you know that that don't do that but those people almost always are people that are going to have very involved Hobbies or that like start up something else maybe it's a a group of people nonprofit or something that they like it's it's just a new thing that they pour all their time into maybe it doesn't have to be as successful as career was but it's it's like some new thing um but you have to keep moving you
have to keep trying things you have to keep the mental stimulation high or decline fast you know about the you know there was kind of like a wave of recent high-profile uh uh content creator retirements uh do you remember talking to me about those at all do you do you remember me saying I didn't think they'd last yeah so like have any of them lasted at this point like already I uh I have something pretty funny to show you I was invited to a party recently which is a first for me by the way so
um good good job good job congratulations lce doesn't get invited to parties well no normally I have to I have to throw them I have to pay for the whole thing and then I have to pay people to come to them it's like to be fair I've invited you and you've never gone um made it show up I no I I'm pretty sure I came to uh I did you had a games night when you Rel Liv in the basement here still I met um I met that uh that couple oh yeah yeah wow and you explained all about um that 
okay yeah you know I know you were talking about earlier today are you not allowed to say that I I'm not sure okay yeah I'm not sure if it's uh I'm not sure if it's private or not but basically um it seems  kind of figured out that like PE busy people like they don't stay they don't stay not busy uh man like my uh my family has been out of town this week and I have no idea what to do with myself when I am not just swamped with working on the company working on family stuff like I um I was just like
well I guess I'll go play badminton tonight I have absolutely nothing else to do I I have nothing else and like I think that can work like if you literally just played badminton like every day or something at least you're doing something it would probably get old it would just get really boring but that's it I've got work I've got my family and I've got badminton so you take away if you take away any and like my kids are going to move out at some point so one of them is going to one of
them is going to end up ific less time consuming at some point and so if you take away work like or like yeah man I go crazy I go crazy man yeah I I I'm pretty pretty strong on the the mental stimulation stuff I um I always don't tighten it all the way if you can get it just right then it'll droop with us I'm kidding I'm kidding I'm kidding that's a lot no no no no no I'm kidding Dan I'm just readjusting uh anyway Luke I'd like you instead of worrying about any of that to listen to this carefully

again welcome to the your company name family we are honored and excited to have you on board and we look forward to getting to know each of you better as we embark on this journey together wow so the prompt I gave it was my large company is about to acquire a smaller competitor we want to craft a statement to send to the new team to assuage their fears can you please provide a template that was the most generic sounding horse that I think I have ever heard it sure was to be fair
you usually get generic sounding horse but what I was going to say is but it was only the most generic sounding because there are so many other things it's tied with yeah yeah it's the same as that's a good point and my biggest problem with that is that just reeks so hard of like big company crap scitech Evo says it's horribly perfect yeah it's it's it says exactly the right thing because it has absolutely no personality whatsoever because it's an AI or it's a generic like comms person I I talked
about how you even did 3.5 instead of four um have I ever talked to you about how oh sorry good uh do you even have it under your plan are you I'm not sure upgrade to plus no I don't yeah I do but I'm not logged into that account um it's really really good four at least I haven't messed with 3.5 with this but I'm sure it's still fine um four is really good at legal writing very good so like man is it is are we about to enter the era of cease and desists to everyone over everything
oh probably I guarant tell it to write a season just right now even with 3.5 uh I mean sure yeah I I guarantee you it would do just fine um oh man my neighbors kid it's very good at because and and like it probably I find that usually the first pass won't sound super legal easy but you can you can poke it and be like nah make it more legal easy make it more legal easy and just keep going and it'll keep making it just like my neighbor's kid keeps trespassing on my lawn can you write up a cease and
desist that sounds like it came from an expensive lawyer here we go your name your address city state ZIP code your email address your phone number date your neighbors Etc re cease and desist demand regarding trespassing I'm to writing you I'm writing to you on behalf of your name the legal owner and resident of your address it has come to my attention that on numerous occasions your child child's name has trespassed onto my property located at your address despite prior
informal requests to cease such Behavior the trespassing persists causing both inconvenience and potential liability concerns trespassing is a violation of property rights and is actionable under the laws of this jurisdiction as such I demand you immediately instruct your child to refrain from entering onto my property without express permission failure to comply with this demand will leave me with no choice but to pursue legal action to protect my property rights furthermore I must emphasize the
importance of your responsibility as a parent to ensure that your child understands the consequences of their actions and respects the boundaries of of others properties continuation of this Behavior will not be tolerated and may result in further legal action please govern your child's conduct accordingly and take the necessary steps to prevent any future trespassing incidents I trust that this matter will be resolved amicably and without the need for further escalation this letter
serves as formal notice of my demand I expect prompt compliance with this demand and confirmation of such compliance in writing within insert a reasonable time frame eg7 days of the date of this letter should you have any questions or require clarification regarding this matter do not hesitate to contact me your earliest convenience see and if you received that because so many legal letters are very yeah however please be advised that any communication should be directed through my legal representative to
ensure proper documentation and adherence to Legal protocol thank you for your immediate attention to this matter it would sound legit if I received it yeah why why do I pay for lawyers yeah I don't know I'm sure there's a reason yeah anyways next topic uh oh yeah right oh wait did we even do two merge messages uh let's do one more hit me Dan  Dan oh yeah cool that makes sense I mean you know that's how people  right that's fair that's mer messages merge messages I got my headphones off
uh hey lonus have you enjoyed playing Horizon zero Dawn are you going to play forbidden West now that it's on PC yeah I really enjoyed zero Dawn I picked it up because I needed something demanding to play on the steam deck while I reviewed it that felt like something that should have absolutely no right to run well on the steam deck and other than some crashes and some chugging particularly late game uh I enjoyed the heck out of it I uh yeah I I loved it I thought aloy was just an awesome
character cool yeah I like her without giving anything away because forbidden West just came out so people if they haven't already might be picking up zero Dawn in order to play them back to back and I respect that I get it um so without giving anything away I thought that the story was just so much fun to uncover as you make your way through the game did you play it zero Dawn yeah uh I tried and it wouldn't run on my computer at all this was quite a while ago I still want to play it some other time
but I haven't I haven't like I haven't played a single video game in the last week oh yeah it's fantastic man I've been gaming more than you lately yeah dude okay I'll I'll talk about this after but uh yeah yeah really enjoyed it I had not actually intended to play forbidden West though no and it's not selling nearly as well as zerod Dawn did there's a number of tons of hype around zerod Dawn and it was a fantastic game I'm sad that the followup wasn't maybe as good well no forbidden West is
supposed to be really good like that's not the issue was it just not talked about a lot or something I've seen some spec culation that um part of why zero Dawn got so much attention was it was one of the first big PlayStation exclusives to make its way to PC with a good Port like an actually good Port um it was dude it's rated really well yeah yeah so I think that what I realized 93% positive on Steve right now that's really good I know I know I think that what I realized though when I tried to
play Tears of the Kingdom was that I am forat I I don't think I I don't think I I think I don't I don't need to play that game again right um I need a new world and I get it she she goes to a new world but you can never have as much depth to the World building as you did in the first one the first one is from already established the machines all that kind of stuff from her childhood to her adulthood um and again without too many spoilers really exploring how what happened how
did we get here um I don't need to just like go meet new people and see new environments and um I do think that like I said one of the things I love so much about zerod Dawn is that I think aloy is an outstanding Central character she's just super she's super cool she's super relatable um um that's always a pretty big thing for me like the reason why I liked Assassin's Creed 2 and the follow-ups Brotherhood and Ascension is that Etso is such a fantastic main character to be
able to Pilot it's like actually a pretty big deal to like like the character that you're playing um so that helps a lot Dave G on Twitch says you're wrong forbidden West goes full desert Jungle Island Paradise it does expand on the original in every way but that's exactly it I I'm not interested in he's not looking for an expansion on an original I just said I don't just want to see new environments and meet new characters which is fine that's a personal preference for him that that
doesn't mean it's a bad game 93% of people like a great game sounds like a fantastic game but there's no such thing as wrong yeah um yeah like it's just what what I I really wanted to love tears of the kingdom and what I realized is I don't need to play that game some more with uh with a building mechanic and some new environments to explore like I breath of the wild was if I'm being honest probably my favorite game but I just didn't need to play any more of it I can feel that way sometimes not
all the time I I think like um like going from morwin to Oblivion I just wanted more Oblivion like Oblivion was great I had no problem with that but there are definitely some games like the Far Cry series oh my God this is the same game for the 18th time like I don't I don't need this again like and it and it kind of sucks because the it's not even the same game it's worse the gamep play is just story is so there's so many stupid little things to do and oh man I could talk
about this forever but um like the the World building is fantastic some of the scenes in some of the new far CES are like this is a beautiful landscape that I don't care to explore it's like all right and the thing is that there's there's so um there's so many other options out there that I don't and I I I find precious little time to game typically um however there has been an exception recently I told you I came home I have I've had no family for a week um and you know how I've T I've
probably talked to you about how usually I'm pretty good at time zone adjustments like I'm kind of the jet leg King in general and we've both actually usually been pretty good at that that's been necessary we sort of had to learn it early on a lot of Our Lives guys like some of those trips we did were just like such short turnarounds the Japan trip will always be legendary for them oh man we were in the country for like 30 hours or something that the I think the I think my most ridiculous one was
uh when um David and I did Germany Germany I remember this in like less than 48 it was I think it was under 48 Hours doorstep to doorstep or something like that I'd have to look up the travel logs maybe it wasn't quite that extreme but that included a full work day on the other side like it was absolutely nuts because because we were working during their work day so we were doing just wild stuff um anyway the point is that I'm usually pretty good at it and I can kind of plan things out and go okay yeah
here's how I'm going to get enough sleep that I can do a long go and then I can pass the F out at the right time and then wake up refreshed totally you also do some pre-preparation before the trip starts just start shifting your sleep schedule I don't have time for that I've done it before yeah I don't usually do it but I've done it before okay so on my way back from Japan um I was like okay so here's what I'm going to do I'm going to um hang out for a little bit I will I
will I will stay up for like three or four hours of the flight and then I'm going to sleep this the last half and then uh I'm going to get home I'm going to make it through the whole day because I was Landing in the morning and then I'll go to bed early I should be good  diver and then all of a sudden we landed in Vancouver yeah I was just gonna say have you played it at all no but I saw I saw you load it up on Steam but somehow steam like indicated to me that you were on a uh handheld yeah I was playing on
the Ally but I didn't I didn't I'm trying to remember how it even did that and I didn't realize that steam would indicate like what device the person was yeah that's weird I'm surprised of that but I knew you were on your ally because of something steam indicated to me I don't know how anyways I saw you load up Dave the diver and I asked you like how it was but you probably didn't see it cuz you were on the I was playing Dave the diver yeah but yeah so it's that good nothing else exists when you're
playing Dave the diver wow okay it's it's actually kind of mindblowing how much um just like they they kind of over it's it's like ano where there's always four things you need to be doing right now yeah five six did you did you forget about two get get on it like like it's ah um and the and the fishing is just like it it's way too satisfying it's there are some I'm F I'm probably about I've got about 12 hours in it and I am finding some stuff is getting a little bit tedious but I'm
already starting to see hints that travel is going to get a little faster and stuff and like the fishing for just like random fish for the restaurant is going to start to matter less and stuff like that but they just they just keep unlocking new gameplay mechanics and new stuff to strive for and you haven't even finished the last thing at all and they're they're throwing a new thing at you and you're like anyway yeah it's really good um which you guys didn't need me to tell you because it's that's
a that'sa yeah that's a very highly rated game yeah isn't it like not really indie or something like that like the team behind overwhelmingly positive with "almost 90,000 reviews yeah" um yeah I thought this was like yeah Nexon yeah yeah that's a pretty big deal yeah it has it has like that super kind of fun intimate Indie Vibe but there is so much content and so many like there's entire games that have been built within the game like it clearly Took a ton of work yeah that's awesome yeah really
good it's great I did a I filmed a fiplan exclusive this week uh which is like I don't know what the heck to title it but it's um it's my Starfield review where I talk about Starfield for I think it's like two sentences what how is that a video uh and I actually end up talking about like the gaming industry and like how everything was going down for a long time but how I don't think it's like actually that bad because I think we're at this part of the curve ooh inflection
point let's go yeah because Indies have been actually pretty good for pretty much the whole time there's been you know Indie like fantastic Indies that have trickled through pretty much the whole time but we're I think my whole thing is about how I think certain old companies are dying and we're seeing offshoots come out of those companies like um I don't want to spoil all of it but yeah I think it's actually pretty good you should check it out anyways topic new topic yeah I think Dan
just wandered away so I guess uh yeah we're on our own yeah you want to pick one Luke sure um oh on that subject why don't we talk about um the Xbox thing yeah why don't we talk about Phil Spencer's comments this week according to Chris during of gamesindustry.biz sources he spoke to at this year's games developer conference showed a clear lack of confidence in the future of Xbox insiders at two wait sorry I thought we were talking about Phil Spencer uh blaming capitalism for uh for everything
that's going wrong in the games industry yeah that's a fun one cuz that was no matter look no matter what side of you know is capitalism good or is capitalism bad or you know or whatever whatever Microsoft blaming capitalism is do genuinely hilarious yes the the irony is dripping off of this entire situation while they try to like gobble up everything in the AI industry so I can own it all I'm 100% here for it uh yeah yeah pretty great okay sorry go ahead anyways yeah insiders at two
companies told him that Xbox's performance in Europe is flatlining and many European retailers are cutting back on Xbox stocks uh Xbox stock not stocks in response to a significant slump in sales Publishers likewise are apparently reconsidering supporting the platform during likewise suggests that if these Trend sorry during during there yeah my eyes sucked I thought there was another ey before dring sorry dring um likewise suggest that if these Trends continue we may see a majority of Xbox
games also coming to PS5 Phil Spencer has acknowledged that the console Market is gradually shrinking even as gaming is growing as an industry see that's a funny thing can I pause for a second here yeah PC sales shrinking console sales shrinking game industry growing game industry growing mobile mile phones also shrinking really yeah like Apple's like are we going to sell iPhones more iPhones right now I think the Market's kind of saturated so basically this and no one has to I think
this Pursuit Of Constant growth is not  you are you are you in there became Phil I yeah it's it's I think we're at a market saturation point for a lot of this stuff I think no one has to replace PCS no one has to replace phones and no one really wants to replace consoles yeah and honestly they look pretty darn good you probably don't really need to anyways yeah what are you really going to gain at this point from a new generation of consoles uh for sure something but do
you want to spend $800 on it $900 on it  sorry go ahead anyways um yeah Phil Spencer yeah Phil Spencer has acknowledged that the console Market is gradually shrinking even as gaming industry is growing because gamers are more increasingly attracted to handheld and PC options Spencer even floated the idea of bringing third-party stores to the Xbox to make it more like a PC or exploring different Hardware form factors which many have speculated might be an illusion to a future XBox handheld
further Windows Central's jez cordin has claimed that Microsoft has an existing prototype for just such a handheld which would make sense can I just say that hon wouldn't be hard to do this is pretty much what I've been predicting for a really long time like you get to do the whole thing where you're right about stuff many many years in advance all the time you know what it's my turn it's my time to shine here because as soon as they went x86 I was like okay their computers now this is a
matter of time it look I think we're finally getting there and can I just say Microsoft if anyone's watching can you just rip off the Band-Aid now yeah I think that's been the whole problem because you've been right like they could have done this pivot even faster but they wanted to move to the platform and then not embrace it they keep and now they're sort of embracing it look they keep half-assing it you know it keeps okay games for Windows Live and we're going to no no we're like really going to focus on
P and we're and like with this new direct and the they like they they keep oh yeah we're g we're doing crossplay we're doing crossplay we're just do it ju just rip it off be a PC company do it and keep making Hardware keep making super affordable PCS but hey maybe the Xbox would be more competitive if your everything does everything Appliance actually did everything like oh I don't know a computer what if XBox became a certification like remember when they were trying so hard
to build the Xbox that you know what took over was was like the center of your living room and then remember when like just prior to that they had tried to do Media Center piece hello can the right hand just talk to the left hand and you could have done it yeah what remember when people were hacking the connect to hook it up to PCS and doing all kinds of really cool stuff with it way cooler than anything that existed on the Xbox would have been nice just do it Embrace Embrace anyone remember that
Meme Embrace these thank you thanks Shia um Embrace these handhelds because otherwise there this is actually a threat right now this is your chance Microsoft this is don't ignore the steam deck this is your chance and Xbox going it alone is not the way to go Windows already has the momentum just turn the Xbox into a store into a certification into a a realistically a game development Monopoly um because that's I I I just I don't think I don't think the hardware makes sense
anymore and I'm not saying that consoles are going anywhere I don't think Nintendo is going to be done making consoles in the next decade or two like they are they are they are just the kings of this is our this is my ball and this is where I play with it here in my wall garden and if you like it then you can come inside and play with me and if you don't like it then you can off that's you think they're more the kings of that than Apple uh oh yeah I think so interesting yeah yeah apple apple
contributes they did put like Mario run out and stuff like that yeah but Apple contributes in a big way to Industry standards in a way that I don't think that I'm necessarily convinced that Nintendo does that's a pretty good argument and and I'm not saying Nintendo doesn't do anything in that regard uh but Apple you got to remember like for all the for all the whining that we've done about how how long it's taken Apple to support USBC Apple shipped the first computer with a USBC port on it they freaking
co-invented the standard yeah like come on yeah that's what drives me so crazy about Apple is how capable they are of innovation yeah and how they just choose to do it in ways that are  so there's a really good question in here uh which is why doesn't Xbox already have a handheld um honestly I think that's quite Fair well you can only do so much though like something that's easy to forget I think is that Microsoft is a relative newcomer to the console game right so the the the the the handheld
the first handheld boom right was the Game Boy The Game Gear failed um like has been 23 years though it's been sure sure but like the handheld boom that that happened like the first one they were not a participant then I would say sort of your next Game Boy era we talking about yeah the first one and then Nintendo kind of was I mean they realistically like they were kind of half arsonate for a long time they were the only one I forget hold on Game Boy uh release date I guarantee you this
will surprise you a little bit okay April 1989 and the second generation of Game Boy was just the Game Boy Color it it just played Game Boy games um 1998 late 1998 it was n and a half years for them to go from the Game Boy to the Game Boy Color that actually does surprise me that's actually pretty wild which got color ized games but the graphics still sucked like it was it was sure it was better but it was not um it was not the kind of generational Improvement that you might expect in N9
and a half years these days um and then Nintendo has kind of like done its own thing in its own completely closed off Garden Sega failed to compete Sony had one moderate success with the PSP and then just tanked it with the Vita it was backlit it was not back lit Game Boy Color was not back lit I know yeah Game Boy Color was backlit no I think so no  on Game Boy Color backlight screen replacement kit thing that you can buy to make it a backlit oh no yeah you're right not backlit it is not backlit yeah
that's right yeah no it like it like wasn't that much better I yeah I forgot about that part even yeah yeah cuz you used to have like do you remember the monstrosities that people would the front lights the magnetizers the speakers like people used to have crazy accessories for Game Boy colors it was actually wild you had like a whole case I have one of the original like Game Gear cases with a whole bunch of kind sick actually uh yeah the Game Boy advanced was the was the first um
Nintendo handheld with an integrated backlight so uh GBA release date here we go so that wouldn't be until June of 2001 so basically hold on the first Game Boy Advance had a backl are you sure that I actually don't know I the SP the like weirder looking Advanced okay yeah oh uh yes the so I don't think that one it's like the it's like the the flippy one no it wasn't until 2005 that the SP got a backl it was a revised SP so it wasn't even the first so from 1989 to 2005 years just to get a backlit
screen it wasn't moving that fast um anyway my point is that who was Microsoft supposed to look at and go yeah this is this great idea this is a great idea for us to pursue because remember having a mobile console is not like having a mobile version of your console it is a completely separate platform that requires completely separate game development like games used to come out for the Genesis and for the Game Gear like you can buy Aladdin for the Genesis and buy Aladdin for the Game Gear those
are completely different games 100% different games different assets different levels different absolutely everything and so for Microsoft to to split their forces and be battling on two fronts might not have made sense when they're looking at basically everyone else and everything else that has existed in the space and going okay is the total addressable market for this actually so big that it makes sense for us to get involved in this and I think that now now that it's just a PC and it runs all the same
titles well all of a sudden okay now that that does make sense because we don't have to develop completely new games for this and in fact thank you Nintendo a lot of really mobile friendly controller friendly games since 1989 have been developed that people who you know wear eye patches can enjoy on our PC yeah and that's that doesn't have to be official but if it's a PC I don't know whatever people are running whatever software they want I don't know so no I think it's a I think it's a
really good time but I think that they need to just embrace the windows of it and just make Windows really good at this because that's all the original Xbox was damn it is it was a windows that was really good at running games invest some more developer power into Windows store and like Xbox store whatever different well because it's you want more Windows store yeah actually interesting okay I want it to be better that's that's my frustration is like when they're forcing it into things like I I wanted to
download uh last night if you don't know what that is uh it's called something else now no it's not well it is and it's well okay they they're a little less oh wow I went to I I actually also downloaded this recently and um it was g New Image manipulation program and I only saw the name later oh okay well anyway yeah know it's front and center on the site I didn't go to the site because I was um I was installing it on Linux oh we've got a really fun video coming uh that's like
my thing this show is teasing all the really good videos we have coming uh I tried uh the team got together 10 weird Linux dros for me to try oh that's actually pretty fun yeah Temple OS uh no that's not Linux oh yeah no Temple OS is Temple OS that's good it should just put in as like a I think what you're referring to as Temple OS is in fact um Temple Colonel with okay I don't know I can't even forget it um anyways I was downloading that and I didn't know if I had it or not
already fairly recently got that new computer so like I might not have certain programs that I would normally have so I just typed press start and typed it just to see if it would show up and what showed up was the Windows store link for it oh and I would like to actually just be like yeah cool but I don't trust it because Windows store has always been a piece of jun oh my God so I went and downloaded it manually anyways did you see the um did you see the subreddit want it to be
wanted me to use Bing for a month oh I was considering it until I accidentally did a Bing search for something earlier this week because uh can't be that much worse than where Google's at these days um get ready to be surprised okay because we needed we needed some pictures of Elijah for some reason okay and he was like oh okay let me transfer them from my phone to and I'm like dude you're a celebrity at this point how hard could it be to find a picture of Elijah online no no no no no I'll don't
worry I got you no I want to show comparison no no I've got them both okay okay so I was like okay we'll type your name and then just to make it easy I'll put my name sure because that works really well from from my previous experience finding someone who works at Linus Tech tips with the name whatever it is that you type so bloody H images huh this is Bing so some RG rig reboot thing whatever this is whatever this is um me because apparently the first thing I typed is not important uh yeah that
um we make our way into peanuts uh we've got shirtless me nice we've got some other LTT staff nice nice seriously not a single bloody picture of someone named Elijah who's associated with someone named lonus okay not a one now for a live demonstration of why what I typed in is  [Laughter] stupid Elijah horer lonus mediate Elijah Elijah Elijah Elijah Elijah his face doesn't even showing this one yeah really Elijah r/ L does Bing even index Reddit like what are you  doing wild utterly
unusable absolutely wild actually unusable that's unfortunate you know what's funny is if you go back to the text search just the search his Wikipedia page comes up or whatever LinkedIn page LinkedIn page there it is that's not Elijah but it's the r team page but it's the r team page which is which is going to be on yeah so hold on so if you don't image search it it actually gives you images better yes so we managed to find the first two results are actually Elijah uh okay who is lonus Media Group
yeah yeah so yeah yeah yeah got it got it we know about lus Med Elijah Elijah okay picture maybe picture yeah so if if it just like use the normal search uh algo more or something I don't know I don't know and grabed some images off of the pages they served up to us like it's done a better job it's embarrassingly bad it is inconceivably bad how is it even possible for that to be that bad that's pretty frustrating it's worse than it is I've like like it it knows and it just is
like I've just like ended up on being a couple times and the search has actually been fairly okay and the search right there was actually fairly okay but I've never use the images portion and that was that was garbage yeah it's terrible actual actual garbage meanwhile I'm supposed to you know expect to you know AIS to freaking make appointments for me and like sure uh oh boy um Qualcomm yeah oh we should probably do sponsors hey Dan oh D Dan was going to tell us to do sponsors he's on it dude he's on

yeah really it's Luke's fault honestly yeah I should inform her better of all of our sponsorship that is I I fully agree uh yeah y that's on you I'll do better thanks um what are we supposed to be doing right now oh three merch messages all right Dan hit us with some merch messages I'm trying to find them there's so many hey lonus how we were to do that one get the hell out of here hey lmg team been rocking some new LTT gear recently and figured I'd grab some more are there any consumer level products
and that lonus and Luke are especially excited for in Tech excited for excited for Consumer products I mean man I've been pretty into like big TVs lately yeah high sense has that one coming that's it's 5 Ines smaller than the TCL but it's double the number of dimming zones and double the peak brightness I think that I it's funny we we did that video um earlier this week on nvidia's HDR conversion uh so they take SDR content and then they just use like their their um neural processor on their
G GPU and they remap it to an HDR uh so like a wider gamut and with um uh and they add I don't know if they actually add the metadata so they're just yeah they're just converting it to the wider um color space and um and then remapping uh um the brightnesses so Bas basically they're just doing like on the Fly tone mapping from SDR to HDR um according to the capabilities of your display so it's like it's super cool and there's problems with it like it kind of Best Buy effects things sometimes overs
saturates things um and you lose a little bit of artist intent sometimes but overall I think I would watch most things with it rather than without it it's pretty cool and um by the way some people commented on the side by side that we did saying we were using different monitors we know that uh the reason that we didn't address it in the video is because it didn't matter they both use the same panel and they were both checked by Brandon Dickerson ahead of time to make sure that their
performance was close enough that that wasn't what we were seeing I just thought I'd clarify that anyway um I was surprised by how many of the comments on that video were still from people who think that HDR is like not real like it's snake oil it doesn't matter um what we could just everything could just be SDR and you could just like turn up the brightness and it would be it's not guys it the display has to be capable of it the content has to be graded for it uh it it is not snake oil it oh apparently
we did acknowledge that they were different monitors okay well apparently we didn't give enough background because people still seemed very confused about  um but yes yes it is totally a thing thank you djore spark over on float plane and the better it gets I think the more people will realize that it's totally a thing and that's why I was so excited about RTX video HDR or whatever their stupid branding for it is got to throw RTX on everything now I guess um whatever The Branding is that's why I
was so excited about that technology because it unlocks this enormous back catalog of content that people can enjoy on HDR devices and you know what it actually made me think about that I kind of wish we had included in the video but I didn't really think about until now is I wish Nvidia had pulled it off in phones remember their Super Phone concept yeah um I would actually love it if the kind of machine learning accelerated upscaling for example or frame interpolation or um SDR to HDR tone
mapping or whatever else like all this Tech that they're building and in fact have built even on arm platforms man like they got the Nvidia Shield if I could buy a phone that was a modern Nvidia Shield in a phone form factor I would strongly consider it me too and phones have like very few compelling things these days yeah but it's that would be nice they happen to be in for most people I would think the best screen in your house like unless you are a a unless your family has a media
Enthusiast um who gets significant access to the budget you probably don't have a TV or a monitor that is a better display than the one that's built on to you know any phone that's come out in the last two or three years they're so bright they're so accurate um B basically any iPhone from the last few years is going to be an outstanding HDR display and if just everything you watched on your phone was automatically converted to HDR I think it would really help people understand how good it can
be even if you know the upscaled stuff is or upcon converted stuff is not as good as if it was graded properly for HDR in the first place so overall I I I'm I'm a Believer um display Tech yeah there that's what I'm going to say uh some of the the super high refresh rate oleds lately we're going to be checking out LG's dual mode one soon so it's the 120 HZ or sorry uh one yeah 240 HZ 4K 480 HZ 1080P and the big question that I have is sorry what exactly is different about this right because you could
have uh you know a um you you could have a a a a monitor and run it at a non-native resolution you could have a monitor and you could run it at half of its native refresh rate and to be clear there are differences there there's a reason that this is being differentiated from things we could do that with before but that's something that I want to kind of dive into and it seems to have to do with the way that the reporting to your GPU Works uh the way they're handling scaling uh
Brandon Dickerson and plof are are working on it so I'm pretty excited about that one yeah I uh when you were originally saying TVs I was going to say monitors yeah so that kind of rips it I don't think there's any individual component in a computer that the future of it is hyper exciting to me um phones are not exciting to me yeah storage was super cool for a bit and now it just seems to be CPUs were really exciting there for a while as well that joke bites that's pretty good ah ah
um he has no Bell there's nothing he can  um he tried to whack a piece of metal yeah um but yeah I I don't think I think it's displays for  up dear or Oran Luke and Dan what's the worst thing a company has tried to pull on lmg oo I've had a lot of uh corporate software salespeople try to mess with us just like increase our rates or cut our service or what or just just the the the bamboozler sales tactics are always the ones that that mess with me we had one recently I'll keep everything Anonymous
but we had one recently where um they gave us a price they like they sent us a here is all of your costs thing and we talked to them the next time and they were like so there was a pricing they were like all right what what are the like sticking points and like uh is like is price one of your sticking points and I'm like well yeah because it will be even if it's like it's just it's just going to be what do you mean price always matters yeah like there's no such thing as a bad
product just a bad price so you can kind of solve anything by making it cheap enough yeah so I was like well yeah of course um and they're like okay well I'll tell you now our price increased so I I'll go to bat for you I'll talk to my boss I'll try to get you that price that we originally quoted you I'm like on your side I'm going to put my I'm going to put my job on the side for you guys to get you that price that we already told you and I was like yeah I can't stand that kind of
thing that doesn't count yeah that's the bare that's the bare minimum expectation is that you honor your word yeah so I don't know that was pretty annoying uh the other one was that same company said that they wouldn't be able to onboard if we didn't sign by the end of this month they wouldn't be able to onboard us until December and it's a software  sure I told them on the call I was like that's like that's amazing because if that's true I'm sure you guys are like your stock is going through the absolute
roof and you're hiring as hard as you possibly can and all these other kind of things and you just see them like squirming because it's like no they're just doing like fine which means they don't have a year long backlog like it's I I don't know it's just so basically skey sales tactics yes drives me nuts I think um I think I get most I get most offended when people don't act in good faith um and and show Integrity um I the weird the weird part for me just to interject is I've had the skey sales
tactics but once signed most of the companies have actually been fine to to me at least so basically you just hate sales people and like account managers customer success managers all these things just get me to like the technical people when I need help let me know when you release new features I need nothing else please never talk to me just like just I don't care I don't care that your company revolving doors sales people like crazy so you tell me that you will now be my agent for till the end of time
and then 3 months later I need to introduced to a new person and I get an email saying hi I'm onboarded to this account could we have a could we have a call so I can come up to speed and I say no I feel so bad I have never once replied to our twitch representative yeah but you've probably had 15 over the years I don't know I don't even know I don't even read their names at this point I just I don't need anything from Twitch TV I uh I I I remember this one time that our rep
blessed their heart I'm um let me know they were going to be on vacation I was like okay cool we've never spoken so yeah I don't think anything's going to come up in the next however long you're going to wherever you're going AJ whoever you are AJ's seen it enough from me at this point that um I didn't even have to catch one fairly recently we got an email from like the literally I'm not exaggerating at least like 12th or 13th rep that we've had from this one company um and I didn't even get to the email
first he got to it and was like yeah we we're not going to do a call here's like the current state of everything here's the things that like we've been asking you to fix for a year and a half let us know if there's any traction on that yeah have a good one um like I sorry dude they're like yeah just let us know like how things are going and if if there's new ways we can work with you and it's like there isn't we know all your software offerings they're great to be honest
they're totally fine I have no problem we're not going anywhere like we're not leaving we're not increasing our spend do our checks do our checks clear yeah they do sounds good good yeah like I don't know all right just please don't waste my time um space gamer04 in float plane chat says as a Salesman you should hate us and I don't like you got to do your job right I don't know that's fine yeah but just do it to someone else I just I don't want to deal with it and my thing
is I I understand you got to play the game to a certain degree just the the like recognize that I'm not buying it just let's just real talk yeah and if you're like I don't have any play and I try to fight you on a little bit and you're like yeah no sorry like XYZ like then we'll be like okay then we'll use something else then we'll either use something else or not and we can go from there like I just I don't I don't I don't want to deal with this and I make it very clear I'm like not going to
engage in that thing the some people will respond to it and some people the whole car dealership I'm going go talk to my manager about this thing just like I'm not doing that dude all you're doing is slowing down this transaction that is quite literally the only thing you're accomplishing right now yeah it just doesn't work yeah um and I understand it sucks and you have to deal with people like me all the time which probably isn't the greatest but my whole thing is I just want to end this call as soon as
possible yeah I I have other things to do we've had sponsors not pay us um yeah that's that's pretty yucky we we don't generally like we don't generally um air that kind of dirty laundry in public so it's not the kind of thing we've really talked about but yeah we we've we've had companies just like totally skis out on us um trying to trying to think like I I'm pretty unhappy with one of our merch suppliers right now I'm I'm not going to name them yet because there's still time
for them to act in good faith and I think that's the biggest one is acting in good faith yeah you're going to screw up here or there yeah making legitimate efforts to recogniz to identify problems and take responsibility and rectify them that's all I really ask for anyone effort means a lot to me I had uh I had one very recently with a company where they uh they just like completely shut off our service out of nowhere and it was like really important that that service keeps running
and I was like what the heck uh and we ended up figuring out that it was for a uh like the credit card didn't renew and I was like shouldn't you have notified me in some way and then I found that they did the subject line of the email was exactly the same as another like just normal transactional email that goes all the way goes through all the time and it was like buried many lines in as a single line thing like there what are you even talking about and I got on a call with them and they
just apologized and we're like how do you think we could improve this communication I told them and then they didn't do exactly that but they did very close to that enough that it's fine and I'm like okay so I'm not even mad anymore yeah whatever yeah they fixed it really quick yep they got on a call with me they found a new solution so that it won't happen again they did it we just move forward people are going to screw up we're going to screw up they're going to screw up it's fine funny hats asks if
it was the aura ring or uring I can't I still can't remember how to pronounce the thing um no no no no no that that was that was uh that was a just it didn't work out um but they they didn't stiff us or anything uh or I mean I don't think they paid but like I did pronounce the thing wrong and our proposed solution wasn't acceptable and whatever um I I think that they're a little uptight but you know that okay that's fine and they probably think that you know I'm a bit of a PR so I don't
sure fine um that just didn't work out but there's been brands that we 100% have executed and then they just have ghosted um yeah no that one that one was definitely just not not every not every partnership is meant to work out perfectly and you know what hey we I'd be open to working with them again whether they'd want to work with us again or not I don't know but like it just didn't it just didn't work  all right you want another one yeah uh are there certain types of games that
although don't contain mature content you still prefer your kids don't get into until they're older also is it Financial advice to get a Chevy Volt um I don't think the Chevy Volt is as necessary as it used to be I mean Toyota finally has Prius primes that are close for for range um I read a really funny comment on on a like this article was just fading the new Prius Prime and the top comment on this article was like good job Toyota you invented the 2017 Chevy Vault um congratulations um meanwhile Chevy
uninvented it good good job everyone honestly at least Toyota brought it back give props for that yeah exactly um yeah now that plug-in hybrids are taking off I would say that the Chevy Volt is not a necessary move unless you're looking to get a deal on a used car that is a good plug-in hybrid I was so happy with mine you know I read an article recently talking about how uh certain governments and stuff sorry one sec people are correcting me because they um I don't know what it is people people
like correcting me I'm aware that the Chevy Volt has been out since 2010 uh I'm talk talking about the generation that actually had decent range yeah yeah come on now um I I read an article I don't remember what it was I think it was government's I don't remember what but apparently uh the fuel efficiency of plugin hybrids is performing lower than expected because people are driving them on gas more than they had hoped I have a theory on that oh really um when driving around residential areas you see how
many people are parked on the road there's no Chargers on the road I think in a lot of situations it's like multi families where they only have one spot where they can plug in and if they two plugin hybrids though like a pure electric if they have a pure electric they they might be able to charge the plug-in hybrid at work or certain other places so they can get some charge out of it both of your cars would have to be like within the last five years for you to have like a full electric and a plugin
hybrid what kind of families have two relatively new cars that seems kind of crazy is a model three release date this is going to be annoying because it doesn't show all of them no yeah it's gonna show um Travis social says it's really really common in the states for people in apartments to not have a charging option at all that's a really good point um so in cities my place we have one slow charge that's so in cities where plug-in hybrids are the most useful because you're doing just your
like little trips on on electric power those are the places where you are least likely to have garage parking um yeah yeah definitely definitely see that the good news is that they still are a pretty solid uh they still are a pretty solidly efficient you know just hybrid car they just are carrying around a bit of extra battery weight and electric motors and stuff which sort of blows but uh it's not like they're carrying nearly nearly as much battery as a as a full battery
electric vehicle uh fohn asks don't you have a newer Porsche and a newer minivan uh Min Van's a 2016 I don't know that's that doesn't I hav't really seen that new so so the so yeah let's go let's go car car history it's car history time so I had uh I had a 2003 Civic and then I had a uh a 2017 volt we got the minivan around that time no no no because I got the 2017 volt later it was used so we bought a new 2016 Honda Odyssey then I got a 2017 volt uh in like 2019 or yeah it must have been
2019 uh something like that and then I  um so yeah at one point we would have owned two relatively new cars when in 20 uh 2019 we had the Odyssey and the volt but not both electric and uh or and plug-in Hy hbd and stuff like that and they were like those were very different Vehicles so it's not like we had um you know like a couple commuter cars or something like that and they were like both new we have a we have a neighbor where they both appear to drive the exact same car in exactly the same color
whoa yeah I know right they're always both part in their Drive throw me off at least like get different colors yeah I know right it's pretty funny like I mean I guess it's nice to be aligned like that in your relationship it's like yeah we're basically the same person do you differentiate between them by license plate yeah I guess so oh that's annoying um model 3s have been getting delivered in MOS since 2018 yes but um think it might be more common than like five years ago no it's not that it
2018 that's six years ago we're barely into 2004 we're a quarter in it's like five and a half years are you really I am close without  I think you're over what no I I said five years yeah and you said five and a half right there yeah exactly so I didn't go over oh but you're aiming the other Direction come on come on what are people talking about come on no I said 20 so didn't I say 2023 tyan did did I say 2003 you said 2004 instead of 2024 when you were talking about current year
don't worry about it it was a different thing you weren't talking about the tyan did I say 2004 yeah I MD on you for it it's fine we're already passed that it's okay it's okay uh Dan hit us another one I'm still jet leg okay something wrong with lonus I'm all right I'm back hey lldd lonus with Junior getting close what sorry apparently you also did say 2003 tyan I didn't notice that sure it's pretty old let's go it's like four years ago it's it's a good year for taan really well
fine wine all right lus with Junior getting close to the legal age for it do you think you'll H let him have social media opinions on this which ones and how will you keep him safe on them he's a really sharp kid um I think that moderation is extremely important uh I think learning it is extremely important I think just shielding kids from everything is uh is not the way to help them learn to manage their own behaviors with all of that  uh like knowing what you know about how
the user experience of something like X goes yeah I there's no way that I would sign off on X I mean there's nothing I could do to stop him at a certain point but there's no way I'd be like yeah you should definitely have Twitter is it really that much better than an Instagram I also just don't I don't know if he'll care um he's on Discord so he's on social media right like Discord effectively is at this point you can find enormous servers that are like social focused yeah essentially um and I
think that Discord is probably the closest thing to where I started on social media like I started on chat rooms and MSN it's basically Discord right if you think about it um you you go into different rooms and you talk about stuff and you can share pictures and and I would say that compared to a lot of the more traditional social media platforms because we are using it is social media but we're using Discord being social media a little bit more Loosely than most people normally would um I I think
it's probably the lesser of the evil ones and when you're just thinking about like your kid engaging with the internet yeah because it's it's Le it's not algorithmically driven right it's driven by people and communities that you have explicitly chosen to engage with yes and I so anything with a anything with a discovery element and and maybe that's where people are getting a little upset at me calling Discord social media even um but I think that's that um so so if we were to say okay yeah it has to have
a discovery algorithm in order for you to classify it as social media then I guess my answer is no I I can't think of any good reason for a young kid to be on Instagram I can't think of a good reason for them to be on Twitter it's totally social media guys guys uh Discord yeah I mean do you want to read us the Wikipedia definition wikip is the be all and end all yeah but still it's it just just because it doesn't it's not like fully I don't know uh social media are interactive technologies that facilitate
the creation sharing and aggregation of content ideas interests and other forms of expression through virtual communities and networks social media refers to new forms of media that involve uh interactive participation while challenges to the definition of social media arise to the variety of standal Lo and built-in social media Services currently available there are some common features okay here we go I didn't read this bit social media apps are online platforms that enable users to create and share
content and participate in social networking absolutely user generated content such as text posts or comments digital photos or videos and data generated through all online activities or sorry interactions is the lifeblood of social media absolutely users create service specific profiles for the website or app that are designed and maintained by the social media organization absolutely social media helps the development of online social networks by connecting users profile with those of other individuals or
groups yeah okay so Discord is social media yeah I know people saying I think in conversation most people refer to yeah I just said that most people when they're referring to social media they're going to mean not this but I still think Discord is a form of it yeah so um so he's on social media um but I think that um no poll you're wrong yeah I think that I think that I would treat something like Tik Tok the same way that I would treat something like TV if I was still making rules
about it I'd basically say okay is that how you want to use your X number of minutes of screen time today and I would like to think that that answer would be no a lot of the time and that some moderation could be learned around those behaviors um but we'll see guys I mean like everyone is human it turns out and humans are humans are messy right like I don't expect like oh yeah I'm going to you know raise my kids to you know have perfect you know the ability to uh and then they're going to Rebel moderate
their usage or whatever and it's like yeah exactly right like they either fail or they Rebel my kids are going to make mistakes they're going to have vices if if the worst they manag is like Doom scrolling on Tik Tok sometimes I think I pulled it off as a parent so we'll see how it goes that is fair I think that has actually kind of like ruined people though to be honest I mean sure yeah fair enough but in like really bad ways have you heard of you heard have you heard of the going Goblin mode thing
I've heard of goblin mode I forget what it means it's just people just degenerate into they all all they do is just scroll things cuz they're hooked on the new content dopamine Loop they're so depleted of dopamine from the new content dopamine Loop that they have no drive to do anything um yeah it gets bad it's bad I don't think that means you have to like completely ban yourself forever but I think it's a good opportunity to teach them about like self-limiting and using uh limiting apps and stuff like that
even the bull crap Google one it's like oh you you just hit your five limit your 5 minute limit do you want to press literally two buttons to completely delete it forever I don't mean I don't mean pause it what Luke what do you want to be accountabil buddies how does that work we're going to create minor Google accounts and we're going to set each  parent we can actually limit app usage we could try it for a month I think I'd be down I think i' be down I think I'd be down I think I'd be down I'm trying to
think cuz you're telling me you want actual limits that you can't bypass on your own I'm a good boy about it and I don't do it though I actually don't have any but I I know people that I've talked to that can't do that I don't have any limited apps right now uh I had Twitter limited and now it is deleted I had to yeah so I'm just like that's that's a good way to go I just kind of I've kind of had enough of it I'll I'll sit down and I'll I I post once in a while and like I'll I'll check
if anyone's dead like that's the only reason I know about the whole P didy thing right now it's the only reason I know that Beyonce released a new song or album it was something I didn't have time to find out what it was but she's a big deal right now again um but so so like it's it's kind of how I keep up with my celeb gossip uh particularly the online Creator celeb gossips like yeah who's been like canceled recently or whatever else uh but I'll just check in on it when I'm on my desk top and that's
it if it's not on my phone it's way easier for me to moderate I probably spend more time in our Shopify dashboard than I do on Twitter now so that's sort of work sort of I don't need to look at that report it's mostly just cuz I'm like Curious I think I think you have some uh I don't think these are things that he would run into but I I I think that you are kind of I think it's beyond necessity I think you are kind of addicted to reading all forms of feedback that the company has yeah
however um everyone has something however and that has a major benefit there's been yeah as far as vices go yeah um I'm not I'm not even trying to dog you I just what do you even like like really yeah yeah you know okay perfect example of that is I was sending I showed Luke this um at the beginning of the show today oh because I just like I can't help I can't help but read things um hold on I'm gonna try to I'm I would screenshot I've got the I've got an easy way to do it I will just create
a notepad window and then I'll why s tool it well because that's more work than this see look I'm already done no it's not you would have been boom um so I just like I read stuff like this this person lost their posting privileges on the channel by the way uh this was on the high availability wanic video the most ironic thing about this video is it's like a new groundbreaking technology as far as Linus is concerned but as someone whose background is in it I know that things like high
availability clustered storage clusters Hardware resiliency Etc have been the standard for well over a decade and is nothing new or groundbreaking so this isn't this isn't a troll this is just someone whose opinion clearly could never possibly matter about anything because they just don't they just don't get it they just don't get that life is not about how much smarter you are than everyone in the room and it's Tech has existed before you have to think it's boring and
old you're presenting it you have to be the most cynical dry insufferable bore yeah so I mean we're doing a high availability upgrade but like this has been around forever just like everybody does and maybe go watch some other video or something it's boring come with us we're just going to plug stuff in like whatever none of this is new about it yeah yeah they lost their posting  um it's yeah it's just it's it's wild dude like I just I can't I am I I do think I'm also happy with this new Arc
of lonus just ban hammering everybody though I think it's better because before the really negative stuff it just gets absorbed to a certain degree even even if you're good at like kind of ignoring it a certain amount of it gets absorbed and then now there's like there is actually less of it yeah it's amazing how noticeable it's been in a sea of millions of people how few actual completely brain dead people who type this kind of stuff exist yeah and they make so much noise like it's it's
actually incredible how loud this minority of people who can't possibly conceive of any any anything that could possibly be happening other than how much smarter they are than whatever whoever else are looking at or talking to like it's just like it's it's actually amazing that they couldn't think of any other reason for what was going on for this video that was being made other than that I had never heard of high availability yeah and how amusingly irony is what are you even talking about oh
boy if I call you a narcissist I'm afraid you got to take the  oh boy uh I want to do speaking of taking the L I'm going to find a topic that works for that um I don't know if we have one well I'm going to talk about this anyways Sora goes to Hollywood open AI uh ties to break in tries reading uh open AI tries to break into the entertainment industry open ey has scheduled meetings in Los Angeles to form partnership in the entertainment industry according to sources speaking
to Bloomberg not only does the AI firm have meetings next week but those meetings are just the latest round of Outreach from open aai in recent weeks the weekend of the Oscars CEO Sam Alman was apparently attending La parties late last month openai coo Brad light cap demonstrated the capabilities of Sora the company's unreleased AI video generator during introductory conversations in Hollywood one person who may have seen one of light Cap's demonstrators is actor filmmaker and Studio owner Tyler Perry
after spending four years planning an speaking of people whose movies could be made by sorry o Get Wrecked um after spending four years planning on an $800 million expansion of his Atlanta Studio those plans are now indefinitely on hold because of Sora Barry believes AI may take the place of set building and on location shooting saying sora's capabilities uh saying of sora's capabilities if I wanted to have two people in the living room in the mountains I don't have to build a set in the
mountains you already didn't uh I don't have to put a set on my lot I uh I can sit in an office and do this with a computer Perry warns of the effect of AI like Sora can have on jobs and the entertainment industry and Beyond acknowledging that all the construction workers and contractors expecting to work on his Studio expansion are now out of a job even though Sora isn't publicly available Bloomberg claims open aai has granted access to a few big name actors and  yep cool I kind of feel like it was a
scapegoat to not have to spend $800 million on an expansion does Tyler Perry have $800 million I don't know it's it's one of those things where like okay I've talked about this before where because I'm someone who's had these articles written about them I know how inaccurate those net worth of SBS articles are have you seen his Mansion though I haven't does Tyler Perry have a sick Mansion dude let's see it bring it up here we go dude that is a sick Mansion does it have a helipad I mean
I'm sure you could land on this lawn somewhere there's this this right here I wonder if I can get close to it Tyler Perry is this rich so I don't know all right there you go Tyler Perry has $800 million probably then look at this Garden I'm having a hard time where does it go to this right here yeah do you see how there's like a circle is that the hel here as far as my understanding goes under this house I could be completely wrong I could be completely wrong I want to preface this
a lot as far as my understanding goes under this portion of the house is a enormous garage like 100 200 Cars something like that wow yeah okay so where I was going with that I could be totally wrong I don't was as someone who's had those articles written about me I know how inaccurate they are like when they when when people started talking about Taylor Swift being worth a billion dollars I was like please Taylor Swift was worth a billion dollars a long ass time ago like you guys got no
idea like I am nothing I am a tiny ant under Taylor Swift's heel okay and I know what my company's worth brother yeah like come on yeah I you want to know the thing that blew my mind the most yeah uh I heard that you know Tyler Perry had canceled the 800 million doll expansion of his Studios and I was like how does he re what has he done since friends that what I thought it was Matthew Perry I was so confused oh too the reason why I know about that house oh yeah I actually forgot about that
part yeah I did not remember that uh the reason why I knew about that house was because you a disaster I Googled Tyler Perry CU I was like what do you mean and then uh the actual Tyler Perry came up and I was like oh oh my bad and then I was like wait this is a ridiculous property why would you even like want this and then poked into it for a second  go anyways well hey at least I didn't have to say the worst thing on the show this I'm just being honest about something that happened okay all right all
right sometimes it's better not to yeah uh is Bitcoin a Beanie Baby says no a judge has ruled that the SEC can proceed to trial in its lawsuit against coin base for engaging in unregistered sales of financial securities the suit is potentially extremely damaging not only for coinbase but for crypto as a whole because if a ruling decides that cryptocoins are in fact a form of financial security this would mean that they would be subject to the same regulations as all other
securities oh boy coinbase has argued that cryptocurrencies are not Securities on the grounds that the buyer doesn't gain any rights like they do when they buy stocks and they are Collectibles analogous to beanie babies cryptocoins have coin right in the name yeah they are um they probably should be a security they they are they are definitely I don't know enough about this at all they are definitely purchased with the understanding that their value could go up which is from my
understanding the main thing that makes something um subject to these same to subject to these laws um yeah that is boy that is tough someone in chat coinbase by the way yeah that's pretty good it's pretty good I don't think there's a ton else to say about that yeah not much other than uh it's going to be an interesting time in crypto right cuz it's there's a big rally going on right now that's true uh "Bitcoin has I think over $70,000 us" right now so it's it's near it's near
Peak value right now and it's been kind of riding up for quite some time uh I think some there's some there's some coins that are profitable to mine on gpus right now like it's a crypto boom is either happening or it's or it's threatening to happen again and I'm just kind of I'm watching from the outside this time man I've got I haven't touched since of my money stolen by quadriga I think oh yeah very fun yeah he's still salty I am uh speaking of salty meta spied on users Snapchat traffic Facebook
apparently used to have a secret program called project Ghostbusters okay uh where it got it where it got its subsidiary onavo onavo sure to create software for IOS and Android to intercept and decrypt users web traffic from particular subdomains first from Snapchat then later from Amazon and YouTube wild the documents were unveiled as part of Discovery in a class action lawsuit accusing meta of using deceptive practices to collect user information well that's definitely one of them the
project began in 2016 when Facebook was looking to gain more insight into how users were interacting with rival companies it ended in 2019 around the time that on onavo was shut down following the revelation that they'd been secretly paying teenagers to use their VPN like Facebook research service so they could gain invasive access to their user data and web activity 20 bucks a month 20 bucks a month nice well it seems that Facebook asked users for permission to install the interception
software some within the company questioned whether or not users truly understood the ramifications of what they were installing yeah Pedro kah haati uh Facebook's then head of security engineering wrote an email I can't think of a good argument for why this is okay which honestly when you're asking stuff like that internally like good on Pedro uh yeah I want to shout that out yeah I mean did he stop it I mean it's it's publicly known now yeah I mean he's not there now so hold on a second Let's uh
let's find out when he left Facebook I'm going to find out uh I'm going to bang   2021 uh blah blah blah hold on Facebook okay uh he said he could probably write a book about the lessons he learned during his Facebook tenure uh it's probably fair to say he could have left Facebook for any number of big tech companies blah blah blah okay 12 years at Facebook okay so uh so he bailed how long after this we don't know he started though uh we don't we we don't know that that's the first opportunity he took we
also don't know that he took that opportunity immediately after leaving Facebook that's true I think we still don't know when he left yeah I seems like he was still there while they were doing that anyway um I mean we can't go after absolutely everyone who doesn't blow the whistle on things people have all kinds of pressures on them and can end up complic complicit in all kinds of things whether they uh whether they realize it at the time or not or you know whatever the case may
be I I'm just we shouldn't be we shouldn't shouldn't be too judgmental that's all I'm trying to say it's pretty stunning to me that companies are allowed to exist after doing stuff like that uh Amazon gives a peak into its anti-counterfeiting fight according to a recent Amazon report the company blocked over "700,000 suspicious attempts to create" seller accounts and nabbed over 7 million counterfeit counterfeit products last year this is up from 2 million in 2020 they they attribute the increase to
increased verification requirements for seller accounts and Partnerships with Brands and law enforcement all around the world including from major sources of counterfeit Goods like China so um yeah I guess this is good I don't remember actually signing I I don't remember saying that we were going to talk about this but that's good I guess so keep it up Amazon yeah except that Amazon's a complete show trying to shop for anything so I don't know it's got a lot worse I used to search for products
almost exclusively on Amazon and then potentially buy them elsewhere once I found the one that I actually wanted and that is no longer the case yeah now you're better off typing it into Bing yeah um Qualcomm has essentially created a a very similar uh translation layer for Windows on arm according to Qualcomm most x86 x64 Windows games with will just work on Snapdragon X Elite laptop processors due to an extremely efficient emulation layer similar to valve's proton the company also apparently
invited several members of the press and influencers to try an early demo of the hardware running 2019s control 2022 is redout 2 and balers Gate 3 results were promising but mixed the demo for walers Gate 3 appears to have been aimed for a target of medium settings at 1080p 30 FPS but dipped as low as 21 FPS in footage taken from the event and it was also restricted to the game's opening sequence which takes place in an enclosed area rather than the open world map yeah However the fact that it's
working at all is cool is a pretty solid indication that it is it going to happen this time is Windows on arm finally going to happen when did the Surface RT come out cuz I feel like that was in like 220 hold on let me think 2011 okay let's see Surface RT release I guess it's 2014 damn 2012 well you were closer to me Clos going over below yeah I'm just salty because he beat me at a similar price guessing game earlier today and I should not have won I'm very upset I'm like extremely upset like
going to crush you at Super checks tonight upset I need Vengeance it's so late it's not that late it's 945 yeah but only it's not like my family is here and I have anywhere to go oh that's what's going on okay I understand are you are you do you have no plans this weekend then they're coming home tomorrow morning oh okay I got lots of plans this weekend all right all right I going to say we should ano oh I mean yeah yeah we're not going to have that much time after merch messages and super
checks he's goingon to say super checks yeah all right okay I can't explain why that's annoying but okay uh speaking of annoying uh we're sinking Luke we are you want me to do it again do you mind y um okay why don't I do another topic real quick while Luke uh unsyncs us um Florida has banned kids from social media Florida has passed a new law Banning kids under 10 from social media and requiring teens ages 14 and 15 to obtain parental permission before creating an account it's likely
that the law will be met with significant legal challenges because it requires age verification to access social media which critics argue is a substantial burden on both adults and minor First Amendment rights to free speech and free assembly similar laws in Utah and Arkansas have been passed requiring anyone under 18 to acquire parental consent before creating a social media account however the Utah law has yet to take effect and the Arkansas law has been temporarily blocked by a judge Florida's law is
distinct from both in that it focuses on younger more vulnerable users and it justifies its ban based on the addictive nature of social media platforms rather than on their specific content which is actually a pretty darn good point meanwhile 41 US states and the District of Columbia have filed suits against meta over addictive features that say they're harming children in violation of State consumer protections and federal privacy laws intended to protect Children online uh if successful these
could result in heavy fines or Force meta to restructure its online platforms oh yeah you got to sit down that'll help also I only yeah the right right right yeah there's three three segments to do um also there's a couple of Ontario uh jurisdictions have sued I think I think it was meta as well over  platforms yeah Ontario schools are suing uh bite dance uh meta and Snapchat things are about to get very interesting and again one of the big focuses was on the addictiveness of 
platforms all right cool thanks Luke yeah we're  there uh Dan I think we're at the end of our topics for today oh wait no first discussion so Banning Banning miners from social media I think we're good Dan no no no you're good you're good um so much taller Banning minor from social media yay or nay uh yeah I mean they're addictive right like yeah screw it I like I I even read a thing recently where um there were some teachers talking about how um with phones in schools people aren't even like talking
in the hallways between class anymore really everyone's just like walking around on their phones I mean they're probably talking to each other yeah you know class being in the same room texting each other but it's like even more hardcore because you might not be in the same class with your friends so they'll have a bunch of like group chats and stuff going on and if you aren't walking around talking on your phone right you're missing out so you're not conversing with people impromptu in
person right so the hallways are like quiet oh really and everyone's just walking around on their phones and they're like it's really weird and then there was one school that banned phones and they said all the kids liked it and they started asking the kids why and they were like oh well I didn't actually want to be on it but I didn't want to be the only one not on it interesting so if no one's on it it's actually better and I was like that's fantastic Go kids man I I noticed the other day
um I was in midc conversation and someone took a call and I didn't care and I realized how bizarre that behavior would have been in my adult memory oh wildly yeah like like how utterly inappropriate that would have been when I first got a cell phone so that would have been in around 2004 you'd have to be like I'm sorry this is very important I am so sorry they have called me three times this must be a life or death emergency W for this call I this is a job interview something whereas it was
more along the lines that we were  like see you later okay sure um and to be clear this is like someone that I have a good relationship with and like it was fine I didn't care it was not over my boundaries I just didn't realize how far my boundaries had been stretched yeah totally totally yeah but yeah I don't know that was a that was a story that made me uh have some more hope for whatever name of generation is currently in school I think it's alpha or something I don't know something like
that uh but yeah kind of kind of based on the whole social media thing I think it's time for Wow after dark Mr  doing I'm glad to hear that I'm not sure if I'm I'm not sure if I'm glad to hear the tone in your voice as you say that thing I definitely believe but um I'm glad to have plausible deniability for not knowing how horrible you feel I've been walking around he says he's been walking he has yes indeed he's been talking about you and me uh we're we're just turning pink I think after dark may not work
today sure that's a little darker after dim yeah after dim um I don't know what what what will it be cam it's a new memory module after din oh oh wow don't worry about it it's for laptops it's okay yeah I know sheesh I'm sorry showcase to the new Labs website page how did we not talk about that today how did we not talk about that today people seem to freaking love it there is a lot of work that has to happen of course but that's why we did the early like preview and that's why
we're just publishing one article about One graphics card that realistically very few people care about but the point of this is just you're going so fast Luke take your time did you notice how we got these yeah get back up there get back up there get back come on come on come on okay so guys the first actual product page and I don't I don't think we would necessarily call them articles because it's it's the whole point of labs right is that this is meant to be the page for this product so that you
know what's up okay so we've published our first product page for the powercolor hellhound RX 7600 XT 16 gig um this is where you guys are seeing everything that the team has worked on for the last what how Bloody hell when did we first start the lab when did we hire Antoine was he the first who was the first person we hired for labs uh Nick really I think I think is that right I think man does someone know does anyone know are any staffers watching in chat does anyone remember has it been 3 years good Lord
anyway um the point is cuz our first project was uh GPU testing right or is this just the I'm remembering this this way because that's what I was involved in I don't know I don't I could be wrong okay whatever I'm I I very likely have bias because I was the one that the point is the team has grown a lot has learned a lot um has done so so much work and it's all finally getting to the point where we can start to show you guys uh Beyond just you know helping some some numbers
and graphs and sort of helping out the video production side of things these guys have been working on their own stuff as well and it's been an incredible journey um everything from like the arrangement of the of of the author's name and whether we would put the author's name and publication date and where all that information would be found include time where the social media you know links would go and how the sharings here over here everything man the number of mockups that I've seen
this is this is what I'm so I have so much anxiety right now of wanting to scroll down so badly because there's Cool Tech we've made and it's not at the top but everything matters it's true there's been so much work there has been um okay so let's start going down slowly all right okay so all the okay so these uh these assets or or not assets these um attributes of the that we populate like the work of figuring out okay what are all the attributes that you should have called because you can imply a
significant amount by the name of the category so like is it highlights is it key specs is it uh I don't remember all of them there was a lot of different options it was I believe key specs for a long time mhm and then it got changed back to Highlights again at some point because we couldn't decide okay do we want to focus on the positive here do we want to have the negative do we want have a mixture should it be redundant key specs then it has to be a speck yes well what's a spec I don't know like
these are all things that need to be figured out and need real answers not just handwavy auton noal figure it out answers because they affect the design the summary is handwritten um and it oh man we went back and forth so many times like should there be summaries at every section should it just be a summary at the top should the summary be like an introduction to the product should it be a conclusion to the product uh I I don't know okay hey look you can buy it go down yep should we show the
price should we have people click through to the price how will we get the price all problems all problems that needed to be solved   yeah so did you know we were doing this yes super cool so did you know they were going to get embedded though I didn't so we can tear down products without uh tearing down products uh we do have a publication date guys it's at the top oh man uh We've we've talked about how we're going to yeah yeah there there if you Mouse over it you can see a version
history super cool right or wait is that coming I don't know if that's currently in I think that's just showing you the time okay never mind uh but that's something we've talked about yeah I'm just saying there's a lot of decisions okay that might be in I don't want to say that's wrong I just don't think that's what's currently happening when I highlight over this okay so go down go down uh yeah so we have um so we have uh a CT scanner now which is pretty cool we'll have a video coming on that very
soon uh photos okay so now we can expand things performance look at that going have graphs um in the long term oh oh can you show them the thing where you can change the colors depending on what  cool so cool so you can you can go into some presets right now we just have default and and high contrast but you can change colors however you want because we there's just there's just so many different ways where maybe maybe you just find one more comfortable maybe you are color blind maybe who knows so
you can you can customize all the chart colors um so proud of the team that was actually like very early done I don't remember who suggested that but someone suggested that and we were basically all like yep that's a great idea it wasn't me nor me uh there was some there there's a lot of like little feedback things we've been been receiving like we're we're very proud of these charts but we found that these labels on the left hand side are very small print on mobile so we'll look into that some
people have pointed out and I think I do agree with it was this already changed somebody already get to this yeah I think so y'all are hilarious by the way that's sick um overall like wasn't pinned to the top so you'd have like a few random games and then overall and people were like that sucks and it's clearly already been changed I didn't even ask for that to happen but that was clearly the right decision so I'm happy it did um yeah cool labels I love the charts yep and this ah man yeah a lot of work
um making graphs is surprisingly manual yeah in a lot of cases and so figuring out how to make them automatic and make them good has been an inordinate amount of work um yes we want to add things to the comparison bin at the top I see we've changed the word cart to bin I actually um didn't sign off on that but I like it it's better yeah people hated cart y viciously hated cart so it's been now yep I I I made the call I was like we're going to call it comparison cart because
there were a bunch of worse ideas but um neither Luke nor I thought of B nope and that's better [Laughter] yep yeah yeah bin makes sense because it's this is my comparison bin it's because it's it's just shorter than bucket bucket would have been too long but it's it feels like yeah this is my bucket of things I want to like compare and that's why I went with cart because it's like I'm like I'm like shopping I'm shopping for things I want to like compare to each other but no bin makes
more sense because this is not a store yeah H so excited and so in the long-term man we're going to we're going to get testing going um in higher volumes it's going to take time man the the ramp is going to take time but hopefully you guys can see that we have not just been sitting on our butts cuz what we've been trying to build is something that can scale um something that is for more than just publishing the odd review or article here and there we want this to be a database and that
is so much so much work it can't be just compare for the person who just asked because this button is compare the comparison bin is where the things that you've selected to compare go yeah so you can't just have like this button's called compare and then this button's called compare and they do completely different things that's a terrible user experience they have to be different we might have to change that to add to comparison bin or something like that though there's clearly horizontal room
for it so I think that's what the plus symbol is supposed to indicate but we could we do whatever there will be changes right so like the the original like I don't know what you even want to call it Alpha launch or whatever um we got a bunch of feedback improved some things and this time we got a bunch of feedback have already improved some things and there's more improvements that will be coming and you know what I think that there was a lot of internal I shouldn't say I think there was a lot of
internal debate around doing this as a soft launch like showing the look of the site without even any articles on it publishing one article before we're realistically ready to ramp hard um I I feel this feels like the right way extremely validated by how how positive and understanding the community has been we've just been working on it for so long along I think people were worried about people having a really negative response to it when it's not technically fully baked so I I understand some of
the anxieties but I'm happy we did it but people the community has actually I've been really proud of the community here because they've been so constructive in the way that they have approached this exercise um like almost every single message even the ones where they're like I don't like some thing they have included how they would like to see it improved and a lot of the ideas have been really good yeah and we had very good feedback and and I think it's been really validating for the team
to see that no one is looking at it going this is a tear down everyone's like oh cool it would be great if this thing worked this way yeah yeah and so I think it's going to make sweet this it's going to guide us as we continue to ramp and as we as we make our way toward the the vision um that this Vision officer has envisioned and and something better than what I envisioned I think that that's that's the difference between involving the community and not involving the community um good ideas can come from
anywhere guys and I think you see that in the way that the team has implemented things that you know I didn't think of or Luke didn't think of um and the way that the community has has requested things that we didn't collectively think of right more voices can be a negative thing but if it's managed it can be so so so kind of trickling in the more voices yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah man if we'd started with like what would you like to see in a like Tech information product page site like it would have
been directionless it's good that we had kind of an idea from the first place I love the logo the labs logo yeah yeah I think it's pretty good actually think it's um I like the text a lot yeah I believe the text was sarra but I think the heat syn was Gary not Gary key not the head of labs but one of our other confuses me all the time yeah I know it's a problem because Gary does a lot of work for the lab exactly I know who he's talking about so it makes sense to me but yeah it's it's
very confusing uh don't quote me on that Sarah might have done both and Gary might have done both they're both  yeah logo looks like a simple heat sink it is it is but it's but it's it's clean it's it's cute it's approachable that's what I like about it it looks professional but uh not like sterile it has some personality there's the you know the logo test um can you draw it yeah yeah now without not being able to see okay I'm going to  it it's not perfect but it's pretty good
Dan gave me a pass yeah but Dan look I I drew it in two seconds yeah it's a good it's a good logo it is pretty good that is a thing though there're supposed to be like can can you can like can people draw like would people be able to recreate it from memory basically and that gets harder and harder to do as a lot of the basic things like oh our company's logo is an F thanks Facebook uh the the more those types of things get taken up it gets harder and harder so yeah yeah I think and and the heat
sink there were a bunch of different things LS that we were it it could I think one of them was a potentially a fan you know what maybe this is maybe this is a perfect time to look at some of the things it could have been one of them was a unicorn um yeah yeah uh hold on Labs logo let me see if I can find do you want to stall for me do you want to do a merch messag sure yeah you got want to throw at me Dan by any   very far away Luke I actually have one for you directly Luke perfect I'm a
pilot and a while back you said you'd probably never do a charter flight but you do like experiences if you could would you take friends or family on a flight and where would you go the if I could is a very questionable part of this um charter flights are obset not not to dog after your job I'm sure you do great stuff but charter flights are incredibly expensive um I think it would be a cool thing to do um it's just wicked expensive so I you would been down for scrapyard Wars hey yeah that
was your money though right yeah Not only was I down I was trying to  it didn't we win anyways we won that season right yeah I think so yeah way to go go us um but yeah I don't know I'm sure it would be sweet I I've wanted to do a a trip with the whole family for a while my uh my brother has somewhat recently had a child so I don't think that's really on the table for a while um but it would be cool to do at some point maybe once that little one is able to remember it stuff like that U but I
don't think it's going to be on a charter flight I don't think that's going to be a thing but thanks well unfortunately I don't think I can find things in Google Drive are impossible to find I well may have just never been shared with me I do a lot of these kinds of I I I really like doing um like Graphics conversations in person because this is someone's like subjective taste and and their and their work and their passion people don't get into art because they like want to make
a ton of money this how I'm going to make the big bucks yeah they get into art because they are passionate they they love design um and so I don't really like I don't like to give feedback about stuff like that um not in person so I do like to have a lot of those conversations in person um so I may it may have just never been shared  um I found a bunch of different possibilities for the gradient that we ultimately ended up with so I can show that to you guys that kind of a fun behind the scenes here we go
um Labs icon gradient option oh it's still loading oh it stopped loading no it just stopped loading uh one moment please I saw the preview yeah that's weird um just yeah give me a sec here guys this has eight pages are you sure here we go oh I see I understand there you go so here's one of the gradient options a the color on that monitor is wild uh yeah that looks nuts you guys won't be able to see this but yeah okay uh uh there's another gradient option there's another gradient option kind of
you should look it on this one luk yeah yeah I've seen this I've seen this yep there's another gradient option there's another gradient option more more orangey more LT uh we ended up not leaning that direction we ended up leaning more towards like a short circuit type of palette Mr light has just sent you a bunch of mockups for the lab logos oh nice why does Nick have that thanks Nick thanks Nick I mean I'm not yeah I'm not complaining um I don't know just like why why would he
uh I mean yeah Sarah oh well well because Nick doesn't work on the lab but he is Sarah's manager so yeah that that kind of checks out okay here you go oh here it is this is the one oh yeah this okay let's go Labs icon concept you want to get rid of us Dan some of these yeah give a wild yeah there were man there were so  ideas and we had like some some really good conversations about it and I think we picked the right thing seeing it on the site and seeing that the fact the fact that I haven't seen a single
comment you know how I read comments I haven't seen a single comment that's like that logo stup that logo is dumb yeah it's and that realistically a logo that nobody hates great great logo fantastic logo yeah that logo came to me tears running down his face big strong logo yeah yeah yeah okay Dan working on it okay well we'll get started you could probably start I think that first one doesn't have anything in the corner cool yeah you're good here so uh oh you know what no let's let's go
one by one here fixed um case concept data collection PC testing uh Beaker ties into Labs so the case is going to have like kind of scientific looking fluid in it we tried having it facing this way and that super cool but not everything going to be a computer the desktop PC is probably on the out you know compared to mobile phones and laptops and handheld PCS and consoles like we're going to test everything  PC okay a fan pretty cool pretty cool I liked this one a lot this was uh this
was pretty close for me um yeah I like this one but not everything has a fan there's a lot of tech that doesn't have any moving Parts moving Parts kind of going out of fashion okay the CPU with kind of the beaker okay thought this one was really cool again two PC it specific I also that while it is great and I think the dot helps a lot with understanding I think a lot of people wouldn't have known who it was y yep so we ended up losing the CPU because cooling can be on anything so this is pretty darn
close to final so this is this is what ultimately won obviously yeah um represents power and pushing components to the Limit yeah love it  rainbow um you can see here the idea a was that it's about like the underlying sort of passion that brings us to investigate technology and how magical it all is I just really yeah I felt it looked too much like Wi-Fi yeah yeah the beaker Planet my issue with this one um and actually and to be clear I'm not saying like I was so smart and I
picked the right ones it's not like that this was a conversation so I'm giving you guys a summary yeah um and a lot of the time one of the designers will I'll be having meeting with them and they'll be like okay which one do you like and I'll say which one do you like and they'll be like well this one has this issue and this one has this issue I think this one's the best I'll be like cool I'm glad we didn't have to have the entire rest of this meeting yeah yeah um so I okay I just want to make that
really really clear so a lot of the time these concerns that I'm talking about would have been shared or even raised by the designer who worked on the project but sometimes you got to throw spaghetti at the wall this one this one didn't fly this one I thought was really cool that's pretty cool yeah the nucleus star just a little bit too physics e so kind of how like how some of the other ones were a bit too much chemistry lab this felt a little bit too physics lab and didn't really say Tech really cool
logo this one and the last one both really cool just maybe for a slightly different application yeah maybe for a different kind of lab yeah yeah hopefully you guys uh hopefully you guys enjoyed that I had that up full screen so I have no idea um if you guys thought that was cool someone said the circle logo is just North Face there was a few I think there's more yeah because there's the Unicorn one and stuff there's more designs than what were just in there yeah the Unicorn one was pretty
wild and there was quite a few designs where like it wasn't the same it was clearly an original idea but it looked very similar to like I remember one of them looked very close to the Rena logo we have a shirt that looks really close to the renoo logo maybe yeah maybe that's total accident but yeah there's stuff like that where like no it was not actually copied from this but it was too close so someone in the company might have recognized like wait that looks like this we look it up we're like yeah
that's too close people are going to call us on that even though that isn't what happened so we go with something else by the way did I ever end up showing um uh the smash Champs logo ideas I think I talked about it I don't think I've even seen these oh okay yeah um have you seen these Dan this is loading really slowly I think so maybe no no I I don't think a lot of the people working on Smash have seen the smash I probably saw them when I was trying to organize some files yeah ah I
think we've talked about this so this is the this is the Badminton Club logo that's pretty cool yeah I like it I agree it's clean um imagine we could play Super Smash Bros there yeah imine having a smash championship at smash Champs these things things take so long man like there's a lot of really good Concepts here too are any of these going to load like hello no preview available I mean sure I guess I love uh I love computers oh wow there was a hammer wow at one point kind of sick but I I think
the one you went with is better this is also super cool but you know I don't know um this idea of having like the QR code inter I thought was pretty cool so it would like load up our our site so if we had any merch or like water bottles or whatever and people were like using them at other places then they just have like links to our stuff uh this is where that one started got it so you kind of Drew it back a little bit and then yeah uh we wanted something that was a little
bit more contained a little bit more normal shape that you can put on the side of a water bottle or at the top of a web page yeah that sort of thing um the the idea was like a meteor you know yeah yeah yeah um but it didn't need to be quite like in the meteor yeah and with the new one you still get the get the point and the uh this is like a super cool font maybe a bit too cool I I still I still really like this font but yeah I don't always get my way yeah I don't necessarily agree with it
being too cool to be honest I don't know it it's a sports thing whatever yeah but it's also you know it's it's a club it's more than just uh you want to appeal to who did these um jquan actually did a lot of this oh wow yeah so he's very multi-talented um if you guys play badminton I'm sure you'll meet him at some point I've met him no no not you specifically I mean I mean folks got it uh if you play badminton and you want to come play at smash I'm sure you'll I'm sure you'll
meet him at some point he's uh super cool very passionate yeah um and like like I said wildly multi-talented he also uh built the facility in um I want to say he was using Maya and did like paint color mockups and stuff so that we could make informed decisions about color um he's been working with uh I don't know if the other guy's off his probation yet but he's been working with so I'll just say the other guy he's been working with the other guy on like procurement of like floor mats just like
all kinds of things yeah he's U yeah he's great I was working with them on the software Choice stuff oh yeah yep yep yep cool I've seen a lot of speculation about like what exactly is like going on with that like is it some kind of like  whatever I like badminton I'm trying to think of what what it would be a front for there's nowhere to play locally uh like like close um it's it's a front for lonus not having to drive so far to play badminton yeah and it's also man I can't even I can't go anywhere
without running into someone who's like yo I heard you're opening a badmon center like actually like I was at the ferry and someone I haven't played with in like probably three to four years was like hey I heard you I heard you're opening a Badminton Center I'm like dude I haven't talked to anyone that I'm even aware knows you in years how do you know about this getting around the batminton scene yeah I was I played last night at um at one of the Richmond clubs and um someone someone came up to me they're
like yeah I heard you're opening a badmin center you should like you should do like some marketing and stuff and I was like brother apparently I don't need to you just I have no idea who you are and you just walked up and we're like hey I heard you're opening a Badminton Club soon uh I think I apparently I'm good in all seriousness of course yeah we're going to have to do some some marketing and stuff like that but it's it's a pretty big scene here and there's a lot of pent up demand um I don't need
a reason to open a business can be sustainable there a lot of residents being put in around this area oh yeah so oh yeah I don't know no shortage of people to play it's going to be good I'm excited it's a great sport I think the people that don't get it probably probably don't play it's that I think it's that simple I didn't get it and then I played and then I understood yeah it's fun and now my shoulder just is like yeah that's I don't know about that that's too bad dude but I'll try to play
a little bit and if not I'll just go hang out go on the treadmills do whatever yeah man design stuff though nothing is simple so hard and you have to do so many iterations yeah but yeah it is what it is I think that's a you came up with or Jak Wan came up with a really cool logo I like that one a lot next merch message it's when after dark time oh yeah sure is let's do it let's do it I got to push the button there we go Oh I thought we already were I thought we started I
thought that whole thing was on no you interrupted it to talk about logo oh for 40 minutes I thought logo was after dark me too all right oh whatever whatever okay oh we look too pink and then I left that sounds about right yeah oh we did we no that was a detour from the charter flight it was a oh my gosh okay well we did one that's good all right moving on hey lldd lonus my job has been going through growing pains from doubling its size from 500 to over a th000 in a year what are some of the
growing pains you had with the growth of LT how about the first day you walked around the office and didn't know someone's name yeah that was pretty bad um you sore at me multiple times I did yeah cuz I was popping up all around and you would stare at me and go like I don't know who this guy is you said I swore at you uh F FN n guy uh fngg FNG effing new guy did I really yeah I I remember I remember uh I was I was trying to get your your master key to have them duplicated for the new lab
building or something like that and I sent you a message on teams which you I never got a read report for and then you walk into Logistics or something i' like who the f is Daniel besser and then you just drop the key on the table and leave  great that was probably like one one of  you I like that like somebody just is like I need one of the two master keys for the whole building I don't know who he is okay here you go oh man people wonder why I try to like rap line accounts and stuff and
extra security like this is why dude I'm pretty sure V let him know so wait I was handing you a master key yeah so that I could go get it copied and the words I said to you were who the fck is Daniel besser yeah did I know you were Daniel besser I obviously  funny oh what that's hilarious that's actually hilarious man I uh okay oh man yeah I uh okay well uh it's it's the security issues you don't know about that hurt the most yeah no I'm pretty sure that it was discussed
beforehand okay what was my point this makes me sound like a horrible person was I Horrible no it was really funny oh okay it like my highlight of my entire career here it's just just absolutely hilarious uh what was my point I don't understand I don't get the joke think it's that he's handing you you were handing him the master key oh I assume that that was your joke oh I get it now sorry I just just the way and also we had like never met before yeah okay I get it I get it I get it giving me this
I think you were making light of like the fact that I was doing that you guys had never met and you were giving him a master key to a building and ion had probably said that it was okay and yeah yeah yeah okay that totally makes sense now I I I don't know if it was just your dry British delivery but you made it sound like I was angry about it or something oh you you did you were you were quite heated about it was I but not like Angry Angry just oh you know what I was well I had probably been trying to
track down where you sat or something most likely like I was probably in a hurry oh that makes a lot of sense okay yeah okay okay okay okay funny you're not you're not mean oh the whole thing makes so much more sense now like yeah I'm basically handing the keys to the kingdom to whoever the this guy is um sure yeah like our whole team's chat history was like can I have the most important key to the business to go copy please got it yeah that all makes way more sense now yeah I mean Luke and I struggle when
people walk past our desks now right I'd say communication is the biggest challenge when things grow too fast I mean I think you guys have probably seen a lot of that leak out into into the public sphere whether it's just you know mistakes or uh miscommunications or areas where our operations clearly hasn't kept up with how many chefs there are in the kitchen um it's it's always it's always really interesting to me where people will see something like um you know a logistics or communication
error internally they'll go how did lonus that up I'm like I never touched any of it um I think because so many YouTubers are one and two bit operations people assume that they all are and they're not but like when we do something really good luk I go out of my way to talk about how great the team is that worked on it nope if we do great things it's uh everyone else and if we do terrible things it's Lion's fault way to go he doesn't even he's not even the CEO anymore still his fault bad Vision I'm
still involved in a lot of decisions it's a slow transition but we knew that um so just to be clear just and you still own the whole company I do not okay sort of your family unit owns the whole comp that is true there we go got him that's a better way I've been thinking about how to say this for a while family unit yeah that works yeah I if someone was like you and Ivon are a family unit I'd be like yeah yeah I think it makes sense because I also I don't want to say like you and your wife because it's not
like that my wife you know what I mean yeah like it's more yeah sink plane says he did say should roll uphill I did and I was right um that is that is the correct way credit should be shared blame should be accepted owned but it can be it can be exhausting it can be wearing sometimes yeah but it's worth it yes it's how it's got to work it's it's the right way but I think really the important question is who the fu is Daniel besser let's not get distracted from these important questions I don't know
but I'm comfy now that's all that  uh sorry all right well that's an image I'll never forget H okay what's next hi LDL I recently bought stuff from eBay and gave a critical review about it the seller then reached out and offered to pay me to change my review no don't what is your review on sellers paying for reviews it's horrible it's the very worst thing ever um and we would never do that on LTT store I'm going to I'm going to go find I'm going to go find a horrible review nice let's find one but
I'm going to cheat a little bit and I'm going to show you guys an awesome one first there's one review so far for the magnetic Cable Management products from Jor verified by shop absolutely amazing as soon as they announced they were making this it was on I was on board and when I got the email to order them I pounced and it was well worth it simple to install super strong and just makes the process of mounting Power Bars actually doable and far better than the 3-in long nails Loosely inserted into
drywall that was my previous solution if there's any product to get from ltd's Cable Management line it's this one it's a game changer all right let's go find something horrible oh it's on the the power Bar Key okay yeah the power bar key is So Co management line wow he really wants us to do more it's so cool um okay Loop help me out pick a category pick a category any category uh um um the screwdriver uh shaft extension you're not going to find a negative review of that oh I mean we can try 27
reviews oh there's okay okay four stars it's the worst one good extension with some good quality extension with some minor issues okay it enlarges your P screwdriver by the way reading reviews on the site is actually great I do this for fun sometimes that's pretty fun um it does this I didn't see that coming I'll say that it does this nicely with a strong magnet I cannot make it fall out of the original Shaft by waving the screwdriver around it does have two small issues the extender doesn't sit
flush with the original Shaft the magnetic bid is a bit too long okay uh this was on purpose yeah um the reason it doesn't sit flush is because if we tried to get it to sit flush there could be tolerance uh there are tolerance issues that could prevent the shaft from fully contacting the magnet inside the original Sha so the extension might not make physical contact magnetic strength is strongest the closer you can get the magnets so if we tried to make it perfectly flush then we would end up
with something that was usually perfect and sometimes didn't make full contact so we made the decision to not even try to make it perfectly flush to put a fingernail spot in there so that we would never run into that issue uh the extender Waggles a bit when in use most likely because of issue one actually the reason is that every bit w Bagles it's just you only notice it with an extension because the spec for/ quarter in drive has tolerances built into it and we could our tolerance is really
tight on our driver so we could have made it tighter but it would have made our shaft sometimes incompatible with third party drivers so if you check really carefully with um uh with the pair of calipers you can see that the uh the male end of our shaft extension is actually a little bit bigger than spec but not much much so we made it as tighter as we could while still retaining compatibility with almost every third party driver okay should we should we find an actual let's find
something actually actually bad I didn't realize there would actually be none on that product it's a really good product let's go to something that has like a bajillion reviews like screwdriver or  sure which one you want uh just a full prime one let's go for the most possible review so we have the highest chance of  one that's a yeah okay all right 3% of our reviews are one star uh took a long time to arrive didn't get it um this is probably dealt with at this point oh another took
a long time to arrive Haven took a long time to arrive I ordered three and it looks like each of them come from different batches colors are slightly off on the last one plus the mechanics seem to be less prec PR than the first one ordered a few months ago so the colors could be slightly off and the mechanic seams could be oh sorry no the mechanics could be less precise than the first one there there are variances yep that's a thing that happens and colors can be a little bit
different from time to time yet to arrive we had some delivery issues before um yeah there's some negative reviews of support it should be noted that any anything under a certain threshold we reach out to but they don't always revise the reviews so yeah the worst scw this one's confusing would recommend to yeah would recommend to others but wish there was an all black option and shipping wasn't expensive I think this person's somewhat trolling look at the like to dislike on it okay yeah uh never
arrived wait are these people that like wait 2023 when did we launch the thing no we launched it in 2022 right I think so yeah there's yeah yeah yeah yeah 2022 right I'm not sure I don't know but there's a there's a bunch of complaints from like August when did we launch it I think we  2022 right yeah I think I'm I'm like gaslighting myself I'm pretty sure did we launch a video on LT for we did we launch it in 2022 okay so apparently we had some some shipping delays in July August oh was this around
LTX this would have been just after LTX okay charge me $1 more after received the shipment without reason well that was probably their like Customs or whatever a big mistake H okay another delivery issue uh I mean if this person reaches out to customer care I'm sure we can get them sort of out okay so has anyone actually had a problem with the screwdriver yet the one person didn't like that the colors were different haven't received it I'm not thrilled with the result okay there here we go
first thing is the magnet is too strong and really annoying to get the screw set  place what really while nice for holding screws on it come annoying to get them set also the screw that hold an outlet cover is not enough back Force for the ratchet and I am forced to turn the shaft by hand and after all the hype on the ratcheting mechanism really and one other thing is there's no way to know what direction it is set to without testing it oh there is an indicator actually um okay yeah it would be better
to have an indicator there's an indicator uh way too overhyped and underd delivered okay there I guess my point was pretty good William Bird's  enjoy we do not believe in uh in in covering up problems whether they're delivery issues that we had around the LTX time frame uh whether they are uh complaints that people have about the product even if we don't agree that they're valid uh guys we're here for you to we're here for you guys to get the real the real customer experience that's what our reviews are
for I I legitimately like love reading reviews on the site though people are saying that the the indicator is I think there's um I think there's a way to tell people are saying that the indicator is just what direction to turn it not what it's currently set to yeah know it tells you what it's currently set to here where's where's my easily accessible backpack location directly behind you your backpack is supposed to be on your back while you  seated oh no no no you guys are right
yeah it tells you what way to twist it oh yeah no you're right Bas on like the the handle or anything no you trying to remember yeah there totally is actually based on the flat point Sorry based on the flat point of the handle oh yes the left side yes yeah if it is uh centered on the flat that's right yes there is a way to tell but it is not that clearly indicated if in the center of the flat it is neutral if it is to the side of the flat then it is that way if it's to the the other side
of the flat then it's that way yep yeah there is an indicator it's possible you kind of have to figure it out though I don't think we actually tell you that we didn't tell you that so this is keyed so the uh selector ring always goes in in the same orientation uh that is by Design yeah I just totally forgot about it good job creative Warehouse team yeah it works I was thinking I was like I'm pretty sure I've been able to tell before and I think I've used that  yep what are you supposed to be talking
about do you want another merch message uh yeah I mean that's what we're doing right now right yep Intel's battle mage got leaked do you think it will have a much better launch than Alchemist will they be back on the WAN show I daily and Arc for the competition and have seen it improve a ton Intel's work on their driver has been  um yeah I I said yes immediately to better launch but I what I think I mean by that is I think there will be more people ready to adopt it to be
completely honest um I don't know I I'm not going to say right off the bat that like their driver is going to be Flawless on launch n um they've they've had a lot of improvements on their driver I'm very hopeful for that but I have no idea but I do think there will be more people interested in potentially buying an Intel GPU come this generation yeah I seeing how dedicated how dogged they've been when it comes to improving these we're going to push harder I I I it gives me Faith I have a bunch of Hope
yeah yeah I'm feeling good about it I'll try it again yeah he LDL was finally time to pick up a shaft extension and the bread sorus pin what do you think was the saddest company takeover that you were alive for Oculus got him oh now I'm sad totally beaten to the draw Bethesda got him nah no you're over it okay they're already dead that's true that's fair okay okay blizzard yeah that was kind of a merger but it feels like the Activision Soul was the one that survived it sure was yeah yeah yeah still Oculus
though hello L this is very sad sorry um five star review I'm sorry I need to return this I bought it for my husband but he can't use it he was in a car accident how do I return it um I guess having randomly seen this I will forward this to customer care and  uh sorry to hear that yeah but we yeah we'll we'll get you sorted out um hopefully uh he makes a speedy recovery yeah maybe we can get him something else yep some some sometime uh okay uh sorry Dan go ahead hello lus been watching since ncx days
do you think a Dell Tower server would make a good choice for the first server for a first server if you're if you're able to get one off of like you know some company flipping it out the door for basically nothing like absolutely as long as the performance there should be reliable enough that's how a lot of people get their first Server Chassis schedule send uh o we're out Monday hey y don't want to bother oh Nick is aware oh Nicks on it y oh well that's easy look at this guy dude beaing us with the
images we needed solving customer  good Okay g to save that one hello from Australia dlll I think I've seen the intro popping up again recently what are people's reactions and how are the analytics finding it uh overall reactions are good uh it seems to be neutral if anything on retention so I think we're just going to kind of have it sometimes if it feels like there needs to be an air gap between the intro and the body of the video um if it feels like something that we just kind of need
to get into then we'll leave it out but it's I think right now it's out by default but I'm adding it back in more often than not I don't necessarily think we should make this some someone in Phil plane chat just just references oh can I find their name what now sorry I don't think I can give you a shout out cuz I looked away and and lost your name an extension that adds the intro to every video I don't think we should actually necessarily make this a shirt maybe we should I'd be happy with being wrong but
if we don't I think Dan you should make this yourself just a shirt that's just like either your face or Linus's face and it just says who the f is Daniel B and you should wear it I don't even know anymore man I don't think I've known for a long  I think that would be hilarious anyways moving on H when okay uh let's see let's see oh yeah it should just be it should just be like a black and white just side profile of you in the top it's really comfy I'm glad I did this I should have done this ages ago
okay where are we where are we uh Hey when. xe. PNG I've been watching a few older LTD videos and I love many of the older t-shirt designs like the ram t-shirt so would lmg ever open the vault for limited run of the older designs I'm not saying no but you know what if you see something you like buy three because it's not always possible for us to bring things back we can't just print one of a shirt it doesn't make sense I've been doing that more often I do it all the time yeah if I
find something I like man those badon shoes I bought like five pairs y cuz they this the company that uh that I I like a lot of other elements of their designs they had they had a wide shoe because they're they're an Asian company so my feet are apparently wide even though they're pretty typical for like a Caucasian dude but like they made a wide shoe that was really good for me um and I like the grip of the bottoms and and and uh and like I like their their internal cushioning and all that kind of
stuff and so I bought one pair and I was like well I'll be able to get these forever and then when their next Generation lineup came out they just didn't have a wide just like yeah well we don't need a like x65 w anymore so whatever get the x65 two and I tried them one they were terrible they were too they were too narrow and then the next gen came out and they had a wide and I'm like okay well half a dozen pairs of these please and then if you guys skip a gen then I guess I'm good
and if you have a future one well then that's cool but these fit fine so whatever I don't care my feet are uh wide and tall and just relatively large and finding shoes that are like sporty that fit all of those things is like practically impossible as far as I can tell there are options but I don't like most of them so there are a few options but then preference comes in and knocks those out so there's like one pair of shoes that I just love and I wish I had more of them but I have two pairs right
now which which is which is pretty okay next Dan hey Dan and the talent love the show I was wondering how you assess your production quality video and audio Etc and decide when you need to upgrade change up or experiment and then set new standards that'd be a great name for like Ed and Andy great question sorry for Ed and Andy um yeah if anything I would say that we've been more concerned about um workflow for the last six months than production quality so much you know figuring out how to how to smoothly
produce rather than how to like have  whatever dll how do you feel about users breaking an apps terms of service just to make it usable for example modding Discord mobile app to bring the old layout layout back or YouTube apps to stop shorts from being shoved in your face okay well hold on we got to be a little careful here because you said make it usable and then talked about things that  but you're not supposed to I guess personally I mean I don't really care um and as far as my understanding goes you
aren't supposed to do things like custom skins and custom uis for Discord but I think they also just like don't really go after you a ton unless you're broadcasting it so I suspect that's how  sure we'll get rid of that did lonus ever get his revenge on Colton for the pregnancy prank no but I will and and that was a long time ago yep and I'll get my revenge bye in my time oh boy and let's see any other other ones you want to deal with we got some incoming first there's a potential you
can check you've just done this so many times I don't know but it's up to you oh which one the potential oh oh do you still have your bike um I do it's in a lot of pieces right now I was actually working on sanding for it last night oh nice sand blasting I'm so I'm still still I'm going to get it painted it's  awesome but Luke what about Qualcomm you said Qualcomm and then sponsor but we talked with that for sure oh okay forget it then I'll qualcom creates proton for Windows arm we we talked about oh yeah
yeah no we're good uh do you have any favorite retro video games that you want to share with your kids I'm going to see if uh I'm going to see if they'll play Final Fantasy 6 there's a there's the remake or or like the re-release the pixel remaster that's the word I was looking for um I think that uh I think that at least a couple of them might be ready for it but I also see the games they play now and they're so good they're so different they're so dense like if you ask me Final Fantasy 6 is
still fun if you ask me what would you recommend to your kid though Final Fantasy 6 or Dave the diver I'd be like I don't know go play Dave the diver probably a better game yeah but there's time hey are you back on it yet no but I I want done done my side I'll do it I'll do it I'll do it I watched hackers because of the computer not being a to play I watch Pirates of Silicon Valley which was pretty tedious I played Titanfall 2 which was excellent those those movies were
tedious for a very short period of time yeah they were they were very tedious though I do actually want to keep playing it I lost a bunch of momentum when my computer wouldn't play it and then like this last week I wanted to play I didn't play any video games the whole week so I don't know um I will get to it though I will play it it's not I'm not trying to avoid it it is actually genuinely just fun I want to actually beat it out of my own drive at this point all right I want uh I want Peter
Smith message dealt with here if you were given a complete doover on one of your videos which one would you choose to reshoot and why it would be the roast not recording the audience laughter killed it yeah and people were like yeah man these jokes weren't Landing blah blah blah they were killing the entire time people you just can't hear it loved it but we were all miked like right here and there was no audience microphone and we we added some in in post but it's it's not the same
like people were hooting they were losing it um and so it's just yeah it's h even some of the deliveries like the people have to pause basically cuz the audience is laughing so hard and it sounds like an awkward pause and it's not it takes the vibe way down H yeah yeah I watch it back every once like probably about once a year I forget like half of it and then watch it again it's  funny okay man last one I've got for you you can never redo that someone's like let's redo the roast you could never you
could never hope to recapture that magic and like man maybe in like 20 years how  how how narcissistic would you have to be to host an event a roast like every yourself TW it's like writing multiple autobiographies yeah like honestly I could see it like if when you like retire if someone if someone held one for me in 25 years sure it would be fine but like so much of what is so much of what you say in a roast is supposed to be the core of that person theoretically it hasn't changed
that much like you sure you could make fun of that person for something that happened recently but like you went after who I am and that's what's funny about it it has to cut deep and so how do you ever redo that it's it's been done I I even you know I take it back in 25 years it wouldn't make sense if someone else did it I'd be like no it's been done yeah no I'm over it the last one I have lus and Luke if you both bounce really hard can you pop the couch or is it more durable feel
free to save the attempt for the end I think this is the end thanks Joseph S I guess uh um how how hard do you want to go I mean I don't know don't we need this coach no not really I mean we use it a lot for something we don't need but uh okay oh he's going pretty hard I don't know if I can do hold up oh he's going really hard okay uh if this pops it's going to hurt really bad yeah I know that'll be   um sure are you timing it uh three on go okay three two one go P well here I feel like I was a
little behind you though all right I waited to watch you move instead of going at exactly the same time okay did I go on exactly go no you waited a second but I waited too long okay  okay you even core exercises bro come on three two one go oh we definitely hit at the same time yeah certainly durable oh so it's pretty good then it did pretty good all right we do all our own stunts by the way thanks for watching see you again next week same bad time same bad Channel bye  [Laughter]
you said there's multiple cells you have to jump on the same one uh it's actually just one well this couch is multiple cells but we were jumping on this I think a big part of the reason why it didn't pop is cuz there's one big a space that we're jumping on but then there's another one below it bye
