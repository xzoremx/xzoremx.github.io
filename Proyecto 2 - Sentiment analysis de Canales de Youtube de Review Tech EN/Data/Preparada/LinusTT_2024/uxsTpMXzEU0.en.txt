after this year's WWDC it is going to be really hard to be an apple hater they showed off a laundry list of new features and quality of life improvements across their platforms that finally address some of my most long-standing gripes and introduce me to ideas that I never knew that I needed Shazam but for TV and movies that sounds shamazing a reader mode that doesn't block ads but rather defocuses them yes please RC text message support I mean sure as long as I can still tell who the
disgusting green bubbles are wait T9 dialing are you kidding me this is amazing and how about an AI enhanced Siri that can find that email that someone sent me the list is seriously so long and legitimately exciting that it was hard to find a spot to segue to our sponsor I fix it laptops aren't cheap so why would you run out and buy a new one when I fix it can help give your old one a new lease on life check out their replacement parts and guides at the link in the video description let's kick off
with what's new with Siri starting with the ability to talk to Siri via text finally I don't need to look like a jackass yakking at my phone just to quickly set a reminder I still will of course because my hands being full is the main reason to use a digital assistant but hey it's the thought that counts speaking of Siri can finally understand when you pause and can't remember what you were going to say or if you just mess up rather than needing to start a new prompt it's things like
this assuming they actually work this time that should really help bring the experience closer to what we were sold back with the iPhone 4S and it's not just Siri either new AI enhanced functions are now built into all of Apple's operating systems that allow you to quickly generate smart replies proofread or rewrite messages and summarize content which is incredibly useful probably the most useful tool for me though is reduce interruptions which uses Clues to figure out what
notifications are likely to be actually important versus which ones are probably not so much it's kind of like Focus mode but more automatic but how is all of this working well Apple claims that their machine learning algorithms primarily run on device as they always have but because of the increasing complexity of these tasks Apple's implementing what they call Private Cloud compute a system whereby information relevant to the task and only that information is sent to Apple's
servers to supplement the computer that's in your pocket or on your wrist Apple explicitly pointed out that these servers run Apple silicon which means I don't know maybe exer is coming back probably not but you can't blame a girl for hoping whatever silicon is involved Apple was very careful to make it clear that they cannot read your information even going as far as to dedicate whole sections of the hour and a half long presentation to explaining how the system works now assuming that you trust
Apple more than you do Microsoft their recall like features might be pretty useful and like recall most of the functionality is already on your I device in a more limited form for example you can already search for people's faces or for appointments and iMessage but now you can do so in a more natural open-ended way Apple didn't explain how metadata for these new capabilities is handled where it's stored and whether local apps can access it but they did invite independent experts to audit the process
and according to Apple I devices and Macs will refuse to connect to a private Cloud Server unless it's been publicly logged for inspection in general it was clear that they wanted to avoid any comparisons to Microsoft around the issues of privacy and security this extends even to the integration of chat GPT in iOS 18 and Mac OS Sequoia a little more on those later for example if a prompt is deemed to be too complicated for Siri it will ask you before sending it to open aai and it
will escate your device's IP address on the subject of open aai you can link your open a account if you want to access paid chat GPT features but by default it is free with no account required and Apple's agreement with open aai requires them to not store requests moving on gen emojis are an interesting if Eerie concept but what's cooler is Apple's new tool image playground that underpins it it can be used to create images out of simple prompts and its integration applications like Apple
notes allows you to quickly and easily turn just a basic sketch and maybe a simple wordcloud into a finished image for now it's available in three different styles but I would expect that to expand in the future now let's shift gears and talk about what I am most excited about iOS 18 and its ability to do what Android has done since basically forever that's right my friends T9 dialing baby just kidding um they did add that but they added so much you can finally arrange your apps and widgets however
you want to if you've got a nice picture you want to set as your wallpaper but key parts are covered with those stupid app icons you don't have to deal with that anymore also they barely touched on this during the presentation but you can now resize your apps which is great if you were in your Prime when the first iPhone came out but aren't as dextrous as you once were they've also got their new dark mode to make those icons black but what's even cooler is their new customization sheet that lets you tint
them with whatever color you want and I get it this is a minor thing that doesn't serve a purpose other than to make your device look a little more you but look if you're going to list customization as something that you love about Android you don't get to suddenly not care about it when Apple has a cool idea like their new personalization for control center not only can you swipe to new groups of controls like for media playback or for your smart home but you can add more controls to each group
through the new controls Gallery you can res size them you can change the layout and thanks to the new controls API for devs you're going to see third party app controls as options that you can just add wherever you want just like you can add pins wherever you want our keyboard pins are back on LTT store.com overall this is amazing I mean it feels like apple is finally starting to get why so many people prefer Android devices I mean obviously they're still nowhere near as open as the competition and I
would loved to see features like these I don't know 10 years ago but late is better than never and on that note similar to the competition you're going to be able to do stuff from the lock screen now like take a note instead of being locked to just the camera and flashlight buttons man that's a really big one oh speaking of phone locks another feature Apple has always been big on has been security and privacy so of course we're getting more of that with the ability to lock and hide
individual apps what's really cool is that any info from a locked app won't even appear in other places like in search or notifications so finally I can lend yvon my phone without her seeing a random grinder notification wait who put that in the script we don't talk about that no I'm I'm joking obviously I'm more of a Scruff guy anyway but in all seriousness this is a great feature for personal privacy or even just parents who lend their phone to their kids and don't want their stuff messed up on the
subject of personal privacy you can now choose which contacts an app can see when it requests access so you can avoid your weird uncle on Instagram or what have you and you can keep your Bluetooth accessories private and hide them from anything else that might be on your network like your computer or your TV it's funny because I don't think I've ever asked for that but now it just seems like a brain dead obvious thing like notifying someone when a call is being recorded should also obviously be
a thing uh texting is also getting some love with super cool features for messaging like satellite messaging on iPhone 14 and up when you're off grid and scheduled send dude I love scheduled send I use it all the time with Gmail and teams and they've added support for text formatting like bold metallics uh text effects using any Emoji or sticker for tap acts and at long last RCS or Rich communication Services messaging support wow I feel like that was a lot and there's more moving mov on to mail
it's getting some love as well with the ability to categorize everything something that Gmail has been doing for a while now but still nice to see here and it's nice to see topography in the maps app and the ability to properly plan hiking trails including turn-by-turn directions Apple pay is also getting just about the coolest thing ever tap to cash so you can perform quick private user to user transactions along with thirdparty browser support even with some of the stuff we're not getting to too like the
ability to stallin people out of your photos or game mode which reduces background sessions and reduces response time for Bluetooth accessories like headphones and controllers it really feels like apple has absolutely knocked this out of the park but wait there's more switching over to Mac OS they're making it a lot more appealing to switch over to Mac OS Sequoia adds some major improvements to using your eye devices together with continuity need to answer a message on your iPhone but too lazy to
get up and go grab it with iPhone mirroring Apple's answer to Microsoft phone link you can it is fully interactable and whether you're docked or in standby mode or your iPhone is just sitting on the kitchen table the only person who can see what you're doing is you and they have finally done it guys you get suggested tile layouts when you drag a window to a corner or to the edge of your screen it's a feature Windows has had natively for a while now and I'm very very happy to see it here
the same goes for their new presenter preview and background replacement capabilities for FaceTime and zoom uh there's a new passwords app for keychain that stores all your passwords pass keys and Verification codes okay that was just like before but now it's on all devices including Windows via iCloud for Windows which should make dipping your toes into the ecosystem just a little bit easier it's even available for the Vision Pro haha that's right Apple hasn't given up on it there's not a lot
to talk about with vision os2 um there's ultrawide monitor mirroring now and you can turn 2D images into 3D ones uh but mainly it seems like apple just really wants people to develop for the Vision Pro with a bunch of new developer API support with that said they are making spatial content a lot easier to make with a new professional workflow and an EOS R7 spatial lens for Canon all of this still super expensive but we'll have it and all the other Apple products we mentioned today in the link down
below will also have the new iPad with its stunning tandem OLED screen we did a short circuit on that recently I couldn't believe my eyes pads get it anyway it's confirmed to be getting a ton of new support with iPad OS 18 um there's a lot of overlap obviously with iOS 18 I like the customization features we talked about earlier as well as the new floating tab bar that morphs into the sidebar um and just about everything's getting new animations to look cool and flashy but what's huge
huge on iPad OS is the fact that it's finally got a calculator yeah okay that doesn't seem like the kind of thing that I would normally get excited about but along with math notes this thing fcks and it's also available on Mac OS there's way too much to cover about their calculator in this video but I think it's safe to say that if you're going to school for anything math and graphing heavy it is going to be an absolute GameChanger another big deal is the remote permissions capability that your
friendly Neighborhood Family it guy or girl is going to love that's right no more endlessly repeating instructions over the phone to help grandma or Grandpa access the photos they hid in some random folder now you can just ask for remote access and do it yourself got to love it that is assuming that your grandma can figure out how to allow remote access and when you pick up your Apple TV remote you now get the ability to run 21 by9 widescreen projectors for a full-frame cinematic experience okay
we didn't have much of a segue into that but that's a cool feature if you're lucky enough to have a 21 by9 widescreen projector in screen uh if not you can still access the other big new tvos feature by pulling out what Apple's calling Insight which will provide you with shotby shot information on actors and background music it's actually a lot cooler than it sounds when you see it happening in real time and if you guys need to mute that music or rewind that scene close captions will come up automa
ically to keep your latest binge going strong and if you just want to hear what the actors are saying you can toggle on their new dialogue enhancer nothing groundbreaking here but little tweaks nonetheless love to see them if tweaks to Apple TV make you uh roll your eyes and shake your head then Siri would have taken that personally as a command the airpods pro will finally be able to respond to Siri prompts like incoming calls or text messages silently with just a nod or Shake of the head that
means that in a noisy envir M you can answer a call with a nod and the upgraded voice isolation Tech will kick in and hopefully let the person on the other side hear you and not the Jackhammer that is working on the street that you're trying to cross Safari's got a couple of new features too like highlights which uses machine learning to highlight relevant information as you browse it's neat but I'm not nearly as sold on it as I was on the new redesigned reader viiew which now
removes distractions from articles gives you a table of contents and includes a summary I can't help but wonder what ad Service delivery networks go sorry excuse me um kind help but wonder what they're going to think about all of this is it technically not blocking ads if they just defocus them R tray is interesting anywh who guys there's so much more they've updated their game porting tool kit they've made improvements to Safari they've updated the health app and watch
OS in general and last but not least uh there's the segue to our sponsor I fix it repairing your laptop might seem like brain surgery but with I fix it it doesn't have to be all you need is a steady hand and I Fixit guides high quality tools and reliable replacement parts let's break it down together first match your laptop and it's issue with one of their step-by-step repair walkthroughs then pick up the exact component you require you can trust I fix it to carry pretty much anything you
