welcome to Scrapyard Wars where Luke and I compete to build the best computer on a fixed budget we get to play with an enormous $800 including a hundred bucks to spend on whatever we want from our sponsor Jawa you're not building just a computer you're doing a full gaming setup oh so like monitor keyboard mouse yes desk chair desk at the end of the week our setups will be put through the ultimate Gauntlet to find out who wins scrapyard Wars  first deal am I going to get away with
this the voice you have to change the voice sorry hello um so we're yeah we're here to pick up the PC yeah you can come in oh thank you very much um yeah it's upstairs it's there just like photos I'll log in you guys can take a look around make sure it works okay thank you great I'm going to have to take most of those drives out okay yeah no problem should be good to go thank you very much we can just wait outside if that works for you I'll just wait here hello hi no problem take your time you seem
pretty good with those machines uh yeah I've had a bit of practice here and there how do you find this that's a cool screwdriver yeah it is pretty nice I actually use it today to change an oil filter on my car prettyy oh where you get it uh from a guy called LS hi mango your name is mango right sorry he's a door to door salesman or no just online YouTube actually kind of  you yeah I one do you have the cash thank you so 1 2 3 400 thank you very much one question for you when did
you figure out who we were um I saw your car in the background unfortunately and it's a very distinct rap but the deal was not affected by real okay didn't really know until you guys kind out here on the car outside okay tell me would you be able to tell I think the eyes are kind of a dead giveaway that's my makeup artist right there we we hired a a professional from the industry to come in and uh that's the shtick this season it's a nice screwdriver you got there yeah it's been
pretty good I haven't lost anything thankfully that's okay there's bits available from from where from LT LTT store.com that's right you better believe it yeah you know what's funny we were like we saw the screwdriver he brought it out in the Box I was like M yeah how's the screwdriver that looks cool and then he was like yeah it kind of looks like you I was like we got busted you know what as long as it doesn't affect the deal then it's legal yo that's pretty good do you want to
know the best part they were literally across the street from the labs building what I literally got in the truck and just went boom and they were like oh you're from lonus right I'm like yep it's free though cuz we already agreed to free beforehand the deal was already made the deal was made I don't want us to be cheating but yeah there's a little bit of sus stuff there's sound proofing on the underneath of it and there's a bunch of like white splatters we can clean it
yeah oh yeah yeah yeah no black lights one of the guys agreed to $500 for 3080 that leaves us with $194 there's a decent amount of systems available at around that price usually i5s i7s around like 7th eth gen power supply is going to be our issue some of these Brands I've never heard of so that does sketch me a little bit you know what's not sketchy though buying from Jawa Jawa is an online Marketplace for buying and selling new and used computers and parts and Jawa vets their
verified sellers to make sure they're providing the community with top deals and service and best of all you're protected every time you make a purchase through the Jawa moneyback guarantee check them out using the link in the description and enter their scrapyard Wars giveaway more on that later bye if they're like 7 years old throwing a 3080 on it might be a little o because of the big spikes right it does but if we have three of them it's redundancy Each pie power connector is a different power
supply would that be three power supplies and then one for the motherboard one for the drive so we end up buying like five power supplies we go get a power bar and it's just part of the build you you have to have this power he's going to look at the computer at the end he's be like why are there five power cables coming off of this uh I just don't I don't know if it works everyone is saying don't do it in forums but nobody's saying you can't the one we're getting recommends a
750 watt yeah but for a system with one in it like how much power draw is just a 3080 taking uh 320 watt according to Zotac site so we could get away with like a 400 watt you can't no way why no no I'm just saying just a 400 just for the GPU yeah yeah yeah yeah this we we are fairly committed to multiple power supp we also need to be ready to kill our babies and move on from this idea Tom am I allowed to drink it's hard though um just move the out of the way you got it all right should we have a
look at what we scored okay yeah cuz I never got a close look at it cuz I was pretending to not know what's going on confused okay we're just going to pull over right here so we have a full system basically without storage right six core processor 16 gigs Ram this GPU is going to go cuz we bought that one on job already so what that means is Sammy we need to start creating listings for any of this stuff that we are not going to keep okay like now cuz we got to sell this stuff I didn't tell you this but
I'm $80 over budget right now okay the good news is the total stuff that we're buying for $780 right is about "$1,150 worth of stuff okay however we're" probably going to have to sell it soon so we have to undercut ourselves and so "we have to sell it for less than 1,00" bucks [Applause] yeah how do you want to do division of labor here uh you take it out and I can make the listing look pretty okay you might have to dilate that a little so do you want to grab pictures then y uh the
ram we're keeping I don't think we can afford this cooler the other system has a stock cooler so we're going to use that instead do do you do you so shme do you you you got this she's got this I just want to get these listings up as soon as as possible because coming in under budget at all is reliant on us selling at least some of it oh God this is definitely dirtier than I initially realized no judgment though no judgment okay are you ready to take the next picture yeah okay do you want to grab
this oh my God a snake kidding kidding okay so this GPU is going to go let's get the back panel off here youve man hands can you hold this yeah should oh you know what we should do though we should clean the goop off the bottom make it shinier oh no don't touch that it'll get all over your hands forever should we post it right away or can we wait until I clean it up and make it look nicer no no we're going to clean it up right now we got this don't even trip okay hi sorry yep technically legal what
we're doing a little weird but legal weird yes there's also dust on the outside I'm working on it any luck is it working no you're breathing it all in next time you drink water it'll tastes like dirt so let's put that on the dirty side okay she kind of cleans up pretty decent here yep oh I guess I'll probably write the posts or you know what I can help you wait do you get carick no nice so I can dictate when we're in the car and you can post okay we got this hey wao wao wo we ended up
with a hard drive that I wasn't expecting oh uh I told them we'd give it back to him if we found any storage oh for crying out loud it's the biggest one bloody hell Daniel that was his name right yep this power supply we're keeping so there's no point extracting all of this yet but the case is going to go I think I have enough photos I think this like on the Porsche logo yeah but then if if we try to get a better price they'll be like you don't need that money yeah that and if Luke sees it
he'll know it's us yeah we can bait Luke and then ghost him that's the best it's not actually about saving money first I'm going to clean this CPU this CPU is going to go we've got another one that's almost exactly the same it actually boosts a little lower but it's a weird 4500 that most people don't seem to have heard of so they're going for a lot less so I'd rather take the small performance hit and get the most money back possible this CPU is one of the most liquid
things we have it should be really easy to move okay do you feel ridiculous yet yes good that means you're doing it right hold on we might want to do this but this would be the sketchiest possible they have LT Edition knock to a fans it would be very hard for them to not recognize us Duke and what was it young mic or whatever what is it what is it AMD ryzen 54500 oh it's only a 430 W power supply do you think if we say hey no hard drive no Quadro no power supply maybe in a case no
case I mean you could go for it just be like 125 bucks posted 18 days ago that's a long time ago why isn't it selling that's one stick of memory maybe that's why people aren't buying it but like maybe the guy's willing to take the ram out too like hey brother we really just need the motherboard and CPU everything else can go away honestly we don't need the GPU hello we're back you forgot your hard drive yeah I was looking for it in there and I couldn't find it it was in
the hard drive sled you don't happen to have the mounting hardware for that CPU Cooler for like other sockets oh I do and since I'm at it the motherboard box as well do you have the motherboard accessories I have both of those all right success awesome see you later have a good one man that worked out great oh look at that we've got thermal compound and everything we appear to have the full complement of mounting hardware for our cooler let's take a photo of our combo
okay oh my good okay we still got to get the case just going to do a quick wipe down don't worry we got this it'll be worth it when we see Luke's crying face at the end he'll cry real tears interesting take on a friendship look if you can't Delight in the tears of your friends then you know really what is there in life a lot of other things like food but imagine if you could season your food with Luke's tears this is the best place to do this there is no better method also the fact that lonus had his
LTT keychain out oh yeah that did did not help do we have everything we need oh son of a gun Daniel I feel bad but I really need the modular cables from this power supply hello we're sorry thank you very much thank you so much sorry to be a pain in the butt I promise not to knock on your door again I'll ring the bell okay it's older but it has more cores and more threads it's a ryzen 7700 so it's first gen ryzen that's pretty good but it comes with the motherboard 16 gigs of
RAM that's pry 750 W power supply that's amazing no GPU nor storage that's fine 170 that's amazing it's a it's 3.7 GHz turbo at 8 cores 16 threads do you think they're going to have eight cores they'll probably beat us on CPU I don't feel like they're going to they might I don't feel if they're going to get a 3080 this was listen 4 days ago and he says he's unable to test it unfortunately but like 170 and that gives us the rest of the system cuz it's 16 gigs of RGB Ram bro it's good I don't
think it's necessarily the best thing we could possibly find this other system that I found where we'd have to like hopefully get them to take some things out of it like the quadro and stuff which is way less likely yeah would be better but it's less likely this one sounds pretty realistic like even if he didn't take a deal with us yeah it works cuz it's the whole still in our budget too so we should start moving on that this guy's in kitum do you want me to lowball him or do you want me to say hey
before I lowball I always open with is this available I can pick it up either tomor basically be like I'm committed I can come to you and get it I'm not I'm not one of those people asking for delivery and I have cash I can give you now our success hinges on selling some of the components that we bought cuz we've got a lot of duplicates in our first two deals so Sammy is working on getting all of our posts up on Facebook marketplace right now we're going to land back at the office and she's going
to have about half an hour more overlapping with me where we can kind of plan out the rest of her night and then she gets another 3 hours so she's going to go pick up our next deal pretty much right away when we get back and then dude I have no idea beyond that Sammy We're going to have to figure that out yeah oh you can monitor if people want to buy our stuff the guy on the 13080 wants to pick it up after 6:00 p.m. tomorrow which doesn't work we were supposed to deliver the systems to Labs
at 600 p.m. can we get after 600 p.m. today that is then for sure locking Us in to this and we're like we're we're in deep brother that means tomorrow is going to yeah but we we would have some time to find another system before then sure okay can I pick it up today okay uh title Corsair carbide 275r computer case I would go gaming case or yeah oh yeah PC or computer is probably there a search right yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so gaming PC computer case yep let's go full SEO baby
let's go the dude wants you to pick up the 380 at 6:15 p.m. today yeah that's fine I can do it are we committing to it are we committing to it 3080 oh man I think this decision is going to make or break if we win scrap your Wars right now yeah hi I have other people offering full price can you do 200 an hour ago oh my second deal backed off on the $20 discount I suspect the other person offering full price is Luke it's a really really good deal I'm a little surprised he found it though but at this
point I'd rather pay the extra 20 bucks knowing that I'll just have to sell a little bit more and know that he's not getting that deal it's a really good deal okay we got to focus in pretty hard on finding a system because right now we actually have no leads that have responded this guy's selling a ryzen 5 3600 for 65 bucks but just the CPU so it's like we need to find you can find the rest of the platform let's go I found a motherboard for $100 20 which would put us at $185 so we need $10 for
Ram and power supply like maybe if I talk them down we'll get lucky but the guy who listed the CPU listed it 4 minutes ago message him try to talk him down it's worth it's worth we don't have anything right now we got to chase everything we possibly can we got an uh hit on our listing which one which one on the CPU already they're friends with 18 people including your wife on Facebook wait it's Luke Duke Maro yeah it's Luke what a piece of nice try Luke yeah got him oh okay I messaged the CPU
guy and I said hey I have cash and can pick up tomorrow he just responded with nice try Luke wait but now he knows it's us oh yeah maybe we shouldn't have said that his name is John who is this guy wait John stuck isn't that lius isn't that lonus his name he saw it unlucky we should have wasted his time oh that sucks I thought we had a real bite how is I wonder if he doesn't even have it yet and he's like pre-listing it hi John buyer name would you take 40 cash for this for the CPU 40 bucks I can reply
with 55 what did we list it for uh 65 do you want to check what the other listings for the 3600 are on Facebook Marketplace cuz I think we're already the lowest other people are listing it for 60 let's offer him 50 we can do 50 yeah well don't say we oh oh what is check Facebook Messenger check Facebook Messenger which one which one which one check Facebook Messenger holy sh dude we're back in it brother let's go okay so that was the guy who had the ryzen 7700 and a 750 W power supply and 16
gigs of RAM for 170 for 170 bucks meaning we will have 25 bucks as wiggle room to do like dude at 1700 so good I think it's good it's a little old got another bite on the Corsair case I thought the case was going to be hard to sell you must have taken great photo Sammy yes maybe the Duke should have chosen to be a king then he would have a crown are you going to be Fielding messages all night selling this stuff cuz like I can't believe how active these posts are it's it can't be real I
can reply to multiple people at the same time got that Zoomer energy love it do you just sell CPU GPU and in case or do you have motherboard too yeah I got a motherboard we have a motherboard too no we sorry I can more or less guarantee you they'll have a better processor are they going to have a better GPU I mean they do have a better processor right now they have 3600 and they're selling it them selling a processor has me pretty concerned all right well well hold on so what all is he interested in
can we add it up because it occurred to me with how we're kind of pricing things according to how it is on Facebook and then like discounting a bit I don't actually know for sure that we're making money like I haven't checked you know this listing is being reviewed did someone like report it did Luke report it that would be quite the move I'm worried they're going to make the benchmarks like super lame like really heavy like storage and CPU based which like no one will ever do or use or care
about you guys in the comments can show how upset you are you would want a 3080 right right right and you can have it if you want a shot at that 3080 and Luke's entire system you're going to want to check out jawwa giveaway campaign for scrapyard Wars every week they'll have new prizes to give away including Jawa gift cards a pre-built gaming PC with a 4080 super and some super secret prizes to be revealed later so go get entered using the link in the description got to go yeah wait we may not have actually
uhoh this may not be smart maybe that's why so many people are messaging us though maybe our pricing is a little bit uh too low a little stressed this may have just been an exercise in doing the math swapping cash back for cash okay we'll be fine though we'll be fine let's "get the 1,700 that power supply alone is" for our whole system let's just send it you want to pick that up tonight if possible yeah so like 6:15 is the the GPU where was the GPU did the guy get back to you I don't know oh he hasn't
responded after you sent that 20 minutes ago do you think he's faking selling stuff he he just read it right now I watched him so I should I just ask him if he wants me to pick it up now I say I got off work early I Pi up now okay so I need to do that yeah I got off work early I can go pick it up now I'm doing a lot of driving I'm driving all the way to Richmond to pick up a 3080 I'm then driving all the way to quam to pick up that uh ryzen 7 system I need to go ask ACC counting to break this into 20s cuz
I don't really want to show up and be like do you have 30 yo brother I got Hondos yeah day two starting I got the GPU yesterday and I got the full tower the guy did recognize me which was fun the haircut didn't work you were still okay with 170 though that's what you agreed on so I'm not using my influence to get a Deal rules Tech tips I never thought this day would come and we bought it for literally what he listed it at yeah cuz we suck at bargaining we haven't tested it yet we're going to test the GPU in
the computer make sure it works we have $25 left we still need to get keyboard mouse mouse pad and chair we really need to verify the TPU works yeah how'd it go the seller from Craigslist they haven't responded so I tried texting them again hopefully they'll reply they're not replying to me and I text so I went and I sat in his Lobby and kept emailing him hi I'm here and then eventually I picked it up we have it right here I didn't get to like plug it in cuz we were in the
lobby otherwise I sat there and I hit refresh until 9:00 p.m. all night to see if we got more messages didn't really get many so I'm a little worried about selling right now we need to buy more stuff before we can even sell anything though we don't even have storage oh so we're going to pick up storage at around 11:20 and we're going to pick up a keyboard at 11: we still need a mouse and monitor and a desk and a chair a desk desks are free we just have to find one where the person is available so
here's our 3080 it's quite dusty but the guy told me he like just pulled it out of his computer to go do the sale so I'm hoping that's accurate oh oh crap is it long enough okay it's a snug fit but it does fit in the computer case that I'm not worried about we can always make things fit the power supply that it comes with I opened it up it's 750 bronze from thermal take we're pushing the limits here on like if this GPU is going to be fine didn't even realize we bought such
new hardware still has the plastic peel on look at that brand new case basically Andy would be disappointed I peeled it but you know what that's fine all right   on it kicked off a lot of dust do you hear that I do that fan does not sound healthy I think it's this front one hey there you go there it is ryzen 7700 8 core processor got our 16 gigs of RAM so our memory 2133 not the fastest definitely not that's pretty slow but you know what we have 38 I found us a desk it's a solid wood
desk oh that guy lies that's not solid wood I saw that one those are MDF desks you know what at this point I uh think we might just have to go with it though can you throw in a chair yes but they are old that is okay I mean we might as well if we don't want it we can find another one so I need to go get that keyboard like now uh I should be done very shortly it's 40 minutes away that's gone up since I looked it up I can message them okay I don't think we'll make it in time for the SSD Linus I may
lose this one but damn it I'm going look good doing it he said 1110 is the latest he can do got to leave okay we got to go then I'm coming okay now oh God we need to get these products listed can I take apart a computer in the back seat I guess we're doing that hey look at that this Nas build has one of those old LTT Edition n ff12 fans oh hello good good how are you good um I talked with my boss are you available tomorrow by CH o unfortunately no it would have to be today that's the tech shop that we
called yesterday calling back I worry that this place is going to know my voice though cuz I've definitely called you me do it what was your name L uh Duke I think it should be fine okay awesome thanks sorry for sorry for being difficult here don't be sorry 11:30 this morning okay great okay so we might have some pretty major curveballs cuz that's the shop and they could potentially have keyboard mouse yes for us which would save us the 10 bucks some audio thing probably not but they would also
probably have ddr4 Ram so if we really want to we could look at the speed and go to 32 gigs or we could find faster memory might also be a possibility for a platform swap yeah this could like this could really change dramatically change things according to this board it says it has an mvme slot I don't see it though so I don't know if it's on the back or under the GPU so I'm going to pull this back out and take a quick look oh yeah there it is okay cool I also am going to take out the ram I want to see
what speed we have have on this just so when we go look there maybe they have faster or if they have similar we could potentially go from 16 to 32 or something a lot up in the air right now so I took the ram out it actually does support up to 3200 so we could just enable XMP and hopefully get that full performance much better than 21 33 or whoever it was how are the listings going I might have a buyer for a bunch of stuff this name guy might want Ram CPU case Mobo and GPU he's making me
kind of a low offer but um we are over budget right now and we need some money we just need the SSD we need a monitor monitor that's the thing literally doing the makeup on the way there this is quite funny I love this right little bit of balancing all right banking right nice okay nice okay well we're here all right I misspelled outside three times okay well that's never matter how do I look great never better hi for the keyboard um I don't have cash on me can i e transfer you at
all okay so it was $10 right and can I take a look at the keyboard thank you do you want to try it out do you think you'll like this one they have the WD gamer okay thank you it's good okay thank you uh let me know if you get it or it should be sent sounds good yeah thank you very much have a good day okay thank you I don't know he glanced at me a couple times but I'm uh not sure if he suspected anything uh I need the address for the second place oh yeah for sure um sorry yeah for sure and can you let them
know that we're on our way we'll be there around 1125 hi this is Duke uh I'm on the road now the current ETA is 1140 does that still work uh yeah sure I'll let them know you'll be there is your name Luke or Duke Duke Duke okay comes up as Luke so I was like did I get your name wrong oh yeah that's a weird thing with Facebook um I actually changed my name quite a few years back but Facebook sometimes just doesn't it sends the old one I don't know okay yeah I'll let them know you
said you're going to be there 11:40 okay sounds good I never messaged them on Facebook that's caller ID yep yeah yeah I I was like no well we'll see how this goes we're good yeah I'm just going to powder man buddy here wants $250 for ryzen 3600 with cooler and motherboard and the Corsair case and 8 gigs of RAM and the 1660 super and the cx430 power supply that pretty much leaves us with only like kind of worthless stuff that's basically all we can sell that puts us back in the green
though how much in the green by like 80 90 bucks I'm going to do 250 with the cougar case I'm going to say final offer so we keep the nice case from d Daniel y it'd be nice to be able to move all this to one person we don't have like a week to dick around selling to half a dozen different people where the hell is dunar Community Center he wants us to go all the way out to Vancouver that is in the middle of nowhere I don't live in dunar should I offer to come all the way to
dunar for an extra 10 bucks 10 15 15 I'm being a fair guy I'm a fair guy oh man we are bang on time for this guy let's go what is this for okay hello hello hi nice to meet you yes this is John all right hi yes can I get you to put in your e transfer no cash only oh oh we have 100 I have a change oh okay perfect so John I did test and sent you the uh the screenshot of the test did you see it on the messenger yeah yeah okay thank you very much do you want to give him the cash yeah any much yes yes
that's I'm kind of in a rush to oh no worries thank you very much thank you have a great day okay thank you I'll walk slower for you hi young lady I um I don't think I got mated either the last two no no I was like a little sus cuz he like smiled a bit too much yeah I think he was I think he was just friendly hey Tom hey Tom right there buddy all right rock on let's go all right byebye let me find out if this name guy if we got to deal with him have we confirmed a time with the desk guy uh
he said anytime before 5 hell yeah that's super flexible okay that helps a lot where's he at uh somewhere in sui okay beautiful beautiful oh you know what we might pull this off all right so we're almost at the computer shop I am getting progressively more worried that they're going to recognize me but I will be going in with Lindsay uh who is my sister yes okay yeah second Sister We're yeah and we're building a computer for our other sister's son our nephew Ryan Yes uh who is seven here's the whole I
got to add in the the Hat this is the full Ensemble um which is not a word I will be saying while we're inside a biker would never say that word no I don't think so yeah PA get up this is a get up yeah this name PA offered $10 fee and meet in the afternoon I think we might have to take it I guess if that's the best we got that's the best we got and ruthless he's getting a great deal the good news is his deal wasn't as good as mine so I'm still out ahead let's go one thing I will tell you about name no is
he is not getting these KN to a fans I'm going to swap them out for the fans that are in that other system I got five knock to a fans in here he's getting zero of them oh my God see I was afraid of this our mass storage Sammy is going to be a a mobile 2 and 1/2 in hard drive look look at the little thing hello we are here um I've got to leave you guys behind now but we're going to we're going to go in there and try to get her done which is something he would say all right so keyboard mouse desk pad
speakers speakers chair if they have a chair uh you could get a second power supply just in case if there's Ram that's like similar speed or slow like slightly slower but we can get more of it that might also be better yeah yeah okay and then platform swap if I don't know they're recycling 11th gens or something like you don't think they'll have an AMD they never we never dealt with AMD when we built the systems unless they're recycling someone else's computer that is AMD all right let me
try to hide the mics real quick yeah make sure mics are hidden I'm like so nervous I don't know why I'm not even going in there and I'm I'm the nervous one I'm wearing a wire dude I think I'm just going to have one wire coming down but I honestly don't think they're going to notice it I think him going in with Lindsay is actually going to help a ton too okay cool Co see you guys in a bit you ready yeah we'll make it work yeah or we won't it'll be funny either way my name's still Lindsay right yeah yeah yeah
yeah we're still going to be okay but we have to go like now no it's stuck on CPU are you kidding me oh no no no no no this is bad are you murdering innocent civilians yes good that's a mentality we need in scrapyard Wars Duke
