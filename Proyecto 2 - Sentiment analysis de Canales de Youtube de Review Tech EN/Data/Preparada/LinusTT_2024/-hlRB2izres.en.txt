what these guys are thinking I can't hold to quickly uninstall apps the search bar is where I want my time and weather to be and I can't move the navigation buttons what those are all stock Android features man right I guess I have been kind of faithful to the Samsung ecosystem for a while maybe I don't know what stock Android truly is quick somebody get me a phone with a stock AOSP image ah perfect a pi pixel 8 Pro with GSI I'm going to use this for a month then I'm going to 
learned that's it I'm out how can anyone use this I don't know when or how this happened but it happened crappy vendor skins that's the good Android now and stock Android it's a broken mess and wait wait wait before you shoot the messenger give me a chance to explain and a chance to tell you about our sponsor MSI if you need a new entry-level gaming laptop or a Powerhouse gaming laptop or an AI capable laptop or a gaming handheld msi's got you covered with their summer sale event check out their sweet deals
on laptops like this cyborg 14 using the  my first gamebreaking issue hit me almost immediately I wanted to take some pictures at one of my kids birthday parties and I was like oh this is great timing I can use the fancy pixel camera instead of my old note 9 but then I launched the camera and I'm like what even is this not only is the app shockingly Bare Bones I'm talking timer grid lines Flash and O you can switch to the front camera if you want to get fancy but it's also super unintuitive
after I'd recorded some video I couldn't for the life of me figure out how to get back to photo mode without closing and completely restarting the app I did eventually figure out that there's a gesture a dang it this is exactly what I'm talking about there we go there's a gesture to bring up the mode select or to see your gallery but if you start that gesture anywhere near the edge of the phone as you guys just saw it it just closes the app and things like that just kept happening let's look at
something even more basic a phone call I can start a call just fine dial a number bring up a contact the Wes but once the call is started I am completely at the mercy of whoever I called because for the life of me I could not figure out how to hang up a phone call there's no gesture and even pressing the power button to end the call is not enabled by default as it turns out there isn't any default app configured for phone calls so when you make or receive a call you're initiating some kind of dark
ritual then that links you directly to the phone's brain stem and okay sure no one talks on the phone anymore lus you dinosaur but come on the app is there why aren't we using it uh what else Bluetooth was weird I could pair devices pretty reliably but then actually making audio playback go through my airpods Pro twos whole other story and the Bluetooth settings even crashed pretty often when I tried to open them uh while I was in the settings menu I tried to switch the Wi-Fi hotspot to 5 GHz and it would
acknowledge I was touching the screen and even refresh the page but would not register the change 2.4 GHz worked fine though uh wireless emergency alerts appear to be totally missing when you click the entry in the menu it just drops you back a menu level and screen saver was enabled but without a screen saver selected so my screen was not saved okay that last one's pretty minor but one that really irked me was needing to hit enter after my pin I hear this is finally changeable on Pixel devices with
Android 14 but it's not changeable on this one which brings us to the surprising Revelation that this experiment brought us to there isn't really a functional stock Android anymore there is stock Android and getting it is pretty straightforward we used a pixel 8 Pro thinking well I mean Google's own phone should surely be a good starting point for Google's own operating system and we downloaded a GSI or generic system image of Android 15 that's built from the Android open
source project or AOSP we picked up one with GMS or Google mobile services because I need Play store apps and that was it we got stock Android it just sucks so much that we kind of didn't even trust the results so as a sanity check we also loaded up a pixel 8 nonpr with the same image so that the team could confirm that my problems were not user ER without me having to give them my phone all the time and they weren't I'm speaking of pixels by the way have you checked out our dead pixel
collection LTT store.com but hold on a second let's back up AOSP is the fundamental code that all manufacturers of Android phones build upon it's a pillar of open- source Purity how could it be bad well whatever it may have been in the past these days AOSP is less of an operating system and it's more of a starting point all manufacturers yes even Google themselves adds their own drivers UI customizations and apps that give their devices a unique flavor and as this practice has become more common
it's clear that less and less effort has gone into maintaining stock apps and functions that no one's going to use anyway now I've mostly been a Samsung boy in recent years so I'm most familiar with their oneui and I've seen your comments that it's clear that lius CES one UI as kind of a base line for Android and you know what there's probably some truth to that maybe you have used Sony's xeria UI for years and you think of that is normal we're both wrong there is no normal Android even
the Android that you get with a pixel device is not stock Google's pixel UI may be their vision for what Android should be but there's no money importing all of their pixel exclusive Visions back into AOSP though of course in some cases that could be considered a good thing Google does not generally include micro SD slots for expanded storage in their devices but Android still has support for external storage in AOSP I think the funniest thing about this for me is that while we still see people
evangelizing the stock Android experience it's actually been dead for a lot longer than most people realize even Google's older Nexus line of phones got progressively less stock as time went on with apps for things like calendar messages web browsing gradually being replaced with similar Google Apps and they even started using their own custom launcher that wasn't available for other phones luckily though if you're not happy with the skin used on your phone you might be able to switch it up with a
custom rom that is a version of Android that's made by someone other than one of the major phone manufacturers I wouldn't really recommend this on a device that's still being supported by the manufacturer but if your device is no longer supported custom roms can get give you access to the latest security patches or even entirely new versions of Android and help keep an old phone viable well past the manufacturers end of support before you get too excited though you will need
a device with an unlockable bootloader in order to do this thankfully these days that's many devices with some notable exceptions like Asus where there isn't currently an official unlock method and it's worth noting that even if your phone works certain features like Samsung's S Pen for example or especially secure features like NFC payments and Bank apps might not work the way you would expect out of the box once you've got your bootloader unlocked though you can choose a custom rom none
of which are stock Android and if anything gives me more appreciation for the incredible work that these teams have done over the years it is the experience of using stock Android uh some of the notable examples of custom roms include lineage OS which is lightly customized quite stable and often used as a base for other custom roms a pixel OS is one that aims to bring a pixel likee experience to devices from non-google manufacturers graphine OS and calx Os both aimed to prevent Google
from tracking your location and other data but take kind of different approaches Paranoid Android has been around almost forever and I think is pretty self-explanatory and of course there's that one that you're screaming at your screen right now because I'm a terrible terrible person who's ignoring what is clearly the best custom ROM so I'll tell you what I'm going to leave it out so you can be the one to write it in the comments and collect your precious up votes you're welcome with that out of
