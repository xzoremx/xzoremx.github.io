whatever your political beliefs we can all agree that China and the West have taken on a more adversarial relationship in recent years so whether you're rooting for Chinese Innovation or wary of it we wanted to make this video a window into what exactly is going on over in the 100 Acre Wood now there is one part of this build we couldn't get from a Chinese company yet the processor there are several domestic x86 chips like the Xin that we looked at a few years ago but they are nowhere near the
performance and efficiency of a modern Intel or AMD chip more like CS slow that is why we settled on the next best thing Intel's Black Edition China exclusive Core i5 13490 F it's basically a 13400 F but with increased boost clocks and 20% more level three Cash There's no offici word from Intel on why these exist or who they're even targeting with them but Intel has been building these black edition chips for the Chinese market for three generations now just like how for
three generations my forefathers have been producing Segways to our sponsor ODU throw away all those mismatching apps that you've been using to run your business odu's all-in-one business software can help you focus on improving your business not juggling apps click the link below or watch till the end of this video video to learn more to pair with our deliciously smooth Black Label processor Macon sent over their icraft z790 white motherboard it's got all the usual accessories in the box like a QR
code that you can scan that thanks you for choosing their graphics card the user manual which is also a QR code you scan and only available in Chinese luckily Google translate does PDFs now as well as the standard cables a nice little case badge and some Ultra Kawaii Enchanted princess stickers but that's not what I'm into this is what I'm into it comes with a mounting plate that you can use while you test your build outside the case how cool is that and it even comes with a little screwdriver it
has a Gen 5 GPU slot with a mix of gen 3 and four for the rest all four m.2 slots are Gen 4 and it's got a pretty decent mix of IO considering the price USB 20 gig 2 and 1/2 gig Len Intel Wi-Fi and a handy dandy clear seos button on the back altogether this is an uncharacteristically premium looking motherboard from a brand that I've only ever really known for its weird products and for $149 un MSRP or about $160 it's right in line with the cheapest z790 motherboards on the market
though maybe that makes sense that they can't charge a premium given their brand reputation back in 2018 it was revealed that some of Max Sun's h310 motherboards weren't using the h310 chipset at all instead instead they used minor Hardware modifications and some bios hackery to make h110 chipsets appear as h310 allowing the use of eth gen Intel processors but what they couldn't spoof was the ability to use ddr4 Ram however none of this is so bad that they don't deserve a shot at Redemption and Max
Sun's strategy seems to be a good one targeting the budget-minded high-end gamer which is going to end up being a bit of a theme for this build continuing with our Ram we'll be using this pair of dual Channel 16 GB sharp blade ddr5 sticks from kingb bank that ow no I'm just kidding they're they're "not actually sharp they run at 6,400" megat transfers per second support xmp3 and this is cool King Bank lists the exact chips that they're using on these sticks which is a welcomed move that I
wish more manufacturers would adopt as long as we can trust them to use what they say they're using and King Bank I'm not so sure see they say they've been around since 2001 but their website only shows up on the Wayback machine as far as 2018 and their account on the popular e-commerce platform jd.com was opened only in 2016 it's not the only thing we were able to dig up on them they were sued alongside a data by the alleged inventor of the USB flash drive back in 2016 but aside from this lawsuit there
doesn't seem to be any readily available information on Google dating them before 16 on BYU however the I chicha business encyclopedia similar to Bloomberg shows them as being registered in 2014 regardless they weren't publicly a noteworthy player in the memory space until sometime after the made in China 2025 campaign kicked off in May 2015 that campaign kickstarted a lot of Chinese tech companies and birthed even more one of those companies is the semiconductor fabricator ymtc who has
made a lot of progress since they're founding in 2016 and who made this SSD this ymtc J Tha pc5 came from a seller on NewEgg it's 1 tbte and it's only pcie gen 3 but it's noteworthy because it was the first SSD to be produced entirely in mainland China it's been common for years to find some made in China components on an SSD but Nan flash chips are usually produced by Korean or Japanese companies while the controllers have often been produced in Taiwan fun fact by the way these chips likely would
have been used in the iPhone 15 were it not for international sanctions originally the plan was to use these chips for iPhones sold in China but because of their lower cost Apple eventually changed the plan to use these for up to 40% of their iPhone n overall at least they were going to do that until 2022 when the US government added why MTC to the trade b list meaning they were no longer able to use American Technologies in their products or their manufacturing processes leading Apple to
drop them from their plans Lenovo still uses ymtc drives in some of their China exclusive systems though now let's talk cooling PC cooler sent us a couple different options from their new CPS line of parts that's aimed at the higher-end market and this is the CPS de 360 a 360 mil AIO with dual pumps whatever that means aluminum fins and a copper base there's not much other information to glean from the outside the base kind of looks like it uses an ACAC cold plate but also the mounting
mechanism is totally different and ACAC doesn't use dual pumps so maybe it's their own homegrown thing I noticed as I was playing with these fans like wow these are really rigid these feel really good wow they look an awful lot like knock to us they've even got the little removable rubber corner pieces so boy are they ever similar we weren't able to find much else about this cooler company but they also sent us this fish tank looking case it's kind of similar to the NZXT H9 flow but with a $100 MSRP which
is $60 cheaper it looks pretty impressive it supports ATX matx Mini ITX and the new ytx motherboard size as well as having support for backside mounted connectors it's undeniably a little cramp to work in I found that in particular screwing in these bottom motherboard screws was pretty tricky but for its size it has ample support for fans and radiators even if it lacks some Creature Comforts like support for a vertical GPU Mount or support for any GPU over 400 MM though luckily the
biggest RTX 490 we came across was 380 mimet so you can put pretty much whatever you want in this thing this is looking great so far aside from the weird yellow discoloration on the water cooling tubes anyo along with their motherboard Max Sun also sent over their RTX 480 which I've been informed is gamer best choice all right Max let's have a look shall we they've got a stabilizer included in the box and a GPU that feels beefy enough to need oh my goodness did they sneak into my brain to come up with
the Aesthetics for this back plate kind's giving me a look but I like it triple fan cooler on the other side and it's got a shorter PCB see it ends right here so you get some of that blowr action that helps with cooling it's not white though the annoying part is that they do actually have a white version that matches The Branding with the enchantment heart princess thing uh it would have really matched the aesthetic of this build but what you going to do other than the mismatched looks I have
no complaints but on the ever popular GPU form on BYU which is kind of China's version of Google users have compared Mac Sun's after after sales support to Asus for what that's worth when one user returned to GPU with a noisy fan they were told it arrived with a scratch and therefore wouldn't be covered under warranty because of physical damage Maxon allegedly pushed the customer to pay for repairs then when the customer refused they said okay well we're just going to send it back without repairing
it except when it came back the customer noted that the serial number didn't match the serial number of the card They sent Maxon did end up issuing a public apology as they should and claimed that they would pun the entire customer service team involved in the incident but whether they learned from that experience or not remains to be seen what I know now is that this thing at least looks pretty interesting even if we would have preferred the waifu Edition at this point we're pretty much
done with this side of the case and it's time to turn our attention to the back where Cable Management uh needs to be a thing and also we've got to install our power supply but what power supply is it well we went a little Overkill and purchased the 12 Heart 100 watt Great Wall Hunter fire F12 on AliExpress despite having fire in big letters on the front of the box it seemingly is a fairly solid offering 80 plus Platinum advertising 93.7% efficiency and Japanese capacitors from
what we can tell it appears they manufactured by nichon Rubicon and possibly nipon chemicon now granted we have not sent this through the labs team yet as of the time of writing but we are going to link to the results for this power supply in a pinned comment as soon as we've got them it feels really light for a 1200 watt power supply H price-wise it's listed usually for around 140 us on popular Chinese Marketplace sites which is pretty appealing for this wattage and efficiency level but we didn't choose it
for the price Great Wall is a very widely distributed brand around the globe but remains Rel relatively unknown in the west this is likely by Design since their focus is on their OEM work rather than their own branded power supplies they provide psus for all kinds of pre-builts as well as for better-known enthusiast Brands like Corsair and Asus this model even uses Corsair type four cables meaning that our kit from cable mod worked perfectly now greatwall is an organization that is
really interesting as a subsidiary of the state-owned China Electronics Corp their sister companies are involved in all kinds of shenanigans there's Tong Guang group an electrical infrastructure manufacturer who's assisted with building belarus's nuclear power plant and fium a fabulous Semiconductor Company who makes arm server processors including for the servers that were used to test China's df7 Hypersonic missile there's also Panda Electronics who manufactures and assembles desktops and
laptops including these kind of neat looking looking water cooled gaming PCs that they built for North Korea they even included a Corsair power supply in it big moment time to see if it works or wait no we're going to need a monitor ah another interesting OEM that many of you might not have heard of is ktc who has a history of producing displays for the likes of Samsung muonic and LG the MSRP for this bad boy is around $200 but on Tabo it regularly sells for $140 250 unfortunately the height isn't
adjustable but it's otherwise comparable to this ONN 27-in curved monitor from Walmart that has the same resolution size panel type refresh rate and response time this one notably has two display port inputs rather than two hdmis and ooh support for hdr10 although at this contrast ratio I'd probably rather have the more robust stand from the o n ktc does produce mini LED and OLED displays as well but at much higher prices let's see if it works oo were all these RGB fans included at
that $100 price yeah six of them man this build looks kind of awesome and look it even booted but wait I'm going to need peripherals meet the Hecate g3m Pro by meets the hakati g3m pro by edify yes that edifier the one that we do know in the west but more for their premium audio products their hiati brand of Esports peripherals includes a few keyboards mice and mobile phone chillers the g3m pro weighs 62 G features a paw 3395 sensor and a little switch on the bottom to switch between
switches that's right you heard me you switch between the switch is noisy quiet noisy quiet the noisy switch is a hanano blue shell pink dot while The Quiet One is a juano micro motion switch that's better and how much fun is this vibrant yellow USBC charging cable these are available for $40 on Chinese sites like Mech keys.com or 55 if you want the transparent version and at that price it seems like a pretty good value across all three pairing modes and with both switch types it managed very reasonable
latency results with only about a half a millisecond added by the 2.4 GHz wireless dongle you know what else has a wireless dongle this f98 keyboard sent To Us by AA it's a 99 key layout it weighs a kilogram and it will run the average cowbow or JD Shopper around 370 un or a bit more than $50 really that that's it huh she Clacks pretty nice for 50 bucks like many of the products we've looked at today it's more expensive through Western Brands like EO maker because I don't know you guilo I guess but anywh
who it's hot swappable and uses semi-transparent ice Soul switches made  company for our first one not too bad function shift seems to change the mode of the RGB on the side that I didn't even notice before it's only no it's on both sides function tab changes the uh can see here as I go function tab not on mine not on your really just wondering if there's a lock somewhere here or something hey there we go function backslash here's all your different lighting modes dang that's cool and in our Labs tests
we found some really great consistency across the board with the switch is traveling 4 mm with a 1.9 mil 40 G actuation point and a bottom out force of 55 G now that's not to say we didn't have any issues on one of our units the screws that hold the name plate onto the front here have caused the transparent plastic to do what transparent plastic does best cracking but it's only a little bit and overall given the price I really like this thing 's biggest claim to fame is not their own-branded
products though but rather their status as an oem of keyboards mice and headphones for companies like HP AOC Philips and lenovo's Leu they also have a wide array of very entry-level mechanical keyboards that can be purchased in bulk for dirt cheap but this collab with EPO maker seems to indicate that their focus could be on premium products in the longer term term now it's time to try it all  together I'll accept that it's time to play some games on this thing but before
we do overall guys I am kind of loving the look of this build and the overall value per dollar other than the GPU which is on the expensive side for a 4080 everything in here is really reasonable especially this keyboard I am loving this keyboard mouse combo for under $100 one thing I'm noticing right away is that this SSD is not very fast um its usage is extremely high and the data rate while patching Alo infinite is pretty slow let's give it a quick reboy boot and see if maybe you know we can
enable XMP tell it hey maybe you want a turbo for a little bit longer that sort of thing pretty normal looking bios layout oh that's cool cool Legacy game compatibility mode you can press the scroll lock key to toggle the efficient course between being parked and UNP parked when the LED is on and off is this a thing I have no idea I maybe I just missed it but I had not seen that before uh oh turbo here we go okay I don't see any obvious way to increase the turbo duration or anything like that
though so all right let's see wait a second now this is curious power button on the motherboard sure that I expect to see power button  do I didn't even notice that was a screen is it even a screen or no no it's just LED lighting with a clear okay still that's pretty cool though there's one here too all right let's see if those memory settings stuck yep 6400 maybe the CPU just didn't need to Turbo that that high yet guess we'll find out oh there it goes oh we saw I Saw 4 GHz there all right by the way did
you guys notice our white cable ties we were using earlier we have saw many different colors on LTT store no complaints when it comes to Performance good gravy we're looking at anywhere from 15 to 200 FPS in the 1% low so averages and we're like 250 FPS and this is at 1440p Ultra in Halo infinite I think the star of the show is the case just outstanding a 100 bucks with all that RGB all that cooling potential and looking like that for Better or For Worse guys it is a really interesting
time for Chinese PCT Tech semiconductor manufacturing on the mainland continues to grow and evolve while the government seems dead set on eliminating any dependence on foreign technology which is of course the primary drive behind their ma in China 2025 initiative just like the major initiative I have to tell you about our SP oh no Odo so you're running a business but it's held together by a bunch of different software kind of like our car that owes a great debt to duct tape ODU has a
better idea use their all-in-one business management software it takes the Essential Elements of any business and combines them into one unified operating system the CRM and sales apps make lead generation and closing deals easier than ever while their point of sale and inventory apps turn selling and product tracking from a chore into Child's Play and their accounting app automatically creates invoices sends "them and integrates with 28,000 Banks" from all around the world and if you
don't even need all of that ODU is highly customizable you only have to choose the apps that your business requires and if you find yourself only ever needing a single app you can use it for free best of all ODU has a userfriendly interface with AI powered features and a support team that'll have your back so don't overwhelm your business with a bunch of software Ware o do unify your processes by checking out the link below for a free 14-day trial or to set up a demo with odu's expert
