two years ago my kids asked if we could go out and see Avatar too and I said sure but only after you've experienced the first one the way James Cameron intended in glorious 3D that would have been pretty easy they put it back in theaters to make sure that everyone could remember the names of the various Smurfs but then I thought why go out for theater when we have theater at home and I was shocked to discover that dozens of movies are still being released on 3D Blu-ray every single year all I needed
to do to enjoy them was to convert my regular old home theater to a 3D home theater there was only one small problem actually a lot of small problems which is why we started filming this video in December of 2022 and you're only watching it now see in spite of the hype around it back in the late 2000s almost no new hardware supports 3D anymore and even if we did go dumpster diving on eBay most Home Solutions require active shutter glasses which give my wife a splitting headache leaving us with only
one real option a passive 3D setup like they have in the movie theaters with dual projectors these unobtanium filters and a whole lot of Jank also a whole lot of segue to our sponsor vessie say goodbye to wet socks and hello to big savings score up to 40% off select Styles during their Black Friday sale at vessie decom or click our Link in the  before you all come flooding into the comments the real reason that I wanted a 3D setup down here was that retrospective that we did back in
2022 I didn't mean to fall back in love with 3D but come on how many of you have fallen into the same trap it's just coffee right and who can blame me for getting sucked back in even without a Time of new releases there is a surprisingly Rich back catalog of 3D Blu-rays to enjoy especially computer animated ones that benefit immensely from the 3D experience except that now there's a giant elephant in the room see back when I had planned this upgrade I had a projection setup already now I
have a TV which is going to turn these 3D projectors into a gigantic downgrade for anything that's not 3D we're going to deal with that later first let's take a look at the plan the first thing we knew we needed was two image sources each with its own polarizing filter and this is where we hit our first major roadblock the Epson ls2000 that I used to have in my theater room uses a laser light source and after trying multiple filters both circular and linear we found that it simply couldn't be
effectively polarized for context here's how that demo was supposed to go see how the image gets dimmer but doesn't doesn't turn green yeah oh I guess now's a good time to introduce our projectors since I've already wasted more resources than I'd like to admit on this endeavor we went for an eBay special now sadly the Optima uhd30 doesn't have lens shift to help us line up the images but what it does have is 4K output 3400 lumens of peak brightness which is really important when you're polarizing filter
it's going to sap so much of your brightness and perhaps most importantly give you picked up for as little as $500 Freedom do each next let's talk about these filters careful with that one getting these bad boys was both timec consuming and shockingly expensive since you know no one bothers to build 3D projection setups anymore there are still commodity options available we found some pretty affordable plastic and acrylic ones but the quality was frankly terrible so after digging through countless ancient
Forum posts and contacting all the experts we could find we made our way to American polarizers Inc who appears to be the go-to for professional installations with a price tag to match this is my first time seeing them who there they are this pair of clockwise and counterclockwise polarizing filters also a family pack of 3D glasses set us back over "$1,500 and the worst part we are nowhere" near ready to actually watch a 3D movie buddy I can already tell just putting these on these are way better than the
cheap single- use glasses and the plastic filters dude check this out wao like it blocks holy cow the light oh dude this might actually be cool but it's 3D of course it's cool here's the thing though Elijah remember how we reviewed the script and everything yes this is the part where I'm no longer sure if what we scripted  oh yeah it did which sucks for anyone trying to make a 3D setup but it's good for me because it means I didn't waste my money here's the thing as it turns
out there's some pretty dark magic involved in getting the polarized light coming out of our filtered projector to stay polarized after it bounces off of a screen and into your eyeholes now before you point out rightly that this is not a screen this is just a wall I did try using a proper screen my old one from Elon Vision but even though it mentioned 3D on the product page it turns out they were only referring to Active 3D like where the projector will alternate between left and right eye images and
you have glasses that Alternate which eye is covered by that logic any screen is a 3D screen so it had to go and in its place I picked up this one from Stewart this is their silver 5D screen screen meaning it's been optimized for 2D and 3D hence the 5D now the information around how these materials retain close to 100% polarization a little thin on the ground but these guys basically have a monopoly on this stuff these days so after much deliberation I bit the bullet the
"$6,000 bullet a silver bullet you might" say this has been sitting in my house for like I kid you not over a year it has not been over a year trust me I know because I tripped over it constantly it was right next to my car this better work cuz if not this video is done for I don't think I'm going to invest in another attempt at this why don't you just buy a clex projector why don't you just buy a CLE oh but I can't afford a coplex the theater industry is not hurting that bad yet soon yeah give it
time oh wow the off axis viewing of this is flipping terrible like watch if I move the yeah look at that actually man oh wow even without the polarizing filter this screen compared to my old one has terrible viewing angles I mean you should never be sitting this close to a projector screen anyway here let's let's stand a reasonable distance away hold on hold on I mean that's better but I guess there's a reason they don't use silver  oh when were you going to tell me I wanted to see how long it would go okay
big moment big moment now if it really doesn't work there's actually nothing stopping okay yes oh shoot oh it works real good really yeah okay check it out check it out She Bangs dude that's wow yeah that's really impressive that is pretty minimal cross talk I mean it should be this is a professional grade solution the Disposable glasses work okay with it I mean if it's good enough for the theater right like it's good enough for me uh okay well they have their own problems but
anyway oh oh I don't have the filter on it again damn it okay you don't want to leave the filter super close to the projector like we have it right now because it'll actually heat it up and it can burn the filter so I had put it down for it was the reason I did that yeah these kind of suck by comparison you can really tell you know the difference between glass and plastic like it's a super cloudy image and it doesn't block nearly as much and it distorts it you see that now
I really don't know how much of a guide this video needs to be because probably most of you aren't going to do this but our first attempt at finding polarizing filters used linear filters these are advantageous because they're cheap but they are disadvantageous because if you tilt your head while you're watching it'll actually switch which I can see and which one can't and it can also be worse for giving people headaches so um if this actually works and is awesome I'm glad we went with the proper
solution with circular polarization now for the really hard part because we cheaped out on our projectors and we didn't get something with lens shift aligning these things is going to be as we say in the biz a b uh I think we're going to go top and bottom sure that works all right wow wow  3D it's going to be great trying to line this up now and then we move in there and we're going to have to redo it you know my kids still haven't seen Avatar 2 because we still haven't finished this
project wow yeah we can go see it two years later every once in a while my son brings it up he's like are we ever going to watch Avatar 2 maybe block the bottom one and we'll try and match the top one to the bottom since we can't figure out how to Oh you mean just the IR I'm sorry we know the top of the image is kind of a mess but the bottom left corner is good enough for us to at least see if it works now we just need to figure out content now if I was a boomer or something and I had a Blu-ray player
then this would be no problem I would just put Blu-rays in it but I don't and I'm not going to so how do I get the right image to go to one of my projectors and the left image to go to the other this actually required more tinkering behind the scenes than believe it or not anything else we've done so far I used our handy dandy video on how to rip your own Blu-rays except I ripped the 3D versions then I followed this Reddit thread on r/v to remux it back into a 3D file format using a program called bd3d to
mk3d then we just need another program called stereoscopic 3D player from 3D tv. we adjust the output settings and Vel half frames on one side half the frames on the other side VOA what when you say VOA you're supposed to show it working oh well let's get it working then okay cool if thought all of that was too fast and made no sense that's okay we're going to have that guide and all the products that we used in the video description for now let's watch a movie oh God oh God oh that is not good
oh we might have remux this file in the wrong format the cross Talk's very good but wa hold on no you can see it's split in half oh balls part of that whole BD 3D tool is you can actually choose how you want to split your frames Left Right top Center if you want to split it in half so half of it goes on one half of it goes on the other it took a lot of trial and error and depending on the Blu-ray file itself can actually depend on how you need to remux it okay so this one no good let's try the Tron legacy
one that I know for a fact I got working oh dude dude it's totally 3D  way that is like actually theater grade too dude this worked way better than I thought it was going to oh dude yeah it's pretty sick okay okay worth it what about the TV though do we want to permanently install this in your theater room because if we do I would say that we would need to get the better projectors before we rip your TV off the wall I would like to see a not  wow dude the she it's coming right out
it's coming right for us I had about 4% confidence coming and filming today how did this not take off I'm kidding now that we've got it working the next step is the hardest part pulling that TV off the wall weighs about 400 lb mounting the projector screen then getting everything lined up just kidding we came up with a better way I found some random brackets in my garage and we turned them into a projector mount that is going to us to mount the screen on the TV I hope we're going to find out okay dude
seriously though this is not as stupid as it might seem this is the original French cleat mount you can see it goes there like that and then just needs to hang off the TV this feels so wrong uh "yes let me just drape my $6,000 screen" "over my $20,000 TV with nothing but one" baby wipe in between that is perfect oh dude no problem obviously this is not you know an everyday solution you know it's not like oh yeah let's watch a 3D movie just to flip over to 3D mode or whatever like I
could set this up in the time it would take to drive to the theater so like that's perfectly acceptable to me whoa whoa buddy off off off I'm off I'm off I'm off down it comes I'm off okay those did not clear oh those really look like they were going to clear they did not can you imagine watching the room in 3D on this I did not hit her Me by zo's ass just like coming out of the screen okay mine's in dude that's pretty easy that's a pretty easy hook yeah oh my goodness you got everything set oh my
gosh don't act too surprised you helped yeah I I helped um basically we made a platform we got some counter balances um we hooked it up to the home theater audio setup and theoretically this is okay it's not perfectly aligned but hopefully aligned enough we're going to try it I have some news for you okay guess what's working the 3D projector yeah finally wow really that took like 4 years this is it huge moment two years in the making does it work stopped making it after like six months no we've been
working on it the whole time here we go I think there's definitely encoding settings that could probably be improved yes it almost feels like it's alternating which frame it's instead of synchron them yeah so still shots are good but motion's a little rough now this is an older movie why don't we try something a little newer yeah anything in motion yeah it's a little problematic and the imperfect alignment doesn't help not helping but when they're in the center and it's just a static camera shot like that
looks great that looks kind of awesome okay that's pretty cool these projectors for 500 bucks each dude like huh I mean you spend that much on don't worry about it oh buddy with the eyes that was pretty wow it's so hard to convince this over camera to you guys like how well this is actually working cuz you know for you guys it looks blurry and crappy and crappy put gles over the camera yeah it doesn't work that way it quite work that way we'd need two cameras and two glasses and then they would need 3D
glasses and on their side now the moment that you have waited over 2 years for my son Avatar oh man 100% worth it 100% worth it dude dude this is insane obviously we can't sit and watch the whole film or whatever but but suffice it to say this is freaking awesome this result is so much better than I would have expected there's so little cross talk very very little I mean that's what happens when you're using professional grade Optics y so uh family movie night this weekend we finally watch Avatar worth the
wait well okay don't yeah did I ever tell you you can play games in Stereo 3D no you can there's a huge library of games guys leave a comment if you have any brilliant ideas for the best way to do it but what I'm thinking is final form like the greatest stereo 3D gaming setup of all time can I have it uh well I mean it'll be in our house you can use it but can I own it you can own the segue to our sponsor vessie they offer all kinds of stylish functional shoes for everyday wear and now you can get
