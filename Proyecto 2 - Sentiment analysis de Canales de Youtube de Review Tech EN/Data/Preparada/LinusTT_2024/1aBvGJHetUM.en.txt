building a five-star PC that's easy all you have to have is money but what if you don't I mean that two star motherboard could hold the key to incredible savings couldn't be that bad could it to find out we built a PC using only the worst rated parts that we could find on newegg.com and we ended up with this and sure from the outside she's not so bad but on the inside it's a black hole misery a disappointment maybe or maybe it's fine to find out we need to go back to the beginning the
beginning the beginning starting with the ryzen 5 8500g AMD never sent these out to reviewers for evaluation and if our experience with it is anything to go by that's probably for good reason you see the compromises that AMD made on this chip are a lot especially if you consider the not very low $180 price only two of its six cores are full-size zen4 and while the integrated Graphics are decent compared to the competition when the time comes to upgrade them you will be shocked shocked
I say to discover that your GPU slot could be running at as slow as 1/8 the bandwidth of other modern PCS and it gets even worse modern storage drives can end up with their bandwidth cut and depending who you believe this chip might only support single Channel memory who does AMD imagine this thing is for maybe you're building a super power efficient PC but can't afford the better balanced 8600 G well I urge you theoretical customer um let's name you Grover please wait for a sale on
something else or consider the Intel 14100 with a discrete GPU or almost literally anything else this truly is the worst current chip so in it goes into our motherboard that is after we look at this message from our sponsor acronis arm your it Department with centrally managed protection against cyber threats and with backup and Recovery capabilities with aonis cyber protect check out their easy to use all-in-one solution using the link in  at first glance the prime b650 plus from
Asus seems downright decent professional reviewers touted its well-rounded features so I can see why Grover might be eyeing it at least until he sees these user reviews and guys I know three stars doesn't necessarily mean something is garbage I mean we could have found a onear motherboard if we looked hard enough but we felt that it was best to limit our search to products that had more than just a handful of reviews and besides while three stars is average would you eat at a three star restaurant
on Google Maps one where half of the customers say that the food is delicious and the other half say it's defective multiple people mentioned that the diagnostic LEDs don't work on this board which could be an issue if we're going to push our twar mushin enhanced Redline memory to the Limit Yep this right here is 64 whole gigs of the worst rated DDR 5 Ram we could find jealous well you probably shouldn't be see it's "rated for 6,400 megga transfers per" second but based on the reviews it seems
very unlikely that we're going to be seeing those speeds which was a little surprising for me I mean mushin's a real brand and at $25 it's not even cheap so with so many other options at the same price why would Grover choose these ones oh speaking of price how much was the motherboard $180 180 bucks I mean that seems like a god motherboards have gotten expensive this is a b650 board yep that's not even a top tier one well at least our storage was cheap that's right folks just $40 for the SATA ad data
Premier SP 580 with a huge 120 billion bytes of storage which is what enough for Windows in one game let's see what the people have to say about about this one uh dead dead defected oh here's a five star review wait blue screens but he's not sure it's because of the SSD that is a super weird thing to mention in a five-star review for a product and things aren't looking much better for SSD number two which we bought another junk SSD I mean at least the team group gx2 has the potential to be more useful
thanks to its 2 tbyte capacity but again that's only if it stays functional you know what's hard to screw up these days though a case but you know who managed it begears the B bigger managed to get only 2.9 Stars the question for me is why there's a lot to like here tempered glass fold my trap this came untaped at the bottom and so when you picked it up it just fell out it was shrink wrapped and then they thought that was a good idea I guess what they never taped the Box no and so twice
people picked it up and it just flew out the bottom oh so the tempered glass side panel could be a bug not a feature if you're going to drop it on the floor increased air flow also the photos make this case look like fans are included and actually make it look pretty sick in general but uh in person it looks more ill than sick the Glass isn't held in place by anything there's no little nubbins no little Groove to put it in or anything like that where would you even put front 120 mm fans in this case it
straight up doesn't have the mounts for them I I remember we looked at the pictures of this in script riew I do you have do you have a picture sure it there there is no fans in the front of the picture of the I thought there were no no they just kind of strategically take the picture so it kind of seems like it yep you could definitely infer that that RGB is coming from fans on the inside and the bottom too like where would that where would the RGB here be coming from yeah that's a straight up lie there is
no RGB coming through there realistically though aside from feeling a little deceived there's nothing inherently wrong with the case that is as long as I don't want to have a ton of air flow Not only was there nowhere for fans in the front there's nowhere for air to come into the case but that seems like a problem for future lus is this like really unstable this is really easy to tip over compared to most cases it's so light and it's so narrow anyway we weren't able to
find a particularly low rated cooler so we're going to throw the stock cooler on here I can't say the same however for our fans if the reviews of the Z3 pros from montech or anything to go by I have very high expectations for them that is to say I expect they will make a high amount of noise I don't want to keep harping on the case but there is absolutely nowhere to Cable manage the cables for these fans or the eight pin EPS connector for the motherboard so good luck David okay that's why I
strategically took the rear fan the these fans literally are mashed up against the vrm cooler of this motherboard this is a really tight case moving on to our power supply you may recall that gigabyte was Under Fire pun intended for setting the over Power Protection and overcurrent protection on these units too high meaning that under heavy load some spectacular failures took place some of which took other components with them gigabyte ultimately did offer Replacements and they fixed
the issue in their newer units but it's clear from the reviews on this thing that the reputational damage was done and honestly I'm kind of surprised that they didn't just relaunch this as a new skew to move away from the 240 onear reviews that are on this power supply while we were wiring it up we found some serious problems with this case there's only one spot to mount a 2 and 1/2 in drive down here in the bottom every other hole is not properly aligned so I don't know I guess other SSD just
goes here but hey it's got correctly spaced tabs and screw holes for 5 and 1/4 in Optical drives three of them even though there would be nowhere for them to slide into I love this thing also if you have the top uh fan installed there is no way to install an 8 Pin power connector on the top of this board that might not be an issue with every board but it's definitely an issue with this one I could rip the clip off do it I need a knife okay nice wow this cable management is awful and it's not about
to get any better at least it won't get much worse our Sparkle ecoar A310 4 gig GPU does not require an external power connector wow that's one of the best things about it though it's been our position for a long time that there is a class of GPU that is less Graphics processing unit and more display adapter for your pcie slot and that's pretty much the story here unless like Anonymous you are a video transcoding Enthusiast where it can offer a pretty good value not to mention outstandingly low power
consumption at just 50 Watts if like some folks you buy this and expect to be doing any gaming on it though you're going to be sorely disappointed especially with this one that apparently has issues with the cooling fan  wait I know I'm interrupting b-roll to talk about the case again but to put a glass side panel on this did they literally just take an existing chassis drill four holes in it thread them and then put it on like it's got mounting for a regular metal side panel it's all
visible and if they were going to just put the holes anywhere anyway why didn't they make them symmetrical it took me three attempts to put this glass panel on they couldn't even put the little grommet on the right spot so there's just a second hole in it getting into the rest of the setup I don't know what's so bad about this monitor I mean yeah it's only 1080p but 165 HZ 1 MC moving picture response time ah 2.8 out of 5 eggs and mostly comes down to reliability issues breaks down after 6
months cool this is a fun one you've probably seen this desk pad somewhere in fact you might have even seen it on our channel before and the reviews across every Marketplace it occupies are bad but what caught our attention more than anything is the awful seller ratings for it how is this store given a toprated status on New Egg if they have so many negative reviews I mean three stars on 402 reviews ain't good and it's the packaging that seems to be the primary issue they apparently fold it instead of
rolling it and my notes just say talk about why they would do that based on everything we've learned from selling desk pads David there is no reason to fold the desk pad instead of rolling it and what's funny is we did buy this from that seller and they did roll it they just put it in a plastic bag so I don't know when they figured it out but hey they finally did either way at 20 bucks this is a terrible value just pick up a mystery desk pad from LTT store.com it's bigger and better and it doesn't
identify Winnipeg as one of the three important cities in Canada our Capital Cities not on here in fact the American cap capital's not on here they got New York Chicago Dallas Denver and Los Angeles where the is Washington as bad as it is though it is nothing compared to our Ruckus 4-in-1 Pro gaming kit this has two and 1 half stars out of five on Walmart with one user calling it the worst thing I've ever used and saying I feel ashamed just to own it why does Southern Telecom Inc even make gaming
peripherals remember when lightning was cool never stop being cool yeah me neither wait this is a super weird Legend they put WD on the arrow keys what and there's no windows key what it has a Windows lock unless this is a Windows key and the lock is you function Windows no that would be so stupid I'm a reasonable person and a 2.5 is not good enough for you so I got you a 2.6 keyboard and it's ergonomic you got two sets of peripherals just the keyboard wow I'm I'm a reasonable person internet
and multimedia hot Keys three color illuminated backlight and split key design you know what though I did a lot of my early gaming on an ergo keyboard h i don't think you know that no but you accidentally put me back in my element this is what was missing now you're a pro again seems serviceable as far as these go and hey it's got two windows keys to make up for that last one you uh missed the most important upgrade another uh mouse pad oh good wow the oh that's what makes it 4 in one
nice and it almost lies flat this is remarkable this may be the single worst feeling headset that I have ever touched oh that's pretty good touch the ear cups what is wrong with these why also this driver is it's like right there you look like a game this is terrible and in order to justify the molding costs they have to make thousands of these thousands of Gamers yeah are experience in two and a half star gaming hey those fans actually look pretty cool kind of noisy but that can
probably be configured don't push a ton of air for how loud they are I have to be touching the metal to feel any air moving huh I hate these peripherals guys for around $50 or less The Cooler Master mm 712 looks awesome or the Logitech g305 there's lots of options for great budget keyboards we're going to have some suggested peripherals for the same price as what we paid for this garbage Linked In the video description uh Decor oh apparently there's decor and we've limited ourselves to one item and
it's one star it's one star oh I get wait is that a Mario star with cowboy boots and a cowboy hat it certainly looks like a Mario star and I love it so much was this poorly rated no it's just one star oh I get it all right thanks David am I supposed to get an output for from this uh yes I mean I guess it shouldn't really surprise us if the lowest rated PC died oh the ram did I put the did I put the ram in the near slots I actually did notice that I meant to mention it wow
what a rookie error not that it should matter it should probably still post but um those aren't the best slots to put the first two sticks of memory in you know what other than the fact that the case is a complete piece of crap I don't hate it is that supposed to be color it looks like it's trying maybe oh yeah wait I didn't I didn't see any RGB lead on it no it was  Molex dude there's two more leads off of this thing I think this is actually an RGB LED strip but they yeah oh yeah yeah no
you can tell you can tell cuz if you cover some of it it turns a color but they didn't install the other leads so there's no control it's just powered at least the systems posted though let's see if we can get Expo enabled ddr5 6400 I believe see let's go my question is whether it's going to be running in dual Channel mode M we saw conflicting information about the support for dual or single Channel memory on this CPU it doesn't make any sense to me wait no it can't be single Channel because we saw
the full capacity of the memory if it only had a single Channel you wouldn't be able to populate both both Channels with two dims okay yeah so where did that come from it's really weird it's really good that it runs in dual Channel because if you have onboard Graphics you're using your system memory as your vram and slow vram is a killer for gaming performance so this thing would be way worserer than we thought it "was oh are we not getting 6,400 though I" don't think so hey hey hey oh but maybe it just
rebooted a couple times and went back no cuz it would have prompted us to go into the BIOS I think we got full memory speed though it's worth noting that that is as much to do with the integrated memory controller on your CPU and your board layout as it is to do with your "memory sticks so 6,400 megat transfers" per second let's go this SSD is running at 100% usage just booting up Windows oh my God I want to know how many pcie lanes my GPU is getting not that I think it actually needs a ton of them but it
will tell us if we wanted to put a more powerful GPU in here whether it would be bottlenecked and the answer is pcie Gen 4x8 at by4 is that a power saving thing or is it actually only getting four lanes by the way this mouse is intolerable oh really let's give it a chance oh yeah put it on this quality you know what the desk pad's actually helping a fair bit the included mouse pad has some really high contrast lines on it and cheap sensors can struggle to track across high contrast lines we
don't even have any m.2 drives installed no so it's not like we're using up all the PCI lane somewhere else I think this thing only runs at by4 unless this Arc GPU only has a by4 interface does it I thought that's possible by it's the GPU that's by eight running it by four ah wow so it wasn't reporting the link speed and the active link speed it's reporting the capability of the GPU and what the active link speed is wow that sucks I'm sorry little buddy so I haven't actually used HW info
for this very much I usually use GPU I don't know why I didn't just download that but anyway we figured it out I can see why people don't like the fan on this GPU I know I have firmar running but still now that our system's up and running it's time to put Grover's black hole build to the test with some famously review bombed games starting with Team Fortress 2 why are they mad at Val for Team Fortress there a Bots there's a bot issue where you any game you join you just instantly start
getting sniped and I just SP it's still that yes cool how old is this game now like 15 years old7 17 years old good you'll get old too what you're in Secure mode what does that mean oh uh did seem just crash what is happening right now what is it's almost like we built a bad computer on purpose yeah blue screen I saw it on that one what yeah no way yeah it went I saw a blue screen appear in the capture I'm going to try one more time sure I'm going to try one more time not currently connected to the TF game 
let's turn the ram down okay interesting we turned the ram back to J deck speeds and immediately I was able to queue for a casual game immediately I really hate wearing these they're really really uncomfortable also the volume Wheels like backwards instead of bringing it towards yourself to turn it up yeah you push away to turn it up huh who does that what is happening right now I guess let's try a different like join a different game I can't interact with the game window or like I can't bring it
back to focus should we just move on to another game to another game the game runs whatever we can't see the FPS but it's getting lots of FPS it's an ancient game our next one is Kerbal Space Program 2 Early Access which I know about this controversy basically they launched Early Access for the sequel to Kerbal Space Program and then the developer was shut down which happens sometimes you know business decision except you can totally still buy this game it's not done it's never going to be
done no don't do that don't set it to high no oh okay medium uh low is hard got it I've never actually played kbal NE oh this really doesn't look that good for what kind of frame rate it's running at look at these trees I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing okay this seems like something yeah hey we're about 40 frames oh okay fuel tank okay cool okay nice sure another fuel tank lots of fuel all right okay let's see what happens let's launch it woo nine frames a second baby let's go
you're going to space Oh Oh Our parachute is deployed already we are we  God it's glorious at a glorious 10 frames per second like you'd think it would run out of fuel oh yeah no we're almost out of fuel we go the crash is imminent this is so slow all right I think I've seen it yeah I don't think the crash will be spectacular anyway last up hell divers 2 30 frames per second I'm getting 30 frames per second you get 30 look to be I'm not saying it looks great I'm just saying that's
definitely 30 frames per second but let's let's let's get you on a planet  okay it doesn't look terrible for all low honestly man low on Modern games looks not bad all right I'm a hell diver look at me diving I'm diving to hell we're running at Native render scale hey that's hey 310 might not be as bad as we thought it was that being said do you want to know the price of this whole "system how much should we pay $1,025" just for the tower for that price you can get a much better system with like a
7600 and like a 6600 GPU uh you are way better spending your money elsewhere yeah this is a terrible value yeah you know what I want to know would we be having a better gaming experience if we didn't buy the ark 310 at all oh I'm curious about that too we should try our onboard Graphics let's do it uh uh roll oh I think you might have missed it but uh that was weird I don't know if we're going to be gaming on this GPU well first I disabled the AR windows and we moved the HDMI over and the system hard
rebooted then we booted up just now and the screen came up with the Asus bios splash screen except there was like green lines everywhere if only there was some way we could have predicted that this would happen you know I've always wondered like who's buying these low-rated parts who is our hypothetical Grover like obviously you're budget conscious but you're anxious about the risk of buying used computer parts um maybe you shop based on Word of Mouth or brand name rather than like looking at
reviews like I get it reviews can be manipulated so maybe you don't trust them which is fair enough especially with overly positive reviews but I think it's clear from this exercise that if you ignore online reviews completely you do so at your peril bottom line there are many reasons why a product might get a low review score and After experiencing all of them for myself it's safe to say say listen to the people who bought it before you did and it's safe to say listen to this segue to our sponsor
