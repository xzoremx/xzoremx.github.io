what is up everyone and welcome to the WAN show Happy New Year it's a new year same me Whole New Year yep it's a whole different number of in the date no new no New Year resolutions wow not even 16k good joke good job lonus X can't afford Mr Beast uh Mr Beast and Elon Musk went back H I don't know if there was much forth but they definitely discussed the issue on TW X Twitter what was the X was formerly X Twitter X Twitter that's what hey that actually works does anyone else call it X Twitter
No but I kind of like it cool um so we'll be talking about that as well as just sort of Creator monetization and why it is such a challenge for platforms like X Twitter to afford a Creator like Mr Beast um the manufacturer sabotaged polish trains with DRM so we'll be talking a little bit about that what else we got did I manage to pick your two uh you got one of them yes I'm I'm now looking for replacement and also trying to find the one that oh yeah International hackers hit uh water
supply infrastructure scary anytime anyone hits infrastructure it's kind of like oh everyone kind of realizes that that can happen again for the however many time yeah then we oh yeah that thing yeah yeah that's that's why the nuclear football uses like floppy discs  that's it you got one what about what about the drug dealers and the drones it's like a year old article I guess there's there's follow-up information that's more new so yeah drug uh drug dealers are using they're using drones
uh because they'll use anything uh the last thing I saw was avocados um cool I know they've put them in submarines this week before CES is historically a super super slow week for news because cuz everyone is saving everything for next week but everyone's saving everything everyone's on vacation we can talk through some leaks and stuff it'll be fun it'll still be a good show you guys don't even watch this for the    show is brought to you today by manscape Squarespace and the ridge why don't we
jump into our first topic today which is a pretty small topic All Things Considered uh Mr Beast recently had a random crypto Enthusiast respond to him promoting a video on Twitter um that he should hey you know Mr Beast Jimmy why don't you upload the video directly to the platform instead of just posting a link to where people can go watch the video which historically does not perform very well compared to an organic Tweet now obviously it's Mr Beast so his video uh his post is just I uploaded go
watch or I'll drop KCK you and it has "66,000 likes yeah but for him that is" not a ton of Engagement that's that's you know on the lower side so that's been the case for a long time just you know simple short self-promotional tweets don't perform as well as when you try and come up with something really engaging and really unique that you know serves the Twitter audience really well um so it's it's a really valid question why not just upload the content here and people can just watch it um and Jimmy
responded saying okay hold on first Elon Musk pitched in he goes yeah "yeah yeah 10,000 likes 10,000 likes and" so Jimmy responded with I think a a really actually um succinct version of what I'll kind of try and talk to you guys about he basically goes my videos cost Millions to make and even if they got a billion views on X it wouldn't fund a fraction of it um colon slashface um I'm down to test stuff once monetization is really cranking and this is a really good point that I think a
lot of people don't necessarily understand about platforms I've been asked a thousand times about at least multiple dozens of alternate platforms lonus why don't you upload your videos here I was about to say 2x as a as a just a variable that doesn't work okay uh lonus why don't you upload your videos TOA Daily Motion except we did yeah yeah why don't you upload your videos to Daily Motion why don't you upload them to you know rumble or Odyssey or any of the any of the countless alternate video platforms
and the answer is always guys the economics of it just don't make any sense because it it can only be one of two ways right you've either got the ability to get a lot of views with a very very low perview monetization rate that's YouTube or you've got the ability to get very few views with a very high monetization rate so that's going to be something more along the lines of like a um uh what's that not master class but the one where where it's like it pays out based on how many views you get I
can't I can't remember but you know something like like selling a course or something like that that's just about the highest possible CPM you can get because each individual who buys the course is going to pay 10 or 20 or $50 or $100 or whatever the case may be so there's your spectrum and the problem is that unless your name is Google and you have happen to own YouTube at least this is true in the Western World the economics of anything that's not paying like this getting less than hundreds of
thousands or millions of views just doesn't make any sense um float plane sits kind of somewhere in between where people pay anywhere from the ogs pay $3 a month anywhere up to I think our highest tier is $10 a month and even then you know we have to put a ton of work into making that platform appealing to people we have to upload a bunch of extra content so it ends up being kind of a mix it ends up being our regular content at a much higher monetization rate but then it ends up being this
other much higher cost content at a I shouldn't say higher cost it's lower cost but it's not going to other platforms that also contribute to it so float plane has to bear that cost completely on its own so we have this other sort of exclusive or behind the scenes or whatever else it is content that sits on there that is paid for by those subscribers so that kind of sits somewhere in between so there's kind of your spectrum and the reality of it is that Twitter X Twitter's monetization is
just not even close I even if you're if you're a person sitting in front of your webcam I am not sure if even at you know let's let's forget about Mr Beast because there's only one person if we do the math based on Mr Beast there's only one person to whom that's relevant yeah and his name is Jimmy um whereas if we talk about it maybe more along the lines of let's say someone who would have a quarter million to a million subscribers on YouTube okay so you're someone who's getting realistically it's probably
"somewhere between 10 15,000 views a" "video to you know maybe 250,000 views a" video somewhere in that range even if you could Port your entire YouTube audience over to Twitter you'd be looking at maybe tens of dollars for that video which if it's just you and a webcam may actually be viable but if it's anything beyond that you're you're probably paying yourself less than minimum wage and you might say okay well are you really though because it's just purely incremental right like why not just have
the little X cherry on top of all your views on YouTube or whatever else but you got to understand from a Creator's point of view at least if you're a a business-minded one there's an opportunity cost for everyone who watches on this platform where the monetization is very low anywhere you're uploading you're theoretically trying to drive more people there so like if it's worse why are you driving people there especially when most of the people looking for videos are probably
going to be on YouTube anyways when you're looking for publicly freely accessible videos so people often ask themselves or or ask out loud even you know why is it that YouTube has this seeming Monopoly on VOD content and there's a lot of answers for how it came to be the way that it is right now but as for why it is the way it is right now you know why are why do twitch streamers want to get a foothold on YouTube why do Tik tokers want to make a transition over to YouTube the answer is simple and
it's that people like to be paid for their work and YouTube offers by far the best compensation for their work and that's not it's not just like oh it's it's all about the money it's like think about it this way if in the morning you got dressed brush your teeth ate some oatmeal and you had the option to go to one of six different places and one of them paid the most and you did the exact same job and your job wasn't you know to manufacture um you know the train that runs over people or you know the lever
that doesn't seem to work to prevent the train from running over people or you know whatever the case may be as long as what you're doing is not you know obviously morally abhorent yeah well which one do you drive to I I think it's a pretty obvious answer you go to the one that compensates you best and YouTube has this For Better or For Worse very powerful machine that ensures that if you are able to get views on the  paid Luke's calling someone yeah don't worry about it well this is very
interesting I know I would I would love to know who we're going to be talking to live on the show today are we planning to tell them they're live on the show we're not talking to anybody live on the show we are not talking to anybody we not talking to them okay wow this is very mysterious anyway anyway um we H we actually do have monetization enabled on X Twitter and I thought I would just share with you guys uh we don't upload a ton of video but we have uploaded some videos that have gotten you know
thousands of views or whatever typically uh man I'm trying to think I actually don't know what a thousand views is worth on YouTube it really it varies a lot but the point is we have a pretty active Twitter account fair amount of Engagement and this should give you some idea why people don't really um why someone like Jimmy might not bother so here's all of our all of our payouts um for the last I guess you know 3 months or whatever um anywhere from you know 60 60 oh this I mean this
could be 65 anything oh $ 65.99 okay I don't know it could have been there could have been another there could have been another digit in there or something like that um let's say for the sake of argument how many typical views does Jimmy get on a video 50 million to 100 million is that a pretty fair range why don't we say 100 million sounds fair I don't really look at them but that sounds about right so let's say Jimmy is 100 times our size let's say we get 1 million let's take
the let's take kind of a mid to Upper range for him let's take a lower range for us we typically get a million to two million so let's say we get a million views of video and let's say he gets 100 million views a video he's 100 times our size he would make let's say for the sake of argument did you say 50 to 100 yeah none of his get 50 oh okay so he's way above that now y okay I haven't looked in a while yeah usually it's like like 80 to 200 is where I'm seeing most of them okay so let's say 150 so let's
say okay let's say he's 150 times our size so he would get around 10 grand from Twitter assuming he had a similar strategy to us you know trying to kind of post every day and meme or you know whatever else that is I mean like that is not even a a a rounding error um for him like I just it it just it doesn't it doesn't register he could he could literally make an off-hand comment about man I'm trying to think of something totally totally trivial like like he could he could do a special edition
popsicle stick with like Mr Beast on it and that's it's nothing else it's a popsicle stick it sounds like a a what was it sounds like a supreme drop yeah and then he could make a tweet about the popsicle stick and it would Eclipse his Twitter Revenue that he actually makes organically from the platform like it's just it's just not a factor for someone like that um so that's that's that's why I just don't think that as much as people want to see it you're going to see this Mass Exodus from YouTube
anytime soon or ever such a ever such a big word but I just don't see anyone else even really trying like bite dance Tik Tok maybe had an opportunity but they haven't managed to figure out either the monetization of the platform itself or they haven't figured out how to share in a way that is enticing to creators like you still have people trying to migrate trying to migrate their audiences what do you want to talk about next how about the AI key oh yeah Windows machines at Microsoft's behest are
getting a new key on the keyboard for what is this the first time since the Windows key was added in 1994 yeah it's tell us about it yeah you must love this it's great AI key I think it could make sense eventually okay let's let's I don't think it makes a lot of sense now basically it's a key that opens up um whatever they call it Windows co-pilot um which if you end up using Windows co-pilot in a very similar way that you would use Windows search then I think it kind of makes sense
mhm right now that's super obviously not  doing so maybe it's a little premature I was telling Dan before the show this feels kind of like when Facebook renamed to meta it feels like they're investing an immense amount of money not really getting the product that they want and then doing something that feels more like a marketing push than anything else to try to stir more news and more push around it because they still want this thing that they've sunk billions of dollars into to be more relevant than it
is um the AI space is moving fast and very exciting but is hurting on actual products that are usable by users um I I pointed this out a really long time ago it was going to be hard for people to actually ship um and a lot of things that people have wanted from the AI space have had issues shipping um including co-pilot so yeah it feels premature to me I think one day I will probably actually like this but something that they would need to do is change Windows search back to actually
searching your computer instead of being this like weird internet thing because then if they had one button that was like this is local and they had another button that was like this is AI stuff and it can search the yeah uh the internet and it can give me links and it can do whatever that would actually be probably useful I think one thing that's fairly telling is it's on the right side of the keyboard isn't it yeah yeah the  uses uh here we actually have be some of the least C pressed keys on we actually
have a a Bigfoot sighting style picture yeah there's better ones yeah no no just go on Tom's Hardware which is the source of this this is intentionally terrible so just go on Tom's hardare look at it yourself you know we're not trying to you're not trying to take their clicks or whatever but I think it's this one yeah it's I think it's to the left of the Windows key yeah um I actually I speaking of speaking of ridiculous things that Microsoft has embedded in their operating system to push their
other stuff like we we are getting super we're getting super close to antitrust Microsoft time again here I think um I was not aware of this did you know that there is a dedicated Windows shortcut key or a dedicated Windows shortcut to open up LinkedIn uh that's what I was going to troll you with oh okay yeah someone posted it in chat there's a lot more than just that actually there's like um yeah so check check this out check this out guys we're going to Linus laptop okay hold on hold on no no wait
we can look at Control Alt shift win L opens LinkedIn opens linked but there's also key combinations for word excel PowerPoint Outlook teams one drive one note and teams you don't need a you don't need a shortcut for teams you need a shortcut to make teams go away you man if I don't know if there's anything that makes me more Angry what about when it forcibly logs you out and then you can't even minimize it because it keeps forcing its thing up yeah yeah that so you're like working on something
important and it logs you out randomly in the background and you have to go through its entire login process or or else it'll Force itself to the front of screen it is um amazing remarkable how bad that design is I also just don't really understand why it logs me out we've we've looked into it you can't configure it to not do that mhm it'll log me out while I'm literally in the middle of using it I I was on a teams call today hung up and then it logged me out I find I find
the approach that some Services take to security very confusing like if you're going to make the argument that I should be signed out every month because something then fine okay well do it on my phone and on my laptop and on my desktop but then you have something like uh Gmail for example which logs you out I'm trying to think man it says every month but I swear my work computer is way more often than that there's no way that that only comes up 12 times a year but on your
phone never logs you out and you could kind of go okay well yeah but you've got you know biometric authentication on your phone or whatever but I'm sitting here going well yeah but I have biometric authentication on my computer which one's more likely to get stolen just check yeah which one's more likely to get left in a coffee shop at least have some consistency to this and there's no consistency between the various Tech Giants I mean okay WhatsApp a great example for
years Facebook would allow you to leave WhatsApp signed in perpetually on your phone but wouldn't allow you to have it signed in or Cloud synchronized with any other phone now they do that and just you know I don't know why'd you change that I don't know not sure uh but on the computer would log you out like all the time like I think it would stay logged at 7 14 days or something like that and then meanwhile you've got something like teams that logs you out on your phone
all the time instead of just being like Oh yeah no no the phone is the single source of truth that you know you can use to authenticate your other devices and then you know Google's really funny because they'll sign you I'm trying to think of what no they don't sign you out of anything on your phone but they are constantly signing you out on your computer and then I'm trying to think if there's anyone that doesn't that never signs you out on your computer um can't think can't think of
anything right now Ste yeah okay yeah there's one and it's like gaming stuff no I can't think of any productivity like work productivity Style apps that don't log you out high value accounts though steam like the value of my Steam account compared to like my stupid throwaway Hotmail account or something which by the way no Hotmail you can tell to never sign you out oh your cuz your windows account is uh is tied to your computer right or your your uh your Windows Live so it's like it's it's
flipping arbitrary so on my computer if it's my Microsoft account that I use to log in for authentication I can stay signed in perpetually but on my phone where it's where it's managed by my organization and if there was ever a problem we can just recover it no problem you have to sign me out every 30 days like it the whole thing is completely arbitrary nobody agrees yeah you want to hear an interesting one yeah recommended by password managers people are starting to store
their TFA in their password managers and there are security Arguments for this no from that's not what to do password managers and security researchers what yeah okay you're going to have to okay back back me up so people on people are storing their tofa backup codes yeah in their password manager yeah but now we're back to just one password again and that was a pun yeah it's not a pun but it's a it's funny password actually  no like surprising amount of other people do this too it's interesting to
me the one of the big Arguments for it is there's just no point in not because  that and I was like hm it's a kind of interesting argument because like if if someone gets into your password manager do they really not also have your tofa uh they might just have the one 2fa I mean one of the ways that people commonly get past tfas is by spamming login attempts and then like calling you in the middle of the night and you know trying to get it or whatever else like well you're groggy and stuff like they
could social engineer one 2fa away from you without having access to your TFA account so no actually what they're saying is if they if they had the if they had access to your password Vault yeah they may as well just have access to your tofa but they don't because I don't store that password in my password Vault your password for your tofa yeah I have it memorized yeah see this is why I don't like it but this is like actually an argument that's being made by like smart people which I find very
interesting uh s toofa in let's see now I'm sad they even tell you when they give you the backup codes they're like write this down print it out that's what you're supposed to do backup codes are not those are different things oh okay I thought you were saying the people were putting the backup codes in some people do that too but that's that's not I don't think that in particular is recommended just the tofa so you can you can have like rolling tofa but then the password for it is in your password
manager that's so stupid like you can literally have it to the point where when you when you go like oh fill my login info for this site it'll fill the login and password and then when the TFA comes up it'll just automatically Thea and you're ful no I I hate the tum of tofa as much as probably anyone I kind of one of the reasons why I'm bringing this up is I want people to like yell at me about why it's fine because I don't really get it CU it doesn't seem fine to  disagree yeah no no pull we really have
to pull this you guys I I well yeah fine I'll do I'll do a poll uh safe to store 2 FAA password in your password manager so is that is that what we're asking uh sure yeah okay I ah guys I don't know man okay let's let's bring up the results results time yeah no there's like 10% oh oh oh it's swinging it's swinging the people who were very angry about this we're super quick to click no oh shoot it's uh it's covered a little bit broken there you go got that fixed for you so it looks like good by
the time the dust settles anywhere between a quarter of you probably about a quarter of you think that it's totally fine to store your 2fas in there it's definitely more convenient it's definitely more convenient yeah and I mean if you gave me the option you know 10 years ago when we were just getting into the idea of biometric security if you gave me the option to have a setup like this where I have to memorize one password that I just enter all the time or if I have to
start like entering my fingerprints and you know retinal scans and Iris scans and facial scans into every electronic device in my life I I would I would probably have taken this path even with all the compromises here check this out like this is this is where like man I find this so interesting here's an article on blog. onep password.com and there are other I'm just using them as an example there are other password Vault password storage password security sites that say the
exact same thing I'm just using one password as an example because this is the first one that I found you've probably heard of read the advice turn on two-factor authentication everywhere it's offered after all it's a great way to add an extra layer of protection to your online accounts but should that include your one password account the short answer answer is no wait that's a completely different thing this is this is a different thing wait what they're saying not to turn on two-or
authentication also password manager we need to unpack what tofa does and how your data is protected by one password security model this isn't the article that I meant to bring up but it's like there's still there's so many hot takes in the one password hold on blog hold on what no sorry I I I can can I how is it secure by Design you're you're you're scrolling where do you want me to stop I don't know you keep just well I know what two Factor authentication is so we can go past that how is it secure by
Design okay you choose this password we don't know it and it's never stored on our servers your secret key is the long yeah but that's not what the are they high that's not how lit what the here we go here we go here we go that is terrible advice here we go manages to obtain encrypted copy of your data from our servers that's not that's not that's such a that's such an outlier scenario that's not scenario one that's scenario 7even a criminal guesses your account this we're not talking
about guessing from a new device without your secret key that's only stored on your devices so you don't have to type it every time you unlock one password and your printable emergency wait isn't that just a second Factor then well what they're saying is like I I I think what they're saying is if you sign in a new location you have to authenticate that new location I think that's what they're saying you wouldn't be able to sign into your account from a new device without your secret key that piece of
information okay so then hold on one password is just saying they already have tofa I guess this this isn't the page I bring up I'm going to go find it okay all right so that's that's fine then because they already have a second authentication factor I mean okay I have uh I have a remote access um service that I use that I do not have you know 2fa like I don't I don't have it in Google Authenticator right right um because every time I sign on from a new location I have to validate via some
other means so I don't need that kind that's just really misleading because also recommending against adding additional factors is interesting to me yeah I do see their point that two factors is probably enough factors that you're going to get a notification that somebody's trying to sign in and you're going to get a chance to deal with it um however wish I find this article I disagree that all factors are made equal I don't think that that should be their default Factor even um like their
default second Factor something that is static like a it's it's almost like a like a physical key a physical key can be copied whereas a key that changes every time you use the lock cannot be copied and that's how something like  works I wish I could find it I know they have an article on this I found someone talking about the article but I can't find the actual root article all someone would have to do is have your computer compromised with a key logger at a time when you are re-authenticating and they
could force you to reauthenticate if they had some kind of access to your machine that allowed them to reroute you through a VPN or something because then it would appear as though you were logging in from another location so I know I'm asking for a lot of stars to align but that's not that far-fetched for someone to have some kind of for someone to have if they have some kind of malware on your machine I don't think it's that far-fetched that they could route you through some kind of um remote
location and that they could have a key logger installed I don't I don't think that's like science fiction um this so this this reads different than the last time I saw it I don't know if it's been edited or maybe I'm remembering an article from someone else and just found this one first so my memory might be skewed but here's the article it was linked in in FPL chat by a few different people um but yeah one password and tofa is it wrong to store passwords and onetime codes together and to be clear
again one password is not the only company that supports this they like all do I think I'm pretty sure last pass does I know keeper does and clearly one password does and I think the other ones do as well um and yeah they argue that it's like secure and fine but they also say you know the correct choice is the one that works best for you you apparently okay so this is apparently the um the the one password um key is only entered when you first set it up yeah okay okay well then that's not
too bad because they'd have to have the key logger at the time you first set it up yeah they might though yeah and you might you could potentially tricky user into entering that um man it's not as bad as I thought it was not even close but I'm I'm not a huge fan and I also don't really like the advice of of not having okay I should I should clarify when I say I don't like the advice of not adding multiple factors I don't mean adding multiple alternate factors I was dismayed when I realized that the way
that Google accounts handle a um a physical device like a UB key if you don't have your UB key and you set up like when I when I initially set it up I was like it was at a time when I think we had just had an account compromised or something like that and I was going like I want three factors I want my password I want my UB key and I want my authenticator app some sites worked this way for a very brief period of time and now I don't know of any that work and what I didn't realize at the
time was I was adding or factors some of them were and not and factors some were and Google wasn't yeah I don't know of anything that is now like I just said but but for a little brief period of time when we when we first got our UB Keys some sites were anded and that was actually very cool uh cuz if you wanted like hypers security it felt like you had the you know the two nuclear keys or whatever um but yeah now it's just like various ways to bypass the thing um I don't know
there's also I've found a lot of places that accept UB Keys require two different ones yeah which is like so it's like yes I can use my high security UB key and I also have to have SMS authentication enabled it's like cool the very worst kind sick yeah I don't know um yub key has gotten I find with a lot of things that we use it's gotten a little bit less useful over the years um because more and more places that that do support it require you to have two enabled and less
and less places seem to support it m4z says if a key logger is on your system you're already compromised that's sort of true because in many cases you are well the expectation one of the reasons that you should use autofill with a password manager is that it makes it so you don't have to type your passwords so if someone has a key logger even if they have man even if they've they've got you good and they have you know remote access to your screen um unless they can also access your
clipboard um yeah man even if they can access your clipboard the autofill service I don't believe copies the plain text of your password to the clipboard so as long as you're not contrl c contrl v pasting your passwords I I'm sure there's a way but it would be very difficult ult to get passwords even if you had even if they had your clipboard and even if they had a key logger and even if they could see your screen because almost every password field that I've seen in the last 10
years just uses asterisks or dots or whatever else instead of actually pasting the text in there one password apparently clears the clipboard after a time delay uh as far as I know it just edits the HTML doesn't  yeah all right quino says be careful seemingly giving security advice uh I think what we're saying is fine yeah what we're saying that having more factors is good and if they're strong factors then that's better yeah what what I'm questioning is some people talking about how you
can my whole thing is I'm just very unsure about the idea of of storing all of your two factor in one application the main argument I'm seeing around it is in general if someone is going to have access to this thing they probably have access to your whole device um and that device is usually described as a phone um remote desktop plus autofill plus developer tools equals compromis with O2 FAA yeah there's lots of different yeah there's tons of different attack vectors yeah um I just question the idea
of reducing the layers because it feels like reducing the layers and I understand some of the arguments like okay if they're literally in your phone then they already have it  well I don't know I don't know about that cuz like the things that I hear getting compromised more often these days are computers and I never have my two-factor authentication stuff on my computer I know some people do but I don't like I never run offie some people run aie in their browser really yeah oh I
don't do that okay yeah me neither yeah that just I mean man I trying to think is this is this like a is this like a subconscious bias or does this have a basis in reality I just kind of think I've always wanted the separation I think of Windows computers as just like kind of probably compromised yeah am I just buying into the Apple m Ming I don't know well I do too so I don't know like I I don't want to be in a position where my computer is the sole portal to any account but I in some
cases you can't really avoid it but I don't I don't like it and I I  um CH we says uh you should disable AutoFill in your password manager settings because they can autofill malicious password boxes manually paste it every time instead I do that to be clear this is one of those things I disable autofill because I find keepers at least is so bad I just find it doesn't work very well that it it it it'll also just like aggressively take over certain things or it'll decide that the wrong box is the
right one and it it won't let me progress on the website cuz it keeps trying to spam into the wrong box which is really bad oh yeah okay that's a that's a that's a that's a very interesting attack Vector um man security is just such a such a  man either way having a second Factor definitely not a bad thing putting it all in one place I'm just not sure if I can agree with that I think that's really the bottom line for me um SMS needs to completely not be a thing for for TFA uh do we want to move on to
what are we supposed to do oh we're supposed to do oh oh my goodness yeah people people have I think found the uh the new item on the store yeah yeah people found it before the show is even  friends lwigs Beday the swipe and swipe plus are now available on LTT store.com new year new clean in both elongated and round forms okay so the swipe plus it's not inexpensive but uh without giving you guys too much information let me just say it's uh you know gets pretty warm you know the water
the water gets pretty warm which is good um it doesn't have RGB but it does have some colors uh some of the colors were were we were we were told our best to avoid but we we definitely do have some uh some some nice different you know gamer colors that you can you can set your swipe plus to uh we also have the regular swipe U let's see if I can find that there it is much much more economical this one is not heated and doesn't have you know the fan and the carbon you know odor filter and all
those kinds of wild features and everything it's just a just a simple bedet why does lwig have a b day as far as I can tell it really is as simple as he thinks that people's butts should be cleaner I I actually I I can't I I I really have you know checked his I've talked to him about it I've checked his just external Communications about it um I've I I I've I've tried to to kind of analiz what his motivation could possibly be for creating a product like this and why do you make a screwdriver
because I just I think there should be a better screwdriver and I think towels be a better backpack why do you make a kids book I why' you make kids toys because they I think they're good why why are you making cable organizers because cable extension because the screwdriver needs to be longer sounds like the bed's valid yeah um so anyway I um yeah I  clean just I was just trying to get it  now so now the the knowledge of Ludwig's clean butthole is definitely something I
needed to so now you can get the swipe and the swipe Plus on LTT store.com uh this is I think the second non lmg Creator merch item that we've brought onto the store the man Jerry rig knife the Jerry rig everything knife has been a Smash Hit for us and maybe this will be a um Splash  it got him let's go yeah so uh someone asking uh Brandon p lmg is asking wait can I merch request a bedet I guess yeah I mean you there you go the the reality of it is that your your annual budget for stuff from LT
store is your annual budget and the stuff that we buy from lewig versus is the stuff that we buy from A supplier like they the it's not like the the lmg stuff is free there is yeah there is cost yeah so the cost is the cost is the cost and your budget is your  not yeah um anyway yeah I great I've been using one for I've had a swipe Plus in my upstairs bathroom for six months or something like that it's I I would have considered one of these but I bought in too early before he
started doing that cuz when there was the toilet paper shortages during the pandemic I was just like screw this man yeah and got up a day yeah it I wasn't open to it until I traveled to Japan yeah I was always like Oh weird toilets toilet paper makes so much sense toilet paper makes no sense toilet paper seems very very archaic and out of date at this point it really it really feels like like sure to you know to dry off or whatever but like what sorry I'm taking this like 
um Casey herp J1 on the float plane on Flo plane chat says not open to bedday very clinched okay I go ahead stay clenched but uh anyway the point is U what am I talking yeah like why why am I like you know getting my hand all up in there and like this like this wimpy paper and the manufacturing it you are literally manufacturing garbage when you make toilet paper why why are we doing this and like okay a little bit is is fine you know so your you know your butt's not all wet when you pull your underwear 
like it it just seems spectacularly wasteful and an an affordable bed like the swipe at 50 bucks will pay for itself it will pay for itself yeah the the the the $50 one probably rather quickly actually yeah so I I yeah as soon as I as soon as I tried it in Japan um like man the toilets they have over there it's like it's like they're amazing yeah it's like landing on an alien planet and they just have figured out waste disposal in ways that humans could never have imagined
like I I've told this story on Lano before but I we pulled over at a rest stop on a highway and the bathroom was so much nicer than anything I've seen in like you know a fourstar hotel in you know North America like in a hotel lobby or like a you know an upclass restaurant you know I'm talking public washrooms obviously right uh it was just everything was clean the lighting was so bright and the toilet seat was heated and this is like like in a shack at the side of the road essentially I don't
even think there was a convenience store like I I couldn't believe it Dan check teams yeah it's um yeah I don't know I think for them too it's like it's it's got to be one of those things where I believe a lot of them are made there um and it's so ubiquitous there that the pricing is probably not as bad like when I tried to get a bedet here it was kind of rough but the pricing also just makes sense because you just do it once yeah and then it's just you just don't buy toilet
paper yeah awesome yeah and over the span of your entire lifetime that you are alive even a swipe plus will pay for itself yeah cuz like with my understanding um they don't really break that often either well they're pretty simple devices especially the the basic one is like a valve and a dial you still paying for water yeah we live somewhere where water is very cheap but I believe basically everywhere that would still be a cheaper alternative than buying toilet paper yeah I think I I I I find it hard
to believe that a little bit of water uh would cost more than the paper that you would use for that cuz it's not it's not like that much water now obviously this I'm sure there's like an example of somewhere where that's not the case but I think most places that will be the case Okay uh so anyway um why don't we do a couple merch messages oh right merch messages how do they work so instead of you know twitch bits or super chats or whatever else we have merch messages that way whether we do or don't get to
your message hey you get your highquality merchandise from LTT store.com in the mail uh sometime after the show so all you got to do is add the items that you're interested in to your cart and then in the cart you'll see a little box that'll have a place for you to fill in a merch message that'll go to producer Dan there he is now he's gone and he will reply to you or flag it for me and Luke to respond to or send it to someone else internally who can answer you or just pop it up on there if you
have like a hi Mom shout out and your mom watches W show which is unusual but not unheard of Luke's mom watches W show yeah hiom exactly uh why don't you show us a couple to kind of show us how it's done Dan yeah sure thing first up here what is the weirdest or most obscure reason you've had to delay or cancel a product or project sorry oh man most of the reasons for us cancelling projects usually come down to just them being fundamentally broken like not not working at all um I mean
man I'm trying to think of something that we cancelled recently we we didn't cancel but we delayed a desk fan that is made out of E-Waste hard drives recently um and the reason for it was that the idea was that we would use the motor from the hard drive ah and we're probably still going to do it at some point but the issue was that if we just ran those motors with no particular protection so the so the first proof of concept I basically told the engineer who showed it to me or the the person in
the engineering department I don't know if strictly speaking they were an engineer it's a protected term in Canada long story uh I told the the the the Creator Warehouse engineering department person who worked on it uh to immediately un plug it uh put a label on it that it was unsafe and that no one should turn it on under any circumstances and uh basically said okay so this is a much more complicated project um let's see if we can figure out a way to make it make sense it ended
up sort of getting a pin put in it but basically what they did was they took the motor set it up with a little 3D printed thing put a drone propeller blade on it and I don't know if you guys are that familiar with um hard drive Motors but inside a hard drive they spin at anywhere from real fast 5400 RPM to 7200 RPM I don't know if you're familiar with drone propellers but they can be pretty scary um and that thing sitting on the desk I'll tell you this it moved air not too surprised about that it it
moved some air I was uh I was feeling cooled I wonder how fast it was actually spinning I'm not sure we could have there's going to be there's got to be a lot more resistance than it normally has I actually asked him to find out you can put a piece of tape on one of the blades and then you can just hold like a thing up to it and it'll it'll count how many per second uh I I don't know if anyone ever got back to me on that but suffice to say it was terrifying and um I was
like okay well we have a lot of work to do on you know controllers for this and building a safe propeller design and uh W this is obviously a much bigger project just put a cage around it like most desktop fans we could but we'd have to design that cage and we'd have to because the idea was we weren't really sure what that product was at the time is this something that we make and it's like bespoke and it's numbered and we do 100 of them and it's done is it something that we make on an ongoing
basis but it's like kind of a boutique sort of handcrafted product is this something that we provide as a kit and we just kind of send out to you the you know the cage and propeller and the and the arm maybe we get it injection molded so it's not just like you know 3D printed and uh and we basically validate different models of hard drives and you build it yourself like there's there was a lot of different ideas for how we could bring it to Market and right now I think we
just won't do anything for now yeah uh what else you got with for me Dan happy New Year in an alternative reality what would LT look like as a cable TV show in the 1990s I didn't watch watch like G4 tech TV or like Steve Do's show or I didn't have access to any of them personally yeah I don't think I I H I'm trying to think in the 90s did I don't think I I don't think my family had a cable subscription so I didn't really um I didn't really get access to any of that but I would imagine we'd have kind of
like a fun sort of colorful side kick sort of character like like a like a producer Dan type of type of person um I would imagine that we'd probably have a lot of guests on like that was kind of how everyone did things back then was you you kind of had guests on to kind of show their their wears um everything was so expensive like on the production side like it would it would have to be in a studio there's no way that you could just shoot stuff at home with any kind of decent quality in the '90s most of
them as far as my understanding goes were just in like Standard TV studios they would just have one of the sets so that they could read use those crazy expensive cameras that they would use for basically everything news all the different various shows they would all be in one Studio I'd imagine everything would be a lot more tutori like even back at the beginning of NC Tech tips almost every video started with okay what's a tutorial we can do and what products do we need to feature in order
to get this point across and back then especially there would be a lot of things to give tutorials on computers were hard very few things that you could just sort of take for granted that everyone knows about and you're just sort of evaluating performance or whatever else like if I if you did a GPU review in 1996 you would have to explain what a GPU is you wouldn't just take for granted that people know what FPS means I think that's what some of them kind of were yeah but it was like what's a sound
card and why could you possibly want one and like how would you go about installing one and picking one stuff like that some of them I found I didn't have access to any of them um but some of them that I found on like YouTube many many years later are actually like kind of cool I I can think of one in particular that had this like kind of weird thin desk and the the host would sit on like the close side and the there was usually a guest would sit on the far side and the computer would kind of be in the
middle and then it would be like this presentation piece I don't remember the name of the show um sounds fascinating it was good though good job I I described it CU I'm hoping someone will recognize it and post it okay FL PL chat's super useful love you Flo plan chat um all right it's time for us to pick another topic Luke you want to pick one hold on yeah they got it of course they did okay are we going to your screen I'm not there yet but yeah uh we will be hilarious computer
Chronicles this old This Old House Is Awesome D Bradley said 71 I've tried to i' I've had to use them when I was like working on a couple of a couple things I don't know them or anything but uh great videos sorry I'm slowly going through YouTube ads here we go all right what am I look oh computer Chronicles oh wait no that's the YouTube channel uh yeah but it's just re-uploads from like this old so this was the main host here we go and they would show like I guess this is probably like
wow informational transaction Appliance they would show like this is how you use the thing how many buttons does it  yeah Starfire Pippen no way no way pien nice I never figured out what happened to ours I wish we still had it yeah I either someone stole it or was misplaced but where would it have been misplaced I feel like if it was misplaced it would have come up by now it's Poss well remember misplaced could mean accidentally thrown in the garbage like that server that one time like
stuff happened um anyway wild for people that are wondering that's really good screen cap for back then lonus and I did a did a video on an Apple Pippen which is what's here right now I'm very surprised we randomly landed on an episode that has the Pippen in it um Apple's game console yeah and and then it just like disappeared I don't have it I checked at home cuz you mentioned misplaced and I was like did I just take it it's not there found other stuff it's the kind of thing that Luke would like
borrow yeah and be like I'm going to check out this on my own time and then just kind of forget about it never return with or come back with like nine years later like those gpus that He took for his dad brings back ewaste and it's like hey  do you want them like I guess you did want them yeah I mean you never honestly if we ever needed to do a video on some old stupid GPU then it's better to just have them sitting in the warehouse than have to go eBay dumpster diving for one
but yeah no I I have no idea what happened to it which is really frustrating cuz I don't want to buy another one I'm sure they haven't gone down in value and ours was immaculate it was brand new in box when we got it good shape left it in perfect condition like we fired it up once just ited ESS yeah and it's a really cool piece like it's it's yeah I don't know yeah this this show is like actually pretty cool I would have absolutely loved to watch this if I knew it even like existed and
also had access to it back then but um it's kind of a cool because there are such good versions uploaded to this YouTube channel um it's kind of a cool Time Capsule to go look back at something we talked this on W show not that long ago but the whole like the internet never forgets uh unless it does thing is is pretty real and there's a lot of stuff from like the 9s and early 2000s internet eras that are just sort of gone now um so it's nice to be able to have something like this where it is
actually being decently preserved do don't forget about Do's dat Cafe I think you've met this guy yeah well I know Steve doto right yeah yeah I I know Steve dto but this was a Canadian uh I've never seen this sort of similar idea uh this guy's great he's got a ton of Personality yeah um super fun guy super nice I've uh yeah very nice I I think I've only met him once but really nice we brought him on wano once actually I I've been meaning to like collab again anyway this is on net
Netscape Navigator I I would I would I could totally I could totally see myself doing you know like what Steve D did this is awesome and again like surprisingly solid screen capture yeah he was telling me that um that was one of the big things that they innovated was um using old cameras to capture from like to shoot a CRT screen without the scan lines that were that were pretty typical on other shows at the time he was saying that was something they figured out really really early
on but yeah yeah good good old Steve dto uh anyway yeah a lot of old shows like I think you've talked about this too like made in Canada uh is like impossible to find no you can get it now CBC gem whole thing oh that's cool yeah and I uh made my own copy just in case it ever disappears again that's good that's good actually that's good genuinely uh but I like that um whoever's behind the computer Chronicles was proactive about getting it up themselves I believe this channel
is official um and it seems to have like basically everything which is just awesome it's really cool it's it's such a it's such a valuable resource that no one's going to watch and then an AI is going to scrape it and then we'll have access to it with no compensation for the original Creator hey did you see that um oh shoot is it the times hold on who's uh who's  I think it's the New York Times yeah New York Times has filed a federal lawsuit against open a in Microsoft seeking to
end the practice of using its stories to train chat Bots saying that copyright infringement at the paper alone could be worth billions okay I don't know about billions but it definitely could be worth something and what makes this even spicier is that um from my understanding Microsoft has released a statement saying okay so first the New York Times said that uh part of why they're so upset this is that they have been in negotiations with Microsoft and open AI to use it legit legitimately and
Microsoft basically came out and was like uh okay yeah we kind of thought we were still talking about this this lawsuit is still super disappoint this lawsuit is super disappointing um what I suspect is that they were just so far away on the number that the New York Times has basically just gone yeah forget it um and so they know from negotiating with Microsoft and this might have been part of their play in fact that actually wouldn't surprise me that much they know from negotiating
with Microsoft that New York Times data has been given a very high level of credibility in training and remember guys there's a lot of different aspects of training I'm not you might think the New York Times is a rag or whatever I don't feel like talking about that that's that's not the point the point is that there's a lot of elements that you might be training a large language model on and not all of them are necessarily the accuracy of the article I don't care I'm not going to
talk to you about that uh what we could talk about though is things like punctuation and grammar so the the the chatbot having any kind of sense of what a sentence is supposed to look like yeah I would probably take the New York Times over your Twitter post um I know I I know I know I know fake training thanks twitch chat real helpful appreciate [Laughter] you oh boy anyway sorry I don't think this is in the dock but I just was reminded of this by something else that I was looking at here
um is this maybe doesn't sync AI but I know we've talked about you know the aresto momentum of of AI that's been going on a little bit lately and I mean this seems pretty if they win this pretty much anyone whose data was used to train these these large language models is going to have to go back and prove they didn't use them or they are man every everyone in their dog has been busted at this point multiple times yeah um I don't think it's going to stop anything CU there are people developing this
stuff that don't care and enough of it is open source that people are just going to be able to scrape on lower levels than corporate and you won't be able to go after them properly and you won't know they're doing it and it's not going to matter cat's kind of out of the bag when this stuff got heavily open sourced with like llama and all these other things like it's done man it's oh I don't mean there's anything that they can do to un Pandora this box oh got it I just mean
the big companies oh yeah some of them might get hit real hard yeah are they are they done I think I think what what is it called um when there's like a landmark case I think it's called a landmark case no but precedent there we go yeah I think this this is going to set precedent pretty hard what is it  avalanche the uh destruction um yeah no precedent I think is going to be set by this pretty hard because these are two very major very recognizable in their space companies if you talk about news
in North America you probably know New York Times if you talk about software stuff especially operating systems you probably know Microsoft like it's yeah yeah New York Times versus Microsoft pretty big deal we were yeah we were talking about this on the pre-show I I ended up down a rabbit hole on like why boxers stood like this and it turns out there's a lot of very compelling reasons for as far as understanding goes it mostly boils down to Bare knuckle boxing versus not well
it was it was but there's other things going on yeah mostly bare knuckle boxing but then uh one video I watched in particular I wish I could remember who did it but uh got a little bit more into why this pose is better for Bare knuckle boxing it keeps them at a distance more it protects it was a lot more body shot because you were not punching people in the head uh you'd still go for the soft cheeks you'd still go for the jaw hitting someone in the forehead can actually be really it can hurt your own
hand a lot yeah um you're also not doing like the big Power punches as much so your rear hand is usually back to protect your your body and you're focusing more on Jabs with that front hand like it's actually a very different style of fighting so but you so you get the old like yeah see we're going fight  um do we want to talk about manufactured DRM sabotaging polish trains this was like last week or couple weeks ago but it's terrible a decent amount of the news in the in the show this week is
somewhat old but you probably weren't paying that much attention in the news anyways CU you were busy with holiday stuff so why did you tell them it's fine it's fine you didn't have to tell them nobody has to know po train manufacturer newg here's some news Beday are popular the wag new a not popular as screwdrivers though still screwdrivers very popular hey you need both right do you do you need a screwdriver to install the b day I don't remember definitely a wrench yeah but that's not a screwdriver
so not yeah sounds like we need a wrench I mean I wanted to do a fail wrench what would that have been uh it was going to be a wrench made of melted down failed screwdriver shaft from that supplier who shafted us got him uh Pol train manufacturer newag that's what I'm going to call it is under investigation by Regulators following allegations that had installed DRM like software on its trains that caused them to fail uh to fail to restart after certain set triggers in order to drive more service work to
itself one competitor SPS I mean it sounds pretty smart to me you just get to do more you get more service Revenue yeah which is probably good money because they're going to really want those trains back on the rails uh one competitor SPS was hit with fines "equivalent to 462,000" euros dang because newag trains for the lower cesan Railway it serviced would fail to restart afterwards um I'm I'm assuming after servicing uh the rail operator then sent the trains to newag
who easily fixed them for an additional fee suspiciously trains that hadn't been recently serviced but had that unused in storage for significant periods of time started failing in a very similar manner in response SPS oh man brilliantly in my opinion whoever had the the the thought of doing this very good move SPS hired a Polish hacking Collective called Dragon sector sick Name by the way way to go on that one uh to investigate according to Dragon sector the trains were
intentionally programmed to stop working under certain condition such as certain components being replaced without a manufacturer approved serial number these included an idle timer that would stop the train from starting if it sat for over 10 days possibly under the assumption that it was undergoing servicing um after train started failing after only being uh after only being stored a new trigger was programmed uh in that added Geo fencing around competitors workshops so
that the trains would instead lock up after being brought to those facilities newag is denying these allegations and claims that these issues were caused by Third parties interfering with the train security features I love how often the security card gets played anytime a company gets caught doing something sometimes it is legitimate this time no I said when they get caught doing something scummy yes yeah it's amazing how cuz most people either don't understand security very well or
especially don't care their eyes just glaze over the second you start talking about any kind of digital security or anything like that and they're like uhuh uhhuh uhuh uhuh is he is he badgering me to install a password manager again I I like my 1 12 34 love password you know or whatever the case may be um so if there's any way to get people bored of a conversation it's to say oh it's it's in the name of user security and then just start saying a bunch of stuff and people
will just kind of gradually drop out of interest and you know get a go about their day the the private key needs to go in the and then like 98% of people just disconnect anyway basically that's bad and it should be obvious why that's bad and uh this is a great illustration of why companies like apple should not be allowed to do similar things and a example of what Apple if left to their own devices might have eventually come up with for iPhones if they weren't ultimately able to stop people from
repairing these things through serialization and all the other means uh that they put in place to prevent people from repairing their own iPhones and from third parties it's it's somewhat stunning to me how many people will do this stuff and not out their own companies I guess it's interesting interesting I don't know I mean people do do far worse than this for a paycheck yeah like come on but like be realistic yeah think of the things  done the horrible things hor things yeah
know I just I I think maybe it's my bubble of like finding recruitment kind of hard um but I feel like software developers like if you're like hm I'm G to defraud my own country basically it's like yeah you could probably get another  um sorry you're saying that software developers yeah have a tendency to always be the good guys in the story no oh what do you how sorry sorry I thought I thought you were saying like someone would see the idea of defrauding their own country and then
resign from the job rather than go do it I'm saying in this particular case I think if you work in that field you have a high chance of finding another job I can understand for some positions some jobs it might be like this is the only way I'm going to get bread on the table I think a lot of people just don't care Luke I I think a lot I think a lot of developers would just oh my God develop a a button that like kills a random person and deposits a million dollars into the company's bank account as long
as they get a of it like I I don't know man yeah sorry I just wish that wasn't a thing that's all I'm saying I I also I also think that I mean okay okay but like okay here's another thing look at the AR okay look at the arguments around Net Neutrality look at the arguments around right to repair especially when you start getting into the you know the Apple ecosystem and the people who are just kind of I don't know how to describe it other than brainwashed I'm really sorry um when we when we when we
made that video about the iMac Pro that Apple wouldn't repair at our cost the number of people that attacked us for it when we basically said yeah it's pretty obvious that just you know replacement parts should be a thing at a reasonable price it shouldn't cost as much for just some pieces of a component as it costs for the entire or some pieces of a machine as it cost for the entire machine including those pieces that doesn't make any sense the number of people that attacked us for it when
that's just math it's not political it's just obvious um so no maybe in some people's minds it makes perfect sense that if you are the manufacturer of a train you should be the only one who's allowed to fix it because you know yeah someone else might might bung it up or whatever the case may be which is not an entirely illegitimate concern I just don't think that's what even happened they were they were taking these trains off the rails I know I just I just mean as a preventive measure not even just to
not get other people to work on them though they were doing them doing it ROM get more service well you know you got to make sure that they're running fine and maybe that's the way it was sold internally maybe they weren't even honest internally with the developers  system maybe they just told them hey we have found that um the customers for these trains are not performing service at the recommended intervals we need to make sure that the trains are uh are shutting down at such time as the
regular interval should be done or whatever and it wasn't coded that way and here's the I'm just I'm just saying there's a lot of room for gray area I'm not saying they should do this it's obviously terrible I'm just saying that just because a developer codes this feature doesn't mean that they agree and even if they do agree or doesn't mean they understand and even if they do understand it doesn't mean they agree and if even if they agree it doesn't mean that they're not an
idiot that's all that's all I'm trying to say yeah but I disagree it's bad it's definitely very bad um all right man I have to get signed back into the dock but people can see my hands so I have to fake that I'm pressing keys that I'm not pressing and it's getting all I never talk about that trick yeah I just kind of yeah okay you got to do what you got  stuff I like that that's actually hilarious oh sure I'm going to I'm going to hide my hands you don't get to see my hands I can see your hand you can no oh
you can see this bit you can't see the this entire hand no okay have fun with your like one letter you're going to see me inut I'm going to enter one of the letters we'll just hope that whatever letter I enter is one that's like goes there yeah was pretty did I get it I mean it was in the alphabet nice but was it in the numeric uh take no chat his password has characters in it and it's definitely definitely English might not be English there we go yeah most of mine actually they mix it up sometimes not
English I like that yeah that's cool I should use that I'm I'm I'm Hazard I have one trick for passwords that I that I love so much but I I don't know if I want to say it because one of the reasons why it's good is because a lot of like Brute Force password guessers never get it because they don't incorporate it M so I don't know if I want to like popularize its use I think I want to keep this one for myself see that's the thing though that's a bad mentality and you know that should I share it well but
then see then it's the constant like cat and mouse game right like how do you help people have better security without also informing the other side and how's  side but but no that that is that that is cuz it's a it's a great trick it's I would say that that is not an elt attitude we are sharing is caring I am not saying you should I technically don't work for L Media Group anymore I'm still going to have to "change your 700,000 passwords when you" get hacked now I never said people couldn't get me
just to be clear yeah this is not a challenge I'm sure if someone wanted to hacker my box or they could I can just say it chat mostly says don't do it but then some of them were like give us the tech tip because that's kind of you know that's kind of what we do is give people tips that are useful for a little while until you know the Naro Wells go and update their and then we have to come up with a new tech tip and that's how we all stay employed because there always needs to be a new tech what if I
what if I arm people to potentially figure it out themselves okay I like that yeah that's a compromise that's a good compromise a lot of passwords can take characters that don't normally get typed especially that don't normally get typed for  this my passwords are all going to be emojis now especially when you're when you're thinking about brute forcing CU like when it comes to guessing or social engineering or someone just getting in your password manager or anything like
that or or uh key logging it's not going to matter what you do right like they just have your password now yeah um but if it comes to brute forcing there's a lot that you can do to make your passwords more Brute Force resilient while still not making them really annoying to like visually enter or whatever else to remember that's a big one for me is I like my passwords to be something that I can retain in my brain for long enough to like it out into a keyboard or character map as it were yeah

were great merch messaging to ask about HDR uh YouTube on mobile your camera footage looks great especially skin tones but web pages look dark and gray what's up with that that is a great question that I'm sure Ed could answer I'm sure it has something to do with you know Peak brightness being white and that also having some kind of uh metadata for being extremely bright or something yeah that shouldn't that shouldn't even be it I'm not sure um it probably has to do with that we have to 
um you know what it probably is actually that because the way that the metadata works on YouTube is more like hdr10 rather than hdr10 plus where it's per frame so it's it's across the entire piece of content so if you have anything in the entire video That's supposed to appear bright like a specular highlight a candle or something like that then that's your 100% brightness so anything else is probably going to look dimmer and more gray by comparison because we wouldn't want to actually send a 100%
full white um every time we do a screen capture uh I'd have to I'd have to double check because we have people internally whose jobs are to understand that stuff better than me it's the kind of thing that whenever I'm making a video about it I'll like brush up on it and go oh yeah yeah yeah that and refigure it out but um yeah that would be that would be my guess I think that's something you'll probably continue to see because one of the complaints that we've gotten not just on HDR content but SDR as well
about screen cap is that when we capture white as white and people are you know a night mode user or like are dark mode user or they're watching at night it can be very jarring when we go from the host who's you know lit in a reasonable scene to just like an all-white page um so I that could also just be something that we adapted for that L Luke if you could design the ultimate futuristic Tech Gadget that hasn't been invented yet what features would it have and how would you envision it transforming daily
lives oh man I mean I I feel like with the the the boundless human imagination that exists out there there's no way I'm going to come up with something that someone else already didn't like uh the idea of being able to conjure anything by just you know rearranging atoms or whatever so what are they called in Star Trek not synthesizers the the food things that they made yeah I don't remember old gray hot yeah exactly yeah yeah exactly right like the being able to go anywhere instantly being able to
have anything instantly ironically I suspect it would actually take a lot of the um fun out of certain things yeah um you know some part of part of the fun replicators there you go part of the fun of a trip um were apparently going to Japan and as far as I can tell 90% of the excitement about this for Ivon is the preparation not the actual like going there like if you could just walk into a hollow deck and be there immediately I actually think it would I think it would reduce the 
her yeah for me it would be why you laughing you don't think I'm an expert    um uh for me I think it would be things that actually get me off devices more um and I I think that could come in the form of uh input even like you I I see a lot of people I don't do this I don't actually know why but I see a lot of people dictate messages through voice and I think that's kind of the direction that I'm talking about um is is like yeah I don't necessarily want to sit here and type this whole thing and
while staring at the screen if I can just press one button and talk into it I don't want to talk to things I need a neural interface yeah but that's what I'm saying in that direction I'm not saying that cuz we basically already have that so yeah like things that can get me off of the device maybe different input methods whether it's neural or whatever else um things that uh like we've talked about this for a long time being able to wear glasses that are basically a Rolodex yeah I almost don't
want it to do anything other than be a rol yeah just like tell me who that person is and why I'm supposed to know them why I'm supposed to know them how many times have I met this person especially if it's more than zero um like yeah and and it it I don't I don't even necessarily want it to be creepy you can pull this information from my contacts yeah you know like don't don't search the internet have it be local I'd be happy to do a little recap for it like yep you know hey this is important for next time
I see you know whoever right there's there's ways to not be aw but it will be awful yeah 100% oh yeah it's going to end up being connected to some creepy database yeah it's going to tell you everything about and it's going to as it learns from your usage it's going to upload that to everyone else as well it's going to be horrible but a non horrible version I'm use it going to be super useful yeah but yeah things things that make it so that I actually spend less time manually myself using the
devices and the more the devices stay in my pocket or stay closed or whatever else and doing things sounds great to me gy 008 says make me Neville's remember all from Happy from Happy Potter that's a funny typo happy happy Potter I can I'm imagining Adam Sandler as a  golfer I thought he like makes okay that movie was great but I thought he makes like good movies now um oh man um any I thought his most recent movie like went really well um I don't know what one it was hustle I think I'm not sure Adam
Sandler makes whatever movie he feels like as far as I can tell all right hit me Dan hey dlll currently listening after I cleared out my fridge that just died got any good Appliance failure stories for the audience uh I mean other than oh man uncut gems yeah there we go that's what I was thinking that was a long time ago was it keep up with movies these days yeah that's fair um I every Appliance I've experienced Dy dies very unspectacular when fridges die it's pretty bad especially if you don't
notice for a couple days oh but I mean like the device itself just stopped working like it didn't oh yeah oh our oven had a bit of a problem the other day uh we have a we have a Bosch oven and fortunately it has error codes that work so at least I know what the problem is but we went to we went to bake some banana bread we had three loaves of banana bread at work dude you're not going to know that Meme but I love that Meme cool it's so good all right anyway so we were going to
make some banana bread yes some of it might have come to work um and suddenly there's smoke all throughout the house and the banana bread is not definitely not going to be good liked it uh this is well before the timer was supposed to go out it's not like we just didn't notice it and the the door was locked we couldn't even get it open oh so it turned out what had happened was like a runaway temperature event so the heat just kept going past what it was set to past the thermal
safety limit for the oven which caused it to lock itself down and then it basically had to it it it did manage to safety shut off so it was I looked it up and it was one of two things it was either your temperature sensor has gone bad which it wasn't because the thermal shutdown happened or it was your relay wasn't working properly for the like it sent like a disconnect signal and the daugh board that was supposed to handle the relay right um it has worked people said okay you can set it like this and then
assuming the temperature sensor is good sometimes the relay just magically starts working again so it's worked fine since then but it was a little sketchy like it smelled like burning like not like burnt food like burning they came out black they're supposed to be brown you golden you in the parts where it splits at the top cuz delicious banana bread anyway I love banana bread work dude banana bread at work dude hell yeah yeah my mom said okay that's that when you wait for
things dude good things happen to you dude that's number five what that's it's number five autocomplete for banana bread okay okay do you know this D so this is just like a damn Daniel like random viral clip yeah yeah yeah do you know this one Dan yeah it's a it checks out yeah yeah okay right old that's good I'm old so it being old is fine I I just I mostly just quote Vines constantly in my entire life yeah yeah Road works I sure hope it does see you just have to say one little
line got him Miss fine yeah yeah me too all right uh well cool yeah sorry I didn't I did not get the reference I  them all right uh you got one more for us Dan yeah sure let's see hey dlll I'm a PC repair Tech and a veteran have you oh I read that as veterinarian so did I that's a weird combo yeah that that makes and I the same thought I was like huh I hope they're like one shop that'd be neat you got the one counter you just put your computer on it you got the other counter you put your dog on it so
my laptop and my dog don't put your dog on the computer counter they're going to put the USB diagnostic Drive in W trying to turn the dog on and off again it's like it's not working okay sorry any um yes a PC repair Tech and a veteran I assume so uh have you all done any or planned to do any how to not get scammed online videos that I can share with my elderly customers oh we've touched on this a little bit but it's like it's so hard now it's really hard because we can't cover everything it
changes nobody wants to watch it the people like the people who are going to get scammed I don't know how to say this respectfully probably not watching the it's not like the resources aren't out there to find out some of it's getting really rough some of it's getting really actually very hard yeah I I got a I got a Spam call that was really good like if I was if I was even slightly less of a competent adult human being I I could have easily given valuable information
over the phone people are doing uh voice spoofing of specifically I'm not going to get into the the reasons why for this but specifically mom's daughters oh yeah and they're like screaming in distress and stuff like that's oh my goodness the one I got they um it came up as from my bank MH so I did answer it because I'll just ignore anything that's not from anyone that I recognize these days um so it came up as my bank and they basically were like yeah there's been some fraudulent activity don't worry we've
locked down the card we're going to get everything reversed for you but we do need to to check some things with you and um then at some point you know everything sounded fine I was like I was talking to them I was like yeah sure I mean yeah that sounds pretty bad no I didn't use the card um and then as soon as they asked what's your uh can I just verify the credit card and I was like well you should be able to tell me which one and they're like it's the one that starts with the
first four digits and I was like yeah but every credit card issued by your bank your financial institution starts with those first four digits that doesn't tell us anything uh you need to tell me like the last two and they basically were like no I I need the whole number and I kind of go okay well um the tip I would say for this is always hang up and call them back okay well hold on we're getting to that um so I basically said well how am I supposed to know that you are who you say you are and they
said well I I mean I called you from the bank and I go yeah but that can be spoofed and they're like uh and I say look I'm just going to call you back click uh because a lot of people don't realize that the phone number that someone's calling from can be spoofed so they can just tell it hey I want this to show up as 1 1800 whatever when I call the person it's it's getting freaking sophisticated and there were things about the call that made me uneasy like the extremely long delay on
the line but it wasn't until I looked back that I went oh that's probably because they were calling from very far away they're probably overseas somewhere yeah um and they they did not unconvincing accent 3 seconds or something yeah always call back call back the number on the back of the card except nothing else yep yeah I do that for basically any institution that calls me if it has anything to do with payment or or changing pretty much anything um if the thing that we're
discussing could hurt me at all or if they ask for any form of authentication then I call them back yeah like I've had back when why didn't you authenticate me you called me yeah back when tus used to be cool um they used to call me every time that I had to renew my contract and they would be like hey uh we're going to give it to you like either cheaper or you get the same price and more features yeah and I'd be like sick yeah do it up they' be like okay bye like I'm not going to call them back for
that whatever yeah it's fine um but if they're the worst case scenario is you don't get the better features yeah but they didn't ask for any authenticating things they didn't ask for any payment stuff they didn't ask for whatever they just yeah it was fine so that was fine it just it was one of those things where I was I was on I was having a particularly like groggy day I hadn't slept well because this was this week um and uh ivonne's in recovery mode and not sleeping well Sheck yeah no she um had
three of her wisdom teeth out they were impacted and the ones on the bottom were growing in sideways so the bottom is already the worst and then they were under the gum and growing this way so she had to go under it was like when was that um beginning of this week yeah she's been like replying to emails because she I was going to say things insane but like she's been answering things I know I I talk to her about it's quite a like genuinely there's a lot of trauma you're preaching to Theo your mouth yeah we
were she doing ice pack rotations in the same conversation she goes yeah I'm was feeling worse today because I think I overdid it yesterday and then she goes but I think I should be able to push tomorrow and I'm just like who do you   type yeah ridiculous anyway the point is I hadn't slept my cuz yes ice pack rotations and everything I I loaded up on we had like four ice packs in the house I was like we probably need double that so I got a bunch more ice packs and got all the different the drug cocktails
like felt like old people like I put together like a medication schedule for her and everything um what was she eating kanji umji nice further purade cream of broccoli soup um she's able to do like uh she was really tired of that after a couple days and on day three she was able to do overcooked instant noodles and she was like this is heaven like soggy instant noodles I I broke up the pack first yeah so they were like little tiny pieces of soggy instant noodles um and then the egg I
put in like extra egg cuz I think she had zero protein since the whole thing started so I like trickled it in and like stirred it so it was basically just like kind of Cloudy broth almost yeah um but she's just like this is so much better than what I've been eating it's horrible but I can't remember the name of them and I'm sure float plane chat will again be able to point it out but my I can't remember the the doctor name for it but dentist guy that does surgeries um orthodontist is that right
uh no I don't think so that they do like um braces and stuff orthodontist yeah yeah I don't know either way um he suggested this like drink that you can just get at like Savon or what whatever else um oral surgeon yeah okay sure I thought it was more complicated what's an oral surgeon yeah what's the like name behind it what's a uh what's a uh was this what's a landmark case what's the word this darn it um no but yeah it's it's this drink um Tooth Fairy so we we bought thanks float plane chat got
you we bought like a a bunch of this one type of drink cuz it was recommended by the guy um is it pedite andure yep yeah that's the one uh and we figured out that it's like very common for like you know old people that have trouble chewing because of various things might be going on um and it tasted really good really so when I was on all the drugs I was like this is great yeah just I'll just have this this is no problem oh is it just like full of su and then when the drug started fading
I was like why does this taste so good it's basically a milkshake like actually does it bring all the boys to the yard though probably it brought me to the yard um nice where's the can I get a nutrition label um ensure nutritional info okay we're going to your screen not yet yeah you never know what might come up you search  internet okay here we go does have a lot of the vitamins where is its information it's got a bunch of protein can I go to your screen so that we're not just
imagining this it has nine grams of protein but it also has 18% of your daily sugar in 220 calories oh wow oh yeah okay so it's it's sugar it's basically a milkshake and they'll even flavor them like milk chocolate vanilla strawberry does so it's like but when you're having milkshakes for every meal it's like whoa okay how get you all right isn't corn melto dextran just like corn syrup is that in there is that the second ingredient after water so it's water and corn syrup and then the next one is sugar the
next one is like milk effectively oh it's a thickener sorry it's it's thickened water and then sugar so yeah nice yeah with with milk protein in there as well so it's it's basically a milk shake um yeah multi is the um the like corn-based the the the one added that they they do give you is it is pumped with like vitamins and stuff but still so are vitamins which you can just buy yeah they're not even expensive oh my goodness for how cheap vitamins are it's actually kind of
amazing how unmotivated I am to just take them yeah I just never I'm always like yeah I'm going to like take vitamins now and then I do it for a week and then I just am distracted I I thought it was was hilarious because I um I was taking I'm still taking athletic greens to kind of flush out my diet cuz I eat a lot of the same thing all the time so I'm sure I'm missing some stuff speaking of which confirmed Luke will be doing a float plane exclusive with the 100% success meal
showing you guys how to make it I haven't made it in years so I'm going to have to practice wow so basically you're saying once you're in a relationship you don't have to try anymore yeah or can try other things that don't need to have that type of sucess much a less cuz  anyways I can I can hear Emma being taken for granted from here what no um what was I saying anyways Lucas single in 32 one yeah no no no m is great yeah um what was I going to say what was I even thinking of you told totally and 
apparently I'm sorry Emma's Mom and Dad um what they don't watch this dude well  do it doesn't sound like my problem all right vitamins all right vitamins yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so um I started taking athletic greens to round it out yeah vitamins what is in that stuff what's in those anyways um and I I  fiber I I confidently said that I was getting sick less yeah and then like very shortly after saying that I got sick like twice in a row and one of them lasted a really long time and I nasty I
don't know travel man travel gets you yeah travel and Gatherings yeah both of  llings yes especially both that's what I was trying to say I know oh my goodness wi 789 says me if her parents don't know you're doing it by now that would be a little weird yeah yeah know we've been abstinent for uh what do you guys have seven eight years eight eight years good gravy eight I    God Dan save me what no it's not saving me get out of here why's your face so red um drug dealers adopt drones
according to a recent Vice Report law enforcement around the world are noting a market shift in using drones to move drugs across International borders over the the past few years driven in part by consumer drones being becoming larger and increasingly cheap in 2021 Spanish narcotics police captured a drone with a 13 foot wingspan whoa um capable of carrying 330 lbs of cargo while this was a mass manufactured Droid or drone built in China um built in China in 2022 Spanish authorities okay yeah found
three submersible drones that were manufactured specifically to fery drugs and capable of carrying 440 lb of cargo wow drones are also being used to deliver drugs and other Contraband into otherwise difficult to reach areas within countries such as prisons as reported by officials in the US and Canada yeah I read an article about this a while back apparently it's really difficult to stop them because it wouldn't be a giant 13t wingspan one that's just like yeah coming up to a prison it would be little
Zippy ones going and you know they have timeout in the yard or whatever else um there's very little incentive I don't think for the the people who work there to be have 100% constant monitoring of the all the skies in the area yeah like it's it's a really difficult problem you could drop it from pretty high too um although oh last October the UK government introduced no fly zones around all of their prisons which of course I mean if you just have a regul going to stop it that'll keep out the nar wells
yeah sure jeez that's a big drone 13 ft and that would be able to go pretty high probably probably but then would it be better to keep it low from like a radar standpoint I don't know no idea I mean I'm not involved in Contraband smuggling so I don't know enough about radar know very little about this world isn't radar specifically worse at picking up small objects I don't I do not yeah but that's why I was saying if it's big pretty big it could probably get up high but it's
also have a lot of space in between the arms I suspect stay low I suspect those arms are thin yeah but if you have like 330 lb of anything I'd imagine that's that's fair I mean considering that they can pick up a little whirly bird or whatever like that's probably got to have some substantial to it yeah 330 lb capable drone could smuggle The Prisoner never mind the drugs yeah man I'm I wonder if anyone's tried I'm surprised we haven't seen a jailbreak yeah just a drone with like
two bars on the bottom just like get jacked in prison just it's arm day every day and all you do is just like hangs until you just like jump up grab the thing and it freaking goes man it'd be dangerous as heck but like compared to staying in prison would I try it yeah I think so wow would you do it if someone arranged a drone to just show up in the yard would you grab the bottom of it and go I think it depends on like how long you're sent you're in there for 10 years let's say
10 years you will be you know 40 Whatever by the time you're out if I have a chance of getting out of the country and thus not an insanely High chance of just being put back in I don't think you have to get out of the country no like if you go legit and just like live a quiet life I think you could probably go somewhere like interior BC or like you know oil fields Alberta or something just like work UN in unofficial capacity you could probably lay low you don't think people are going to report like the guy
that wants to work but refuses to give you a I think you'd be surprised how many people are just like that anyway regardless of their pasts I I was another article I was reading recently was about the sort of uncomfortable truths that are being Unearthed by services like 23 and me um and I just want to make my position on them clear you shouldn't use them they're super super bad not just for you but also so for anyone related to you uh anyway uh but what was interesting about this was
there's this family that found out that like Grandpa was a completely different person from who they thought he was he never played with Babe Ruth um he like had a completely different family that he just abandoned and this was just it didn't match anything they knew about him they knew him as like a loving father and grandfather and didn't realize that he had just walked away from his responsibility in the US before he moved up to Canada or something like that I don't know allegedly
um that's unfortunate any who 10 years I have heard of a crazy amount of people finding out that like their parents like someone cheated on somebody or something cuz they're like huh I don't have anything from this line that's weird um yeah and also just like family lies in general yeah uh that that might come from oh yeah we have Irish you know Heritage or whatever like don't what are you talking about no we don't in some cases I've heard that those were very well-intentioned
actually but it was eventually forgotten that it was a lie if that makes sense yeah that makes sense um because like they did So to avoid persecution or yada yada y um but then eventually the the lie was kept so secret because it was so important that it just was forgotten eventually but top 10 drones that get  man the the propellers on that thing would be scary as like an April Fool's video like how to break out of prison am I am I going to have to buy another cantaloupe smuggling drones oh
man so you smuggle in a swarm of tiny drones yeah in people's butts and they all work together to lift  oh man oh jeez was that the first video you worked on or something D no it was one of the first requests I got for a video um I don't think I'd been here very long I was working in logistics and of course it was like uh hey we need a cantaloupe for this video uh why why do you want a calope oh it needs to be an analog for somebody's butt we're going to put a phone in it
butt phone butt phone all right I should have stayed at my last job what they didn't have butt phones at your last job no boring I signed up to manage inventory not butt phones inventory the butt phone yeah technically we also had to do that we have to find it first oh it's very uncomfortable time to I find the phone  was okay oh boy what even is this show who knows oh wow a Griff Aviation 300 can carry 227 kg or 500 lb of weight it only has a flight time of 31 minutes you
could get pretty far in 31 minutes but you but that's yeah 15 kmet range sorry Griff Avi Griff Aviation there's an eang 184 that can carry 220 lbs and go 30 kilom that's far enough away that you'd be kind of hard to track down I'm looking at there's a joav cw-80 that can carry 55 lb and it has a flight time of 840 minutes or 100 to 200 kilm which is like wow okay what am I looking at how big is it tell me how big it is 30 the one I was looking at was a Griff Aviation 300 not 30 this I hate websites 
yeah I would like it to take forever to navigate your website why don't you make a site like that the thing also doesn't need to fully take over the screen it only covered half the screen with information how big is it how about a single picture with any kind of a banana or something six I need something for scale how about a banana that's perfect  okay uh what else we got brands use AI in influencers I mean this is pretty funny oh here here here I got it you got it okay but that's a mountain funky looking
how Luke how is that supposed to help me know how big it is okay here we go here we oh wait Max size here we go it's 3.4  "long wait oh 3,400 M wait what is even" that okay I don't know that looked sorry  so I'm I'm reading this off of a TV over there I thought it was 3.4 M which would kind of make sense but height is is that 600 what sorry what 6 M would make more sense oh Kil 3.4 kilm size length that doesn't make any sense it's probably it's probably millimeters and there was a typo yeah
okay so 3.4 M then probably yeah they're about that big okay that's very for height yeah that's that's about how how big they should be yeah so Mills is what they were going for there yeah um there is a space oh they all have spaces never mind I think it's just a typo brands are apparently increasing increasingly buying paid posts from AI generated influencers such as AI Tiana Lopez a pink-haired model created by Spanish agency the clueless they run wild Instagram account for AI Tana with over
"250,000 followers many of whom seem to" believe she is real despite the account being labeled as AI she also has oh man you know I find the term NPC to be extremely disrespectful when used to  really yeah I can't really um you know what In fairness powered by AI doesn't necessarily mean anything that could mean that you are sponsored by an AI company or something like that especially when it when you look at the whatever that icon is I don't know balloon or something Barcelona's digital Muse atthe
clueless. you might think powered by AI is like yeah just part of the like I'm pushing the company thing yeah all right so that's a thing that is definitely a thing that exists I had seen if you go to the top of her pictures yeah I had seen that top right one and didn't realize it I saw it on an unrelated article and I just scrolled right past it and no part of my brain was like that's not a real person according to the clueless AI Tana typically earns around "€3,000 a month but can earn up to 10,000"
with each advert being worth over just "over a ,000 her sponsorships include big" a supplement company uh she also has a fan view account where they post pictures of her in lerie the UK's advertising standards agency says there are currently no rules requiring virtual influencers to disclose that they are AI generated and many do not do so a primary attraction of virtual influencer campaigns for companies is that they're significantly cheaper per impression up to 91% cheaper based on an Instagram
analytics report on a virtual influencer post by H&amp;M they also give the brand a far greater deal of control and eliminate the complexity and risk of dealing with human beings that have opinions and  I mean I mean we talked about this before I think I said a number of years ago if I was smart I'd be transitioning to be a vtuber I think this was back when we were on the set that was at the opposite end of this building say that for quite a while but like man for real though yeah
geez yeah there's been a bunch of accusations that I've seen that like a lot of the followers are uh like paid bot accounts and stuff but I mean if they're getting paid it's working yep so here's here's the clueless AI so here's their I guess they have an I click on anything CU Instagram on desktop just well I'm not logged in yeah but come on I don't know yeah they they want you to log in I any that data exactly Sony got fined for sabotaging controllers French Regulators have fined
Sony 13 and half million EUR for allegedly damaging the reputation of thirdparty controllers via a 2015 PS4 update that intentionally caused unofficial controllers to frequently disconnect further Regulators say that Sony selectively refused to communicate the wait no way Elijah follows her and didn't know no  actually I'm actually speechless I thought she was real no joke yeah and if you scroll up there's what I thought this chick was real I follow her wow always full of surprises this guy yeah life
man why do you follow Elijah don't don't answer that Elijah get out I play the Fifth's what's going on she's hot she says oh I gave you I gave you a warning didn't even care there was no right answer and yet you still managed to pick the wrong one yeah he probably hasn't seen war games has he no okay well I yeah anyway wow uh further Regulators say that Sony selectively refused to communicate the access criteria for its official licensing program to certain third party
manufacturers and used language that was imprecise because it allowed them to apply the criteria in a discretionary manner man I can can can Europe like do something not cool this is this is great this is great you should have clearly laid out guidelines they should be fair for everyone and thirdparty products should work just fine as long as they follow the guidelines and you know properly interface with the device and you shouldn't go out of your way to break them like this all just seems like such
obvious stuff I wish it didn't take what is this from 2015 yeah I wish it didn't take 8 years to deal out sort of piddly fines it just seems like there should be faster might they might have had to figure it out this is kind of a weird thing to figure out I guess so I just I I wish the wheels of Justice moved a little faster sometimes yeah obviously you don't want to you know wrongfully y you know  but just see you know this train thing is probably going to take years to resolve when it just kind of seems
like don't do that you know stop um would be would be good yeah uh someone had an interesting point um that I that I want to kind of follow up about I don't remember her name the AI person uh I can't even find it in the dock but that that AI created influencer chick someone had an interesting point um at least in the US I think you can't copyright AI created works so anyone can be her yeah and then I guess what would they have to have like a like a fan account you know
disclaimer on their thing like would you even I don't I guess not yeah so like you could just AI create images of her doing things that are very bad for Brands and then just post them I guess you could but then it seems very how would you get any very attackable position oh I guess yeah well okay yeah I see what you mean so you wouldn't really be able to be a huge AI influencer but you could have a an army of AI micro influencers pretty easily yeah that makes sense because it's a very assailable
position anyways moving forward um twitch bands pretending to be naked I don't know how they're going to enforce this because it seems like what they were trying to do with that whole sort of thing recently with the the artistic nudity thing was they were trying to make the rules s more more clear and more open so that they wouldn't have to deal with this constant sort of argument about twitch's rules and the interpretation and the uneven um enforcement of them and now they've gone
and they've given thems a rule that seems like it's going to be very difficult to enforce evenly uh twitch is updating its content guidelines to ban implied new following a surge in nearly naked streamers covering their various parts in Black sensor bars and streamers using strategically placed objects and careful camera angles to give the impression that they are nude according to twitch's post about the update while some streamers were correctly labeling their content as containing sexual themes
which would prevent them from showing up on the homepage others were not actually talked to Ivon about this um a couple times after that stream I had meant to kind of come back with a bit of a more nuanced take on the whole thing because I think that during that W show I basically was like well I mean realistically this is kind of what twitch is anyway at this point you might as well get used to it it's been this way a long time and you know realistically those minors that you're
so concerned about are like six keystrokes away from seeing this stuff anyway but then I said on the show that this was as a not a non-user of the platform I don't really use the platform and so I went out of my way over the next couple of days to fire up twitch first because I was just talking to Ivon about what we were talking about on W show and I was like oh yeah there's this whole thing on Twitch and I brought up twitch to show her to talk to her about it and immediately there was like
breasts in my face and I didn't realize how bad it was yeah if I just wanted to use this sight to see what I'm here trying to see even if even if I am you know super open-minded about you know pornography or whatever else and even if I was a pornography Enthusiast maybe that's not what I'm on this site for right now and maybe I would actually just like to watch someone play video games or something else anything else and so over the span of the next couple days I was like okay
let's play a game called I'm going to open the Twitch app having never clicked on one of these streamers before in my life although I was logged into the work account so strictly speaking I don't know if nobody's ever used it for that I don't think many people have the work Twitch account I don't think so I think it's basically me yeah I don't think it's many it's not just you but I it's many oh Dan apparently and me and I see probably AJ and probably Aon well yeah but they would like Von
would never use it um and definitely not for that as far as I know I mean I'm saying it wouldn't be cool but oh  is I decided to play a little game called I'm going to open the Twitch app and see how long it takes how many Scrolls it takes for there to be boobs in my face and it was basically instantly every single time yeah and and I I even was like like look at how bad this was and without even looking I scrolled it in front of her I was like okay how many boobs were there and there was like five
and to be clear he doesn't mean like he means a a a a very noted focus on that yeah yeah I don't mean that there happened to be you know mamories I mean like that was obviously the point cuz this was at the height of the whole uh you know cutting off the frame right here and the implied nudity thing that was going on right in the wake of the artistic nudity uh rule change mhm anyway um Elijah said the first time I showed my wife twitch she thought it was a cam site technically
correct yeah so cleavage is still allowed however underbob is explicitly forbidden so to everyone watching on Twitch Where's the Line Where's the Line like on a guy I don't know yeah is it it just female presenting nipple where's the underbob that too I mean that's a tumbller thing right this underbob do you even have any I don't know do I have nipples we'll never know look there you'll never  right yeah Elder Scrolls 2 Daggerfall revived in unity so sick I want to play this I
want to play the Warcraft 2 campaign huh someone redid Warcraft 2 and Warcraft 3 reforged oh yeah I want to play the Warcraft 2 campaign apparently it's only half of it now maybe if they get some more maybe if they get some more support for it sorry this is not the topic um that sounds great though that's a really good idea for a project in that game here A Game Spot um Warcraft Chronicles of the second War okay how much traction does this have cuz hopefully it's a lot lore craft designs yeah they got
"166,000 views 18 hours ago Warcraft 2" tides of Darkness ah yes Ah that's really cool so cool I can't wait to play this they say look it's a little janky we're going to have to patch some stuff Warcraft 3 reforged is a dumpster fire but um man ah so it's remade and like you know that looks sick theoretically more modern but hey Warcraft 3 reforged was a dumpster fire so you know it looks as good as it's going to look but I can't wait to play this I've never played the Warcraft 2 campaign what yeah this is
like perfect Warcraft 2 is where it gets playable Warcraft 1 trying to go back and play it as a Warcraft like you can only select like four units at a time it's like it and the two would have been I'm sure Warcraft 1 was fantastic when it first came out the two factions are completely equivalent almost I think necros and clerics have slightly different spells but you I don't know unless you could do like 500 actions per minute you're not microing that stuff like it's impos the interface is
terrible um so so uh the maps have are like very limited resources like even playing against the AI as a teenager like I would have difficulty breaking one AI is hilarious because you just have you you've played one but not two I played one with you oh that's right yeah why did we do that the first Warcraft game I ever played was Warcraft 3 and I loved it oh Warcraft 3 is amazing I loved Warcraft 3 I love Frozen Throne I put an insane amount of time into custom games I kept somehow losing the like CD
keys so I probably bought like three or four copies of that freaking game I bought like three but every single one of them was worth it to be completely honest cuz I put a ton of time into Warcraft 3 and specifically Warcraft 3 custom games I played an insane amount of winter Mall Wars that's why I'm so excited about that new mode that you found for faf um survival survival mode yeah I I think once we kind of get it it's going to be really fun cuz it reminds me a lot of some Old Tower
Defense games and stuff like that which I always love I love Tower Defense games very  yeah oh hey uh if we're going to report on whenever he's a complete then I guess we should also report when he is not a complete um Logan Paul is apparently finally offering refunds for that crypto Zoo thing I don't trust it that's fair like that anchor man meme where he leans back and goes I don't believe you or whatever it is yeah all right well we'll see show me when it's done okay and then I will I will happily
give prop that's fair that's fair because I completely agree if we're gonna you know we're going to throw people under buses we should also give them props when they do good stuff absolutely but I just I just don't believe it until it's done that's all oh apparently there's a catch oh no oh you agree to not Sue and stuff oh no coffeezilla is apparently already on this get him  right yeah yep okay yep cool yep got a sign an Indemnity thing to all right well all right Behold The
Claw yesterday MSI teased an upcoming gaming handheld and today images and benchmarks leaked onto social media indicating that the new device apparently called The Claw will use Intel's core Ultra 7 155h and eight Arc Alchemist XC cores for graphics unlike the legion go and RG Ally which use AMD according to benchmarks posted on geekbench the device will have 32 GB of RAM here is a leaked image of the MSI claw courtesy of at wxad whatever that is that looks like an ally sure does uh leaked geekbench
information okay I'm a little surprised to see them use Intel but I also don't have any familiarity really with the core Ultra 755h and I don't really know exactly what these Arc Alchemist XC cores are going to perform like but if it's anything shy of you know steam deck I think they're going to have an uphill battle ahead of them but I'm I'm excited to check it out I'm I I love I love my Ally I ended up sticking with the Ally I love the screen on the steam deck OLED but
um nothing I'm playing right now will benefit from that screen as much as I need the extra performance so right now it's all about performance I'm playing a platformer that I'm just realistically not going to say cuz I don't feel like it did I say platformer it's more of an open world Fantasy game yeah um and I just don't feel like having a conversation about it but it definitely requires performance and so I uh I'm sticking with the Ally for the time being that makes sense why not a PSP I'm
gonna I'm G to have some time this weekend hope try Final Fantasy again but I'm I don't think I'm getting that thing yet oh we made him a new computer yeah uh we have to make sure it works before we give it to him so that's a whole thing I thought it was I thought you were just going to give it to me not knowing to be completely honest I was fine with that no that's content oh okay yeah if it doesn't work then that's content so that's good got it um but yeah I still have I still have my
computer with the AMD card laying on top of it um which I'm also fine with um but it's very unstable in this one part of Final Fantasy but uh I have some time this Sunday so I'm going to check if there's a new driver update and if there is I'm going to give it another shot cuz I want to keep progressing not one person knows what game I'm talking about good yeah that's fine I'm just I'm amazed at all the terrible guesses why would I got it immediately why wouldn't I tell you guys if I was playing balers
gate three like yeah greatest greatest game I what what would you say the best game in the last decade is because that's been the new conversation is is balers Gate 3 the best game in the last decade um you're not going to like this but uh I I think breath of the wild of the wild and I think it's a strong argument it's an absolute Masterpiece yeah um I think it's a very strong argument there's other people in chat even saying breath of the wild wow no it's not in the last 10 years come on 
that Legend Zelda Tok tars of the Kingdom oh the TS of the kingdom was H got to go if you're comparing the two on their release I think you've got to go breath of the wild yeah breath of the wild was a moment in gaming man and this was on a console that hadn't sold a ton of units yet right like that's another thing to consider is tears yeah tears of the Kingdom released to an install base ah that was an order of magnitude a lot of people bought switches for breath of the wild like 100% um and yeah that's
fair tears of the kingdom is breath of the wild but better but greatness is not the same as goodness and breath of the wild was great yeah um yeah breath of the wild if you yeah for sure I haven't played Last of Us Part One um got some people talking about that genin impact I want to play genin impact but I mean genin impact from my understanding of it is kind of yeah breath of the wild but gcha and newer yeah um I gave it a good old solid shot cuz a member of our team an
esteemed member of our team suggested it quite highly and I tried it and it wasn't really for me Titanfall 2 I can see why people really like it though Titanfall 2 had a great story really enjoyed the gameplay but I don't think there was anything that said greatness to me like you have to have Innovation too I feel and I think this might be a negative reflection on where Shooters are right now more than it is a praise for Titanfall 2 I think if you narrow it down to Shooters I think Titanfall 2 was
the best shooter in the last decade but I like I just single player maybe but single player definitely I mean you you when you talk greatness though greatness has a connotation of scale did you play Titanfall 2 multiplayer no yeah but scale small I'm sorry but if you want to talk greatness I honestly think you have to have conversations about fortnite over Titanfall 2o I'm sorry like fortnite has done yeah sure for a different generation than you that might you might not be into but they have innovated in a
way that is changing the industry For Better or For Worse did they things like I I don't think anyone has done an in-game event the way that fortnite actually care I genuinely don't know are you kidding me M&amp;M's one recently I didn't even know he had one huge okay huge Mr Marshall mats still brings the crowds I'm not surprised so you know you gota you just have to kind of Minecraft isn't the last 10 years yeah you could make that argument if it was in the last 10 years yeah but no yeah Minecraft changed
way yeah anyways that conversation is literally cropping up around that game which I think is fantastic oh hey uh we have Mr Chu just posted flips and did you see the video of the kid who finally beat Tetris yes I was riveted I couldn't look away from it I can't I can't believe that that is human capability like I I can't even fathom watching this kid play oh it's crazy do you know about the whole rolling thing and everything yeah fantastic what fantastic what so cool and and and how he he missed the
one break point the tension lost the tension in that Gap like what yeah couldn't believe it very good the fact that someone else was racing against him at the same time and I think either lost their run or paused or something and then switched over to watch him win and was like congratulatory and very cool about it was also just like a fantastic reflection on that Community um yeah very very cool very very cool yeah so when we say beat Tetris for those of you who are not familiar it doesn't end yeah
but eventually the game crashes it can theoretically get to level 255 but then it just Loops back to level zero Z or one or whatever but it will crash before it gets there I think is the issue I I think it gets to a point where you I I don't I don't know ful people saying it runs out of memory runs out of memory yeah some some problem happens or or the amount of things that can cause it to crash apparently some news anchor like crapped on him that's stupid yeah yeah what do you not have basally told them
to go outside and touch grass I mean it's not a terrible idea but the kid didn't look like super unhealthy or sickly or anything he probably does touch gr I would also so I actually agree would also throw it there that in my opinion he just set himself up for a career as a sucessful famous streamer yeah and he streamed the whole thing if I remember correctly he was on Twitch um but was removed because of age restriction reasons so I think he was streaming on YouTube or something but
like tons of people know his name now he could play other games this skill is going to transfer to otheres imagine for a second if he took that and was like you know what I'm going to resurrect Guitar Hero let's make Guitar Hero cool again guarantee you he'd kill it he'd kill it created a career for himself at 13 and you're gonna tell him to go outside and touch grass come on yeah H H like how much do you make as a mid-tier news anchor or whatever like I think this kid's going to do all right might
outscale you before he's like 15 like maybe what were you doing at 15 maybe hold your horses a little bit I don't know just like y'all need to look up clone hero right now okay I do  this is the same way as people beat Pac-Man yeah Riley and I had this debate earlier to uh was that today that today yesterday uh we had this debate yesterday um I I think a community can determine a beat point for a game if there isn't a clearly distinguished one or okay well this one they did have a
beat point but it had only ever been reached by an AI player it hadn't been reached by a human one and that was the crash apparently there's like a percentage chance of crashing at stages yeah here's where the confusing part gets though because he had planned to beat it at like level 154 or something and ended up beating it at level 157 so the argument is like could someone beat  level I mean watching do that I doubt it but sure really care as personally Riley didn't agree but personally I don't
really care as long as the community decides on a point if that makes sense yeah but you can decide and then someone will break past it anyway because that's how people are and then what was the point of deciding it anyway I don't know yeah I mean I just I know there's enough speedrunning communities and there's enough of these types of communities where they kind of have to come up with something right because it doesn't make a lot of sense and I'm personally okay with them doing that
because an organic game Crash an organic kill screen I think that's valid no one can the first to get that again and I've heard that now the the competition moving forward is going to be like getting a higher score before you hit that crash whether that's through getting more like tetrises which is where you clear four lines at once I think um not really I was actually decently into Tetris for a while there but not anymore um or just yeah other various ways of making try to try to
manipulate your score to be higher before you hit that crash point and I guess that could maybe be by getting to a higher level I don't know anyway incredibly cool either way and that news anchor lady is a jerk apparently like in the same breath pretty much she congratulated a 16-year-old darts player cool cuz that's so much more outside and athletic than Tetris Honestly  though I mean come on please the finger rolling thing is so sick it's so cool I love that too that like they tend to
wear gloves I think because the the fingers like slide better by by wearing like like it looks like cotton gloves I don't know so interesting absolutely wild uh oh I think it's time for Wow  dark   I was going to check and see if he's streaming on Twitch but then I realized he's 13 he's probably not allowed on  campsite a blue scooty SC which is like actually a sick name I actually it's it fits like you know he's 13 he's playing games what your name I don't know I have a color I like a lot
and scooty sounds cool yeah blue scooty let's go I like the name all right it's got to be hard to come up with names apparently he was banned from twitch for being too young yeah I said fair enough I mean he doesn't even have fully developed breasts yet what would he do on that site oh my God yeah dude like trashing on this kid his most recent video that the first time anybody somebody has ever beat Tetris two million views come on all right uh Dan hit me sure after getting into
computers through your videos I'm graduating this year and starting my dream job in CPU design W that's super cool do you have any optimistic messages going into 2024 for my Doomer generation I don't um there's no hope it's one of those things where I feel like I'm in a really awkward position where I I am a participant in you know the whole Millennial you know being crapped on thing that happened like I I I did join the workforce at a time that was not great the worst
basically sorry the worst B the worst a little bit better than me pretty much um I'm still terrible like I I I joined the workforce right as the 2008 financial crisis was happening and you joined right as it had happened yeah both of which were really both terrible terrible times um I I I I watched as property values went up faster than I could earn money to put a down payment on something fortunately I was I was lucky enough to find a teammate really early in my life that put us both I I
can't stress enough finding the right person to partner with for your life is the most important decision you will ever make Bar None because it has a waterfall effect on absolutely everyone else I was both Lucky and I'll give myself a little bit of credit for being a good job interviewer I guess but you know Yvonne and I found each other and put ourselves way ahead of our peers uh just by by teaming up very early on um which is what allowed us to get into the housing market it's what allowed us to
fund lus media groupy good time well it didn't feel like a good time totally the value of that house had gone up double in like four or five years or something absolutely like it was but looking back at it now it's great it's like hilariously low yeah like but psychologically at the time watching the the trend line it was it was terrifying because it seemed like it could burst in any second so I understand and I I not just sympathize with I have felt a lot of what people feel but as someone who got
out um and you know now run a successful business or now hire someone to run a successful business uh like I feel like I I'm in this position where I can't really talk about it anymore I don't really know what to say because I don't have Solutions I am doing fine um but I get it so it's like yeah it's crap um yeah I I'm pretty sure a lot of people probably would have told you you were nuts when you got that place yeah but then yeah again looking back at it now it's like it's a bargain yeah but
like it's like less than an apartment yeah like over half a million dollars on just like like the place to live like are you kidding me like our I forget what our mortgage payments were but they were a lot like if we weren't doubling up our incomes there's there was no way yeah impossible yeah well I mean maybe her income not mine though but yeah it's I I don't know and it's it's crazy to think that it was so crazy back then and how bad it was back then is like a joke compared to how bad
it is now yeah and we got lucky in a lot of ways man like when we when we bought the units that we occupy here that the one not the one I'm sitting in but the one that I would be sitting in if I was on the other side of that wall uh they cost us "$330,000 each" Canadian um let me just see if I can ryar for sale Siri commercial let's see if let's see if there's any for sale  now uh oh no well so yeah Elijah is saying like out what what would that be uh abbottford I would in like abbottsford area 
it lots of people are talking yeah I can't find any right now but they've they've basically like quintupled or or something like that I I I don't know 780 ft apartment not close to here like decently far out 400 Grand anyway my point with these is that we got really lucky with the ones that we got at the in the first place but then experienced a lot of the same frustration as we wanted to expand yeah and found that the prices were going up so fast that as we needed more space it was becoming
unaffordable as fast as as we could make more money for fortunately we have run a very successful business and things have gone well and we've managed to you know find the space that we need but but you can't be just like a solid business anymore even no not enough very take outside money which we we're lucky enough to never have to do yeah like it's it's brutal yeah South surria detached house starts at $1.5 million Canadian so you know 1.15 1.2 real dollars but still it's I don't yeah we say okay so
here's here's another one of the problems too though is in saying real dollars I think that somewhat diminishes the fact that people here make less yeah so like that's that's something I don't complicated because people here have access to socialized services that other people have to pay for like when you actually break down everything it sort of depends it's not as black and white and regionally it's very very different yeah and also in certain career paths it's very common
for those jobs to cover that for you depending depending it so it it's all it is never if you think it's as black and white as socialized healthc care bad or you know this job good or whatever benefits package downsides and upsides to it is always Shades of Gray if you think you know for sure you're wrong it's that simple I'm sorry and I know  wrong only Sith deals in absolute yeah exactly uh yeah Elijah is saying minimum wage still 15 bucks yeah that's also just like what what are you supposed to
do with that you're a Sith now what's going on he's Obi-Wan canobi you know you can C of pull it off with the beard Clone Wars era Obi-Wan it's not bad it's actually pretty good anyway sorry I have no good news and it looks like it's going to get worse yeah it's only getting worse like with interest rates being like they are I I thought like housing prices would at least go down yep not happening like what the  still so you're just going to have these like gigantic corporate overlords that
own every place to live and then you'll  be at their Merc there's record levels of Canadians leaving the country because they can't afford to live here yeah which is like and then then that that microcosms down to uh there's also tons of people leaving the province we're in for other provinces inside of Canada so this is like a multi-step Al has stopped running ads to encourage Canadians to move there cuz they're like oh is lot of  yeah please don't eat me before before he would have even heard you say that
Elijah was like can we start a smaller LTT in Alberta cuz everyone in Canada is like oh boy got to go there it's the only place I can afford to live yeah well that's going to change oh man well the maritimes was good until Co and then apparently a bunch of people like moved out of the city and started just work from home there and like prices up drove   just ah yeah let's start our own City Elijah we've talked about it stop we're not cult c c cult you do great you could
do it you do Supreme Teran can run the business you can run the cult I'd make way more money than him Cults seem to be very profit we don't need money we have lus yeah Company Store do the whole shebang yeah yeah imagine all of the money that the company makes never actually leaving  yeah you know yeah I live in Prince George make decent money but will never own due to rent and housing prices yep yeah I think that's true for most basically an entire generation of people yeah which I don't know how
the heck you could do it like even okay unless you have parent money or something this is going to get me canceled by someone but like speaking of parent money even being in a position where my kids could afford to stay in the Lower Mainland because I can just facilitate that yeah is that the life I want for them yeah all their peers are going to leave yeah none of their high school friendships will remain or they'll just be peers with people who are also kids of people who can do that
and which is also Highly Questionable yeah like as a parent of rich kids I um still don't want my kids hanging out with other Rich Kids yeah um I I want my kids spending the vast majority of their time with downto Earth people who don't take things for granted and stuff we've actually been talking about doing a um doing uh an experiment not an experiment because it's not really an experiment when you just do it but Ivon and I have been talking about moving out of our house for a year um Furnishing and
accessorizing a place based on two sort of medish incomes and living like that for a year because I feel like um are you doing vehicles too well it have to be yeah yeah like I feel like you can talk about it all day but I don't think that my kids can possibly fully understand that most people don't have a sports car and a theer and all this stuff that they for them is just life for me is sweat Blood and Tears yeah and for them is just it appears it appears I mean and I
I'm guilty of it sometimes for Christmas um you should you should come into my building we can have pipe first days together it would be great for Christmas Santa got the family  as much for me as it is for them which is how they end up with a lot of the stuff they have but most people don't "have a $1,200 3D printing"  uh yeah I don't know man I I I I feel like I feel like there's a lot that they could learn and I don't think I don't think a month is  think I paid so much for that pool that
I am loathed to give up a summer with the pool but I think if we did an entire school year like there's already a lot of things that we do pretty well like my kids don't go to the cafeteria at school they always take a lunch feel hit without the summer without the summer you think so because the summer is going to be the most concentrated point in time where they hang out at home and do home things well remember there at least in my experience when I was growing up style changes we're going to
have to make regardless of home like they are not going to be able to be in as many programs as they are like they just they they they do you know martial arts and dance and and choir and band and like like all some of it you know run through the school or whatever but some of it cost money and um they they're going to have to make they're going to have to make choices house swap give them my apartment I don't think I don't think he wants to be living in his house for a year um funny
funny idea though um um yeah I don't I would yeah cuz like I'm thinking back when I grew up we did a lot of things but one that was kind of I'm sure if my brother and I like really desperately wanted to my parents would have tried to find a way cuz they were like that um but ice hockey was kind of not really in the cards cuz it was so expensive ice hockey especially at a competitive level was extremely expensive cuz a lot of those teams were like flying around and stuff to play
games yeah um and the gear is wicked expensive and you're growing out of it all the time so you'd have to buy new gear all the time but something like ball hockey for example like we were going to do ball hockey pretty much no matter what um you just needed sticks and we never had the cool sticks we  um but like we could do it we we could play football we played football all the time my my parents had me in a lot of programs is what I'm kind of trying to argue to a certain degree I don't know
man don't sacrifice your children's development this is a different kind of development he's trying to get them more I don't think that's you're taking this the wrong way I don't know man we um it's it's it's something we've talked about I mean I do think there's ways that concept you can keep kids more grounded regardless we have a lot of rules um we they they lead pretty structured lives and stuff like they don't just get to do whatever they want yeah and so even though it's
it's a funny thing even though we have a lot of different stuff that they're allowed to do the really good stuff they they have to sort of they have to pay for it in doing you know practice this or chore that or whatever else um like I probably played more video games than my kids do at uh at my son's age because he's just like yeah it's there but he's not allowed so he's like a really good kid it's kind of shocking I don't get it but uh yeah I don't know I uh all in all terrible idea why I don't really get
that I don't think taking away the extra crcular is a good idea yeah I Hazard that one a little bit too but I don't understand why any of the rest of it would be a bad idea Elijah seems like a funny Rich issue this is a joke we are spoiled so I will buy another house to teach them how to be humble I did think that was pretty fun obviously wouldn't buy it just throwing that out there like obviously um you'd set up a lease holding company which would own the house in trust so  
wouldn't um yeah see this is another one jph 290 says I know this is not exactly perfect but you can have the kids see what poor is really like in another country that that to me actually had exactly the same problem as as that other thing is like what we're going to learn what it's like to be poor by being rich enough to Jet Set around the world and witness poor people in their natural habitat like I that seems so much worse but I I don't know I mean I I'll tell you this Ivonne did a uh did like
an outreach program thing when she was a kid and did you know like they built something while they were there in the community and for her that was extremely impactful but then IV like me also grew up in a house that had to budget every month so was it that or was she just already grounded and that you know was the final hit on the nail and then it was you know cemented as part of her personality or whatever I I don't know I don't know I've I've just I've read some really interesting no guys
stop okay we got to stop this is important we got to stop there's a comment so in a housing crisis you're going to collect yet another house in your housing quiver no no no stop stop i' make sure someone's living in ours and no I wouldn't be buying it he's not buying it he literally said he's not buying it okay stop oh man I love this I like hamburgers you hate hot dogs then no I didn't if I didn't say something then I didn't say it can we can we agree on that maybe um sorry what was I what was I saying
before right yeah um something that I've read about a fair bit is how the like the the the number of generations um oh that wealth last that wealth last and it's like three and then it's gone like every single time because it it's there's all kinds of problems with it but not not technically every single time not it is very common but it is extremely common um there are there are particular families that have found a way to make it go for like literal ever um but that's part of that might
just be the incredible wealth of those families because you can squander a small fortune very easily but with a big enough Fortune you can squander really hard and it just is a perpetual motion machine yeah I only learned recently about why people um hate billionaire philanthropy so much spec not the like the image cleansing aspects of it but the fact that I think it's in the US they only have to SP put I think 5% of the money into what they actually say they're doing so if their Returns on the
money they put in are greater than 5% they actually make money overall and it's a tax and it's taxfree so you just get yeah it's a whole it's a whole thing I I just I just learned about this recently I don't actually know much about uh tax Havens and loopholes and all that kind of stuff I pay my taxes um oh boy but uh anyway the the whole thing about about wealth not lasting multiple Generations is because the attitude and mindset that makes you start a business and take risks and build it is not
passed down by living in opulence as a child and so the kids might have witnessed a little bit of it but the grandkids are completely detached from any of the hustle that ultimately led to that success and they just blow it or something so yeah why do you hate housing Linus I know right yeah Balmer is about to make a billion a year in dividends he could squander a billion a year and still be richer yeah exactly I don't think that's the only one I think some families have very strongly baked in preserve the
wealth stuff sure and there's but I think that's very abnormal there's communities and cultures that also have very different attitudes about money um than others yeah yeah tough man I uh anyway the point is just I want my kids to be good people I want them to be your kids are pretty cool real people I want them to stay that way I agree I just like it's um I think that there's a lot of time I'm not I didn't say that to dissuade you from any further effort just there's a lot of
Developmental years left for things to go really really wrong oh yeah and so you're entering some of the worst ones this is this is a super first world problem and I 100% understand that but I will do anything to keep my kids from being douchebags yeah that's like the worst as two people that grew up not wealthy at all yeah uh more on the poorter side I it's obnoxious I didn't like the rich kids me too like at all me too no offense yeah um but me too like they just kind of sucked no
offense exceptions um absolutely like I know Ivon talked about one of the people she worked with that one of the pharmers she worked at I'm not going to identify anyone but they grew up like Jet Set lifestyle and didn't want any money from Mom and Dad not because they had a bad relationship everything was great but didn't want anything wanted to hustle like like 100% grind set and just super down to earth and I'm like yeah but like you can't point at an exception like that and go okay well then it'll
everything will be fine right like even if the odds were 33% then two out of our three kids are going to be so we got to we got to figure this out man yeah like I I've I've definitely met some exceptions too but a lot of the times it's just like excessive outof touchness um so like even if there's no intention there yeah it's like oh you need a replacement part for that game why don't you just re your a new one yeah exactly I I've told you this a story a billion times but uh there was a
person uh when I was in a certain class at a certain school there was a person who dropped they were holding their laptop like this yeah and they dropped it and it smacked into the ground and they just laughed and my brain just shattered cuz I couldn't understand at all you'd protect that thing with your life yeah yeah and if I dropped it which like okay sure I used to render LTT videos yeah holding my laptop open so it would cool better walking between classes like it was sketchy but if I
ever dropped it I would be like broken um not laughing about it like it's just it's there's some there's some like context aware things where your automatic reaction in certain scenarios if you've never had any exposure to like life being difficult is going to be not really okay to the people potentially around you my kids don't value money yeah at all that's not good it means basically like I remember get jobs I mean I mean yeah of course and then what happens so okay but they
haven't needed one totally like what would a kid get a job for well what did what did you spend your money on I mean I bought just like dumb stuff I bought candy I like saved and I would buy really early on bought Big Ticket things um like I I would buy I bought a GPU upgrade for our family computer the biggest purchase I don't think I've ever talked about this the biggest purchase I think I made with like allowance money like as a kid was I paid for the C internet drop from the street I remember
you told me about this oh I have told you about this okay um my parents agreed they would pay the monthly bill if I paid the installation and that was it was hundreds of dollars it was I didn't have money but I had all my $5 a week allowances and birthday money and all that stuff and I was like I want always on internet let's go um but like my kids have always on internet they have a switch they have a gaming P what what on Earth would they buy yeah I don't know like I have all the cool toys cuz I just
like most the games make videos about setting up toys and I like they have cool toys this is all the stuff that I wanted when I was a kid right yeah so then they just like already have it yeah I don't know dude I don't know most most of mine was saving up for computers or computer parts or games or when I was very young it was candy um yeah Elijah my my son does value money to a degree not like I did when I was his age though like I wanted it you know whereas I think to him kind like eh my brother and
I wanted money so bad we didn't really have a traditional allowance but sometimes my Mom would set up certain chores that we could do for money that were kind of like extra um and I remember for the sness my brother and I were on like uh you you mentioned this term earlier we were on a grind set for that SNES I think my mom was just like making up chores at a certain point um like going and like digging up rocks in the backyard and like sorting them so that it was less Rocky ground stuff like
that um but eventually we got enough money to buy a SNES but my mom also hooked it up there because this was a I don't think Craigslist was like a thing I don't know how she found it but she found like some dude we bought a SNES off in a parking lot um and I remember like sitting in the car with my brother while my mom goes out and does this deal for a SNES in a parking lot recognizing  sketch but she got it to us cuz it was way cheaper than Luke stoen Goods left friend year right here baby yeah I don't
know um but it was yeah it was like it was when the N64 was already out so it was a last gen console um but I think that was honestly I don't know if it was cuz we weren't as wealthy or if that was because that was less of a big deal back then I don't know because I still thought sness was like super cool when N64 was around I thought it was just a different style of games like N64 was more attempting to do 3D stuff and SNES was more like perfecting 2D stuff think either of us had as much access to
advertising at the time though ah that might be it yeah like I didn't see a lot of ads cuz we didn't have cable so yeah Fair yeah yeah I was kind of the same way like yeah I was like oh he just has this toy yeah like that friend has that one and that friend has that other one and I didn't really see them as like better necessarily I got really stoked when I figured out one of my friends had an original Ness because I was like whoa cool I haven't played any of these games before like I didn't
really see it as like this one is newer therefore better yeah man this has definitely created some uh man this has definitely created some debate in the chat I don't remember the last time I saw chat this active people are everywhere from like this is a great conversation to you know this is the most entitled horse that I've ever seen in my life or whatever just let them be kids they can learn that later they can't learn that later though like that's the thing it's so fortive later kind of is now
yeah anyway uh was that one merch message yes good gravy how you doing Dan yeah I'm good okay I want to hit me again sure let me find the thing uh hey D question for Luke I'm a recent software Dev grad but I feel as though I'm not skilled enough for entry-level jobs in your experience are graduates given some slack to learn on the job one impostor syndrome is a hell of a thing in the software development industry in dustry oh my uh industry largely because a lot of people are you
know learning constantly or Googling things or stack overflowing or gping uh things constantly um and I think there's some insecurity around that despite that being a thing that everyone does um so don't beat yourself up too much uh there is absolutely or there should be absolutely opportunities to learn and grow on the job for a junior uh because there should be opportunities to learn and grow on the job for everyone in the stack uh including seniors uh that being said if you're being actively paid
you're going to be expected to produce something of value um so it's not like you're just going back into school but this time School pays you um you actually have to make things that bring the company value um you're just going to have as a junior you should have more time and opportunity to work through those problems uh than other people may have and you should hopefully have access to it depends on where you end up working you might be the only developer there um but you you
you may depending on where you go have access to seniors that you can um you know bounce questions off of but you should try to solve it yourself first you should take the opportunity to try to do that and then if you get hard stuck then you can bring it to them and see how you can move forward um but but yeah I think that would be my answer don't shy away from applying uh places are probably going to going to send you tests and things like that and do the tests and if you don't get call backs
after the tests don't worry about it just move on to the next one and keep going uh you need to get in somewhere you need to start getting some experience on your resume and you need to start getting some experience just as a developer as a person so just send it um don't take it too personally don't get too imposter syndrome me uh before you end up getting a job um uh work on your portfolio if you can keep training keep moving forward we're all going to  hello w. dll longtime viewer firsttime
Shopper lineus I've noticed their increase on camera time have your Littles expressed personal interest in content creation how do you respond um they love being in videos but I think they specifically like being in videos with me like I think they like doing what I do they're kids right they um I I I'm just grateful they still think I'm cool as cool as I can be uh they actually were in shooting a video with me today that um I think is going to be just a blast we build Luka computer but with a
Twist I don't know how much I want to say about let's not say too much let's let the people experience it um it's a really really fun video I'm very excited for you guys to watch it and I am also very excited to watch it yeah yeah it's going to be great that's all I'll say so um as for just making videos on their own no I don't think they have a ton of interest in it and I I'm not sure if I would even encourage it really I want them to I want them the more I think about it the more I want
them to find their own path um I'm not as they get older I'm also not going to shy away from showing them as much as I have in the past like if they want to participate I think that's pretty cool we'll pay them for their work uh that's something that I've talked about a lot in the past is um content creators who seem to think that their children are their property and they can just exploit their labor and just take all the money never been a fan of that doesn't really make a ton of sense to me but I also
think that um but I'm also not going to go completely the other way and just go yeah my you know my kids should never be  um I I doubt it's going to have a significant impact on their later life if they build a computer or two like we have a very different kind of Channel than some of the channels that do Bas around your kids yeah do feature their children a lot you know experiencing Milestones or doing embarrassing things or whatever else like my kids like they're building a computer like what
who cares like it just um I I I doubt there will be a ton of negative impact on on their later life from being in a video with dad on his YouTube channel at some point when they were a kid it just seems kind of far-fetched um and  they're they're having a lot of fun with it and it's it's fun to do things with them yeah it's been okay cuz like blocking them out completely I think would be weird but having them on all the time would be weird they show up every once in a bit I
think that's cool I think it's it's on people to kind of find the balance that works for them like um it also depends how much they want like what's inside you know talking to the dad um and and actually and and Lincoln as well like they for them that was a thing they did together and they bonded over and like it's super memorable and stuff right like that's um like yeah did the family you know does the child actually want to do this too yeah that's huge cuz if so then you know sure run with it but if
they just hate it all the time then like what are you really doing yeah I'm not  yeah hello LT so I've got the LT steam deck and it has sticky buttons so valve RMA have you experienced sticky buttons or heard of it um I haven't heard of it specifically around the steam deck but uh something that I did want to talk about the reason I curated this one is that even mature devices can still have a lot of differences from one unit to the next and one of the things that can cause uh a plastic part to fail um can
be worn out molds and I was just I was just wondering and I'm now I'm going to wonder aloud exactly how many steam decks valve has sold because I can tell you right now it's probably enough that valve has had to remake the plastic molds for the steam deck possibly multiple times which is a tens of thousands of dollars process if they want to do it on Shore uh with a with a high degree of quality um to make like a really long lasting mold that was it as the molds wear out you can run into tolerance issues
exactly like this so I do Wonder maybe if you know they had a worn out mold and it didn't get replaced in a timely manner or you know whatever else I wonder what the differences are between the first steam deck and the last steam deck theoretically you know they they are the same but as it gets plastic flowed through it more more and more and more times they they do change a little bit I don't know a ton about the exact materials processes that are taking place there but it's something that I
did have to learn about with the screwdriver because we had to make a decision actually it might not been the screwdriver might have been something else but at some point we were making a decision between um different molding materials and whether we wanted to go with the more expensive one that would last much longer or the cheaper one that would last a shorter period of time and it comes down to how many you think you're going to sell because that cheaper material is great as long as
"you're only going to sell 10 or 20,000" of them but if you're going to do hundreds of thousands then you want to really invest in a super high quality mold which costs a lot more because it's made out of harder materials that are not going to wear out as quickly that was it I just thought that was cool I wanted to talk about that from what I can find the 3 million unit number that people are throwing around for the steam deck is a estimation I don't think valve has announced it
yeah there was a research research firm omia they reported that the steam deck sold 1.62 million units in 2022 not sure why they think they know that or not I haven't looked into the report at all uh and then their report estimated that the steam deck would past 3 million units sold um sometime during 2023 but that that's a complete estimate and that's not valve saying the 1.62 million that's a resarch fir they it from it might be very good information it not I suspect
it's a lot more than that at that price I feel like it is too but that kind of reach no idea there's just we just don't know I the just the number of them I see around like I that is your yeah like what about like on the ferry or whatever you see them on the fair yeah i' see I see Steam decks in the wild man so it's I don't know man I uh I suspect there's a lot of steam decks out there I'm always pretty surprised at how many people have them I also think it's kind of interesting that when I say
I don't have them how surprised people are cuz they're like what I do like that's very often the response that I get um so yeah they're they're they're they be out there um yeah key pass and syn thing was the best decision I made what do you think about not being able to able Google prompts I store tofa secrets in it because it's the most secure thing I have I hate that not being able to disable Google prompts like it asking you to store passwords no no Google prompts that's
when you go to sign into something and it's like I just sent a notification to your phone just click okay or press a number or whatever I'd like to be able to choose um that's the only thing I hate about it overall it seems reasonably secure is as secure as anything else I think it's actually  I I do agree though I would like to be able to especially because it's yet  yep can you talk a little bit about what is required to get one of the fair phones to work on a Canadian Network I
want one but see that it doesn't come with Canadian bands when uh when stock um I didn't really have a ton of issues using it I didn't set up anything special I just used it um it's possible that my particular carrier uh uses bands that the fairphone just supports or that my area has good coverage of the particular bands that the fairphone does support your mileage may vary but it was that was not my issue with it by the way I managed to get I started carrying my iPhone in my
other pocket well I was I I've switched off the fairphone now I'm back to the note um I wanted to use the OnePlus open but apparently Belle took it for CE he says for CES so he can you know do more planning like okay um anyway so I'll wait I'll get it from him after CES but um good job B yeah so I I started carrying around an iPhone so that I the so I could record the buggy behavior from the fair phone man I've got everything from the earpiece not working on phone calls to the main speaker not
working when watching videos to the brightness going like this like high low high low high low high low in a dark room like just it's going to be a really disappointing review that sucks yeah I'm bummed I wanted it to go well hey dll Hope yall are having a good night which companies are you most excited to see at CES I'm really excited to go to high sense apparently they made something that just shs on the TV I just bought like absolutely makes it look like a a clown product for going to be
the new thing like incredibly bright SDR it apparently can do double the peak brightness "10,000 knits what's going on is there" was there like a new technology Discovery or something he's he's checking if he can say I think that's what my guess what is a context for "10,000 nits oh thank God okay this is" not proprietary secret information told oh yeah oh you're wondering about what you had said already oh yeah oh no oh oh that's so much worse um "10,000" knits you like blind so is that a flashbang
"40,000 local dimming zones W how big is" the TV 110 in so it's a little bit smaller but more local dimming zones but more so you could move a mouse pointer around on this thing and get barely any blooming as far as I can tell wow absolutely flipping assum you could get it inth America without having a Chinese pH number all they claim 95% of BT 2020 what are you 2020 yeah that's what I'm talking about man this thing sounds wild and then right next to them on the show floor TCL is supposed to be there
with a North American version of the thing I just got oh yeah so wow I guess I didn't need to import it I mean it's a cooler story that you did that yeah and like yours is special now we it was it was worth it for the content to deal with importing it before it was available in North America like I I I'm really glad we did it and it's for the gram yep yep anyway I'm really looking forward to that I also want to see all the weird AI stuff so exciting hello lonus as someone
who loves folding phones do you think Apple will eventually make one if they do do you think it will help make folding phones go mainstream I don't know Apple seems almost resistant to doing anything cool with their phones lately what what have they done it's felt very safe like put like more holes in it like I just don't really um or less yeah or less I don't know man like it's uh it almost seems like they're stuck in a rut where they recognize that what people love about the iPhone is
that in 6 years 7 years having not paid attention to Tech at all people can go to the store say my iPhone is slow can I have a new one and it works exactly the  did like that's great from from a like that that's great from a customer consistency customer experience standpoint but it's not exciting it's just boring uh so boring happy New Year dlll Luke I'm thinking of getting a budgie or two and was wondering if you had any tips or resources for me I had a cocka teals growing up but uh so I have some
experience with owning Birds Emma my my girlfriend is more knowledgeable about birds and and the care of birds that I am I like to think I'm no slouch in that regard but she's she's much better  um look up cuz I don't want to say it and be wrong look up uh the things that you shouldn't have or be doing near your birds or probably in your home at all some of that is like cooking with Teflon some cleaners are also included in that um they are like mostly made out of air um and if Airborne
things get into them uh like I mean we were happy that our budgie gained weight and became 30 G um so they can they can be completely taken out and no longer be alived very very very fast um so you need to make sure that there aren't bad contaminants that you're not like cooking stuff that can overwhelm them uh that you there's no people are saying no smoking in the house they're not kidding um no smoking in the house um that that can be really bad for them um they're very very fragile beings as Birds they
hide when they're sick um they don't want to look like easy targets to pre so they hide when they're sick there's some ways that you can kind of tell look it up this is something you're going to need to know because again they can die very fast they're not super resilient so you need to get them to a vet very quickly if something does go wrong  also be very active with their environment when you first get them they're can be very shy uh they might hide in their little box for a long time
stuff like that but they're very social animals they're going to want to hang out with you but you need to constantly poke them out of their not actually not actually physically poke them luk bird tips but you need shake the cave if they're sick just shake the cage but like change up their environment give them give them something that they're not comfortable with yet um last night I just put a random recently cleaned so that I knew it would be safe uh but a random sock near their cage just one
that they hadn't seen before so that they would be like what's that is it safe is stimulation yeah keep them active keep them stimulated they're they're smart and they're very social so keep those things rolling spend actual time with them um and change their environment and stuff so that they have to learn new things get used to different things um accept different things as safe they'll also accept things as safe faster and more easily when they're needing to do it all the
time um and that includes you so if you're having a hard time socializing with them if you're having a hard time like getting them to land on you stuff like that um get them used to getting used to things yeah anyways I'll stop there hey D I've recently tried to stop shopping on Amazon but I'm at a loss on on where to find all of the things they used to shop for how do you find storefronts for highquality Reliable products well LTG store.com let's go getting all the brownie points tonight oh man
um I I just I Google um I look for places that seem pretty credible there's easy ways to make mistakes like that like I almost bought uh badminton shoes from a site that was just fraud once yeah um so you know look for independent I do reverse thumbnail search by the way that's one of the things that I do okay um I try to figure out if the exact product pictures they have are from elsewhere sure but if it's from the manufacturer site that's fine by the way a lot of smaller sites will
not take their own do their own product photography they'll just borrow from the manufacturer but yeah um one of the other things you can do is I don't know reseller ratings used to be a thing um I I haven't I buy I buy a lot of stuff first party these days like when I bought the bamboo printer I just went to Bamboo's website like I just I don't more places offer that now yeah so it's more possible thing now y um I I remember being frustrated actually quite recently cuz I wanted to buy something
and the manufacturer didn't just sell it and I was like Amazon only stores are very annoying no it wasn't an Amazon only store it was just there was just something I wanted to buy and I was on the manufacturer website I was just like I just want one of these why don't you just sell it to me um like what's your problem but it makes sense like setting up e-commerce is not easy right yeah a lot overhead there a lot of legal issues and stuff too um before I forget uh you mentioned you're excited to see all the
weird AI things at CES you should like keep a tally of how many of them you can like break oh no that sounds like too much work you're an AI fridge no you're helping me buy a car or like learn how to make Napal yeah yeah yeah yeah I like that that's often what you reference from the book cuz it's my favorite part too my um my sister-in-law has a smart fridge which I only found out when we visited over the holiday and she actually uses it oh like to play music in her kitchen and I was just kind
of yeah it has a screen on the front you can like load up YouTube music videos I love the ones her kids her kids love like watching music videos in the kitchen I just sorry I just music videos in the kitchen it was one of those product categories that first saw at CES 12 years ago or whatever and I was like well this is stupid this will never be a thing that matters and like in my house where I realistically could have bought a smart fridge if I really wanted to with a screen on it I so so your kids
"could watch music 1,000% decided not to" do that because it seemed like now you'll have to watch music videos on all  um I'm sorry I've gotten complet completely distracted because apparently Alex Jones made a video game yeah when was this for your fridge no but this was a this was a bit ago I think was it if I'm thinking of the right thing um no this is this is from like two days  ago oh boy uh all well good luck with that    boy uh okay wow should should do you see the like um wow it's all reviews right
now are overwhelmingly positive POS  um yeah okay so there's videos of a ton of different people playing it so I think I've seen like thumbnails for people playing this game which is why I knew about that um I wonder if uh they have asmon's permission to be in their trailer well they must have sent him the game yeah I guess interesting that uh seem like an unlikely collaboration there's also I mean there's other streamers in here too it's not just asmin all right okay uh sure let's move
on uh how long until we can get VR headsets that are able to be true monitor Replacements I think it's a bit Apple Vision Pro that I it is I don't know the the people who have tried it say it's amazing I haven't tried it yet if it's as amazing as they say maybe it's super amazing otherwise I would say we're probably a bit off we just had kind of a big leap and I would say maybe it's the next leap or the one after that where you can like really comfortably replace the high DPI monitor that's right on
your desk but one of the issues I have with it is yeah the Comfort side of things I don't think I would want to do that for 8 hours in a day um I wear headphones for 8 hours a day what if it was just as comfy not on if it's just as comfy sure but it's not headphones aren't on your face yeah but it becomes just as comfy but I mean that might be the break even point right it basically needs to be just as comfy it needs to be thaty wearing headphones and like I wouldn't even want
to wear these all day I hate these yeah these suck so like it's not even like headphones in general haven't just solved this like some some of them are good some of them are going to be better than other ones I I feel like I could wear my my sennheisers that I have at home forever and it would never be a problem um but these are are not these are not okay um I have a headache right now yeah like I'm not sure if it's the Alex Jones game or these headphones I think I'll put that on my list I'll get
new headphones through here um okay another one for you uh hey dll I'm a teacher in Texas and this year our standardized tests uh the written responses both the short and the long form will be graded by a custom trained a how do y'all feel about AI as a grader  dumb Tex I don't know if I need to elaborate on that more let me get this straight we're concerned about the students taking shortcuts by using AI but we're actually going to enshrine the teacher's right to take shortcuts by using AI in the in the
worst way the grading portion really come  essay anyway okay you hand in an essay on like pony boy or whatever is it Pony no gold stay golden pony boy yeah I don't think the book is is the book called no no no no no but you hand in a an essay on pony boy it's a good song um I think it's by Sophie I don't remember yeah Outsiders yeah yeah yeah you handed an essay on pony boy from The Outsiders uh and it's like your essay on war in peace all right has these various I just
hallucinated a different essay for you I'm going to grade that one if you don't mind I did perfect and like it's not going to show its work so how is like if if a teacher has to vet it all anyways aren't they just going to have to read the whole essay   what all right AI graded him uh Hey Linus did you hear about City of Heroes developer officially lining the biggest fan server I didn't but that sounds super cool yeah I created this I did not hear about this either that
sounds awesome that sounds super sick so what is what is officially licensing a fan server mean I don't know City of Heroes has been dead for a long time okay um I'm assuming what this means is they legitimized this fan server because Sony's not doing anything with this Dead game anymore um so maybe you have to own a copy of the game similar to how Forge Alliance forever does it uh which is great fantastic solution in my opinion um I don't know I know none of the details I've never heard of this but them
it it it sounds good super cool um in other like kind of cool sounding news for a change um this I also didn't know but this is a merch message from Tony C uh thoughts on Rockstar buying modding platform cfx and NC soft giving official plastic oh wait oh no this is the NC soft thing uh okay hold on Rockstar buying cfx okay no I don't have thoughts on that no I hadn't heard about either of these things sorry I've been buried under a rock this week apparently but the NC soft one is super cool sorry I
thought I misread this so the license that Sony gave the City of Heroes fan server the fan server I saw the name for a second I think it's called homecoming yeah fan supported homecoming server for for City of Heroes receives official license from publisher and seesoft surprising players the license allows the admin team to continue development my God that's amazing that is ex and this is Sony who's done this uh it says it's I think it's it said Sony in what I don't know in what you
said but this says NC soft okay that's kind of amazing yeah NC soft's decision to embrace the FN server not sure what that means um shows a shift in sentiment giving hope for future Community content in the gaming industry this is awesome what should happen this is amazing if it's one thing if a game dies out because the developer can't maintain it anymore or whatever else and uh no one cares fine then just let it die I guess but if the community wants it to keep going if they're sure
small but dedicated enough they should be allowed to yeah I I don't know if uh someone else misspoke or if I misspoke or or what uh but yeah Sony has definitely nothing to do with this well that makes more sense now you say Sony that makes so much more sense now okay y sorry verbal typo it's getting late uh my bad all right lastt being very cool D I'm playing games with my kids is my favorite thing to do and they're getting better they're finally starting to walk straight lonus
what are your favorite games to play with your kids oh um man anything anything they like um you play faf with little man now yeah yeah um the uh Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles beat him up was pretty fun to play with them cool uh I was one of L's kids that day uh Ultimate Chicken horse um they they really like that just the the trolling and fun party game uh one of my favorites is TA Ling's house party it's a VR game super Niche but it's a lot of fun and the kids just love the silliness
of it you can't play it all the time no no it's like fantastic when you pull it out not very often it's a hit every time it comes out y you want to kind of limit it though and I think that's pretty much it for the show hey thanks guys for tuning in we'll see you again next week same   bye we may want to consider I know I'm still but we may want to consider H weeks where there is absolutely nothing to talk about  it honestly a lot yeah weird sh weird shower
