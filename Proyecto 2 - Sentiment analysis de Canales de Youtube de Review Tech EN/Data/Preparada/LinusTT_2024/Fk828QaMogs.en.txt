here at the lonus tech technical institute of forc induction and funky lettuce we've been working tirelessly on a problem that has stumped computer Engineers for decades you see the turbo button turbo boost and Turbo S have one thing in common they have no freaking turbo but our best and brightest Alex here has found the solution Alex it came  laptop behold the world's first    woo this right here is a conventional turbocharger for a car specifically the Volkswagen Golf R the exhaust gases blow
into this side right here spinning this little turbine right here then there's a shaft going through the middle that connects to this compressor which in turn compresses air that is blown into your engine right up here more air plus more fuel equals more power excellent but also problematic you see our red magic Titan 16 Pro powerful machine though it is does not produce exhaust gases so to make Alex's dream of reality we need an electric turbo now terrible electric turbos are plentiful on eBay
AliExpress and wish.com but we wanted an electric turbo that legitimately works so we got this meet the torque amp a 6.7 horsepower electric turbo that blows enough air to substantially increase a car's horsepower this says Alex to write disclaimer about turbo versus supercharger oh yeah technically this could be considered a supercharger because it is driven by this and not exhaust gases but they say turbo on the website so we're going with turbo whatever you want to call it this
thing is absolutely flipping wild I mean look at the geometry on these fan blades I have never seen that each blade is two blades I guess to increase pressure probably something to do with compressor efficiency I I don't really know then there's the motor which maybe I'm just out of the loop but I thought would be a "lot bigger given that it's 5,000" wants and there's the super lightweight construction because we only need the one side it can be made out of cast aluminum instead of also having to have
Steel in it with that said it's going to cost you elsewhere because you've got to power the thing and that's where the rest of this kit comes in what's the  "$2,978 oh my God this power box though" keep 2 cm free for cooling do not block the holes this is going to be fun this looks fairly self-explanatory colorcoded 48 Vols out I assume yep harness goes into the turbo or supercharger whatever you want to call it okay yes our motor controller right here so we get our DC
AC 48 volts okay and I assume this needs to plug into some kind of control thing this is a temperature sensor actually so if this starts getting too hot the motor controller will be like we're stopping by that's something that's important to note because this is designed for use in a vehicle only when you're accelerating hard it's only rated for 1 second of boost for 10 seconds of recharge so using it to cool a laptop continuously well it's not going to be continuous continuous but you know we'll
see how it goes yeah uh make sure the red dots are lined up it says explicitly in the instruction manual to make sure that they're lined up they're lined also torque amp excellent instruction manual like I don't say that very often but it was actually very informative dude I am jazzed like I am legit extremely excited about this this may not be the dumbest thing we've ever done but it's up there it might be the dumbest you think so well we haven't had other things spoilers that actively heat themselves
up that we've tried to cool a computer with before but anyway we'll wor with that later for now here's a 1200 W DC power supply plugged into the power input side here is that enough to wait "but I thought this is a 5,000 W Motor so" what they do is you have your 12 volts well actually like 14 volts from your car that goes into this charges this up and then the lithium battery that's in here is what powers your turbo got it so that's why it can't run continuously it actually has a battery in here yeah and
"you also don't want to be drawing 5,000" WS from your car because you will drain your battery and your alternator will probably not be happy at all right you have experience with that I do do you want to know how this is supposed to work is this something to do with the accelerator yeah you literally just put this under your gas pedal when you go all the way down she click and it goes there are much better ways to do it like you can have full ECU configuration using this guy right here but if you 
dirty and I guess that's how we're doing it yeah neat one final thing before you power it on oh yes oh we want to filter the air going into it yes that makes sense it's both to make sure that no dust and crap gets in there hurts the turbine also to protect us cuz like you don't want like your Willie get sucked  or a really good time for a really short period of time really bad that's on its own circuit that's on  uhhuh okay do you want to hit the thing I do okay so how long is like safe
to hit it for oh I don't know you can just hammer it if you want should we have earring protection in probably right well we can hit didn't  okay yes  bananas that is crazy that's through the filter yeah well I mean it would add restriction not very much some let's get earplugs I know I shouldn't be that surprised because that's kind of the benefit of an electric motor is that you've got that immediate torque and immediate ramp to full power but holy crap it does blow it it does force the induction that was
crazy you should hit it again I I mean I will I will I will hold on I want to put I want to put something on the end so we can kind of see what's what's shaking here hold on just give me give me a second give me a second I got I got a concept I got I've got a concept if you're wondering ing yes that technique  kids okay okay I got to feel it I got to  it the Air's not hot but it sure as heck isn't cool do you want to explain to the people why that would be before we do that I want to play with these but
before we play with those we need to go and have a little listen to some turbo sound so you know what's good and what's bad right now everything in the engine is as it should be so we'll just have a little listen to what the turbo would sound like so you  hear that P that you're hearing that is the diverter valve this little guy's job is that when your throttle body closes while you're making boost it just diverts all that boost somewhere else and makes that fun sh noise on other
cars you might have a blowoff valve instead but let's just come in here take this plug oh there we go this is almost definitely going to give me a check engine light but my warranty is already very void as you can probably tell so we're not too concerned about that I'll just clear it later just so I'm clear what you've done is you've made it so the valve won't open correct huh yeah probably don't do this cool unless you want fun noise and turbo damage you can't have a warant warning
that includes unless you want fun well that's not a good warning okay you'll hear it in a second and you will agree that it's very fun don't blow up your car I'm not going to I'm not going to go full Boost but now if we listen we get oh so that's compressor surge that is when the air that you've been compressing blows back through the turbo  fun right very very fun probably pretty hard on it though it's not ideal it's not so bad in this situation where we're not at full Boost and you know you're
not making power once that throttle body's closed but with an electric turbo like the one that we have back there you're going to generate power yeah if there is a restriction and it starts blowing back through you have an electric motor that is not going to stop so it will just kill itself so if we start hearing that kind of a noise we stop we stop and now I have an engine code to clear if those nozzles or that laptop turn out to be too restrictive I made this it is two ball valves JB welded into some 3D
printed stuff please tell me you at least used like a high strength filament or something no but like you it's pretty good these days I did a lot of infill okay I got these off of Amazon they're very very cheap intercooler tubing cool then you just throw a worm Drive clamp on there and that's not going anywhere this is even cured like if there's actual pressure in here these fittings  bullet that looks dangerous now it really does doesn't it it was already dangerous now it just looks the part
here's a pair of safety glasses instead of putting them on my face uh Alex go  oh they're over here buddy they done got Yol across the room what are you using that for what are you doing what please okay do  portable yes nice oh that's the good stuff yep okay throw this one on the the arm that's going to no it'll be fine it'll be fine do do it you cowards we go I'll be fine I've done worse for my craft red magic Titan 16 Pro features a full metal CNC chassis an Intel core9 14900 HX plus
an RTX 460 it's got dual fans plus highs speec quad copper heat pipes and phase change silicone grease a 1080p cam camera with Windows hello dtsx Ultra audio 16 gigs of 5600 megat transfer pers second high frequency memory plus a 1 TB pcie Gen 4 SSD it's got a 2 and 1/2k screen with 100% dcip 3 color gamut coverage and the cooling is basically good than we need but that doesn't mean it can't be gooder so we're going to attach this to in a minute but first let's have some fun what do you think
can I close the lid of this laptop with    dude this is like the most Juiced up  this and they're gone dude dude this  blower and the best part is we have haven't even tried the tight nozzle yet I think it's time let's see what she can do to this duct tape roll think I can  can w d perfect got  nothing you know I think she's actually more restricted huh I think she's less powerful this way well that's a Downer but it allows us to direct it a bit more for example we could spin the turbine in 
this the bottom line is it moves a lot  air let's cool a PC you're going so slow Alex you're  a jeez we obviously can't fit this inside the machine well I've made the world's first ever turbo manifold for a laptop so you've just taken the entire air intake at the bottom and made this it looks like a freaking vacuum cleaner head Alex it really does I am a little worried about bolting this on though like does this have enough structural rigidity for that oh well there plates
right there ah oh there we go so that goes on the inside all of those are threaded holes boom make sure that you line up the broken tap with the spot that doesn't have a hole drilled just like so sure and then in terms of the seal are we just going to allow for some leakage here now we've got an O-ring 330 second it goes on the other side in all seriousness making your own o-ring is not as weird as you'd think all you need is par o-ring handbook you just go in there they tell you how big to make this
little hole right here a little Groove Chuck it in you're done nice easy oh nice okay I got this one that helps a lot that's an important one right there okay we got the two on the ends oh yeah oh bud no we're good I'm good with this question for you y um now there are spikes going into our motherboard yep no do you want both colors or an angle  so this one's still intact I guess we have a sacrificial lamb somewhere oh I was going to swap the bottoms on that one oh perfect yeah are they all the
same y nice thank you red magic for that just use all the same screws love to see it also very nice in here they have upgradeable Ram there's a free SSD slot right there over top of your other SSD oh damn some chunky heat pipes that's about all that you can expect these days really do we unplug the fans cuz we can't run this continuously so when we're not running it having fans would be pretty nice but we also do risk way over spinning these and blowing something up didn't you test
that though in the dark fantasies video yeah I did also test it and I blew a bunch of compressed air into it and was totally fine if we kill it do we just swap them and not tell anyone yeah okay okay so we leave them in so that's it then this just goes on here now yeah it might have some clearance problems nothing that can't be overcome by forcing screws it's funny because there is a very real benefit to the metal chassis if we were trying to do this with a plastic bottom we'd risk
cracking it yeah red magic thought of this this exactly what their Engineers imagined do we have like a like a stand or do we have any kind of concept there uh I did bring over some feet that I was going to attach to the bottom and then I forgot about that until right now cool so then you do or don't have them uh let's see um you know what though Alex it may end up that the turbo just kind of supports it oh I was going to have it piped over like here somewhere oh we have a whole
box of intercooler piping Wick at smart  okay theoretically we haven't really changed much here so so I'm going to boot it up the fans didn't collide with all the stuff that we just put in there so that's nice perfect let's pop out CPU core temperatures GPU temperature is there any other temp sensor we could maybe I mean we could sure we could grab our SSD temperature why not right yeah I'm sure there'll be air flow over that there there's going to be air everywhere okay
let's fire up fur mark this is going to get our GPU a little toasty so here's our GPU temperature she's Rising it's also still 44 degrees that's pretty good yeah give her a sec give her a sec she's going to she's going to go up oh dude GPU is um kind of running too cool I guess the 4060 is pretty efficient we might have to hit the CPU if we want to see something actually run at a high temperature but what we can do still is we can see if more air flow will help  oh my god did it get hotter or colder I
couldn't even tell it went down oh wow oh yeah I do wonder if we may have unseated something our temps are higher than they were before we ever turned on the turbo though yeah they are I wonder why let's watch GPU temps here I'm just I'm going to hold it down this time okay   down now Alex has explained this before there is a limit when you're designing a heat sink to how much benefit there is from additional air flow is that what we're up against or is it because the air is so warm it's probably a bit of
both there is a problem where turbos create a lot of heat for one it's compressing the gas so PV equals nrt pressure goes up a bunch so does your temperature same thing as like compressed air can but in Reverse you know how this get super duper cold but also just simply like there will be friction against the turbine housing against all the little fins and stuff like that that also adds in Heat against the hosing this tube is at 36° it was at ambient a second ago yeah so do we have
a solution for that oh we do we most certainly do we not only have the world's first turbocharged laptop but also the world's first front mount intercooler laptop this thing was sent over by CTS there are local guys here in Langley and it just so happens that this one fits a Mark 7 and a half GTI I don't know how that happened really what what's happening to it after we're done this project we'll see I don't know did you explain this to them it's a fan why don't I try then this
intercooler is basically an air-to-air heat exchanger so we're going to take the hot air that's coming out of our turbo and we are going to cool that hot air as it goes through here into our laptop and we're going to cool that air using ambient temperature air using this fan I was thinking that we put it on this side because if you remember this video These fans are very very dangerous mhm these are the guys that the carrots right across the room oh yeah yeah that's good that what are you doing what do you 
oh okay I like how we are going to have so much more power going towards cooling this laptop than the laptop will ever even think about drawing each one of  "5,000 the back of this setup is going to" be extremely dangerous once we turn this on we do not want to be hanging around back here if anything gets in these fans it will get cut off I'm talking fingers Willies you name it I think she's on For Better or For Worse Alex it's working yeah they're not pulling much at the top but that kind of
makes sense and it looks like they're not suck the duct tape in so okay we don't go back there anymore that's it that's the whole thing now that we're switched over to gaming mode and we're hitting our CPU you can see temperatures are ramping up pretty fast with the stock fans it is drawing 100 WTS on the CPU that's pretty good let's see if we can    god oh damn gee Works CTS knows what they're doing that is the best example of like an aircooler I've ever seen we went straight back to the office mode
temperatures like straight back oh oh man this pipe is hot right here well yeah I bet so that's 40° okay this one on the other side 23 dude it works great it works really good so we were probably just completely counteracting any benefit we were getting from the airflow by blowing such hot air dude this works it works good want another hit oh yeah I can give you another hit I'm afraid to put my face near this keyboard the key might take my eye out here we go oh we overpower protection our poor
power supply which actually makes sense because we have so much restriction on the outlet now now what I'd actually like to see is if our CPU package power is willing to go a little higher if we throw this much cooling at it but it probably won't cuz we're already well  oh that is so cool to show you guys how much air is being pushed through this laptop I have an idea ah ah okay I'm going to put this one next to the left exhaust and we're going to put these  oh the track pad the poor track pad oh
my God okay we have to game on it right yeah we have to game on it we obviously have to game on it I'm really impressed at how well this removes heat from the air I don't know why but I just I thought that wouldn't be able to do much to that volume of air oh no that that's what it's made for that's a it's a sick intercooler that thing's good for 450 horsepower apparently now it's time to actually game on this thing I'm sitting at around oh wow 35° on the GPU 73 on the CPU well we don't really need it 
it we're down to 60 on the CPU oh yeah that's crazy we blew off one of the pom  very oh she's hot dude oh that's fine 70° yeah okay that's on the outside of the motor housing Lord only knows what's going on inside and it was pretty cool of red magic to be Bros and just sponsor this video sight unseen and let us do this to their poor machine yeah I've definitely seen happier laptops than this one when you  but it held up and look the trackpad still works it works yeah you can do
horrible things to the chassis of this  fine you can check it out at the link down below and if you guys enjoyed this video maybe you can check out the one where Alex and I hooked up the biggest fan we've ever seen to a PC or those other big fans that put a bunch of carrot in them don't forget about the other other big fans when it blew the panel off oh yeah
