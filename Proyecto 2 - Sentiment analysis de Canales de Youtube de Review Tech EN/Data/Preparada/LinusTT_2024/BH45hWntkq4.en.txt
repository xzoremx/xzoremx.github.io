June the 14th of this year was probably the worst day of my life so far the previous evening I had found out that my sister passed away I had spent the day dealing with the family drama and grief that comes with an unexpected loss like that I made my way through one of the hardest W shows that I've ever done um just focusing on the routine and when I came home there was an unexplained wine that I couldn't really nail down the source of I made my way downstairs and I found out that the pump that runs
the cooling system for my server rack here was running dry that means one of two things the reservoir is leaking or the systems are leaking and I'll let this water mark on the floor answer the question for you so instead of eating I began the painstaking process of tearing everything out of the rack as safely as possible I made my way all the way through both storage and utility servers my main and my backup mine and yvon's office machines and all three of my kids gaming rigs until I found this the
culprit a completely corroded off fitting that dumped gallons of water on everything underneath it how could this happen I mean that's galvanic corrosion plain as the nose on my face but this is a loop that has nothing but Copper Brass plastic what the is going on here I've had to sit and Wonder from then until now so that I could get someone over here to point a camera at this because I'm sure that you guys want to know the answer as badly as I do and if I'm going to lose a bunch of server
equipment well I might as well at least help pay for it with this message from our sponsor if I had time to untangle cables would my hair look like this why not switch to Magnetic cables from our sponsor mag tame instead they pull apart effortlessly roll up perfectly and stick to any magnetic surface no stress no mess no worries we'll have them Linked In the video description now I know what you guys are thinking ah it's lius he's always doing janky projects and I'm sure
he overlooked something I mean galvanic corrosion can't happen by accident that's science but listen to this you want to talk science how about the scientific method for a control system I grabbed one of the other ones in the loop and look at those fittings those are the same two fittings and they're immaculate so if it was a configuration error in the loop these should be eaten and yet they're pristine our goal today is twofold then my son obviously wants his gaming rig back up and running which is
why he's helping but before we do that we need to know what the heck happened here so that we can ensure that this won't happen again the first step of disassembling these blocks is popping the stainless steel cover off it's important to note that this is purely cosmetic since steel is not a compatible metal with the ones that are typically used for water cooling like Copper Brass and nickel now let's go a layer deeper and remove the delin top okay not the cleanest Loop I've ever seen why is
there so much dust on it well I can tell what some of this is these look like little plastic filings from working with the tubing that we installed oh there's a little metal shaving uh that could be left over for manufacturing of something radiator heat exchanger there's a surprising amount of this that looks like hair or other organic matter but there's iodine in the loop and what kind of contradicts that theory is that this tube over here which is running water to my system right now is Crystal Clear
well maybe one of the other systems will give us some hints as to what that is actually we don't need to go that far around the edges of the reservoir there is a little bit of something not much but I think I might need to up my iodine dosage and maybe throw a filter in there either way none of that would explain the leak let's take apart the other block here we go what the crap what is this ew why does it look burned it kind of does look burned it's definitely not it was
underwater but the kind of oxidation that could occur when burning I guess could also happen when it's being corroded but the funny thing is is that this is where the metal and you can actually see metallic elements here this is where the metal was being deposited but there's no metal for it to deposit onto normally in galvanic corrosion you have a sacrificial anode and then you have a a cathode that the metal deposits onto but it's depositing onto the delin or the space above it you
can see that's what was being corroded away right which is why the fitting broke off and liquid gushed out into the system but the deposit was so close it was right here the mid plate that fitting crumbled  who okay well that's something that happened now EK had a theory when I contacted them and that was that this stainless steel cover was somehow participating in the galvanic corrosion process because it was bridged to the fluid somehow or something but I just don't see how it
could connect none of these screw holes externally pass through to the inside of the block and you can clearly see with their Decades of experience designing these things there's no connection here either even if I screw this in all the way not going to lie boy I was hoping it would be a little bit more obvious at this point can we just fix it and then not care what happens we got really lucky this time we only lost the big ups at the bottom and I lost one of the rows of nvme back plane
slots on one of the servers the other row fully works and I don't need the second row um also your computer is dead we won't necessarily get that lucky next time there were pools of water on the motherboards of some of the systems under this one so we need to figure out what happened is what I'm trying to say which means we need to start dissecting some more victims actually wait before we look at a different system we should look at a second block within this system to see if there's something
unique about this environment these fuel line hoses are a bit of a nightmare to get off you can see the reinforcing string that makes even cutting them a bit of a chore okay what do you think we're going to find a lot more corrosion and metal oh crud I called it cuz this means your computer's not getting fixed today oh still happy no that might do it for EK theory about that top stainless steel thing maybe this is a more widespread issue now we really need to start cracking open more systems and
seeing what's up one rail came out hold on you got to come straight out there you go oh my goodness the plot thickens the second fitting on this GPU is pristine what is going on here could it be the Worm Drive clamps they're not touching though and this this one hasn't been moved I unscrewed it by just twisting up the tube this is exactly as it was bro nasty what this means to me is every one of these systems has to have every fitting popped to check if it's corroding a couple of the screws going
into the top of this GPU block are rusted this is not a damp environment so the only moisture they should have access to is from in here I didn't know which holes they came out of though unfortunately I don't think your computer is going to be working for a while hey thank goodness it's summer and there's lots else to do right yeah I wouldn't let my dad get away with that but hey thanks what do we have to do to get it working again it relies on a cooling system that it shares with six other
systems all six systems need to be checked to ensure that they don't have corrosion in them because if one of them corrodes it takes down the whole thing so all the systems need to be taken right down to the disassembly of the bare Parts okay so like 2 months I'm the kind of dad who believes in honoring my promises so I am not going to promise anything okay this is shaping up to look like it is going to be an absolutely terrifying amount of work like better off starting over amount of work here
then shouldn't we just start over well I mean it'd be kind of was wasteful don't you think and this is your gaming rig this has seen you through many battles well you just going to leave it behind on the field yeah now it's clear there are issues with the loop not caused by anything to do with block design uh there is some organic matter in here you can really tell now that it's still wet but I reiterate that would not cause a leak so then it is ek's Fault well we can't say
that definitively I think what we're going to do is we're going to investigate one or two of the other systems send them our findings and then we'll go from there the worst corroded one in both cases was nearest the acceleration or impingement plate but on the GPU the deposition didn't take place on the plate itself it took place here before it you're probably wondering what to do next what we need is a corrosion check on this this this and this you're going to start by blowing all the water
out of the system how do I do that I'm glad you asked when they aren't coupled these quick connects stop the flow of water and air so there's no way for us to blow out the system  now she should just kind of drain o hey there we go but that's slow and we can accelerate the process using under normal circumstances I'd be giving you guys a bunch of lectures about air compressors and computers there are concerns with moisture being blown onto the components uh static buildup but in
this case we're just blowing out tubing so we don't need to worry about any of that what you're going to do is you're going to take this you're going to hold it tight up against the in one as you can and all the water is going to blow out the other side when you pull the trigger [Applause] W now we don't need to worry about water leaking all over our system as we disconnect our hoses realis ically the system is not alive anymore but there could still be components that are good
remember that I said that your SSD might be okay well that's because it's over here on the other side from where the leak was so as long as the water didn't come up that high or as long as there wasn't some kind of malfunction of the motherboard that caused a cascading malfunction to your SSD you might still have all your games and data and all your saves and all that kind of stuff get this hex head and pull the block off clean the thermal goop off the bottom of the block while you're handling it so
you don't make a mess okay next thing you want to do is get these fittings off yeah you might need to take off these worm drives first so you need that Flathead there's certain things that I really hope are not dead I mean a motherboard's a relatively simple replacement I even have a cold spare of these just in case you know we experienced a failure but like these pcie Gen4 extensions and stuff like that H it'll just probably take a little while to get new ones then again I've made no commitments
about when this will be done so now we're just going to play twisty twist until this comes out not the world's most fun game twisty twist is very effective how'd you get to be so sarcastic bad parenting I guess yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah speaking of bad parenting I think I'm just going to have to give you a really  you perfect okay so now we just put it back well I don't know man like this is Raising more questions than it's answering I think what we need to do is
have a look at the fittings on the GPU now so this one's perfect on both yeah maybe this is a system by System thing then the fittings are perfect on the GPU on the second system remember our first control system as well got two more to go though let's see what's shaken in those phrase interesting so yours is the bad one oh man I guess this is It's kind of good news but it also just deepens the mystery and there you have it looking at the last two systems the ones above the leak flawless flawless flawless
lless only one system experienced corrosion out of the five and it was on two different blocks for real chemistry Majors get out of your armchairs or rather get in your arm chairs what happened here so you're probably wondering well what now then well now I'm going to test the two systems that were under number three and see if they still work which means maybe ooh caps up white light good hey desktop better as unbelievable as it might seem the only system casualty is my son's gaming rig almost  is it
possible that this system still functions I kind of doubt it it gushed water over the motherboard like right over the vrms let everything else survive what do you think Andrew is she just going to like post I'm I'm not I  dead now modern Electronics got a lot of protections you know short circuit over current over voltage but dump gallons of flipping water over it protection obviously I can't deploy it the way it is it's got its blocks and fittings all corroded to heck and back
so there's definitely going to be a followup where I hear from some of you folks I go back to the manufacturer we figure out exactly what's going on we rebuild this mess but I'd say this is about the best outcome I could have possibly hoped for just like I couldn't hope for for a better sponsor than our sponsor next to go have you ever hopped on a meeting and thought your screen was frozen because the person you're talking to his picture is moving at 5 FPS how embarrassing enhance your work from home
