the reality is you guys were right realistically with Rising interest rates and inflation we probably would have gone down eventually but after the slowdown in production after the controversy last August guys we're out of money and we can't afford our office buildings anymore there is a silver lining though we were able to hold on to one asset the old Langley house so one little eviction notice to the tenants later a VOA the new old lonus Media Group off off we're moving back in honestly I see
this as a win I mean before we grew too big for our Brites we used to shoot our videos here in this regular residential house so why can't we do it again it's where we created bangers like whole room water cooling the ultimate RGB build guide and more importantly that time we pranked old Taran for a year I mean realistically if it worked for 10 people it should work for a 100 people we just knew knew that creating an efficient layout was going to be a top priority I mean the first day I was
here I couldn't take two steps without bumping into something or tripping over somebody so we divided up the house by department and gave everyone an equal workspace just turned out that uh some departments got a little bit more equal Works space than others we're going to start in the living room oh after we tell you about our sponsor please don't skip we really need the money build Redux not everyone has time time to build themselves a PC that's obvious what's also obvious is that you should
let the experts at build Redux do that  below my god oh wow um I think it's worse than I imagined oh my God we moved the poor editors here too everybody's here L is the whole company in this corner where the tech quickie green screen used to be we still have a green screen but we've also got the writing Department how's the transition been guys it's been all right so far I think I enjoy it we had a power search and my computer died hey um glass half full you still have a computer uh before they
took the keys we had everyone just kind of snatch everything that was within Arms Reach including their computers so we're actually pretty good there but the issue is that asking everyone to sneak a desk out seemed like a tall order realistically you look around it's not like everyone one of these people could have had a traditional desk anyway that's why Jordan actually came up with the idea of bunk desks I mean we just added the junior writing position so they get the ground spots while the
uh senior writers get the top bunks nice don't worry buddy you'll get up here one day while the view is Good from the top the commute has some problems we've got Creator Warehouse Engineers working on improved solutions for this which uh you guys might catch later on in the video keep your eyes peeled speaking of peeling potatoes you may already know from the tour of our potato farm that we do our best to give our staff their yard time I I don't mean that in a literal sense I mean no one's
allowed outside without a pass like yard time like a prison you know uh time away from your cell it's a joke quite onet now one big challenge is going from four fridges to one has led into some significant food storage problems so we started organizing Pizza lunches every eating day everyone gets a slice and hey clean up is easy too which is nice because we've been doing most of our Vlogs here in the kitchen it's like the good old days only uh Cozier he's contractually obligated to
do that lonus we okay we got to we got to shoot techman now we need the space  thanks to AI Apple's next iPad is supposed to have a sense of selfness I can hear you talking come on yeah not having sets anymore the green screen's been getting a ton of action which means the editing Den has been absolutely bustling we were originally planning to put Logistics here but uh then I had a little brainstorm they can't take this box truck back if they don't know where it is I was
concerned we wouldn't be able to pack all three of our surviving Logistics members in here but with how little of our inventory made it to the new space it's not a problem in fact we're going to have more room soon because uh there's almost no work for them to do is there oh no oh hi Mark I see you are working off of one of my favorite kinds of products anything from a sponsor who hasn't abandoned us over our constant stream of controversies like UK green please don't go away oh
which by the way brings us to one of the problems that we had to solve here power delivery you see most Vancouver homes "are serviced for about 10,000 Watts" which sounds like a lot Until you realize that across 100 people that's like 100 watts each for all of their Tech and that's not including appliances or air conditioning or who turned these on who turned these on doesn't include a budget for lights I told you guys there's no budget for lights and working in the dark promotes positive Chi look how much
better we all feel right now one of the ideas we had to solve this was to just have the editors work off of power efficient laptops you know the kind that can be quickly grabbed in a hurry but we realized that most of what we had on hand just wasn't sufficient for any kind of computation heavy workload like rendering video we're currently working on a solution using jailbroken ps5s which draw less than 200 watts each as our standardized workstations we're going to have the
files that you need to jailbreak the PS5 Linked In the description below but sadly we've run into some compatibility issues with Adobe Creative Suite 6 so the editors were allowed to keep their Windows machines for now on the condition that they edit twice as many videos as before cuz they've got twice as much power we even let them keep full-size desktop monitors like these ones from vew Sonic that uh landfest might want back at some point they're not getting it back sucks to be them I mean
realistically we're a great company that deserves their support anyway like look at this plof um this is a great workstation you've got here it's very ergonomic is working on an upcoming video where we're giving away gaming rigs to people who ask for them in the comments what what that's what you're working on is it for them comments yeah oh God you know and then just here's the rroll every time someone actually wins don't worry it's fine it won't cost anything oh God now as you can imagine
having so many people in a house that's designed for five maybe six people there are not enough bathrooms to go around we tested out some solutions like a schedule or those vibrating pucks they hand out at restaurants that it turns out you can just take but the best system ended up being earning bathroom time on a merit basis which for me means anytime I want excuse me hey hey whoo whoo again come on you have your own bathroom oh dude I take it back go go  jeez what are you doing you done as for
the Post lunch drop off rush and uh the low married individuals who uh just can never really earn any bathroom time we operate a shuttle to the local Starbucks where our Mac address writer Jonathan course has made his office fun fact he Blends in so well with the crowd of oy FY people on the MacBooks he's been there for weeks and they haven't even noticed them at this point you probably have some questions about Network infrastructure the editors are clearly all connected to ethernet
cables and uh' got some pretty high-end stuff we were able to snag right here but where do these cables come from where do they go let me show you one thing we will never compromise on is our Ballin servers and I mean look I knew that we could address almost all of our infrastructure issues if we just set people up to work remotely and In fairness to me I allowed most of the managers to work from home but for everyone else we've got to connect to new new new new new wanic and our 10 gig
internet connection that we achieved by aggregating Links from nine of our unsuspecting neighbors thanks thanks neighbors right thanks neighbors let's check out the server we wanted to put it downstairs where we could take advantage of the natural heat regulation of the basement but now that we can't afford his executive level pay anymore Luke enthusiastically volunteered to move back into the basement hey Luke working harder hardly working you yeah we're such good friends
we could talk to each other like that oh um on our way upstairs then to see the server we're going to pass our business and procurement teams on The house's naturally embedded cushion benches with all the changes that we're making around here we decided there was nothing more important than to streamline the moneymaking processes and we're putting it all right into our script writing now hey you make me any money today shro absolutely wait are you un Link in no he's not as for any confidential calls
the business team just takes in their cars situation in the car Sven sorry sorry sorry for sakes man in the car okay okay sorry sorry my boss is just give me that I'll just do it he'll talk to you in a minute I got to have a chat with him first meet me outside I'll be out there eventually here take your phone other than the occasional insubordination I'd say this department is doing great you guys doing great yeah happy to be here now for the server room oh Dan um good job you want to tell the
people about what we've got going on here this uh used to be a infrastructure map and now it's this which is great yeah um thanks I guess oh yeah uh so this is our like UniFi rack we had to send the Hammond back yep uh our internet comes in through here through the window no no it's it's on the floor I don't want it running through my office bring it in through the window okay okay uh bye tomorrow uh and then we've got the the portable Nas over there cuz we don't have W anymore and then these are the
mother Vault ah we went back to the old Vault you got like 20 terab wow and Wi-Fi uh yeah uh no one else is allowed to connect to this one though right this is mine six uh yeah sure I prefer yes to sure I can't change this anymore obviously there's still some work for you to do then Dan but yeah there's some really cool stuff like this is still a working bathroom check this out I can wash my hands no it gets so hot honestly this whole place is kind of hot not only is every computer a space
heater but every one of my worldclass meat sacks produces around another 80 "Watts meaning we're at 18,000 watts how" do we cool that well initially we tried opening the windows pretty good idea right but then people started abusing their privileges so we had to think outside the box you've seen water cooled room you've seen water cooled chair have you seen water cooled humans in here we've got our camera storage which we don't have a lot of it but hey we don't have a lot of Studio space anymore so uh
win-win and our amazing accounting department this is pretty cool right all we needed was a couple Pals some tubes some painkillers and a garbage bag it just runs in there then to prevent them from getting swamp butt we use camping chairs so any extra moisture just collects in the bottom and then seeps into the carpet where it can be dissipated into the rest of the room um speaking of collection guys is there any money today are you playing video games uh I'm actually working enough of these
guys who lik accountants anyway now let's see what Creator Warehouse is up to you um might remember there being more people on the team and you're right we sent half of them on a trip to China to work closer with our manufacturers literally then to save money and keep our prices low for you we canel their return airfare that's a lose win win uh what are the engineers working on I can't help feeling like we used to draw things on computers we still can his is dead though and this way getting a sign
off is much easier  yeah ready to go to the manufacturers fun fact uh this is Nick's old office back when we were working out of this house the first time just now he shares it with about eight other people yeah and we still get kicked out on Fridays for the W show here on the other side of our now in-house screwdriver production facility we've got our social team as you guys probably know Twitter and Tik Tok don't pay particularly well and we had to cost down but we can't stop the
content Mill so these guys just need to take up a little less space than before you guys are doing good Mr Sebastian I have a question I have a question for you why are you not posting cat memes I only get paid in Cloud exposure I'm wondering if we can that's a good question why don't we turn our attention to the fashion team what are you working on so right now you know just measuring some fabric for some new Styles testing out to make sure that the GSM is what we want whether we want a heavyweight or
lightweight garment you know all that good stuff right but have you costed it down yes like way down I know yeah we're talking sense and that's why it's red DED red with oh God meanwhile in the final corner of this spacious office we've got a lamade um it's a little tougher to measure things I guess without a table how do you do it now well you go on the floor why does this have blood on it I put my blood sweated tears into it just like we do with all of our merch at LT store yeah you heard
it here first one in every hundred shirts will have have authentic sah teers on it and to show we care about our customers just as much as our employees we kept over 19% of our customer care team right here in the closet thanks Nolan you're doing God's work you're welcome I tell him I'm God there's not much to see in here though it's basically like the rest of the house I mean look at this awful paint job do they even know what eggshell is uh I I mean I guess I've got my plants 
Visions this isn't the time for work though I'm giving you guys a tour now you might wonder why exactly it is that I need my own exit from the building and it's because just because my job is to have visions doesn't mean that I have to  them it feels good to be outside by the way this is where we're shooting short circuit these days what's go have a look it's just like the old days thanks so much for watching guys make sure to check out another video like the one where we learned to suita sausage that's
a good one it took a really long time cuz the heater on this hot tub doesn't work so good but hey I mean look we're ready for all the different elements Belle even has a full 40% of this uh woo hot tub covered doing good in there it'll be warm soon at least it would if we'd ever paid the gas bill oh there's our parking lot the neighbors don't really like it but uhome this is fun right I mean securing a parking spot at the old office was almost a blood sport so as you can imagine this it's more like the
Thunderdome 100 people enter one person gets Rich you know like the angry Maxwell movie in the meantime we've developed an efficient system for fitting an incredible 30 hole cars where our neighbors used to access their garages and the only scratches are from when they get keyed we really are making the best out of what could have been a tough situation but you know what I always say what doesn't kill us makes us stronger feel stronger oh we ended up in HR they suck let's go look at the lap sorry for
breathing things are a little tight in here but we're making it work how's it going Gary it's going great today all right let's see then if you can handle this one more time okay what's better gForce or Arc Ark no okay again GeForce Ark Ark oh he's going to get it eventually how's it going John we got a lot of space here that's a good attitude I like to hear that and what are you working on we're retesting the XTX cuz everybody keeps complaining about it oh that's a good
idea actually there's a there's a lot of kind of uh redoing that's been going on including adjusting the labs as attitude Antoine here is undergoing a mandatory new training program Antoine we've been through this me we live as a team we die as a team it is amazing how many tax writeoffs you can fit in this bad boy infinite money glitch yeah it all kind of came together I was worried it would be a tough transition but instead it feels like going back to our roots and guys this is
just the beginning we've got all kinds of great content planned for you guys like uh whole human water cooling V2 where we actually mix the chilled liquid with their blood which is going to be really cool oh and my personal favorite the best tech for faking your death and leaving the country uh on that subject hey uh shout out vonic and landfest for Lending us those monitors that uh you can get back if you can find us good luck though cuz the only people we give this address to are the ones that send
