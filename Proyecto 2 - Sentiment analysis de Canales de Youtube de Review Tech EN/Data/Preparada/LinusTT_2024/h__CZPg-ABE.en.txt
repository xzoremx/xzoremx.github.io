to the W show where I have blood on my hands what a criminal according to someone's I think High School teacher I have the blood of people on my hands um and I am personally what is this well well we'll we'll we'll we'll get into it apparently I am like really really really bad though and this got a lot of upvotes on Reddit with people kind of weighing in on on this teacher's take on uh my pedal of tech tips on the internet and other news uh much actually more on topic news telecoms hate her we're
talking of course about lenina KH uh dude click to cancel okay so making it easier for people to cancel subscriptions um trade groups representing the Telecom industry not happy about it we're going to be talking about that what else we got this week Airlines Embrace starlink and it sounds like it's a lot better than what we've had in the past but you know we'll talk about that later Al Squarespace goes private this might not make a lot of sense to be all that interesting but
remember they just bought Google  the show today is brought to you by jump Cloud Fallout 76 and flexispot with our chair partner secret lab our laptop partner LG and our rap partner dbrand why don't we jump right into our title topic today which is of course that lonus is personally hurting children in the Congo um lonus has blood on his hands children in actually uh Dem ratic Republic of the Congo I think is the proper term but sure whatever um work for less than $2 a day so he can sell
you Tech tips it is a requirement if they don't work for $2 a day or less you're actually legally not allowed to give anyone Tech tips don't let Tech influencers sway you into gross consumerism buy less Tech and end the suffering in Congo uh so according to the poster on Reddit um let's see if I can actually find anything from the op here yeah no well anyway uh there's  um you guys can probably hear that short aside Marty from Mighty Car Mods and a bunch of uh his friends are here this
week working on a collab we took ploop car to a completely new level so look forward to that video soon uh that was probably the car like going somewhere and it's not close to us right now it's it's got a cosmetic Muffler is I believe the uh the the term for it cosmetic Muffler anyway uh the point is there there's a lot to unpack here and I'm going to stun everyone including probably my co-host my producer and all of you watching by saying I don't fund mentally [Laughter]
disagree okay but hold on okay hold on so I've actually had this conversation uh internally uh before well not this specific one but in this case it was uh it was more along the lines of um sort of discussing the impact of our business environmentally more more broadly you know uh we we create oh that that's not our product again we create um merch items you know we have things manufactured uh we sell them uh we we burn jet fuel shipping them around the world um we obviously are sometimes we
burn jet fuel shipping ourselves across the world y yeah we do um in cases where realistically we could have found out just as much about the product on a zoom call um instead you know we we we fly somewhere we eat food up in a mile in the air because you know that is where you should eat food instead of eating it in your home harvested somewhere ped somewhere else moved to an airport put in a plane and shipped somewhere else with you to eat and so running running the business that we do uh we oh man we
we build sets right these are these are structures that do not house anybody yeah right we we buy technology and I think this is part of the point that's being made with this slide we buy technology products that contain uh precious materials like Cobalt and lithium um in some cases you know very controversially obtained materials right and don't even use them sometimes we have a warehouse of devices that are sitting not being used you know you could easily look at our business and go
okay well you guys have an enormous carbon footprint you guys have an enormous environmental impact um so I  oh boy I think that was across the front of the building I think so I think that was fairly close I understand where this point is coming from and I actually think it comes from a pretty good place we are a marketing company right we are a a production company um and part of our job is to sell things right fundamentally right I mean we're going to we're going to give you guys a pitch
for our new tech bro vet later on in this very podcast um however I do think that there are degrees to which you can mitigate some of the damage and I do think that singling out me as you know the tech influencer who has blood on his hands uh seems a little misguided given my history of promoting the three Rs of promoting right to repair of of principally standing behind those things that I promote when it comes to things like investments in framework who is legitimately doing real
work to make was not done on a framework laptop oh yeah that's a good point it was done on a Chromebook probably just about the most disposable kind of laptop computer that you can purchase yeah um and so I think that's something that is maybe some Nuance that is missing in this take is that realistically you are going to need cloes you are going to need a computer um if you want to you know not get arrested for being naked everywhere and if you want to have a job you know in the year
2024 yeah a lot of Modern Life is done through Computing and a big part of our job is to make sure that when you buy those clothes they last for a really long time and when you buy that computer it's one that actually suits your needs properly instead of being manufactured e-w there is so much more waste involved in buying something and then it just being a piece of junk that should have never been manufactured in the first place supporting that industry instead of just supporting companies that build
a highquality product that's made to last in the first place which is what we obviously strive to help people find we don't nail everything we are not perfect we are in fact human it turns out but what I would ask then to this uh teacher whatever grade whatever class this is on something English yeah okay this is an English class I don't see how this is particularly on topic but anyway what's going it doesn't matter the point is here's what I would ask um how would you do
it what would your media company do then right like in order for you to provide people advice so that or should they just should they not have a phone and if they do have a phone which do you have a phone how do you decide which one to buy so I think there's particular bits of uh people say the website links to your store I've I've typed in a bunch of times I've never had to go to the store but um I I think it's a someone's saying is it a media literacy thing I think it might be that
I think it might be a display of like a potential form of like propaganda or something I don't think it's necessarily actually legit um but uh so something I've been thinking about though is like I immediately pointed out when this was first linked me and I thought it might have been real um um I immediately pointed out scrap head Wars because like we we started that super early on in the history of the company realistically in in regards to like series that we have  and let's see that does
work um we we started it super super early on in the in the history of our company um and its whole idea was showing you don't have to buy new computer components you can reuse someone else's that they're trying to get rid of right that was like not going to lie I may have just been post Bamboozled  me may have misspelled it and somebody else bought the domain and made it link there that makes way more sense because I I saw this on Reddit before it was in the topics no okay let's get you guys up
to date so the uh the URL in the slide redirects to LTT store.com which would seem to suggest that it's a post but I saw this when it first showed up on Reddit and the op was replying to people no this guy's actually for real okay and it's a typo it's it's a completely different site it's supposed to be like friends ofth con.org yeah yeah so no no no no no this is real it's really okay I thought I thought it was just supposed to cuz like no there was it seems like it should be just like a cuz teachers
did stuff like that when I was in school they would try to like rally you up on something and make an argument about it or whatever else yeah no it actually does not seem to it does not actually seem to be wow that's fantastic um so we we we have specific series scrapyard Wars where we show that you know you don't have to buy new tech to get your foot in the door in regardless to Tech you can even get really high performant good stuff by buying used things we have compensator which shows not only do you
you know not have to buy new tech but also just buying the most expensive stuff is pretty stupid kind of actually just stupid doesn't have a benefit yeah we call a compensator right we're we're we're making fun of it um spending that kind of money just for just for show just to have the most expensive thing um the values on our Channel have always been about finding bang for the buck finding a good value recently you you started just repairing broken things yeah how like and valuable that is
however I'm going to again play Devil's Advocate counters against my own channel why did we make a video on the 115in TV that again I invested heavily in in fuel to be transported all the way from China uh so that I could you know install in my house creating a you know Shrine to a media consumption like it's a whatever right my point is just that people can be influenced in a lot of different ways and even if I say at the end of the video yeah this isn't a great value and
it's not something that I'd recommend for most people um it aspirationally people might watch that and go like oh but I'd like to I'd like to have something like that right so so I think you could make an argument that that I do participate in sort of um maybe not glorifying but but certainly making consumption seem you attractive or  I don't know I think being interested in technology is not inherently like a sin and I think seeing the bounds of it is is entertaining and and interesting and
you could you could see this massive TV like I see that TV and I don't want it like you're not telling people you should want this you should go buy this you're actually showing how complicated and annoying it was to get and things like that I think sometimes it comes down to the messaging um you're not actively recommending that people buy it  like I don't know it's I definitely see how if you're a fitness influencer sure you are automatically going to be you know communicating the
positives of buying stuff are you though yeah what if what if you're a fitness influencer who focuses entirely on Cals darn it I thought about that as you were going into it got him destroyed yeah people like stay flexi are pretty good for that kind of stuff yeah if you're if you're a I don't know gy gym influencer person come on cuz workout equipment is expensive it's really heavy no you're going to have to give me something other than Fitness you got find a different vertical find a different vertical
Automotive I mean we can hear it outside right I think Automotive is actually an  unnecessity of that rather than just accepting things the way that they are what about the people that are in situations where they they cannot do anything other than have a vehicle realistically there is no safe alternative find me a channel that has only ever done that then I I don't think that's out there yeah the the ethical the ethical personal Transportation ownership Channel there is no ethical consumption
under in my opinion effectively any human system so it just is what it is people got to make up for their own make up for themsel what is okay and what isn't okay so basically the person who made this slide did it on a laptop that has a fat battery in it that probably has a bunch of cobalt in it they could have done it on something that didn't involve batteries they could have done it on an overhead projector but they didn't do that so I think in short they almost certainly have a phone I understand
where the teacher is coming from I understand the argument um I understand that you're almost making the so you hate Society why do you participate in it why do you participate in an argument which is no no no no I'm saying that this type of argument doesn't really hold a lot of water for me when that's the case if there are you know there are channels out there there are influencers out there that are very much pushy for consumerism that is a thing I don't think we necessarily are I think we have
certain content that can maybe push the line a little bit sure I think stuff  yeah yeah yeah I can see that can maybe push the line a little bit I don't think it always does though yeah In fairness to us I mean that's more driven by that individual because they pick exactly what they want other than making sure there's one product from the the series sponsor which is AMD right now yeah so like but I think we also balance it out quite well by like you know when a phone comes out we're not like oh my God buy
the new phone it's amazing we're like you know if you have last generation 's phone this is probably not worthy of an upgrade cuz phones aren't moving that fast right now and you're probably fine and we we you know I mean look at look  reviews you're probably fine you a gamer all right put your wallet away you can sit this one out yeah uh yeah I don't know like I don't I don't think that we just push consume consume consume I yeah okay so tell me this one of the things that this made me think of 
Swift yeah so Taylor Taylor gets a lot of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] for her private jet use her jet travel okay yeah yeah yeah and I think that there is I personally I I I I don't fly private um I don't even fly first class I mean come on look at the size of my legs do I need more leg room not really um so you you know I I kind of look at private air travel and I'm like um yeah it doesn't seem great you know the the the sheer amount of fuel consumption also like in in in Taylor's defense can you
imagine Taylor sitting on a normal plane the attacks genuine attacks that she would probably be subject to insane she would probably have to buy like the 10 seat radius around her for her security anyway so hold on hold on hold on hold and then she's just going to get chirped at the whole time what do you mean we're not on a first name basis gal Fray and she just only has a first name Mrs Swift share okay Madonna Taylor she's earned it okay the point is that so so so one
of the arguments that I see often so so I have my own thoughts on private travel I don't feel it's necessary for me in any kind of security way and and I'm not I'm not super keen on it I don't think it's great for the world um however one of the arguments that I see made very often about her is oh my God look at all the private jet travel she's doing and the many tons of CO2 that she creates compared to the average person so we're we're recruiting the swifties to help us against this teacher
no no no that's not that's not my point my point is that's always something that has bothered me because I have an alternate perspective on that if you think about what someone like Taylor Swift is doing in her private jet what is she doing where is she going usually concert like yeah on tour places to have concerts you can actually there's like a Tracker that shows like you know everywhere she flew and and there's obviously some stuff that's a little unnecessary like did she have to
go from overseas to every one of Travis Kel's you know games last playoffs or whatever uh I don't know maybe not you know maybe maybe she could have watched it on TV I don't know bet you would have if you could maybe that was an and that's that's the thing to think about for yourself but that's a separate conversation the point is in where is she going she's probably going on tour and there's a lot of kind of if you look at the the travel patterns there's a lot of kind of like going back and forth to
places uh probably for you know rehearsal this and transport the bandmates and Equipment you know whatever else it is it does a lot of like fing things around and it's wild to me that you can just trag private planes but anyways and so all of that CO2 kind of gets attributed to Taylor Swift and it's like look at this number at the average person but here's an argument  concert do they own a share of those emissions they're paying for her to go there they're they're financially asking
her to do that why the is she there she wouldn't be there if nobody asked her to be there and paid good money for her to be there yeah normies it's your fault no I'm just yeah you're the reason Cen say wanting things so is Taylor respond for all the people who travel to see her in concert exactly yes am I responsible for all the people who buy some phone yeah or some laptop of course not what what what do you mean so let's go me and Taylor you know we're we're we're of a
kind you know you guys are close we're not actually responsible for the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that people do because they I don't know think we're cool a lot more of them think she's cool but I I I was I was just trying to find a link I was just trying to find a link I have one thing in common with Taylor Swift now your last name starts with us that's two dang dang we're getting there now you just need to release a country album uh yeah maybe not you don't you don't want  awful she thinks my processor is sexy
what what are you even reading think my tractor sexy my tractor the song I don't know I don't know the song okay yeah yeah yeah maybe a Christmas album good you have released an album that's true you're both singer [Laughter] songwriters twinsies oh man yeah next time you see her you're just going to be like what up twin man I I think we talked about this on W show before but you remember when the news broke that she was a billionaire and everyone was like oh my God Taylor's a billionaire and I was
like surprised and I was sitting here going like okay has been for a while yeah like b b based on what I know about my own situation and based on the fact that I I am this and Taylor Swift is this like I'm sure yeah uh yeah we're both blonde let's go we're getting there oh man this is turning into to a whole topic what do I have in common with Taylor's how many degrees of separation is lion and Taylor probably like one or two we both got  thighs I'm not saying it's a bad thing
I'm just saying we both got him how do you even know that have you seen the bodysuit she wears and the arrows to her no you can tell how big her thighs are I have not seen the arrows to her yeah   lus is myin dude okay so what what I'm I'm supposed to not notice it looks pretty  thighs she's tall though ah yeah comparison limitations okay come on okay let's move on uh topic number two  you got nothing I have to log back in so I got nothing uh Lena KH sure let's talk about someone who is sexy on the inside
here because dude Lena KH what's happening absolutely based lot is based I do I do agree lot is based just just don't talk about her thighs that's probably not appropriate like we're killing dad I'm Los I'm Los I just anyways Leon is base trade groups representing the Telecom industry are suing to stop the fdc's recently announced click to cancel rule which we all want uh which would require all subscription services to provide a means of cancelling that is at least as easy
as signup the complaint argues that the decision is a form of regulatory uh regulatory overreach that is arbitrary uh capricious and an abuse of discretion in other Amic regulatory news AT&amp;T and T-Mobile have come out against a proposed FCC rule that would that would require carriers to unlock phone 60 days after activation that sounds amazing uh so they can be switched to another carrier that's this is see we're promoting that because it's good for reuse um according to T-Mobile which
locks prepaid pH phones for a year customers would be harmed by no longer having access to free or heavily  sets Okay uh AT&amp;T which locks phones for 6 months says that the move would create upward pressure on handset prices so here Mr High School teacher let me explain to you our position on this matter and how it's actually good for consumption we support this because heavily subsidized technology products encourage gratuitous consumption you're old phone probably works and if the new
phone cost more and by more I don't mean more I mean if it cost the amount it actually cost if you were actually not being expected to do the comp admittedly complicated math of how much is my monthly payment versus how much is my down payment on the device in the first place how much am I paying for it overall right if you actually saw the sticker price of that phone you would be more likely to keep your old one for longer and run on a longer upgrade cycle okay we are supportive of this because
it would expose the true cost of a new handset to the consumer and probably reduce the overall sales of new mobile devices that is a good thing and yeah if you rely on heavily subsidized phones then that's a that's a downer but you can get used ones but here's the thing if you rely on heavily subsidized phones you're still paying for them in the monthly you're paying for them in the monthly so what this will force is it will force the carriers to give you the real cost of the device and then it will
force them to compete on the cost of the monthly service which will ultimately drive your total cost of ownership down this is a good good good good good thing yeah and because I don't actually give two shits if you buy more phones I really don't I will of course support this let's go back to that first point though um trade groups representing the Telecom industry uh are suing to stop the recently announced click to cancel so guys um this is something that if I know there's kind of a big election
going on in our with our Southern neighbors what what is that in like good Lord like 16 days or something like that um if you if you guys have any way maybe want the dust settles a little bit of making your voice heard to your local representative um click to cancel is outstanding and should be supported at every level of government by every citizen there is literally no one who should be who should be supportive of dark patterns and and complicated like like going in person to cancel gym
memberships and stuff like that like dude uh so and basically what click to cancel means is whatever method you use to sign up you can use the same method to cancel it but there's there's like gyms for example that are known for allowing you to sign up online give all your payment details and then if you want to cancel you have to like go in person and do it so they intentionally put these obstacles in the way to make it more difficult for you to cancel and the gyms specifically want that because
uh a lot of people feel shame about canceling a gym membership in person um and a lot of especially like corporate large multilocation franchise gyms have gyms all over the place so if you try to use excuses like oh I'm I'm moving or whatever they'll just be like oh yeah that's no problem we'll just transfer your membership to like the the local gym in that area um so they they they try to do a lot of things to make sure that you feel shame in cancelling your gym membership uh which is which is icky
gross oh apparently I got the election  11th sorry it's the fifth oh my goodness it's 10 days away all right so yeah wow get out there and do your thing my American friends this this is now watch this drive sorry um oh my this is uh this if I remember correctly this year has like one of the highest concentrations of worldwide elections like ever it's kind of crazy yeah I think BC broke records recently um turn people are turning out yeah had a weird one cuz like conservatives haven't been
in power in BC if I remember correctly in like close to 100 years or something yeah but conservative party is a little complicated CH who who it actually is is like yeah well our Liber are oh my god did you see Christy Clark F volunteered herself to run the federal liberals like I could do it nobody wants you to do that get out of here literally nobody I will actually March me too I would I would do it I would as well like imagine imagine okay we have we have Justin Trudeau
very imperfect leader imagine being like  better corruption Queen are you kidding me oh man oh man yeah actually actually worse and I I know I know for for a lot of the people who only see like International headlines or like nonsense that their Uncle posts on Facebook or whatever you probably can imagine anything worse than Justin Trudeau yeah he's he's super imperfect I'll put it that way um there's levels of self-dealing and  acolyte corruption you know that you know that Meme like I'll do it again
feel like she's like but on a national scale dude the you thought I did a lot with a province what about the country uh I should see if I can um I should see if I can find the article because it's so bad uh here we go hold on was this was this CTV News article as he as Justin Trudeau faces growing pressure um oh yeah oh this this is amazing okay this article is so bad uh Clark as BC Premier between blah blah blah blah blah blah blah um who appear Clark who appears on a weekly as a weekly panelist
on ctv's Power Play Oh couldn't help noticing that that's um the publication I'm reading also released a separate statement on X and called for Unity within the party to fight conservative leader her comments come ahead of a highly anticipated Caucus meeting blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah okay emerged etc etc oh wait no is this not the right one yeah what are we looking for hold on oh no I was looking for one that like basically was it basically talked about what she's been
up to since she uh since she retired and no this isn't the one no no no I take it back CTV you're doing good uh go ahead and uh and do your do a quick merch message or something there yeah sure I got a couple for you here already with the oh no hold on you got to explain what it is and do your updates no l can do it all right uh if you go to LTT store.com if you add something to your cart like potentially a tech bro vest that we will talk about a little bit later you go and view the
cart in the cart you'll be able to see this merch messages box if you check the box saying I would like my purchase to appear as a merch message on the LTT stream it's called stream not wow because it's for the various streams that we do you can go in here and leave a message for the show at which point it will be curated by uh by Dan to either be responded to by Dan as you'll probably see down here um as a response to to this one uh or if you say super bad things that aren't allowed to show
up on stream because you included bad words we'll ye it or it'll be curated by Dan for for lonus or myself to answer sure let's see is that normally what he says something like that I think he's a little worse at it but okay I'm listening oh crap he's still here um let's see with the mention of the chair partner laptop partner and dbrand and Pia during dark the number of ads in when show technically doubled do you have an internal limit or policy on how much is too  much uh I don't think we technically do
I think over the course of a show that often goes for like four hours I think a very small amount of mentions at the beginning of the show and then three not very long mentions in the middle of the  agree with this merch message too many sponsor uh someone said in flow play chat um it when people consider the merch messages section at the end of the show to be a sponsor section then I can understand that um I also have have heard some people's comments about the banner at
the bottom being too busy and I think I can sometimes maybe agree but these types of things take tuning we'll figure it out yeah yeah I'd say so uh what else I got maybe there's something here for  one all right one moment I know I got one here for Luke um hey when my favorite flavor of dll pickles question for L hold on I've got it uhoh um never mind you L you get nothing yeah okay this is this is crazy okay here we go here we go so cbc.ca GH Clark's political history
Clark has been taking French lessons for several months according to a source close to her that's not a political history that's pandering nonsense the former Premier has already made two trips to the se de jier in Quebec and plans to return there in the coming months to improve her French skills okay that's just the same thing that you just said okay here we go she has launched a Tik Tok account in the last month what are you are you going to like are you going to get to this at some point
that's good I I want my you know or is this just going to be puffery a word that we all learned recently I want my prime minister to have a Tik Tok account if they don't I'm not voting for in the most recent post she encouraged British Colombians to vote okay where are we going to get to the history every politician on the planet has done that ah yes during her six years as Premier she built a reputation as an environmentally conscious fiscally prudent liberal wait how do you Champion
the Mining and oil Industries while being environmentally conscious okay sure she resigned in 2017 she resigned nothing she got booted the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out it was a historical defeat historical sorry let's continue she resigned in 2017 when her minority government was defeated by an NDP confidence motion no no no no no no no what happened was We the People sent you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] packing is what happened sorry sorry sorry um the new Democrats then took over the provin province with the
support of the green party her departure from politics left the BC Liberal Party in disarray no no no no no no no no no no no again the party died her leadership left the party in disarray unable to win an election that's what actually happened to the point where it it died yes like it it it it's it's gone in April 2023 it officially rebranded and became BC United until it dissolved all together on the eve of the most recent election campaign yeah like they weren't a part of this election oh man
uh okay anyway during the conservative leadership for okay she's a regular Federal politics commentator on several English language net uh television and radio networks including CTV CBC and Global she also works as a guest speaker across Canada that right there is all you need to know about how someone's career ended in politics you went from leading one of the you know major regions of a country to being a guest speaker on like ancient Legacy Media nonsense she has a Tik Tok good yeah which she just
launched please anyway so um yeah cool merch message by the way I'm going to take these off they were kind of for my my look with the tech bro vest but they're prescription and my eyes are tired now yeah yeah yeah all right hit me um I've got a new baby and cargo Pockets have come in clutch excited to try the pants at what age did you let your kids start using screens also thoughts on all the smart baby devices out there uh I let them start pretty young because I like to sleep in um we
were a lot more controlling about what kind of content they watched in the early days now we've relaxed things a little bit so they they allocate screen time they're older now though yes but I just mean from the first to the third we just we we just were like we can't yeah um but we we allocate screen time based on time they spend doing other things so if they practice piano for uh 20 minutes then they can earn 20 minutes of screen time question for you yes do you ever worry about having things like screen
time be a reward Vector creating an un kind of an unnatural sort of um desire for it and almost making it more addtive when they no longer have the parental rules and they move out then you know do you ever worry about so that's yvon's Ivonne worries about that more than I do because she was a TV on all the time household the TV was like the fireplace in their household it was just always on it was the it was the the light and sound that you know was just in the living room that people kind of gathered
around and she had and has no problem like sitting and doing homework in front of the TV while while a show is on um and Meanwhile my family was the polar opposite screens could not even be turned on until after dinner time and even then the time allocation to them was was tightly controlled and in both cases households that have gone her way and households that have gone my way I've seen Kids come out of those same households both ways yeah so I don't know is what it is it might just kind of
be what it is some people have a very addictive personality some people don't um I think generally philosophically um I am in favor of building good habits yeah and uh building the habit of doing something productive with your time rather than you know vegetating at every possible opportunity I feel like it makes sense I was just wondering like yeah like had it been thought about but something that Ivon and I have talked about and actually have done I think a couple times is having um like structure
holidays so you just you have okay we're we're off this week and uh you know it's it's we're on vacation and you can have as much screen time as you want you could stare at your computer your phone your laptop whatever the TV we don't care um get it out of your system for a bit and then you know when we're back to school next week it's it's back to the  there's already I was a screen on kid and now I'm chronically online yeah there you go yeah but I mean he made a career out of it he's got
"100,000 subscribers on his channel oh" really yeah you didn't know that no yeah already has a channel that's pretty sick um what was I going to say I think the the incredibly hyper addictive nature of things like Tik Tok is a little bit different of an arena than the on okay Instagram YouTube Shorts Facebook YouTube shorts um the one watch it watched too much YouTube for a bit not shorts he was mostly into like Minecraft Let's Plays and stuff like that yeah um but we've we've talked to him about that
recently we've kind of cut down on that um so those some of those like hyper addictive like Doom scrolly ones we basically are like no yeah but yeah at some point they're going to have to figure it out you're right it's weird it's it's that's the when talking about kids right now there's like I mean there's all those conversations around Coco melon and how just like bra brain destroying Coco melon is is cocomelon bad I I don't even know COC Melon really as far as my understanding it goes COC melon is
specifically designed to just crank screen time oh and it's like actually very brain Rotty for kids oh interesting I don't know much about it my kids I think missed the Coco melon window I don't want to say too much stuff cuz I I'm not I don't have a kids I'm not super well read up on this but yeah people are saying Bluey good as as far as my understanding goes blue is pretty good there's that teacher that former teacher yeah yeah she's supposed to be really good Miss Rachel or
whatever she's supposed to be really good Coco melon apparently there's like measured decreases in like development from COC yeah oh wow okay it's really bad yeah but again I don't don't don't take my word on that I'm not super well read up on this I just I've dude I came across an interesting topic to I came across another like family Vlog Channel L that's like exploding they're doing like 300 400 million views a month or something like that and it's pretty much all shorts of these two little girls
like acting out skits like you know uh there's one where she rides a scooter in the house and like pretends to fall over and it's like Don't Ride Scooters in the house and it's supposed to be like a good lesson or whatever but I'm just I'm just looking at it going like okay how much are these kids getting paid like family vlogging is actually a terrible terrible thing and needs to go away like immediately like legislatively yeah yeah yeah I just make my kids only watch LT sure oh boy oh man
okay oh we have some announcements well let's do some announcements shall we LTT store.com secret shopper is now live whoa right now on float plan hold on the general audience will get it next week but let's watch a bit of the intro I love this thumbnail that is pretty great audio yeah did you know that they make them with just the glasses and the mustache that's my real nose see look I guarantee you can't tell the difference oh my goodness me wearing a fake big nose really does feel unnecessary
though is that working I can't hear anything wait you've got audio playing that's the whole video are we am I supposed to be playing the whole video yeah what I thought it was supposed to be a clip yeah what am I supposed to be doing here Dan what's going on I don't know I don't write this let's watch a bit of the says okay sure yeah we can watch a bit of the intro sure okay is it working yeah I want audio we need audio oh oh I have other stuff playing well there's your problem right there
yeah all right I got it I got it I got you I'm picking up what you're throwing down Mr Dan okay we good I think so okay guys this this was one of the biggest risks I think we've ever taken and I I understand I understand how you could look at the premise and think oh they shopped at their own store they're just going to make sure it goes well but as you're about to see we intentionally built this in a way that forced us to be held accountable regardless of the  comes we can't hear it because we have
to do series and have all their worst problems brought to light but after today I won't have to imagine it and neither will Nick because I paid five of you to secret shop our store and I'm sitting with the Creator Warehouse head of product Nick light to enjoy the results firsthand Nick looks genuinely uncomfortable oh Nick I say he didn't know really all he knew was that he was going to help co-host a video so he sat down he found out when I said that holy crap you know how much I value genuine
genuine reactions on camera you know the lengths that I will go to the the number of times that people are like fake fake fake you're just actually [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] idiots like I care so much about capturing real reactions we're in our mid-30s I've known Nick since we were in grade eight he was very uncomfortable oh yeah oh yeah oh man enjoy because I got a sneak peek and it's not all sunshine and rainbows unlike this segue to our sponsor this is a star did it not go I'm so incredibly curious now I'm almost
like annoyed that we have to keep doing W show I want to go watch it well there is one way to do so you will just have to subscribe to float plane dude don't be upset this is float plane you should be I want to go watch it right now I know I know lm. g/ flat plane while you're there you can pick up an FP exclusive dinosur shirt uhhuh designed by the one by the way it's a little bit confusing cuz when you go through our our t-shirt section all of the shirts are depicted with their front
and then this one is depicted with the back so the float plane logo is on the front the dinosaur plane thing designed by the one and only Sarah but all right which I think was the right choice it's just confusing there's a couple of other quick things for us to announce uh we have a correction in our video on buying every Tech ad we saw for a month we demonstrated one product the birdie personal CO2 alarm incorrectly specifically the wall mount was not installed and it doesn't work unless
it's attached to the wall mount so we removed that section from the original video to avoid misrepresenting the product we have reconducted our original test with the wall mount attached and released a YouTube short showing it activating it's still um a product that you probably shouldn't buy because it's $200 for a CO2 detector it doesn't have any kind of like screen on it or logging or anything um it doesn't detect any other potentially harmful uh gases uh there's like way
better value options that are way more effective and and do yeah work way better but anyway um yeah it it definitely does what it says it does so yeah good for them uh okay oh also it's folding month folding month begins November 1st and the lmg community is once again participating if you'd like to sign up there's a post with information on the Forum which Dan is going to post for you guys in all the various chats as a company we're also contributing $200 LT store gift cards
for prizes signups close next Monday so please join the team finally let's talk about AI crypto and biohacking yeah does it does it look like we want to talk about those things it should because we're wearing the new tech bro vest from LT store something something Dogecoin it's insulated with the same 3D down that you would find on our old 3D down jacket meaning that it is surprisingly warm for how light the vest actually is it's also made of a water resistant material and has a soft tricot knit back
which is quite comfy and it's designed to be able to be worn in the office over a button-up or pulse po like many Tech Bros do so you can dress it down casually you can lay it on top of a t-shirt hoodie or sweater it's totally up to you it is kind of outer wear though because of you know the material it's made of the same w at 4:30 a.m. made of the same stuff as our 3D down jacket thank you for that um and like most of our outerwear it's loaded with YKK zippered Pockets so you can always
have your Essentials on hand task base AI is the future available now at lm. g/ bro so here's Nate actually wears one of these vests every day so this was like the most appropriate possible model for us to have here it looks quite natural actually  airpods oh just okay I'm sorry knowing Nate this picture is way funnier than if you don't know Nate uh he's working on an Electronics engineering project for us that um is very very exciting and he 100% wears a vest and uh 100% would look
exactly like that um anyway oh my God they definitely picked they definitely picked the best people to model this there's Sean from the INF for team dude right though yeah it's the tech bro vest H the reason it's not cheap is because it's like really nice 3D down it's it's basically our 3D down jacket without a sleeves without the sleeves yeah so there you go nothing says disruptive innovation like the tech bro vest oh my God okay the the team working on the copy has actually gotten really really
funny over the last little bit I love it nice nice got the off-site lap talk bag airpods that's what a guy whose company was just reviewed looks like yeah all right cool all right what else we what else we got going on Dan what are we doing I think do a topic let's do a topic shall we Nvidia to ship one billion risk five cores this year Nvidia gave a keynote speech at the risk Summit with the speaker estimating that the company expects to ship about a billion risk 5 cores across its gpus CPUs s so and
other products slides of the talk were shared on Twitter by Nick Brown senior research fellow at University of edinburgh's EPCC super Computing Center the company has been switching from its proprietary microcontrollers to ones that are built on the open- source Isa since at least 2015 and have now revealed that they have fully phased out their former falcon microcontrol ER in favor of custom risk 5 cores sick all told there are 10 to 40 of the cores on every Nvidia chip depending on the
Chip's complexity the company has developed at least three risk 5 microcontroller cores and more than 20 custom risk 5 extensions Nvidia gpus have apparently had risk 5 GPU system processors since touring really I didn't know that this is super cool is cool because Nvidia has talked a lot about all of the you know the monitoring that they do and the load balancing and all all the all the cool stuff that they're doing on their GPU dies but they haven't said that they're using risk 5 at least
not way back then I didn't know I didn't know risk five somebody knew risk five is freaking everywhere yeah it's really exciting and especially if you look at the uh at the way that the relationship between arm and at least one of their partners going right now dude it is it is not a good time for arm to show any kind of any kind of weakness it's a good time for arm to be super super magnanimous and easy to work with because risk 5 has no licensing fees no licensing fees I'm excited I am really excited
about a risk 5 future I've still I've still been dailying my uh my Snapdragon Windows laptop ever since the challenge ended I just I don't know but they they took the AMD framework that I built on short circuit uh because they needed it for something and then they like apparently needed it for something for a while so I've just been using my Snapdragon and I have the occasional issue with it but overall I'm I'm blown away at how usable it is and seeing seeing translation layers work to run
programs and seeing the kinds of Investments that major companies like Nvidia are making into risk 5 and making it better making it viable I'm pretty hopeful risk it's a good sign yeah having a big company behind a project like that um can sometimes be scary but often gives it gives it long-term legs that just being open- sourcy doesn't even though I'm saying that about a project that has existed for a very long time you like need industry consortiums to kind of get together and say okay
okay this is open source and like it's super cool but how are we going to how are we going to push it Forward yeah you need cooperation yeah that's good is gr space going private sure why don't you talk about that Pera perra something a private Equity Firm has purchased all available common stock for Squarespace meaning that Squarespace is no longer a publicly traded company Squarespace went public three years ago in 2021 and yo-yo a fair amount after that it reached a market cap of 8
billion two billion less than the company's Peak private valuation in 2022 its market cap fell off a cliff hitting $2 billion which while still a lot of money is significantly less than 10 uh before gradually returning to $5 billion profess which again is quite a swing $3 billion is kind of a lot uh and then uh premier's purchase is worth a combined total of $7.2 billion likely indicating a degree of confidence that this rebound wasn't accidental uh it's unclear what if anything will change for Squarespace
clients and my dyslexia read that as SpongeBob at first um our discussion question is I have no idea what lonus was going for when he sent this story does this affect our company somehow well Squarespace has been one of our longest running partners are they no not quite close to the longest but not the longest yeah they they go way back with LT and I guess all I'm trying to  Premier please don't screw it up okay you've also got a lot on your hands now because of the whole domains
thing yeah there's a lot of people that scrambled to leave when domains went from Google domains to Squarespace and then now there's a lot of people scrambling to leave that domains are going from Squarespace to Squarespace still but public to private um people are looking for Alternatives it's a thing yeah so um you know just don't bung it up please yeah we like working with Squarespace we like using the product let a good thing be a good thing why don't you be why don't you be the
smart private Equity Firm uh C Catos or cat talk oh I think I just realized that cat has another te in it I don't think I ever registered that before but okay um a lot of people can't go to cloudflare because cloudflare doesn't actually support that many domains like cloudflare doesn't support doca oh okay yeah that's a problem for Canadians yeah so we can't just have cloudflare right so we have to use something else and previously we did use Google domains right and now obviously we don't and we
don't use square space domains either oh we used like GoDaddy way back in the day well you did yeah I know we don't use it at all anymore yeah no I know oh man I don't remember the name off top of my head what's the do you know the name Dan of the new thing we use forc domains I don't whatever danrick said it was  racing she was pretty good oh you know what speaking of Lady race drivers you know who I would love to see uh tackle that unless unless she's already done it
and I missed it I'd love to see Michelle ki do it just no I don't know I don't believe you it started with it was like gra or  now what are you talking about what are you guys even trying to figure out right now the domain uh thing oh yeah the domain thing what are you guys even talking about the regist we use a different regist now well yeah but we're not going to like tell people what we use anyway are we I mean we tell people that we use cloud flare for like almost everything which is way bigger Honeypot
than this would be that's not what a Honeypot is okay fair got him could be Hy okay why don't we just KN I don't think we found it I can knot if you want but it's also like pretty easy to figure out yeah that's fine I just mean why are we drawing attention to this fair enough you know better it's it's fine oh my God Luc is now the security risk sure oh dude dude the Hat has been transferred I put the vest on I immediately became a security RK I'm to get out of this stuck short  okay oh
no what oh thanks now I don't have now I don't have to look it up I appreciate  nothing you can't have inside jokes on a podcast you guys a AJ just said it full  oh man all right the show is brought to you by jump Cloud I know it's yeah someone's like it's public info I know it is you can just look it up I just mean we I just mean normally we just don't talk about it at all we just don't bring it up maybe maybe we need jump Cloud to help with our it we don't know what we're
doing yes you can who is a domain I know I just oh my God logus isn't wrong he's not wrong it's just it's just very funny do we have to use multiple cuz some of them don't have like Canadian domains I don't even know you know what no no forget it no I'm no I'm I'm just going to make it worse you know you could probably you could probably figure out what data center were hosted in pretty easily I mean we've said that a bunch of times too you can also yeah we but we go out of our way not to talk about it that
much that is true and I don't say all of them there now you're basically just asking them to figure it out yeah yeah see yeah you like this yeah now now  coin oh apparently AJ's stream was  yet all right I don't actually really believe him because our stream delay is really short but yeah well he might have been no he might have been rewound nope okay it's not on Flo plan no no DVR oh yeah but he might have the player open in the chat and yeah he has that technology he's pretty smart AJ yeah
yeah yeah yep when it comes to security  18643 what is this external ip2 Avenue  one pops up all right that's me and uh that's what I would look like if I joined Scooby in the gang uh but if who you're going to call is Jump Cloud you'll get your own it Ghostbuster Squad zapping problems before they even appear jump cloud is an open directory platform that centralizes your entire Tech stack from user identities to device management access imagine managing Windows Apple Linux and Android devices

the meta there's like there's so much there's so much depth to it mmax the death out of everything and I'm just I'm just kind of like if I don't if I don't have like 25 hours to noif it in the first week or two realistically I think I'm always just going to feel kind of behind um and I'm just I don't have time I mean it is a PVE game sure so like but I don't have a crew to carry me you could let's do some P what do you mean I could I mean I hav played like months I could carry you I'm sure
wow wow Chad move here we also have a bunch of people at the office that play I'm sure we could like pull people out of the wood yeah but if I'm going to if I'm going to like pull people to game at night we're going to like left for dead yeah exactly or play tape to tape yeah we'll play something that tape cocky much it's not that it's just like the G not actually really like that hard I'm I'm not trying to like flame people Jo and I the game's not actually hard I'm not trying to Flame people really do
go on Joe and I used to do the hardest difficulty as a Duo instead of a four stack and it was fine but I'm not trying to Flame anybody this guy's a gamer wow the game's super easy if you're bad actual skill issue if only he was as good at Super checks as he is at Hell divers too wow literally stopped playing cuz he was tired of getting his monkey spanked that's not true  spank oh my goodness who's yeah who why why why are we playing you okay so I have to do bird meds tonight yeah but
then afterwards you invited me to play pool yeah let's play pool since we we is it the vest what no I caught a pool table why yeah why are you going to move super checks there I was thinking that yeah yeah just move it to smash CHS nobody uses it here yeah yeah yeah so we'll just have super checks I was think I want to get a pinball machine dude what a flipping Rabbit Hole pinball machines they can they can cost as much as a new car if it's like the like a good one it's like the Pirates of the
Caribbean you know special edition or whatever or they can be like flipping cheap they can be like just a couple Grand even though they're like supposedly fully functional there's all kinds of modifications people will do on them they'll put like you know more transparent glass on them and they'll they'll do all kinds of like mods and stuff and like ex expand the sound effects and make it play different music there's like the the depth of pinball machines I'm looking at it going like I
would need a consultant before I would be able to confidently buy a pinball machine buy a Stern one yeah but I don't want it to depreciate three grand the second I bring it home like I I'd want to like pick a like a good one or something like I don't know I used Stern  wild what ice weasel weasel says lonus jumping into other Hobbies than complaining about how people who love their Hobbies pay more for stuff they want is hilarious that's not what I'm even talking about not even remotely what I'm talking
about I'm talking about how it's a rabbit hole what a crazy take and it's something that I don't I don't understand well I don't know what the value of the different things is and it seems like I couldn't possibly hope to why is Pirates of the Caribbean worth more than Captain America I don't know yo there's I have no idea there's a "$116,000 Adams Family pinball machine" yeah dude I didn't even I didn't even look at brand new like I I was just looking at this this is refurbished this
is 1992 refurbished the pinball company okay I wasn't even looking at retailers so there's uh I want to say pin heads or something like that there's like a community that has a buy sell trade and then I was looking at Facebook Marketplace as well and just the range "like they go from two grand to $20,000" and these are secondhand machines so they're all secondhand and like they everyone will list like how many hours it has on it or whatever but I don't know if there's a way to fake that like we found out
during the Mighty Car Mods video that um ploofs um pl's car had been odometer swapped oh really yeah so it had like markings from an auto wrecker on it once they pulled it out that were like low kilometers didn't come from that car that sure as heck wasn't written on at the factory so like I don't know can you  know freaking no one makes them anym they're all vintage no that's not true that's totally not true Stern I've said it like a bunch of times yeah you can definitely still buy brand new machines
but I'm not really like a brand new machine kind of guy you know like I bought a used super checks machine because I know that I can turn around and like and that I kind of I at least like played the game and there's only like a couple of variants so I was able to I read like this 400 page uh super checks owners owner thread on uh like some pinball Forum of some of some kind some arcade game forum so like I'm I'm I'm pretty versed in that but there's like four variants of the game
Pinball it's endless and they've been around since like the 80s or whatever so they can be like I'm you know there's like a I'm sure there's like a valley of vintageness you know like if they're like old they're just old but if they're really old they're vintage especially if they're still working I I I'm just saying I don't understand it um but I I yeah I just I want one for the lounge basically for the for the members Lounge  yeah okay let's see hey wple I was eyeing those cargo pants but as an extra
short boy 24 inseam I had to hold off oh Pinball's apparently much older than the 80s okay well there you go shows you what I know ancient cool couple questions are they hamable are there plans for a short version how are the sales uh Unfortunately they are not easily Hemm and right now we don't have plans for a shorter inseam sales have been pretty solid though I think this is our first really successful pant oh yeah I think you like shorts oh shorts no no no no yeah no no no smaller  um oh sorry yep good
cool someone didn't save a file to the server and it screwed things up like it always does never save a file to your local machine didn't you fix that uh no I fixed a different issue I fixed an issue where a file was deleted off of the server over a week ago and we had to recover it ooh from a cloud ooh we got it good job nice bad nice scary good job guys may I ask what the file was um it was  exclusive what was it uh denoised version and was it like the whole folder I think it was a folder with a whole
bunch of the Deno stuff I have no idea I'm not super up on all of the different types of working copies that we have we got it yeah okay great cuz we only have 3 days of onsite replication so it gets really messed up got it uh okay so we did that one last one I got for you he D.W could we get a feature to buy items not in stock there is always an item out of stock when I want to order rather wait a long time than to pay postage  sorry Inventory management is really hard and I could go on a really really
really long thing about why that would make it way harder um but I think it's pretty boring for everyone else the short answer is no it's really hard um and the odds that some other item would accidentally go out of stock while we got the other item in stock uh would be really high and it would mean that we'd have all these orders like cued that we would either take your money for and then um what wait when did we deliver it did the order get placed now or is it when we've fulfilled it and then the
return window tracking and then the accounting complication of when the order was actually placed is that when the money came or is that when we ordered the thing and we sent it out there's it actually does add a lot of complication and we're just not going to do that uh what we are going to do is we're going to manage our inventory better so that the site isn't like half out of stock it ghost down that's what focused on how often do you have how often do you have reviews that say
they're going to purchase 5 to 10 more of the thing that they I don't know but what is that for oh only the best thing in the world oh jeez yes yes yes we're going to make more five to 10 is not enough I want to buy 5 to 10 more can you sell them in like 20 packs they don't they don't exist can I have bulk bulk packs I would buy them in bulk especially if they're not going to be uh have any printing on them wow these are getting really good reviews all right well I'm just I'm just glad you
guys like them all right the tall shirts so good as far as mying goes they are currently Perfect reviews thank you don't don't tempt them we love you that's true I still remember when I had that video that had zero dislikes for like years and then I mentioned on W show it just got bombed yeah it's like you buts that's what happens and these are the guys that like us yeah H questionable there's there's people that hate watch this is this is actually something I have encountered like I I have encountered
that are like this long about how awful I am and how you're barely more tolerable than me it as well they'll be referring to something that we talk about like three and a half hours into like some Marathon ass W show and with all the context of like everything we said before it and I'm sitting here going you know you can change the channel it's an option we do have the technology oh man oh man all right all right what are we even supposed to be doing Dan I we got a few more topics
we only got about dud this week 45 minutes left this week has been insane okay I didn't even realize I didn't even realize when I sat down to do W show today how insane this week had been I was sitting here going like oh man I'm really tired this week like I'm kind of glad it's going to be a bit of a shorter show CU I I just like I don't have the energy for it and I was like man what what did we get up to this week like yeah there's the Mighty Car Mods shoot we had uh we had like a I don't know a
bunch of other shoots I reviewed a lot of scripts and videos and like dude I went to equinix equinix yeah what's that so they build themselves as the biggest tech company nobody ever heard of which you've heard that line you've heard that line before right yeah they may actually be right they might actually be the ones yeah I know of Equinox not equinex how  it uh here e q UI NX n iix okay yeah data center company and Enterprise Network Technologies no I this you would
think this would be something that I've heard of you would think so but these guys operate at a completely different level they don't give two flying leading companies choose Google Cloud azour AWS Netflix Zoom okay they give two flying boogers float plane okay we we are we are just a sh stain on the back of their heel because they walked through the I don't know bougie park next to their Penthouse they live in like we we don't matter to these guys um wow I mean I shouldn't say that because they did
sponsor the video and uh so it's so we did a tour dude um this place was flipping wild um and the reason the reason they actually showed up on my radar was because I found out that they were planning to use the deep lake cooling system in Lake Ontario to cool a data center sick and I was like that's neat I don't know who these guys are but let's go let's get in touch look at the partner list uh y okay okay okay oh boy AB absolutely is there a large technology company in the
Fortune 500 well absolutely all of them chatted out chatted out partner list and what was cool about it was they went full open kimono like they literally they literally showed me a room that if I walked any further into it and was caught on the motion sensors and cameras there would be there would have to be a report to the SEC that someone was in the room but you're allowed to like look into I was allowed to look into the room we got a shot we got a shot of the room that's pretty cool okay you know how
when we do tours of factories and facilities and stuff there's always like no no filming signs everywhere right yeah they didn't have a single one you know why because nobody would be [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in there if they had a camera that's one way to do it they built this building custom okay they built it so the foundation was feet above ground level you know why flooding because the city wouldn't let them put ballards and truck Stoppers around it because they're unattractive so they made it built it on
a platform so if you ram the building  Foundation okay that's that is a solution custom building that's the way they did it these guys are absolutely insane okay so on the roof on the roof okay so you know the speed of light right it's as fast as stuff can go but the speed of light's not fixed okay Logitech demoed this years ago when they showed their light speeed wireless dongle actually outperforming a cable because the speed of light through an optical fiber or any medium through through any medium is
variable so through an optical fiber we we approximate that the speed of light is about 2/3 of the speed of light in a vacuum but in air it's very close to the speed of light in a vacuum it's like9 97 or something I I can't remember what it is the point is it's it's a lot more than 2/3 so get this on the roof they have microwave dishes that are pointed at the TSX and toward New York Toronto Stock Exchange where the other where the other oh yeah sorry where where there are
other exchanges so that they have the lowest possible latency link because light through a fiber optic cable is not fast enough that's pretty wild dude I saw a cage there that not only had all four sides closed not only had visibility block lockers installed in the cage not only had the fifth ceiling chain link installed on the top okay because cuz some companies will have regulations for particular data or particular operations that you have to have six sides essentially on the cage that can contain
not only did it have all of that it had touch sensors in the chain link oh if you so much as Le the chain if you so much as lean on their cage the head of security for equinix gets a call and that will not be a good call no that's so sick dude this place was wild and they showed us everything absolutely everything nothing that they were not legally allowed to show us they showed us everything equinex nothing from their customers that they weren't allowed to show us but like they had
they had an empty cage so I was able to go in and like show how the cold AIS and hot aisle separation works and like I held a temperature sensor and you could see it like open up the thing and like d pull on me so we were able to do really cool demos because they really did let us in um it's going to be probably one of the coolest videos we have ever done do not miss it this is like no actually for real a data center like like of the highest of the highest tier like your
bank and your ISP and the cloud services that you use hey your bank has that this is where they are that old Windows 98 system sitting in the corner so the room the room that you have to file an SEC report passw are stored if anyone so much as goes into it and approaches the rack any guesses as to what's in there the SEC is involved so you know it has to do with exchanges and trading I I'll tell you that much I'm not even going to know like the the names of different things but I'm
assuming it's the trading computers nope no computers no computer there's no computers cuz cuz they would all have their own cages they would have their own least space and everything they would yeah they'd be caged off wait I thought you this was did I miss something I thought this was no it's a room oh okay it's a room it's just there's a room on the floor and there's no computers in the room no there's they don't need computers in there they don't need any computers for that what I have
no idea at a data center a room with no computers that if anyone goes into the SEC has to be told records of some kind no no no record networking would you not consider that computers kind of no gear though yeah no gear what spools of fiber optic cable and the SEC has to be oh the uh the I've heard of this it's the one that keeps all of the trading platforms fair so you can't have shorter links everybody has to have the same length of cable I saw um a video of somebody had one in their
building and it was this giant spool and it goes from the switch to like another switch and it's just 30 kilometers of so someone's office you can't away they would have less spools in their room cuz like Nan seconds matter in trading oh that's sick I'm so excited for this fig out like the furthest you could be and then everyone has to have that much that length of a fiber optic link oh man Isn't that cool that's I feel like I've heard of this before but just completely forgot someone said Tom Scott made a
video on this I probably watched that it's probably old and I probably forgot about it since then that's wild yeah very cool so these aren't like kilometer long spools here these are just uh to uh for fairness within this data center floor okay so different companies that are using this data center and then they have they have to like that service that equinex offers for the like the fair linkage and that's something that like from a regulatory standpoint they they have to subscribe to yeah then Equinox
themselves probably have a bigger one that also does the building I'm assuming uh probably yeah yeah um actually I don't know because it's going to depend on the setup like it's going to depend what partners are in there and and what what they yeah I'm just making an assumption yeah but yeah no uh yeah oh dude this place and and I haven't even I I haven't given away the whole video like this place is flipping wild and I was uh I was joking with them I was like yeah so when we did the Intel Fab tour
uh they kind of quipped to me that the last person they could remember giving this level of access to was then President Barack Obama Obama and um and I was I just I I I told the anecdote because I kind of wanted to see their reaction and they were kind of like I don't I can't think of anyone we we've ever done this with because remember they're not just showing me around a little bit like they had an entire Entourage there with us they had like their head of oh man I'm going to
get this wrong his title's like head of what's up Jimmy so now you have one thing come with Obama nice me Obama and Taylor Swift We like birds of a feather you know yeah um okay sorry what was I going to say um right so so they didn't just like show us around we had oh right his title he was like the head of like Global architecture Solutions or something like that but in Canada so he was like like the Canadian head of it but like globally so like any any canadi Ian based multinational he like deals with so
essentially he's like a global architecture lead guy but like Canadian based or something like that for equinix yeah for equinix yeah so they had they had him there they had um they had a bun they had as far as I could tell head of security like I don't know if that was for the country or just like at all uh but he was like he looked like a head of security just and super smart he the guy just like knew everything off the top of his head like every customer like everything
guy was chatted out it might have just been for that Center but I I don't know but they had the head security there um dude these guys were these guys were these guys were crazy um so they they not only like showed us around or whatever but they were there to answer basically any question we had I asked how much how much the how much uh loading per square foot each floor was designed for I wasn't expecting them to give me that that is like a that's a speck of their building design
like did they just know it and they they they knew approximately offhand and then found out and like told me I was like okay there's six feet of concrete between every floor the place was crazy dude you wouldn't believe the conduit runs it's a thing of beauty it's a thing of beauty you know you're a nerd when you I I enjoy that as well just to be clear but you know you're a nerd when you get excited about the conduit runs but they uh but yeah so and and we were in there
filming everything right like they were like yeah I just don't think we've ever done this okay cool and they might have at some point maybe maybe you know whoever I was talking to didn't remember whatever are you worried about uh like revisions to the video because they noticed something or whatever no because um a lot of their building is designed to be Security First so because they're going to have third party people visiting their own cages or whatever else it's designed so that they can't
see or touch or do anything they're not supposed to do so everything that equinix showed us was equinix stuff and everybody who approved that was literally standing there in our group as we went around so it was one of those it was one of those situations where like it was a sponsored video but like I have done it anyway like 100% And they didn't even I think the only couple of things asked for in the because I went through the script with them the only like they asked for a couple of things um I I said
they operate over 250 data centers worldwide and they were like okay we understand 250 is a kind of nicer rounder sounding number we understand why you did that but can you say over 260 I was like okay right who cares right like I'm not gonna I'm not going to dig in my heels they already doing the specifics while you're live Minor Details like that I just I just mean like they didn't they didn't ask me to change my voice mys which guess isine because realistically I was just nerding out the whole time
anyway and there was stuff that I left out that they mentioned like they had a lot of the initial briefing was about the like environmental impact stuff that they work on and and initiatives like that and I was like I I basically left out all of it because at the end of the day it's already going to be over a 20-minute video just so you know we just released two videos on processors that are really power efficient people cared a lot yeah yeah and and so I I I get I get that you know when
people go on equinix's website you know that's needs to be the first thing that they see and I understand the importance of that stuff they do seem to legitimately put a ton of very real work into being a more sustainable company which is great but it isn't why people tuned into this video doesn't get a lot of views it's and and I need to be focused on what people clicked this video to see you know and uh and so I I I took a lot of that stuff out and they were like okay you know we we want we we
want to let you be the expert they suggested a bunch of like titles and thumbnails and I like we're geared up to have the talk you know because brand suggestions for that stuff they're never good they're usually terrible and I started talking and they were like just do whatever L gets lots of views and I was like okay sweet I will nice so yeah they just immediately back down we're like yeah no I mean you're here because like that's what you do and we're doing this because this is
what we do uh so yeah you do you think that's pretty sick yeah no dude I uh I don't know I I told the I told the business team that basically I don't I don't travel anymore you know if a brand asks hey how much of a bag of money does it take to get lonus to to travel anymore and I just say no right but what I will travel for is something I like would have done anyway I if if it's something that like ticks off something on my bucket list I'll I'll get on the plane it's like and I know I I probably
sound a little spoiled right now but the reality of it is that I spent a lot of years traveling way too much uh it was hard on my body uh it was hard on my family and um the the reduction in travel because of covid really opened my eyes to and not just mine because I've always felt like couldn't this just be a conference call you know like I've always had that mindset but I think it opened a lot of people's eyes to how much of what we do in person could just be done remotely and um forced people to
work around that nobody was really traveling and my whole thing has been like okay well why don't I just keep it that way um so I I still do travel a little bit I mean I did computex I did CES this year I'm going to do CES I'll do computex again um you know obviously I you know I I did the Micron a facility tour but wouldn't you go to Micron yes exactly why yeah but I I want to go everywhere um that's true why are you really going to computex though if we're being real to play badminton yes
yeah but I'm going to CES because I just like should probably be there CES yeah yeah CES I I hate CES no offense if you live in fabulous Las Vegas but it is not it's not my kind of town I like uh I like a you know a book or an interesting article to read and like uh you know a nice spot on the couch like that's my idea of a good good time I I I love stage plays like like I'll I would I would do that you know i' I'd hop down to to Vegas to like you know watch a couple shows or something
like that but like in general the Vegas Vibe not my thing I don't like Vegas sorry it is not a town made for either of us yeah and no judgment if you're into Vegas hey you do you go have fun yeah what are we supposed to be doing right now we should probably head into when after dark oh no I want to talk about small town panopticon sued in court what the institute for justice a nonprofit public interest law firm is suing the city of Norfolk Virginia over its extensive network of security
cameras that use automatic license plate readers to log every passing car alongside the car's color make um model and any distinctive characteristics officials including police can then request the system give them a list locations a car has been create lists of cars that visited specific locations and even track cars that are often seen together yeah that the lawsuit aims to either shut down the camera system or to require police to obtain a warrant before accessing the feeds or collecting
information from the database that's right no warrant big yikes this is like something I would expect to be reading about like China not the US the fact that this got installed at all and oh by the way these cameras are run by flock who has cameras in over "5,000" communities it is unclear at this time how common police misuse of this system is but two well publicized incidents saw a Sedwick Kansas police Lieutenant use the system to stalk his estranged wife in October 2022 and a police chief in
the same city used the system to stalk his ex-girlfriend and her new boyfriend in October of 2020 23 and I guarantee you if they stay installed this will keep happening and this type of information is going to leak both of those things it is likely that this lawsuit focuses on Norfolk because it is in the jurisdiction of the fourth circle uh fourth circuit appeals court which recently ruled against warrantless drone surveillance in a different case warrantless drone surveillance oh 
that's all I really have to say about that um oh no I have something really cool I actually I saw this and I just like lost my biz what no I don't want to I'm not going to sign up for an account that's fine cuz I can see what I need to see before the thing pops up there you go yeah dude start whatever hold on oh my good video conference just whatever video conferencing on a plane dude dude guar Airways made its first flight using starlink internet on Tuesday making them the second airline
to launch starlink service after Hawaiian Airlines who got theirs in February according to Business Insider who had a representative on the Qatar Airways plane download speeds reached up to 215 megabit per second that's not for the whole plane that's for one person qar Airways plans to make starlink Wi-Fi free to all passengers compared to its regular inflight Wi-Fi which is extremely slow and costs $10 per flight that means passengers can even make video calls or live stream something
that Qatar Airways demonstrated with a video call between their CEO and uh starlink CEO Elon Musk on a prior test flight Qatar Airways plans to roll up the service to around 60% of its Fleet in 2025 United Airlines and Air France have also announced deals with starlink this cannot come soon enough as someone who spends time on planes and would like to get some actual bloody work done yeah I am like more excit like I know starlink super important for like rural areas and Disaster Response and and all
of that stuff and it's like actually a super amazing technology we've we've talked about it before it's awesome um this one's going to be more meaningful to my day-to-day life personally so I have personal excitement it's also interesting because it notes that you know regular inflight Wi-Fi is expensive and slow and I think it's might be just qar Airlines but they're planning on offering Starling for free yeah so that tells us something about the relative affordability of it cuz the
satellites are just up there they vibing so you might as well use the capacity unless I have a strong work reason I don't tend to get inflight Wi-Fi anyways dude I'm not talking about conference calls I'm talking about like just being able to access the freaking internet at a reasonable speed it cut out for like probably an hour of my flight to Toronto and then like 45 minutes of my flight back like it's not it's not usable oh right I remember why I started talking about equinix because that was this week
and I totally forgot because I flew out Sunday night I had that shoot for like 12 13 hours on Monday and then I took the red eyee back home so that I could be home in time for the Mighty Car Mods collab Tuesday morning so this week I'm just like I think that's I had badminton training on Tuesday night which was this with the guy that I'm like it's not with a coach but he's like done some coaching but also we're both doing everything like we're just trying to like help each
other improve so we're like both feeding and like both doing the footwork drills and stuff like that at the same time so I had that that was that was crazy my my legs are so much in very much pain then like Wednesday I don't remember even what happened Wednesday and then Thursday yesterday I had training again cuz I'm trying to I'm trying to like get good for a tournament in December so like I'm just I I I have no idea what's going on man yeah sorry what are we talking about
uh oh dude I'm sorry we we will get to some merch messages uh I guess we kind of we kind of uh let's power through these two we can do them both pretty quick Chrome is purging U origin the extension page in the Chrome web store is still up but some users are reporting popups from chrome telling them that you block origin is now unsupported and turning the extension off Google says that it's new newly rolled out manifest V3 framework still allows developers to create ad blockers for Chrome but many U
block users however are talking about moving to Firefox or brave because of this Interruption um discussion question how many people are actually going to switch off of chrome and is it enough to matter uh I don't think it's going to be that many people we'll see but hopefully it will be enough matter I mean people I I think a lot of people thought Internet Explorer was unsalable at one point they had like 90 plus% market share or whatever it was so anything can change anything can change do a Firefox poll
now no I don't feel like being lied to right now which is why I'm not going to oh Dan can you uh can you move our box yep darn it um not only does the the new designs of the product pages and stuff in in the labs website look look all super neat and we're writing cooler articles and things like that but there's a a little bit of I don't know if you no way just for you guys just for just just for all of you float plane members that was not my idea um but I think it's hilarious so it it's there um yeah all
right because I don't feel like being lied to right now I'm not going to buy an AMD um new b840 motherboard amd's new 800 series motherboards are a mess according to a recent article over on XDA Developers who have been who has been strongly critical of amd's new motherboards so for starters the b840 is named as though it is a b tier chipset which typically allows CPU overclocking but instead it not only doesn't have overclocking support like last generation's budget a620 uh boards it is arguably worse than
the a620 because it only supports PCI Express gen 3 for graphics and storage while a620 supports Gen 4 XDA also claims that the rest of the chipsets aren't really that different from last gen the x870 adds mandatory USB 4 to the x670 E specs while the x870 adds that and a pcie 5.0 slot uh a pcie 5.0 slot is also the only upgrade that b850 has over b650 the conclusion reached by XDA is that these upgrades don't justify the price increase and AMD is resorting to Shady naming tactics agreed comparable to
nvidia's Infamous 480 12 gig controversy it's almost like AMD was never your  yeah they want your money careful people are going get mad I am dude I am so tired of deceptive naming schemes I know I keep talking about how I want to be like more positive in our coverage but I just you just you see so much of it and I think I think that a lot of the time it's easy for people to watch our content and go well that doesn't seem like that big of a deal and it's like yeah but it's cumulative you know like
it eats at you like you see this kind of stuff over and over and over again you see people make mistakes and like you know you read about people who are getting confused by it you know like you'll see people oh I want a I want a core i7 you know not realizing that they're buying an ultr light laptop and that core i7 is not fast and like probably doesn't matter compared to the Core i5 for editing documents right like it's just the the way that I just wish that we could Market
honestly because honest marketing is if you have a good product is actually better educating your customers turns them into informed customers it turns them into advocates for your brand like it maybe that's my new career be like a marketing consultant you know go tell them to be less stupid yeah wasn't that that was a direction at one point potentially yeah I mean it's something I considered I never had an offer for it though like that's not what WD offered me no no they
wanted me to like like lead marketing for or be on a Marketing Group no not lead it no I was going to work for I forget her name anyway yeah no I wouldn't I wouldn't be high up enough to have actually made a difference I don't  now all right uh what else we got oh  friends this oh my god seriously um what Dan are you into Reddit I think so what I can do is I can just post the there we go uh do you want to zoom in so this is why we redesigned the water bottle lid making it much
easier to pull out your o-ring and wash it yes it was worth it that's a moose that's a moose nice moose what about the  moose okay we alluded to this ear but the last big one this week is arm cancels qualcomm's license this week arm gave 60 days notice to Qualcomm that they're canceling their architectural license agreement on grounds of repeated material breaches to the agreement notably arm will be facing Qualcomm at trial in just 51 days over qualcomm's acquisition of CPU startup nuvia
um novia's license was supposed to only allow server chip applications and was supposed to be n transferable but Qualcomm has just been like using it notably in the Snapdragon X Elite laptop chips that they released this year both companies stock prices fell in response to the announcement of arms decision I got to think they're bluffing I agree but to what end like why is mediatech really going to pick up the slack in the phone space no like immediately well no no no no they're
better than you probably realize I think it's probably been a while since you've looked at media Tech's latest stuff and they're actually like pretty good now okay yeah qualcom lost an arm I really just want risk to win um that's very funny and this this is the kind of stuff that if arm just just acts like a petulant child about things but I mean In fairness they did break terms In fairness yeah yeah SN Qualcomm is almost certainly not um not going to come of this looking like
Saints either like licensing agreements do exist for a reason all right Dan it's time for after dark let's do it Okie doie I got to push  button and then  purple purple you're welcome merch messages hey D sitting here listening to the stream doing my plaque brachial therapy for my eye cancer can't read well but I can listen what is your most interesting non-te podcast or book to read you're a book person not a Vegas person interesting uh I most interesting non-te book okay I don't know if I listen to
podcasts um man I'm mostly I'm mostly an article reader these days I don't find much time  leisure um after my sister died um tan gave me a book called Tuesdays with Mory that is like super famous um I read that so that's probably that's the last book I read uh it was good hopefully it's not on topic for you uh really hope your treatment goes well um any non-tech podcasts uh oh podcasts um I only and I don't listen to it that often anymore but just the yard yeah okay fun bro podcast this
book you said interesting book I would absolutely not say this is the best book I don't even know if I would say it's an amazing book I haven't I don't think I've recommended it to anyone ever it's always risky to give a book recommendation right because like people are going to judge you immediately I'm going to your whole soul is about to be judged because they said interesting book okay interesting and it is an interesting book s 3.86 out of five and it probably that's probably Justified it the plot is
not that amazing but it's a very interesting book it's sealed when you buy it you have to break the seal on it and then there's pieces of like evidence you know they're looking for stuff that they can listen to as an audiobook right no okay I didn't that part um neat let's move on probably I've got a lot of audio books hold on a second okay all right Dan why don't you read me another one while Luke finds some good audio books okay sure  end uh excited for the MCM collab video
after collaborating with the world world's best off-roading YouTube channel are there any other non-tech channels that would make for an interesting collaboration um Plato's The Republic narrated by raych Childs or chills I'm not sure which one it is there you go does a very good job it's it's a really good listen there you go go go go with that instead um thank you Luke that was much more helpful or bar elephant graveyard also very good okay I'm going to lean on I'm going to lean on my co-hosts again I I
don't really watch YouTube much any other non- Tech channels that would make  channels I don't know non Tech I would love to see you with a click spring what's that he's doing an analog uh version of the antira mechanism I guess that would be a tech Channel cuz the antira mechanism is technically a computer tech Channel but he does Machining videos I'd love to do like a how how wide do you go with tech I think it'd be kind of cool to do like um like a like like workstation Effectiveness
analysis with like an engineering Channel or like an animation Channel or something like that because that's a space that's really not well documented in terms of like how to Benchmark same with like music production so we bring in like a BN we we basically like bring in like four machines or something like that and we go okay we built what we think is like a good better best Ultimate do your thing you know we'll watch like let's see let's see if any of this matters you know um I think
something like that would be pretty cool yeah if if you I mean could work with like bonea or something and oh yeah find like you know gamers are notorious for not wanting to spend time cooking cuz I mean they could be gaming obviously bonea gamer meals getting gamer meals from bonati could be pretty sick we have a big sponsorship coming up the deal is not actually Inked and I want them to be the one to announce it not us um but uh wait why are you talking about it then well I'm not going
to say who it is oh yeah but LTT store is uh is on kind of like a sponsorship ship drive right now uh sponsoring other YouTubers so we're we're working on some stuff so I'm not going to tell you who it is but what I will tell you is that it's someone that float plane chat has mentioned in the last two minutes oh yeah and it's a pretty it's a pretty sizable sponsorship dollar amount it's it's comfortably five figures so it's like who they're a pretty big deal okay yeah I'm I'm pretty excited um
I'm trying to think what would be it's not Lunchables oh I'm disappointed can you survive eating mold for more than a week well I'll pay you a five figure sponsorship to find out why a stomach pump tips that would actually be a hilarious like Mr Beast Style video parody how much moldy Lunchables cheese can you eat like the last person to the last person to be eating lunchable moldy cheese wins this car we water cooled your dialysis machine yeah doing doing some form of like
computer experiment thing using science Mindy Han green something like that could be good Han green seems super cool yep um everyone else is like too closely related like even electroboom is probably too close we've already collabed with them I've hung out with smos a couple times at events and stuff they're like super cool that could be fun yeah CTS Kaz I can think of a few different ways that you could even do that as well I think for me me at this point in my career honestly I've kind of
done I've kind of done it all when it comes to Tech I'd rather I'd rather go on someone else's Channel now I think just like yeah I don't know you're doing something like weird yeah let's play like practically anything yeah let's play paintball with you know grape juice you have to catch it in your mouth like I don't know like what whatever whatever kind of I I don't know I'm just you get graped in the mouth that's  exam lus gets tied to the radiator oh my God oh my God I was not expecting that 
okay 5-second films yeah oh that would be fun dude I used to watch those guys in University oh they they're back they took a very long break I've heard yeah I'm going to Grape you what is going on oh my God I'm the grapest I don't even know this reference and I don't  it okay oh is it white is kids you know yeah oh okay I remember now um it's a reference guys yeah it's a reference okay um great I don't I'd have to like bring up my YouTube and figure it out very hard to watch I think practically
anyone to be completely honest yeah anyways moving on uh hey D finally buying something from the store how is progress going with the city and the Badminton Center we submitted our package to the city um they uh have not gotten back to us like about the result but but this is promising they did get back to us to say that they have received our package and that they have scheduled a meeting to discuss it and uh that they would follow up with us with a decision and next steps that's good
which to me sounds like there are next steps considering there's next steps mentioned I mean it's good that you heard anything yeah and the fact that they're on it that's always a sign how quickly you get an email back tells you more than probably anything else about how important something is to the person on the other side sad what there's a project that I'm working on took like over a month for them to respond recently but then we had a meeting about it this week and now we
have meetings about it every week moving forward okay so it's probably fine now okay well or it could tell you something about how busy the other person is remember remember it's relative right we can't change multiple variables you can't compare one person to another person I'm just saying that if you had worked with the city in the past and they would take a month or never to reply to your emails and they're working with them now and they're like on it same day next day a couple days that's
good you're a priority that's good yeah you're a high priority so I'm I'm really I'm really really optimistic about whale I'm really excited um as for B Center good it's been soft open for almost a month now I think and next week we are going to move the evening the very evening 7: to 10: p.m. uh dropin session to be paid wait are the new floors in no so only one side is open and we have signs up everywhere saying that the floors are temporary so what's going to happen is we have placed the PO for our
new floors they're from Victor uh they have said uh 6 to 10 weeks for production um once they arrive the same company that installed our floors is going to install these ones for us cuz they did a great job of the installation just the defective material um so they're going to install it on the side that is currently unfinished then we're going to move all our programs over there then they're going to go on the side that is finished now they're going to rip out the bad parts they're going
to put in the new parts and then they're going to go away and then it will actually be finished good cool very exciting super exciting I wasn't expecting there to be so many people there it's very popular right it was amazing yeah this whole time Dan thought he was building a giant facility for just me to toy with cuz I was there by myself for until like 1:00 p.m. and I thought oh man this place is is dead lus has no clients and then like 400 people showed up and all of the courts were
jammed and I was like all right maybe lus maybe lus shouldn't have been doubted ever friends and family right now um well people they uh the best way to get people to tell everyone they know about something is to tell them not to tell anybody so we I it's friendsss friends of friends to my knowledge we have never posted it publicly yet and yet every time I go in there I recognize hardly anybody um and I think we have over a thousand people on in our customer database now my
parents told a couple of their friends about it and they're like oh my God I love badminton there's nowhere to play we're going to go there I had no idea badminton was this popular it's incredible are you going to are you going to work out with me again when there's a gym at the Bon Center absolutely yeah my life is calming down a lot I mean I'll come back to the normal gym I feel bad I feel bad I'm back to where I was before the sickness good I got a long way to recovery but
things are calming heck we'll get there yeah all right what else we got hi question for lonus in Supreme Commander how do you deal with endgame lag when all the players get to unit cap same faster skill issue Stellaris Kerbal Space Program Minecraft no it is a real problem uh even though it's an old game like what is it like 2008 or something like that I can't remember when Supreme Commander came out off the top of my head but even though it's an older game it's single-threaded um and so even modern
processors struggle to handle the the maximum unit counts on these like gigantic 40 km square maps um and as if anyone if anybody in in the lobby has a slower computer it slows down the game for everybody because um The Sim everyone has to be able to handle the Sim uh so the combat is all physics based in the game so because you're simming every moving projectile on the entire map it's it gets pretty ridiculous it is fair that it gets ridiculous yeah yeah um but yeah there's
not really much you can do about it get good get better computers I don't I don't know man promote mindless consumerism buy more computer yeah good make sure that when you're doing that they're notably powered by batteries yeah lithium batteries yeah with lots of ideally as much Cobalt as possible and have them flown in yeah yes and Lead yep get Leed in your batteries to get the lead out MH any updates on a potential collab with big time would love to see some LTD staff subject to Jerry's lie detector
test I don't know that sounds really funny um and I I don't know if I don't think we have anything planned like collab wise but I I did say before that I would love to sponsor big time I don't actually know where we are at on that I don't know if I've gotten an update but the team knows that I would like to do that so hopefully I'd like to work with them hopefully someday we will get uh I'll I'll get like my phone blowing up like oh my goodness I saw your screwdriver on big time so we'll
see hey Luke's mom and dll what are your thoughts on COD blops six having an advanced audio subscription what's next charging to unlock the frame rate wait what what I don't know like surround sound also I thought it was bloops oh no that's yeah I've always called it bloops what enhanced audio What audio subscription do you need to buy it how did how did I not how did I not see this okay so sorry I'm on read write.com which I've also never heard of uh enhanced headphone mode designed to give
you more immersive sound using Tech from embody directional accuracy helps you directional accuracy did we come full circle all the way back to eax are they not using like fod or wowi which is spatial audio you can unlock a 5-year license for personalized sound profile through embodies immersed spatial audio technology what is this I mean it's not unprecedented to have to pay for a subscription or pay for oh yeah subscription like Atmos but to have to pay yeah like Atmos and
windows like to have to pay for like like a Kodak or but accurate placement of sounds which can be helpful multiplayer audio cues like footsteps gunfire $20 for a 5year license I mean that doesn't for the amount of money that you're going to spend on like like dogs right it doesn't seem wasn't it Cod that had the stupid dog that you could buy that you were so upset about no oh was that Battlefield no it was a which one was it RTS game I don't remember name are you sure yeah whatever the point is some like
nonsense cosmetic for the amount of money you're going to spend on that um this doesn't seem that unreasonable especially if they're if a effectively just licensing a third party audio tech with that said I think that this is what like a 90 Canadian dollar game like if you're spending that much on this game then I mean is it not pretty reasonable for them to just include good audio in it also like knowing that you're at a disadvantage compared to other players because you didn't pay the subscription
that goes along with the game is that's how they get you a little rough all recently released uh spatial audio tool  again some Final Fantasy 14 fans this is according to readed write.com where the service has been available for a while have expressed dissatisfaction comparing it to similar Technologies like Dolby Atmos which some say offer comparable spatial audio without the extra cost uh all right well good luck everybody ah man I had decided to not do the whole Cod blop six
thing and now I'm happy about that decision I miss like having Shooters to play you're going to turn into a non- gamer basically dude yeah you're going to be a non- gamer until like balers gate 4 comes out yeah and that'll be in like it'll be like that's going to be by like Hasbro or whoever it's not going to be by laran oh really larion lost the license no they just left oh yeah based laran yeah all right yeah the next game that larion makes is not going to be uh bers gate wow Hasbro is going to bung it
up like so bad they have quite the blueprint to at least make no like you know Far Cry 17 okay tell you what no I'm going stop you right there show me a like Hasbro show me a Hasbro game studios game that's like good what games have they made I remember getting their Monopoly Gam in my serial box when I was a kid I was going to say actually those games were pretty good there was Boggle Monopoly I forget which other ones I know I've launched games that had the Hasbro logo that I liked and then I went
back and remembered that it was those I don't just their board games but on a CD all right I want what hasb video games Hasbro studio video games what games do they made yeah I know they did the billion dooll investment um like this year basically they saw balls Gate 3 pop off and they're like huh billion dollars yeah yeah I don't know if it's called Hasbro games Studios I just like I I know that they're working on some stuff wait Hasbro games is an Ubisoft Mech Warriors 3 Pirates Moon I
think that was the worst Mech Warriors  made huh they made Glover classic H moving on all right cool good luck everybody yeah hey lldd lonus how's the iPhone going and how long do you plan to use it for also any idea when the Retro pet cave will ever come back uh H our our second order of the Retro pet cave was a disaster they were the wrong color they're all mashy we're working on it but like it's the exact same suppliers like how' they screw that up I don't get it like just do the same
thing you did last time just just don't swaper it drives me crazy you guys it drives me crazy dude I have so many more notes on my thing like this dock is so long um like there's man so many of them are just little things that iPhone people are going to tell me don't matter and I'm like yeah to you I guess but to me they do like when you okay have you ever have you ever noticed this on an iPhone when when you scroll the scrolling is slow no no not that oh um here it's a lot more noticeable in the
YouTube studio app which I use a fair bit to uh like read comments and stuff Community oh it's a community tab now they made an update okay so do you crying out loud okay okay so as I'm  anything not really do you notice that it highlights the comment that I click on even though I'm not interacting with that comment not always I did notice that happen a couple times but not always I'm just scrolling and it highlights the comment since you mentioned it I don't think it's happened
you know what if it's already moving it doesn't there you go yeah so see that how it highlights the comment yeah why what other modern interface will will act like you have activated an element on screen when you're actually  scrolling if you do it really fast does  yeah does it every single time why it makes me feel like I'm misclicking stuff all the time what do you mean because you touched it no incorrect literally Windows doesn't do that on touch screens Android doesn't do
that on touch screens it's really misleading because it makes you seem like you're interacting with that  not I'm trying to think what would cause it I I feel like it's like it's delay on interacting with that element is really low or something or well no cuz it Doesn't interact with it it knows I'm just scrolling uh yeah but if you if you like held press on that would it do that animation of you interacting with it in the exact same way if so then you're just not hold pressing it long enough
just no just it doesn't do  it yeah so I have to tap it in order for it to actually do anything but if I scroll and I T if if I touch it first when I scroll or if I just hold it it just like highlights it yeah and then doesn't actually activate it is it just people are commenting is it just the YouTube app yeah no it does it in uh it does it in like my news feed and stuff like that like why why I thought you're supposed to be a paragon of like design in ux like this is obviously wrong
design in ux is subjective um I'm also experiencing the bug where my ringer volume gets bugged sometimes and goes super loud literally interrupted a shoot because my uh my ringer was set to like like this much and it was like like going off in the middle of the shoot like it's been so buggy that made me think dude I should I should change my ringer to the Everquest level up sound most people aren't going to get why that's yeah anyways um oh what was this what was this uh what was this
note uh convenience oh yeah oh dude when you're connected to carplay if you take a system screenshot it sends your carplay screenshot as well what yeah and as I I'm sure there's a way to un that it but it was not super obvious and I was um busy so I didn't deal with it but it's on my list of things to figure out as well so like it sends both like two separate things or they like stitched together they're like stitched together um I ran into a crazy bug uh that I recorded on my Note 9
where touch wasn't registering in the right spot I recorded that so I I'll have that uh I mean again there's lots of cool stuff so since the last time we talked um the phone noticed that I never really like deplete the battery and automatically recommended I switch over to limiting it to 80% to optimize the long-term life that's really cool that's cool I like um I really like the way there's a little popup in the island if you uh get a call on this and your airpods are on you but like paired to
something else and this was to a Windows laptop so it's not like they were talking oh it can like suggest you to take it over hey can I grab can I grab that instead of just grabbing it you know like your car will do that was really cool so there's lots of really cool stuff lots of really cool stuff um and lots of stuff that's just like completely obvious garbage anyman is saying that it's individual screenshots when carplay is active not that they're stitched oh okay sure well when you're
using the share interface which is what I use um they're both there and there wasn't an obvious way to get rid of the other one interesting so I accidentally when I was messaging plof uh sent him both my answer and my location oh yeah that is stitched it looks I like it or wait is that two separate files I don't know click it yeah it might be two I no I can't cuzen uh the point is just that it was I I wasn't expecting to send him like a screenshot of my map on on carplay that
was not what I was not what I intended  bug yeah so overall I I don't really um I don't really like it it's really buggy I was expecting a lot more just works and a lot less well there was the time when my phone just cut out when you called me that yeah Su off like just turned and it was weird cuz on on my end the call didn't even disconnect and he his call history has a log of our call connecting and mine doesn't like it just has no idea that that ever happened the Android
phone just overpowered the iPhone yeah I guess so yeah how is it still buggy they have one phone everything's going to have bugs dude yeah you can't you can't say how is anything still buggy everything ever is going to have bugs as higher a second div they legitimately they legitimately changed a lot in iOS 18 they just um I don't know it could be it could be way better could be way better all right software is going to software yeah I hate computers at Shorty Swift you've spoken a few times about
your disdain for Sleep Country on the show but you've never really Del into it stop that care to share more info as to why you dislike them so much I will do you one better and I will direct you to the place where you can go to learn all about mattresses mattress underground.com is based you're welcome sick typical Monday listener here what's the most wasted qualifications that you have encountered oh A+ uh no no that' be something like with a that's the opposite yeah no we we have
some people who work here who have like like just ridiculous credentials but um do stuff here that is nothing to do with them at all like almost any PhD where you're ending up anywhere other than like research and Engineering or education it feels like maybe you like can get paid more for it like if you have a PhD I think you get paid more as like a counselor or a teacher for example like in the public sector but the reality of it is once you're in the private sector your your initial
compensation is going to be you know whatever it is whatever you negotiate with your employer but then beyond that your PhD is not going to like get you raised next year you're going to have have to perform so yeah maybe that helps you do that maybe it doesn't maybe it doesn't I have a ballet degree yeah I could see that not necessarily getting you much unless you wanted to be a ballet teacher yeah there's a lot of degrees that are like if you want to teach the thing that you got your degree in great if not
nothing yep hi dll does the float plane Tech stack utilize open source software if so do you worry that license changes like what happened with redis could impact future maintainability we do and yes but that's also a problem with notop Source software sure is so like a big problem it's potentially a bigger one yeah we're having an issue I'm not going to name them but we're having an issue right now with a particular company where we wanted to change the tier of like subscription that we had with them
um and uh oh the way that that is being handled is extremely unsavory I will say at this point in time uh to the point where we might just be completely bailing out which will take development time but would be worth it okay we'll get them these vests and our developers will code so much faster with AI I'll I'll wait till it's done before I I talk about it because it's not it's not done yet so naming them now would just be in bad taste tast um sure but yeah it's like but we won't hesitate to name you
if you don't get your act together it's it's pretty lame uh what they're they're saying they would be doing um so we'll  goes I noticed you haven't had any new bonus bin items in a while are there any plans to make a 2024 sticker pack another postcard maybe some more of those cool pins or anything similar yes Sarah's been busy we definitely have new pins coming and we definitely have a 2024 sticker pack in the works it's not everyone's so convinced it's Cloud flare the one company I'll say it isn't is
cloud flare yeah I won't I won't that's where it's the only reason why I'm saying it is just cuz so many people said Cloud flare I understand why you say that yeah we've definitely had some conversations with cl flare but but in this case it is it is actually not I'm just clarifying that cuz so many people said it it's not Cloud F this isn't necessarily a question but give me an early birthday present next time lonus gets premium access to a company Let It Be valve I want to see inside the company we all
have so much invested in with our libraries I'll tell you what our rep there is super chill she's really nice I will screenshot this and I will send it to her nice all right I'm not promising anything literally doing that right now yeah he is a humble request I look so serious in the vest every time I look over the TV I'm like oh yeah you look like you look like I'm in my quarterly review meeting I did way too many of those over the last couple weeks I don't want to do anymore yeah L had to dress
up because it's not going to be positive you don't you come into like a stained t-shirt yeah this is fine okay next oh man I better put a button up on oh no no the clothes have been looking really good on you recently must be the tall it's weird yeah it might be something to do with the fit yeah interesting interesting never thought about that I had a friend come over and she was immediately like oh my God your shirt looks great I'm like tall size I've had a non insignificant amount of
people mention that my shirts fit unsurprisingly it's always been like you know like my mom like women in my life which there are not many but but my mom and um Emma and Emma immediately noticed my mom immediately noticed like it just it actually fits now yeah which is honestly you know once you've partnered up probably that's pretty much all that matters but like it's it's interesting how fast I'm not saying you should avoid other women I'm just saying like no it's I don't know you got the bases covered
that's all yeah outside of work like the Casual Hangouts that I mean I barely have friends at all these days so yeah I don't know it is what it is  though cool hi w this easy to get him to sh this hard for the store it would made it this I've been asking for told that this would happen it's been very clear there was no miscommunication we said exactly what we needed it was delivered and now we are acing on our side of the deal women have taken notice of  everything oh boy hi W oh my goodness
week number two of asking for an update on the 3D printed custom Loop oh they do updates on float plane which is where we said we would do updates better get subscribed on float plane they do happen there I've seen it uh last one I got for you hey LDL I work as a private teacher for a family of billionaires the family does Pro Motorsports if you homeschooled with an infinite budget and lots of travel opportunities what would you do I don't think I would homeschool my kids um interesting socialization is
important yeah maybe not when you're a billionaire yeah maybe well I no I would think if anything it would be more H um that's what they that's why they don't that's how they feel about everyone else I mean I don't know maybe I I can't speak for them I'm not a billionaire um if you homeschooled with an infinite budget and had lots of travel opportunities yeah see okay we got a couple of problems here so number one is um at risk of sounding like I look in this vest um my kids can have whatever education
they want effectively I have an infinite education budget for my kids there's no amount of like education budget that I couldn't afford at this point um so I like kind of do except that I wouldn't homeschooled them like I like just wouldn't do that that's not even that's  um uh I think the homeschooling would be that you hired like people to come and teach them like the world top Engineers lots of lots of practical experiments and demonstrations I think yeah I think that'd be cool visiting a lot of uh
here's a laboratory go learn how to do science with a team of people to teach you I mean yeah I guess that'd be kind of cool but like GH because I mean at that point in time they don't need to work so all you really need to do is Inspire interest so showing them how cool things that you can do with the different subjects are go try everything to find what you're interested in and then we'll we'll dive  so make sure they at least know the definition of the word job yeah can at least pretend for a
little while I'm just I'm just reading I'm just reading chat right now it's it's interesting hearing everyone's sort of different background like yeah I went to home school it was great I did home school it was the worst I I think at the end of the day they're going to make the best um I think they're going to make they're going to make make whatever they make of whatever they have like I I  um and so much knowledge is available for free now that I just I don't know I
don't know if I'm convinced that um that like fancy school I mean travel opportunities could be cool like being able to see see things in person instead of read money and infinite travel opportunities I think I think there's a lot you can do you also waste a lot of time traveling though like no amount of no amount of money makes it so that you know going somewhere far away is when you've got private jets you could have like the the paperwork stuff that they have to do on the
planes yeah I mean I guess so you could just like you know oh let's learn about uh wac Bennett Dam by going there like yeah I guess I guess that that's something um here's a helicopter you can  yeah have fun man there's almost too many there's almost too many uh there's almost too many options like I wouldn't even know what to do with it I have to confess I hadn't really given it that much thought I just let the school kind of do their curriculum and Reading Writing rithmetic and a little bit of
Performing Arts and Fine Arts and I mean I would I would be if I was I don't know if you're clearly not the parent so if I if I were you I would be most concerned about making sure that they're not just like I'm did you did did you just accuse Ivonne of cheating what no I'm talking to the person who sent in the merch message um we all know ivonne's the real parent yeah that's fair  um and 15 cats five five we'll get there um but like yeah I don't know showing them like the the impact of of bad
things in our oceans and doing Beach cleanups things could be cool um doing things like that giving them a reason to give a crap about anything yeah my fiance is homeschooled  okay nice nice nice and I think that's it for the W show yeah we'll see you again next week same bad time see bad Channel bye   it's like anything's kind of Education
