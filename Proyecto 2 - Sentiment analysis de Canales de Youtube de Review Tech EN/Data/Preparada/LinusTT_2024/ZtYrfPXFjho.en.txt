what's up everybody welcome welcome one and all all of you even you oh to the W show huh well I've never welcomed you to the W show before if you think about it you probably have on the first episode oh maybe a long time might not have been called W show at that point though that's true so I'm saying this is it for the first time Luke welcome to the WAN show thanks bro we've got a great show lined up for you today um we never actually talked about this last week but a well-known actor
in the video game accessibility space doesn't appear to be real allegedly we're also going to be talking about what exactly happened this week when one of our videos got uny youtubed we'll talk a little bit about that but there's going to be some more detail in a full video that's coming tomorrow what else we got today uh maybe our phones really are actually listening even though we've been gas lit that they haven't been this whole time yeah intriguing I never believed it yes also Concord uh sucked I
guess it's offline completely yeah I was I was about to say I was about to say I mean I I wouldn't know I didn't try it but hey neither did any of you and now you can't  the show is brought to you today by LG Squarespace one password our chair partner secret lab and our laptop partner LG Dan hold on a second before we get into this how can a show be sponsored by LG  oh and we're off to a good start all right let's jump right into our first yeah that doesn't make any sense wait no
I think it is though it is I know I know YouTube YouTube unived one of our videos this week the popular series that we just started so I'm maybe taking some artistic Liberties when I call it a popular series but our series degoogle your life um had a part two that was uploaded a little over two weeks ago and sat there on YouTube for 2 weeks until earlier this week I received a notification that it had been removed moved for violating YouTube's Community guidelines um specifically it was
flagged as potentially harmful or dangerous content which we'll get into this in a little bit more detail doesn't necessarily mean that it included you know instructions on bomb building or anything sort of overtly dangerous like that but more it doesn't necessarily mean it didn't include bomb building it is possible it included that did you ever play it backwards like those records from the' 70s with the devil lyricss did you that's fair no I didn't well now you can't because it's not on
YouTube at least it's on Flow plane at least it's not on our YouTube channel where it is definitely is on float plane and and other people's YouTube channels and other people's YouTube channels so what we discovered is that that category of of of violation is just extremely Broad and they did provide a little bit more detail in terms of what was exactly uh against the YouTube Community guidelines in uh in a follow or not a followup but in like an additional message um I can answer a couple of your
main questions right now one is if you want to watch this video where can you go and the only official source of it is lm. g/f floatplane where uh it will be forever because it doesn't violate float plan's terms of service but so there you have it degoogle your life part two where we talk about um I'm actually not going to show the exact things we talk about because I really don't need this episode of The W show pulled down yeah thanks YouTube yeah uh cool anyway there are other places where you can find it
but guys this is yet another example of the importance for creators of diversifying their revenue sources and this is something that I've been talking about since day Zero intern atus Med grally when I did unpop things the do you remember the kind of long chat we had to have with the audience the first time we did a baked in sponsor spot into our video oh yeah dude that was controversial back when we did it I think we were promoting an Intel like snowboard giveaway or something like
that that was either the first one yeah that was super weird or very early one and Ed did this like weird little like graphic that he created for it and stuff and that was that was a big deal back then it was like you money grubbers get a real job like the way the discourse around that kind of thing has changed in the last 11 12 years now when people don't have those people are like what are you doing yeah get get paid get that bag queen you know like it's totally changed it's totally changed now and so
you know whether it is um procuring your your own sponsors or whether it's um starting a merch store or whether it is providing uh video downloading and streaming services directly to your viewers via an alternative platform like patreon or nebula or float plane um we have strongly encouraged creators since day Zero to look for ways to diversify their income streams and um this just is such an this is just such a such a strice and Affy of Google ultimately making our point
for us in a way that I could never make so powerfully I do prefer it over them effectively like Shadow Banning the video um because that wouldn't have stri sign affected it yeah I guess that's true and uh thank you for bringing that up now if anyone from YouTube watches this I'm sure there'll be some internal conversations about you know taking that approach instead um good job yeah I mean in general that is it's true what he says shadowbanning the offensive behavior is
absolutely the lowest impact way of at least lowering its impact we've seen YouTube do that before with channels so we know that's the thing that they they do you can find the channel you can technically find the videos but it's really hard you almost need direct links to them they'll like never be recommended to you under any circumstance y but as it was the way that they did it was um not great it it ended up with I think uh Rossman made a video about it that has half a million views now um his
video I think front page Reddit like our "SL all it has 30,000 up votes just" discussing Google pulling this video down um there are re-uploads of it that I'm not going to link to because I don't i' that's that's a question that I've seen from the audience a bunch actually I'm not interested in going to battle with YouTube over this it's not totally are you planning on doing anything on the lmg side about the other people uploading the videos that's this is not me asking the question I've seen this
ass from a bunch of other people just to be clear for the audience do what yeah I don't know what you're talking about all right yeah sounds I think that's that's crystal clear to me sounds good what is yeah nothing I mean air yeah yeah it's clear as a crystal yeah Crystal air I highly recommend it it's delicious it sounds like if Crystal Light got into like flavored air isn't that just asbest I assumed it was a Pepsi product I assumed it's like one of those one of those uh one of those weird booths you
find in like Las Vegas when they're trying to sell you like flavored air banana flavored disbest y um y so and and I you know like I said I'm not going to say too much about it because our full kind of breakdown is going to be uploaded hopefully tomorrow I might even get the call during this W show to have a look at the at the edit and make sure that it's that it's good to upload oh we're releasing a video like talking about what happened literally we we we kind of pivoted this
morning and we went okay um at this point it has officially strand affected and not because we did anything we actually hon we didn't do anything the first thing that I said to to our Google contact who uh by the way is great and I'm not going to say anything that she said or didn't say about any of it because nothing she said is is problematic in any way from my point of view effectively all she did was kind of go okay here's the resources that you guys need and it's just kind of pointed
us at the places in the dashboard she did everything totally great I actually love our YouTube contact she's amazing um but the first thing I said to her was this is such a completely unnecessary like escalation of this when if you guys had a problem you literally have my cell phone number you could have said hey this is a problem and and and to be clear I'm not even saying I should get special treatment in this case I'm just saying that as a very large Channel regardless of how they feel about me or
my channel doing this without talking to us and without even attempting to to rectify the situ to tell us what's wrong necessarily would have changed it not that we necessarily appreciated some form of head up at the very least I didn't even say that I'm just CU it no no I want to make it clear I was not asking for a heads up oh what I was saying was strategically this just seems like a pretty dumb move ah yeah yeah yeah yeah that's all yeah yeah and that was the first thing I that was the first thing I
said about it and I'm not going to say what she did or didn't say in response to that because I'm not looking to get her in trouble she's amazing but I was just like with every Factor considered and I'm not I'm not saying I would have done anything differently or that I wouldn't have just left it up or that I wouldn't have just said you or whatever would have changed it CU I'm I'm not I'm not even I'm not even going there all I'm saying is this seems like the highest impact possible way that you
guys could have approached this oh yeah definitely um and it's it's that's one of those things where I feel like sometimes it just comes down to Engineers making decisions rather than you know like people whose specialty is sort of human relations and human interactions and human behavior you know um you know people who see things in terms of numbers and in terms of policy and and you know what I got to own my part of the blame here right like I did put them in a challenging position by uploading a
video that violated to it's that simple did it violate TOS we get into we get into yes okay whether or not that should be the to we're going to leave that to people's judgment got it but in the video we do lay out um how we did in fact violate TOS so I'm not even I'm not complaining I'm not going to sit here and throw a little hissy fit and re-upload my video and then get a strike and then complain about that and turn this into like a drama snowball that's absolutely not going to happen
but what I will say is I think they went about this in the supremely wrongest possible way and what I would like to see is I'd like to see them approach these things in the future more like they handle things like copyright where the video doesn't get ripped down it's it back and forth yeah they they they the owner Flags it and to be clear the way they handle copyright is not perfect I'm just saying there are some things that we can learn from YouTube's existing systems about how we could do
this better so you get a notification in the meantime any AdSense earned by the videos goes into escrow and then once the claim is dis the claim dispute is um resolved that funds that is in escrow either goes to the copyright claimant or it goes to the uploader who had their video claimed against yeah and and so that was how it worked for a long time and then now it's actually a little bit better you can use AI to remove infringing music for example so that you can maintain your your AdSense uh
without actually re uh without just reallocating all of it to the the owner of the song you used for 40 seconds of a you know 1 hour video or whatever the case may be MH so there's um there's also the opportunity to trim out the infringing part so we've done that on Wow before where we've shown like a movie trailer or something like that which I actually maintain is fair use um I'm not I'm not willing to go to court to defend it but I I strongly believe that watching a movie trailer on a podcast or on
advertisement it's an advertisement yeah when you look at the impact like there there's the four pillars right and in that case I think the main pillar that matters is the one where it's the uh here we go the effect of the use on the potential market for or value of the work yeah if anything you would be crazy utterly deranged unhinged to like willfully like make a human decision and go those guys are showing my commercial how dare they these people didn't pay to access my commercial and rip it down
right like that's just that's just crazy um and people people are saying apparently this is totally a thing uh camf bam in float plane chat says Warner apparently went after Mumbo I don't know who that is but for the Minecraft trailer video now in that case that's a little bit different because if you're just playing the trailer especially if you're being positive about it then the impact on the market of the work on the potential market for the work is very positive if you are showing the trailer in its
entirety and then just like crapping on it for 25 minutes that particular pillar weakens a lot right but there's four pillars so I think when it comes to things like marketing collateral I still think there's very very strong arguments to be made for the the fair use repurposing of uh of commercials and advertising imagery and and stuff like that um what was I even talking about now I forget uh I don't know I'm looking at the Minecraft trailer now no well have watched it yet no no don't watch wait
wait we what did you expect that was going to do it's one of the topics of the I oh I was hitting the space bar I was going to I was pausing it I'm pretty sure you hit the trackpad well I'm pretty sure that you hit the trackpad well okay when I closed it yeah um anyway the point is that um so you are you are you talking about how we often have to trim out trailers and then we're going to watch a trailer on the show uh oh yeah right right right right right right right hey thank you that was
actually really helpful problem uh so yeah one of the other mechanisms is offering the ability to trim out the offending section so that the copyright holders claim can be removed but that was not given as an option instead the entire video was pulled out even though as far as we can tell there were only small parts of it that were in violation of the TOs so I would like to see in the longer term I'd like to see YouTube re-evaluate this system in a way that you don't have to be a major YouTuber in
order with a with a contact at YouTube in order to resolve something like this in a way that isn't just the video gets pulled down the trick there though is building a system that doesn't enable Bad actors so if you're the kind of person who is uploading harmful content let's say you are recruiting to a terrorist organization or something like that if they provide clear exact timestamps for what exactly was infringing then you are enabling those Bad actors to trim just that little bit
and re-upload it and happily go along their merry way yes yes everything we're doing is fine because we used this particular euphemism and left out that exact word right so it's a balancing act but I would like to see them do better and I think other than that we can pretty much move on subscribe to float plane yeah oh hilarious apparently no there are actually two official ways to watch that video that support lonus   oh man here we go here we go someone called it that's actually really
surprising oh bollocks I'm really s musky good job oh well whatever I'm not I'm not logged in but uh can you not watch videos unless you're logged in I have no idea uh sure whatever what is it h can can you do you do you have to log into Billy Billy to watch a video now you didn't used to yeah I know crazy uh okay well anyway yeah our our official Billy Billy Channel apparently has it with Chinese subtitles so you can you can watch it there if you really want all right what do you want to talk about
next that's that's the big drama topic this week I've got something that's not on the dock oh sure yeah hit me why don't why don't you actually no I'll just do it look at this okay hey LTT labs.com what exactly is it that you want to talk about you notice something from the lab what is the right oh there's a there's a feed on the right these are blogs oh cool so we have mixed content now so we have products on the left and articles on the right very cool it looks a little bit different you
still got the color coding for the different articles and and your little compare buttons which look all nice and neat and all that kind of stuff but we're trying to highlight some of the the blogs and articles a little bit more so I don't know check out the lab site that's all I really have to say I think it looks better very cool more content there just having these uh the products kind of grided out made it I don't know how to describe it properly but I think having more stuff here is good and
having the Articles listed here as well um I think is interesting because while you might be interested in in individual products that are on the left I think it's more likely that the Articles will hit a broader range of people so yeah Shen says I like that there's more above the fold yeah 100% yeah 100% agreed it's good I think it would be good very cool good job team what do you want to talk about next how about uh should we do the thing we missed last week yeah sure
let's do it sure so this is honestly um even though man this kind of stuff is hard because it's one of those things where there's a bit of a disconnect between what I know cognitively and the general sort of um state that I like to live in where I feel like things are most okay you know cognitively I know how possible it is with the tools that exist today to become a different person online or even fabricate a person online and and use that identity to to fool or in many cases defraud others right I
know that we cover that stuff all the time whether it's uh you know deep fake technology or using llms to generate sad stories on Facebook that send people to gofundmes or you know whatever it is right you can you can fabricate entire people out of The Ether I know that but still this read on IGN which is probably the best piece of Journalism I've seen from IGN in years um maybe years I I was being nice let's go with in years sure was chilling to read um I would strongly
encourage you guys guys I'm going to go ahead and drop this in the float plane chat and I'm going to ask Dan real quick to maybe uh repeat that link and Huck it into the YouTube and twitch chats um I would strongly encourage you guys to go read the whole article because we can't get into every little detail but what I will give you guys is a summary and basically what it what it comes down to is that Susan Banks who was a prominent video game accessibility Advocate and co-founder of the website can I play
that was was thought to have died in 2019 but the report from IGN raises serious doubts as to whether she ever existed at all she was supposedly a deaf Turkish immigrant who had worked as a model and financial asset manager before becoming a professor at a notable DEA University but when IGN asked for comment the university denied she had ever worked there between 2015 and her apparent death 2019 she blogged extensively and often interacted with other Advocates and news organizations however these
interactions were exclusively through social media or emails which most people attributed to her being deaf which I can tell you from my own experience with the deaf Community is a totally completely normal thing for for them to prefer text communication it's uh like my my own mom is heart of hearing and she taught at a school for the deaf for many years that's the reason that I have picked up on some American Sign Language um and so you know I'm I'm already familiar with
the kinds of accessibility equipment that existed before um uh before the internet was necessarily widespread so like we had a TTY in our house which is essentially a a keyboard phone um and so you you use it through like a Relay operator to conduct phone calls or at least you did back before you know every brand had a had a live chat or whatever else but you'll still find like TTY access numbers on things like uh government websites and things like that um so but the point I'm trying to make
is that it really would not have raised any kind of weird alarm Bells if someone who is deaf or heart of hearing preferred to communicate via text and also preferred not to turn their camera  um so moving on if banks is in fact a fake person the most likely suspect seems to be uh her supposed romantic partner Cody Craven who facilitated many of her Communications according to an associate of Craven Craven claimed that Banks was hospitalized after dropping a KitchenAid mixer on her foot which resulted in the
amputation first of one leg then of the other leg 2 days later when this associate contacted the hospital where Banks was recovering in order to send flowers the hospital denied they had any patient by that name one thing that's interesting is like someone in FL plane chat um posted up like privacy policies and stuff like that I'm kind of surprised you can just like call a hospital and figure out if someone's there or not no you can uh without being having relations with that person or
anything um no you can you can definitely do it I I had to do it a little while ago you can definitely do it intriguing um okay yeah I think they kind of expect you to demonstrate a little bit that you like know you're talking know what you're talking about but no it's it's definitely a thing engineering someone said in chat yeah true so the associate then hired a private investigator who found no evidence or any legal record of banks whatsoever uh Craven meanwhile so this
was the supposed romantic partner was apparently showered in gifts and sympathy whenever he posted about his partner's illness and Recovery since announcing Banks's death by stroke in 2019 C Craven has dated two other surprisingly SAR deaf women whose existence has also come into question after being reached for comment by IGN Craven strongly requested that the piece not be published then began deleting all of his social media accounts not a good sign my notes continue these kinds of bizarre schemes
aren't new but they're becoming easier to pull off with modern tools in addition to entirely AI generated influencers there are apparently already several fake influencers created by stealing real influencers photos and adding deep faked AI faces to them however other influencers have made tons of money off people using their own faces but otherwise fabricating facts about their life and circumstances that's not really however that's an addition to yeah we know about the fake
planes and stuff like that what was the grift though did they make money off this so the grift was no I believe there was at least you got to read the whole IGN article to find all the details but yeah between um things like requests for donations to help out and and being an apparently sort of able-bodied person um who could create this Persona of someone who would have much more credibility discussing accessibility in gaming you can create this uh you know you can create can I
play that you can create uh you can create blogs you can get gig work as an advocate you can you can create this career that ironically wouldn't be open to you as an able as a completely able-bodied person um but would be open to you as someone who could speak authoritatively on the challenges that you face and I mean I think that's the thing that makes me most sick about all of this is like really there's there's not enough things that you could do that like you have to from the people
who have legitimate grievances with the way that the gaming industry has treated accessibility who have legitimate voices that need to be heard in this space you take advantage of their plight and you profit from it and you turn it into like a hustle that then substitutes their voice for your own like I can't I can't even begin to wrap my head allegedly around how sick this guy would have to be to think that that is even remotely okay MH allegedly allegedly none of this proven in court
but read the IGN piece it is actually worth the click go check it out um it is it is gross um all right Dan what are we supposed to talk about give us give us something give us something better uh another topic we've done two topics uh then we can go straight into merch messages and stuff if you want oh well why don't we do Luke goes back to PS first okay the only comment look look at how useless the dock is here my only comment here is Blue Water Grill is amazing so okay help
me out here I was I was going to write more notes for it I'll just remember everything it's fine and how'd that go uh really well actually I remember everything it's okay okay um except for one extremely important detail which I can look up you heard it from Luke I remember everything Luke left R A 2024 uh maybe don't extend that too far yeah for sure um so yeah I went back to packs it was an extremely last minute decision like the week P I wasn't yeah I had told people I wasn't going and then I think
it was like days before packs I was like oh I'm going uh I was only able to go for one day so after W show last week lonus and I went and looked at the Bon Center badmington Center for a little while and then after midnight I finally went to go drive down to Seattle so I didn't end up getting there until like 3: in the morning-ish slept for oh a few hours I guess cuz I should probably still be down there for when the show floor opens yeah buddy and then stayed up until I
think it was about 3:00 in the morning again before starting to drive home nice didn't get home until like 5ish Sunday morning and then had to go to my niece's birthday party breakfast which started at 9:00 nice so I had a heck of a weekend so it was a PA weekend it sure was nice but I was only at PX for one day um there was this is still zero useful context but thank you for that delightful and heartwarming story there had a wonderful birthday one is I think there we go I got little kid birthdays
are always funny to me they have no idea what's going on I have no clue at all yeah she okay so she's been scared of me I'm going to tangent really hard here for a second uh she's been scared of me forever I don't blame her i' rather I'd rather deal with a  goodness okay um yeah so she she's she's been I I don't know what it is she just has always been very standoffish of me when I'm in person they'll put on like the WAN show or something and she'll point at me and know that it's me and be all
happy and when she goes to bed she'll like say good night to everyone in the family and she includes my name like she seems to like me when I'm not there but when I am actually there not so much this time there was like the the tables that we were at had tablecloths that draped over and she was sitting in in I think it was my mom's lap who was who was sitting next to me and I I looked at her and tried to talk to her and she kind of stared at me for a second and then got under the table
and then was like hello and started  me kids deal the sickest Burns cuz they have no filter they just do what they feel you know so brutal hopefully she'll uh you know I'm sure she'll get over it she just needs my presence she needs to get a little closer to your size and then she might not feel like the tables are so one-sided here yeah maybe that's part of it um yeah little kid birthday parties have always been funny to me because like man especially with our first when we were mostly dealing with other
firsttime parents and stuff like the kinds of Productions that people will do for a one-year-old or a 2-year-old's birthday and I would always just be looking at this going like you know they aren't going to remember any of this and when you try to sit them down in their teens or 20s and show them pictures of it they're not going to give two Hoots because they literally won't remember any of these people either like this is as long as you fully recognize that this is all for you then they would have been
just as happy with like I was going to say some packing peanuts to play with but at least not without supervision um they would have been just as happy with an empty cardboard box to crawl around in um then okay you do you but the amount of money people will spend on these parties it just blows my mind anyway I'm sure there was chill knowing your family it was probably fine yeah there was fine uh and everybody had a good time it was it was all good um but yeah I know anyway okay
rewinding for for packs yeah BL Grill the story of okay we're not we're not at Blue Water Grill yet the story of getting down there is interesting because this is important cuz I forgot the name of the place um the story of getting down there is interesting because I did detail how late we got there right so we didn't we didn't end up getting there until almost 3: in the morning right I I went down with with one of my buddies that I've known since like high school and the room that we
were supposed to get had one bed but it also had a pullout couch so we were like okay cool you can crash on that um we we get to the room that we were supposed to have there's no PO couch Okay cool so we get checked in no PO couch I don't really care I'm like we can just do the over under sheet thing I've done this a hundred times it doesn't matter to me but he was like uh and I was like I mean we we technically booked room that's supposed to have this thing we can call them and like see
maybe they have another room yeah yeah I'm sure they had plenty of rooms I mean it's not like it's the biggest event in Seattle turns out well I mean they still had tickets a couple days before the event they didn't sell out by the way they used to sell out like that you had to scrape the site to be able to buy tickets cuz they sold out so fast they did not sell out this time oh that's rough apparently a lot more people went this year than last year and they're expecting that growth to continue
because there's like this Resurgence postco yeah that makesense um so it's probably fine but yeah I don't I don't know but anyways so they they okay sounds good they switch us rooms we get in there we take a second to properly investigate because lo and behold it's the same room effectively it's on a different floor there's still no pull out couch we don't know what's really going on uh so we call down again it's now been like half an hour and it's pretty late really just want to go to
bed um but they're like we can bring you a cot we're like okay sure the C rolls up it takes a while but it rolls up looks amazing it's just a full-size mattress on a wheel frame so it's like sick sounds good um we start going to bed he gets inside he's like why is it so cold and I'm like what and he gets up and starts feeling around the whole cot is just not the whole cot about 30% of the cot is just soaking  so we called down and we're like what the heck and and uh they're like okay we can like
try to bring you another one they end up calling us back we don't have another one so we're like okay and they're like well we can we can just bring you like some extra blankets or something bring you a hair dryer we're like sure whatever like it's it's now been like an hour just if you're going to do something great if not like whatever 20 minutes later yeah it's been a long time at this point I'm actively trying to fall asleep I'm in bed 20 minutes later they call back up hey we're trying to find you a
cot just stop at this point I don't care I gave them like tons of bedding from the main bed we just layered it up it was fine it was all good in the morning I'm like can you guys like do anything about this about this by the way cuz that was like we not only did we not get what we paid for yeah I feel like someone's about to get called out here but carry on yeah um but also after multiple attempts of not getting what we paid for it took over an hour that we wanted to sleep and we
couldn't sleep and the Weston said no they said no they said no because I  apparently which is not fair and I'm not going to stop because I like Expedia personally but this is not they don't not sponsoring us that's garbage so annoying I I was it was incredibly frustrating it was a huge waste of time literal garbage soaking wet bed and then we went to Blue Water Grill the reason I wanted to call them out is because amazing restaurant that we used to go to every time we went to go to packs and it was
packed every time we went there you had to wait in line to be able to order we walked up nobody there really food still amazing they said that there's a new convention building so they're still using the old one but they're also using this new one and they said that they think it diverted foot traffic because now people are going not on the path now or whatever so people are going to restaurants that are in between the two buildings they're not going to Blue Water Grill Blue Water Grill is had to
pull back their hours because Pax isn't the only convention doing this so they used to get tons of traffic from the convention because they're really close to the convention center so maybe check out Blue Water girl the food's still amazing to make good stuff Pax itself was fun the gaming Halls spent about three or four hours checking those out and then was completely done and okay with it yeah to be honest yeah that kind of makesense not that interesed there's this new
theme where uh all the games are handing out like cards with QR codes on them to wish list their game oh okay so back in the day you used to get like shirts and now you just have like a stack of cards cards H I could see people getting into that I mean it might be more effective for the developers and publishers so like that's cool how about we meet in the middle shirts with big QR codes on them horrible free free clothes for Luke and you get people to wish list your game whenever you take a photo of
someone it's that' be pretty funny actually um there was some we should do it just like could be the the shirt could have like a QR code on the back of it dude I'd be so down that' be sick um people are saying that apparently it is standard practice that there's nothing that they can do when you book through third parties and I had a similar experience that's ridiculous though uh okay oh you know what this reminds me of if you sign up for a subscription service through the Google
Play Store they like can't do anything for you I've noticed that you have to I've had that problem before I actually hate that me too by the way that's insane um but this may not be the Weston's fault entirely they should have dealt my my rebuttal to this I'm not taking a side I'm not taking a side all right all right my reut and I I left the the lady at the counter that said like we can't do anything I left her alone it's not she can't do anything about it it's not her fault to be super
clear but I don't believe that because none of this was expedia's fault they gave us the wrong room they gave us the wrong room again y they gave us a wet C and they failed to solve that problem Expedia did none of that so like like I'm sure there is something that you could do and you're just trying to get away with it that's that's how I feel I mean at the very least what they almost certainly could do is give you a voucher for the hotel restaurant or something like that something at the
very least they should be able to do that something all right what is our next thing Dan hit us sure let's do some merch messages and oh sorry one last thing about packs they did massively expand the tabletop areas though and those are super sick now that's pretty cool like actually really cool they have a huge tabletop free play area where you can play all these different games that people are showing off the tabletop Expo area itself is much bigger and to be honest I think that makes a ton of sense
because the amount of games that are publishing demos on Steam now have massively gone up that's great so you could really go to the video game area just by staying home and playing steam demos but the tabletop stuff you can't experience just at home home yeah so that part was really cool Gaming's coming full circle let's go we're going back yeah yeah and there's some really crazy good like the the slay the Spire tabletop game is really highly rated the uh Divinity tabletop game is really
highly rated I really like Co-op tabletop games um and they had a whole section that was just Co-op tabletop games the whole thing was really cool actually so I was happy to see that they must have recognized this as well like the gaming area is less interesting than it used to the video gaming area is less interesting than it used to be let's maybe expand tabletop and the the new convention building was like almost all tabletop stuff which was sick anyways that's it all right hit us Dan oh we
should explain merch messages if you want to interact with the show the way to do it is through a merch message we don't do YouTube uh super chats we don't do twitch bits we do dust thing uh we do merch messages so all you got to do is head over to LTT store.com and add something to your cart you'll see a little box pop up when we're live or you can leave a merch merch message it'll go to producer Dan who will reply to it bone bomb weird reply but thanks Dan good solid effort uh he'll forward it to
someone internally who can address your question hold on is that like a tears of the Kingdom oh yeah bone plus bomb Oh I couldn't see the I couldn't see the plus from I was like that's got to be a gaming reference or something or he'll curate it for me and Luke and sometimes Dan himself to reply to so he's going to show you a couple examples of what that might look like uh Dan you want to hit us with the with the merch message what's wrong with Luke uh no sorry I just saw something that we'll end up
talking about later in the show oh okay oh I think Luke finally found the thing that you guys are probably going to be ordering sure why don't we just show them that first I did we can go to my screen I guess this is community guidelines t-shirt uh if you didn't know because you weren't here for the beginning of the show we got a video taken down uh and at this point you probably do know if you watch the L show that whenever something unfortunate happens to us we make a t-shirt commemorating the
occasion the community guidelines shirt designed by the one and only Sarah but will be available for a limited time uh you can give us your impressions on the design um and like all of our is there a way to do that I actually have no idea what they mean by that anyway like all of our other limited edition T-shirts this will be print to order on our custom soft and longlasting LTT blanks the ones that were rated so highly by project Farm very very recently and they'll be printed by our local printing
partner who just does such an outstanding job of the quality that um sometimes it takes us a long time to get things printed because it's a small operation and we just can't accept any substitute at this point I think it's really cool it almost it's yeah that's a cool take on it I originally thought it was just going to be the text that was originally discussed and I was like H this is cool it's kind of a it's kind of a you know it's more abstract inspired design by you know the entity that might
had something to do with this whole controversy um if you look closely there's no solution to that no I I got that too you know it's hard to it could be challenging to navigate um you know the modern interwebs and all of its difficulties and so it says a lot without without having any text I think it's great it says a lot I think that uh I I think that Sarah did a great job it's available now at g. g/c Community guidelines we're going to go ahead and throw that in the chat boom boom boom
boom and the color choice there's black if you don't like the green there there's black there's other color choices there's black yep go for it guys easy all right Dan show us how merch messages work sure yeah I've got one here for you lonus years ago you offered to pay the reopening cost of an Asian restaurant in a mall that closed you mentioned that they footed your bill once and won your loyalty did this ever come to pass to be clear they credited me they they like gave me an advance I
did reimburse them for that for that lunch uh no I I never heard from them I I would have loved to my offer is still open I actually the exact place you're talking about I actually can't remember exactly what it was called anymore but it was an Aberdine mall and it was just a delicious little little F Place Basil Leaf it was called basil leaf and they had this this like egg jelly dessert thing that I really hated the first time I ate it and then now  probably H if it was the only way that I
could ever get it again and if I if I had the opportunity right now if he was like I will make you one right now it will cost you $50 I would probably pay for it I would I would probably do it assuming it's a one-time thing like I wouldn't buy it for $50 every day that'd be crazy but I I think I think to have it one more time and remember part of this is you know just having enjoyed it so many times it's the it's the The Nostalgia of enjoying it again you could think of it kind of like buying a game
that you played as a kid you'd spend way you'd spend way more to kind of relive that it's also just like I I still remember the first time I ate there with you and you got me to get the dessert thing and you got me to eat it and I was like this sucks and you're like yeah you'll figure it out or whatever I don't remember exactly what you said and and  God I need more of that thing know it's amazing uh yeah so if uh if the owner of Basil Leaf if he's still around if this ever makes it to him um I I would I
would be happy to help you start up again as long as I can as long as I can come get that dessert again and and and and delicious soup uh and I will pay $50 for my first pudding but after that I want to pay menu price for the rest yeah after that after that okay what else you got Dan uh let's go through the rest of the announcements and then we'll do another one of the end announcements oh oh yeah we have a few more announcements the Precision screwdriver popup is tomorrow this will
be your opportunity to get hands on with the brand new LT Precision multi-bit screwdriver in bitset we're going to be having testing stations where you can feel how it Stacks up with the competition and you'll be able to talk to our engineering team about the driver itself you will also be able to purchase one of 500 limited edition numbered Precision screwdrivers as well as some other items from LTD store.com um we oh I don't want to say some of this stuff uh but what I will say is
please don't travel to far for this event it's probably too late to book a flight anyway that isn't a challenge uh we really don't have a ton of capacity we do not have a ton of capacity so if if you're local and you happen to need a Precision screwdriver set hey we'll see you tomorrow September 7th from 10:00 a.m. to 2 p.m at the lonus Media Group studio in Siri BC you can check out our social accounts where we'll have more detailed information if you're swinging by uh also the Precision screwdriver bit
set and case are releasing tomorrow if you are not able to come to the popup oh okay oh wow so it's going to be available online Saturday September 7th we've shown it off a ton on the W show and in our videos we're really happy with how it turned out we can't wait for you to get your hands on it and what time cuz are we are we waiting for reviews to come in from the popup or what's I think they're going live at the same time if you want to be notified the moment it drops to secure yours you can
sign up at lmg Dogg Precision pretty exciting Dan if you want to copy that link uh we also have an we also have an update on the off-site laptop bag we got some feedback about the off-site laptop bag that we launched a few weeks past uh some customers are incredibly happy with purchase um another review exactly what I expected and needed some people are not as happy and felt like the messaging that we had on the site didn't line up with what they expected um so we hear that customers were disappointed with
their purchase so we've taken it down from the website while we do an update to some of the messaging to clear up some things about the B's capacity both in the description and in photos as always if you're unhappy with your purchase reach out to support and trust me bro we're going to do everything we can to make it right that is something we've always been consistent about um if you are wondering by the way we are going to have it available at the popup it's it's not a quality issue it's an
expectation management issue so uh I had no qualms telling the team yeah go ahead have it available at the popup because if people can see it in person then there's going to be no misund understanding and no um yeah no no false expectation or anything it'll it'll be what it is it'll be right there so they can buy it or not buy it the last thing uh is hey scrapyard War season 9 thanks to everyone who watched thanks to everyone who joined float plane to watch the extras and
behind the scenes Jawa has picked the winners of the grand prizes the rigs we built this season with both of our signatures on each of them are going to Marcus R from Texas who won the okay system from Team Duke and Diego V from color W the cheater system from won the amazing build from Team old man be not actually winners yeah you know we won uhuh you know we won cheated you know we won you cheated I didn't cheat you did tell me how I cheated uh having the person that you pay collaborate with
you on cheating doesn't make it not cheating sorry what what are you even talking about be able to go over budget be I didn't go over budget you did I never went over budget you did temporarily no no no no no the money hadn't left my wallet no still counts if if you buy something align with a credit card that money is out of your account it is not yes it is it actually isn't it is though it isn't if you place a purchase if you place a purchase it is on your credit card which you can pay in
30 days with money from your account so you're still over Bud debit card comes out of your account immediately why would debit card Visa pays for it for you yes they do yes they do account congratulations to the winners and a big thank you to Java for partnering with us this season we'll have a link in the description where you can check them out LC is going to destroy one of the computers now dude it's going to go kick it over they're just to your is it just to your right oh yeah there they are I
for what you guys did that I saw I think it was in part to that was extremely questionable yeah no no no I saw you guys pull some look at him right now he knows look is a Flawless person who also didn't cheat at all never what was it nothing we didn't go budget no I no no I know that no no no was all it was your SSD nonsense dude the fact that the fact that you guys got to sub out a better SSD oh yeah but yours didn't even wasn't even going to work highly yes it was which is why we were allowed to do that
by the way no way no way mine would have capacity so they never that was never a requirement he said it was for us yeah but he didn't tell me yeah well so if I don't know I don't know maybe the guy that you paid was letting you cheat oh come on cuz in the past we would have had to go back and forth on on any rule bending oh that is such oh that is such a load of crap it's unfortunate uh that your win is illegitimate but don't make me call David don't make me call David
me you can call that guy that you pay to make up rules and let you cheat as much as you want you are going to bmer the good reputation of one David go oh no it's not his fault wow you got to do what you got to do to get to you know oh man you got to do what you got to do he told me in a in a post event interview that he likes cheating which is why he allowed it to happen allowed what to happen you're cheating I didn't cheat you did cheat I didn't cheat you did cheat you know what we will let you guys
be the judge have to watch the real ulterior motive no I'm very angry yeah I see that um we will let you guys be the judge because there is a Tracker throughout I believe Parts two to four of our of our existing balances so we'll let you guys de Does it include when you uh it includes everything spent money on your credit card it includes everything Does it include you going over the budget when you spent money on your credit card it includes everything do you go into the negatives when that
happens it includes everything Luke does it show that it it shows everything it shows everything people are asking for a poll they want a poll I think Luke regrets not doing the same Strat no on camera Elijah asks if we can do the same Strat and I say no cuz that would be too much cheating no it's it's not cheating unfortunately it is it's not cheating yeah it's not well we'll let the people we'll let the people we'll let the people who watch be the judge I think he's just I think he's
actually he's lashing out I'm extremely angry because what he's really upset about  teammate choosing the worst possible Benchmark and bunking up the overclock see we've done to the root of the issue no no dude Luke's a team player okay Luke would defend a teammate to the death no matter how wrong they were mhm so Luke has to attack me but what he's really salty about what he's really  about wow it seems like that uh that pole is saying that you cheat it's it's great having the dude the fact that only
60% of them are siding with you means that I won no dude no not all always side with you it looks like the next polls results are definitely yes as well they all cheated 110% look at this you guys look at this  motherland they've got two they've got two polls regular pole no no that's fine they can see it regular pole and nonbiased pole did you really spell pole wrong dang it and we're professionals here well maybe uh maybe Luke isy cuz he cheated oh man yep professional
Integrity speaking of issues with the last scrapyard Wars where the heck is my trophy oh well you don't deserve one we didn't do trophies this year what we didn't do trophies this year you guess maybe David preemptively knew that he was going to allow you to cheat so I'm I'm going to I'm going to let you guys watch I'm going to let you guys watch the series it's actually actually I think watching through it's the best one ever I I have too much like personal attachment to season 4
yeah really but this it's it's absolutely incredible team did a great job I if I if I had if I was purely a viewer and I had to side by side one this one's probably better but just I have just working with Rod and the stuff we're able to do in season 4 and stuff was just like Bob and Rod are such characters yeah it was pretty amazing the experience of season 4 looked so good honestly I I love having a teammate sort of regardless um and for me scrap Wars is more fun even though it was really different
um I equally enjoyed working with Bob and working with Sammy even though in the case of of the fourth scrapyard Wars uh you know Bob's expertise was obviously way more applicable to what we were trying to do like modded system the desk but the setup stuff yes which ended up contributing in a big way but in terms of like which one was more helpful minute to minute you know I couldn't I couldn't just sick Sammy at like okay go do that and then I can completely tune out but I actually really enjoyed the
different perspective compared to working with someone way more likeminded like a bob and Rod where their interests are all like the overlap with mine is a perfect circle whereas having Sammy who is very different from me provide that very different perspective and that very different skill set was a ton of fun and I think what I would like to if we were to ever do scrapyard Wars again I think I would like to try to capture that again having like you know like an Odd Couple VI contrast on the teams on the
teams yeah exactly that's an interesting idea there's a reason they do that in reality TV it's not an accident I have I I feel like you probably feel the same way I suspect even when you don't have a team teate you end up like somewhat forming a team using the like cameraa so like because you like you need you're going through so much crazy crap SC Wars is genuinely an insane experience to film yeah we all end up super invested every time they're like they're like behind the camera like
they're basically end up like fighting each other because like the the hosts are like fighting each other and the camera operators are like getting in on it it's fantastic it's very uh it's a little tribal um but it's it's kind of easier when your teammate is actually involved with the challenges and not just trying to capture the challenges to in order to have that bonding stuff T ofun but uh ton of fun yeah it was great you should watch it are we doing the thing the allinone video thing
all Scrappy do in one video oh yeah that was something we were going to kind of prime you guys for we're not really sure we've never really done this sort of thing before but like a compilation video um lots of channels do it like big channels small channels they'll put together a bunch of projects like kids channels will do this all the time they'll have like like three hours of just their videos just cut together and uploaded as one particularly effective on kids channels but I do see other
channels do it as well but should we just cut together the entire scrapyard Wars 9 and just upload it as a video I don't think it would perform well out of the gate but that kind of mega long form content it would be almost 2 hours with with all four pieces can do really well on the channel are you guys going to be like mad if we upload that or is that is that chill are we good it's a bit of a gamble um I would be very interested like I I almost want us to do it just for the science DVD box set that is we
actually talked about it before doing like a director's commentary like Blu-ray remember that we I think we almost cuz it was for we talked about doing it on vessel yeah as like a as like an exclusive and then we just like never because I oh this is all coming back C stuff no we we wanted to do it because we were like oh we could do that as like a as like a virtual Blu-ray and and you could like buy it and it was around the time we did the Christmas album I think as we were
experimenting with like digital releases but like like traditional media releases this is back when more people had like yeah Blu-ray players and St like people bought PlayStation because they wanted the Blu-ray player more playst it was a different time it was a very different time um but it's it's an interesting discussion I I don't know I'm I'm very I'm not saying that we should do it necessarily but I'm very interested in us doing it just for the science more than anything so I want to see what it
does to the channel um I still think I understand it's not Clips but I think it's a good channel to use for it but I think the previous Seasons should go up as compilations on lmg clips I'm still I still think that would be cool I pitched um as my sort of maybe solution that we do all the seasons on Linus Tech tips but we upload them like all at the same time so we basically kill any uh notification viewership on them and we just let them algorithmically just boil over time go
out there and see what happens cuz there's a lot of videos that we have by accident released with a very very small initial subscriber push uh one of them is like a weird controller video where someone accidentally ticked unticked notify subscribers oh no um another one is one where we went live multiple times because of errors in the Stream the previous day and we had used up our allotment of notifications so like a Saturday morning video that didn't get a notification like there's been times
when it's happened and in the end it mostly comes out in the wash and they they tend to do okay as long as they're good content and the retention is good I know of a channel I don't want to I don't want to dunk on them they're a friend um but I know of a channel that uh hey I see did this and you can see the view impact on a lot of them which was a dump from another platform and usually they get like these numbers and it it some of them ended up doing okay in the long run
but the majority of them but give them time let them cook that's a couple months ago when I say in the long term I mean over a couple of years big long term okay yeah like videos that go they'll go another interesting variable to try to keep in mind here but it's going to be tough is the impact of this on the individual uploads from the past I CU like are you just cannibalizing those views or are you getting new views I would suspect it's going to be and I mean this is pure speculation but I
would suspect that it would be mostly net new and the reason I say that is because the YouTube audience is unfathomably big I think that we we think of ourselves as sort of understanding the size of it we don't understand the size of it I mean look at what's been happening with Cristiano Ronaldo the idea that 50 million people could be subscribing to him in a span of how many days was it I don't know soccer player no I know who it is did they start a YouTube channel yeah he started 
football oh two death looks that's crazy um yeah so he's up to 58 million he started a couple days ago wa so that should give you some idea oh dude he's killing it that should give you some idea dude it's not a few days ago it's a couple weeks ago whatever the point is the point is that the audience is huge the appetite for content is huge the number many people you think like I used to always tell you like we're going to reach a saturation there's no way you "can get more than 100,000 views on a"
video about a hard drive there's no way "you can get more than 250,000 views on a" video about a a CPU there's no way like I've been saying this over and over and over again and then at some point you might have noticed I stopped saying it because the audience is unlimited as long as you're passionate about what you're talking about as long as you can make it engaging and entertaining you can make a video about anything and you can get millions and millions and millions of people who are into it I
mean our biggest video ever our most viewed video ever is building a PC using onlywish decom all I do is build a computer that's our biggest ever now if you had asked me if you had asked me it's a really funny video have you ever watched it R fire truck it's really funny Tru video Bring It Back the point is if you had asked me when I started the channel back when a huge YouTube "channel might have a 100,000 subscribers" right if you had asked me could there possibly even be 23 million people on
Earth who would sit and watch a video about building a computer I'd have thought you were high like your guess is high I I would never accuse someone of of partaking of of course not I just could you I would have thought something like that to be un fathomable right um but it absolutely is fathomable it's fully fathomable and so I forget what point I'm trying to make right now but the audience is enormous don't underestimate it hey how to build a PC the last guy you'll ever need didn't
that do poorly when it first launched yeah 11 million views yeah D yeah well that's the thing it's cooking dude you gotta you gotta you got to understand what you're uploading you got to know okay is this a slow burn or is this is something that's going to be a a short and bright burn and then just fade into nothing and there's there's both of those and there's everything in between um in fact we how to build a PC hold on to PC we've actually uploaded to how to build a PC the last guides you'll ever
needs and you can actually see if you look at the analytics here on the more recent one which is updated like it's an updated version so if we dig look at this garbage garbage performance "in the first days never stops 533,000" views and like you'll get remember that time you uploaded that video how to basics uh how to install a GPU yeah yeah I'll go find it I'll go find it after this um it did horrible out of the gate we got horrible people were mad they were so mad that we would upload a video
that was so basic just how to install a  Furious we'll get back to that but first this one you can see abute dog crap oh it goes into the typical band and escape velocity let's go because it's a different kind of content it's designed for a different kind of Engagement where people are being served this video because it is an incredible resource and it is the We Believe Ultimate Guide to research sear in learning how to spec how to understand what you're doing and ultimately how to
build a PC Sebastian from the creative Warehouse engineering team said that you can see on the old one when the second one was uploaded looking at its analytics oh yeah that that's makes a lot of sense but is super interesting that totally makes sense here we'll we'll play uh dig around in the dashboard with lonus here uh yep okay uh yeah yeah makes sense that it would flatten out a little bit yeah but you can see actually if we go get some views there's no there used to be a
really easy way to zoom in there was a little interface down at the bottom where you could just kind of drag the window for what period you want to look at is it a drag select like can you can you click on the thing and then drag it across and then unclick and no no no they just took away that and I keep every time they ask me hey what features do you want to see in the dashboard I tell them that not less features would be nice and every time they just don't do that which is um well as a as a
person guys I know that I can key in a custom value but it's tedious as a person who runs a development team with people who ask them for features 100% of the time I can sympathize but also we don't have the people and resources that they have yeah they're literal Google and it's a feature that they used to have just don't take it out okay uh this one is a little less obvious because I think they've actually changed the interface um or rather they've changed the way they collect the data with old
uh with old videos so you can see it's just showing it's just showing daily views for whatever reason um and I think I have to I think I have to go into advanced mode in order to see the the lifetime thing so yeah like this is clearly clearly not helpful but the point is that it started with really really poor um poor stats you can see it recovered somewhat not entirely but people were freaking freaking angry genuinely furious at about this one they were really I remember correct I would check the check
the comments now cuz the top voted comment when this first released was just like rage uh oh the comments are probably fine now probably instructions unclear jammed GPU into RAM slot now have gddr5 Ram heck yeah was expecting eggs and disgusting things happen yeah it was kind of a play on howto basic it was like how to basics but it was like real Basics yeah um yeah like this is this is all fine yeah it was rage back in the day um yeah well look at look at me replying to comments wow yep
anyway oh this is great this is amazing what a great insightful comment rather touchy audience you've built here great video like Yeah the more things change the more they stay the same appreciate you all  do oh what are we supposed to be doing Dan I got one more merch message for you and then we'll move on to some more topics did they know it was going to get worse sorry I keep going lies continue love you hey hey low density lipo  BL hello low density lipoprotein did
yall get access to the 7600 x3d what do you all think of it being a Microcenter exclusive um I did actually have our our CEO Taran who is down in California right now ask if uh we wanted one and I basically said I I don't I would like to give Luke some time to work with the lab's team and get our processes in order before we tackle any benchmarking videos other than the ones that we need to this is such a low impact product because it's exclusive to exus one US retailer um that I don't think it's
necessarily relevant to the broader audience and I'm sure there are going to be folks out there that are going to cover it sufficiently I just didn't feel like we needed to throw our voice into this one yeah I agree um um do do you think this is just like a weird binning thing where they just had a bunch of CPS they didn't really know what to do with so they were like uh almost certainly this is going to be the leftovers of Dy that didn't manage to make the cut for any other 3D vcash Pro um product yeah
and they have so many of them that it would be wasteful to throw them away but not so many of them uh that they can justify a broader release of the product and guarantee that they're going to have any kind of ongoing supply of it um that they wouldn't have to then Salvage from higher tier products so the way it used to work is that if you had a lower tier product like 7600 x3d you would release that and then if someone wanted to buy a 7600 X 3D but you didn't have enough
dies that failed to be a 7800x 3D you would just take 7800x 3DS and you would fuse off some of it and you would just sell it as a 7600 X 3D but they just don't really um do that anymore because capitalism basically um and In fairness to companies like AMD I I suspect that times are a little bit tighter um there have been certainly everybody right now there have certainly been plentiful times uh for the IT industry but right now it Wafers cost more than they ever have um getting the most out of out of
every die is is definitely something that at the very least your shareholders want to see um and so it's disappointing to me that we can't continue to just kind of you know I don't know yeah sell a 7800 X 3D as a 7600 X 3D and just kind of eat the margin on it in order to serve that lower Budget customer right because at the end of the day that that is how many lowbudget chips existed in the past was them blending the costs on these products and basically going okay as
long as we don't sell too many of these and we position them we we cut them down enough ER that they're not too enticing we can continue to sell the higher-end one we can make a we can make a profitable model out of this and those are still there they're still available as a budget option that just doesn't really exist anymore and and I do think that this product would C would um not suffocate would um cannibalize the 7800 x3d in a big enough way that if they released it broadly they would
effectively be discounting those dies that they could have sold as 7800 x3d so this is a long and convoluted way of saying I don't like it I get it um congrats to anyone who lives near enough to a Micro Center that they can go pick up one of these because it looks like an outstanding gaming chip for a pretty decent price I I don't love it but I don't think I would do anything else if I was AMD really like it it makes sense it just kind of sucks if you if it is the thing that you would want to get and
you can't reasonably get it um I have a really random aside I saw someone say I live really close to two microcenters lfg let's go yeah basically with a little F in the middle there um that acronym confused me for a little while because on certain sentences that I saw it being used with it like could have been looking for group um and I was like okay what this only like sort of makes sense like it barely makes sense and then I finally figured out that it was let's go with an F in the middle took me
a little while to realize people weren't  language that's pretty good you want to know one that still screws me up a little bit yeah ofc of course I very legitimately thought it was of with an F word in the middle course for a long time really thought people were like really upset or angry when they were using it and after like quite a while I think I I think I heard someone else reading it out loud and they said of course and I was like oh yeah no it's it's not aggro I thought it was like super aggro
for years yeah there's people saying yeah I thought it was that but apparently it's not a lot of people don't use they use it as of course yeah and it's it's a super weird one to me because most of the time that's not how that works yeah so I I re like I I man and like I used it that way for for a long time and I don't think people necessarily understood that I like yeah it was you know there's a little bit more emphasis behind it um oh that's great my my probably and I still read it
that way and then have to like mentally correct and keep going my personal favorite is that Dennis for the longest time thought ft meant Taiwan so he would just see it all over the place be like why do people hate Taiwan so much EVGA had FTW cards back in the day that must been really awkward yeah oh boy amazing love that guy um all right acronyms what are we supposed to be doing Dan topics keep us on keep us on track here what else do we got up here gdpr is a service what oh my goodness this is going to
make you so mad oh boy multiple sources have noted a general rise in consent or pay gdpr popups AKA cookie walls these popups instead of offering the option to accept or decline cookies offer only the option to accept cookies or pay a fee of or a subscription this would on face value appear to violate the text of the eu's general data protection regulation which requires consent to be explicitly requested easily withdrawn and freely given freely given quotes with an equivalent method
of accessing the content without accepting any kind of tracking however this year the Spanish data Protection Agency released a use guideline for cookies that clarified that this alternative did not necessarily have to be free of charge this seems to have made several companies much Bolder in offering expensive subscription Alternatives that casual browsers are unlikely to pay it's unclear at this point whether the rest of the EU will support this interpretation what the heck are you doing oh sorry
sorry sorry I the Guardians is not one of those sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry they have a really really big cookie popup but it does not actually prevent you from accessing the site did you say the guardians or did I say the I no I I I I brought up a thing um they just they just get really sad about it when you don't uh accept cookies oh yeah so yep that no no no hold on uh let's if you guys can think of an example of one that actually prevent you from accessing it I don't personally know of one yes and in
theat I've seen it I've come across it clicking things in my Google news feed like I just can't click through to it unless I accept cookies they're like you can either pay or you can um or you can accept cookies if you say no I don't accept cookies they just are like okay see you  know oh I think we're about to get a hot  as a as a website owner obviously I don't want to do this but it I I feel like is is it not up to the website owner to decide how people interact with the website and this is
transparent in that form you're telling people you have the option to just not go to the website it's not life or death to go to this website or not you do it sucks but I'm just going to leave  so interesting I don't know I don't think this is what the EU had in mind with gdpr I think that what they had in mind was um transparency around cookies and otherwise being unimpeded I think that's why it doesn't bother me that much is I still prefer this over what we had in the past I don't want people just forcing
cookies um so if you're like hey I would rather you either aren't on my website you have cookies or you're paying to be here I and I have the choice to just be like well then I'm just not going to be on your website that sounds like a exchange to me that's going to bother some people I'm sure here's an example  okay can I go to Luke's laptop I I might take him up on that uh yeah I think you can okay here we go there we go read with advertising or subscribe Yep this is it this is the one thank you very
much for the link Ivan B in float plane chat this is a perfect example here you are agreeing to get a bunch of ads I mean In fairness to your take even though that may be a somewhat unpopular take with some people oh yeah In fairness to your take this is very transparent yeah my biggest thing is I need it to be transparent that's that was my issue with cookies forever is so many people didn't know that they were being tracked so many people didn't know I guarantee you now a huge percentage of
people don't realize that they're being tracked that advertisements are being pointed directly towards them based on their own data all this other type of stuff um I'm going to blow your mind some people like it yeah that I I believe you I know I know you're correct I have literally seen people complain earnestly like not just trolling complain about getting irrelevant ads they're like I use ads to like find interesting things to buy this is the  the we were talking the other day about
um I was watching a a live stream for stormgate and this is not this is not a gain stormgate at all to be clear but there was a like dog style combat unit on the screen and the twitch chat blew up talking about how they wanted to buy they wanted to buy all these different skins for the dog unit and I'm like like what happened to Gamers I don't I don't get it I'm not is it me or is it the kids or whatever however that quotes goes um but yeah this is this is one of those
situations where like I'm at least happy that this wall is here and if I'm I'm the host of this website and it's like you know I don't want to have people on my website that aren't either paying or uh sharing their data with apparently 156 Partners um then yeah I mean I think that's fine your website's going to get a lot less traffic you're probably never going to go viral or pop off or any of those types of things but that's the decision that you're making as a web host I don't know I don't think it's
going to go well for you but it it feels like to me like it's something that you should be able to do um if you uh if you hate people trying to buy skins for the dog don't watch Elijah's ultimate Tech upgrade all right I will not do that I uh I spent a not insignificant amount of it and our lunch we we headed to 7 Oaks mall for a crew lunch um trying to convince him to sell his uh well what's the forget what they're called not OS the other one the more popular one I don't
know dude the the little fig things yeah yeah yeah yeah sure I have no shoot whatever Funko funkos Funko Pops po yeah yeah I spent a not insignificant amount of it trying to convince him to sell his collection of Funko Pops yeah cuz he has like a genuinely insane amount doesn't he in the video in the video he says yeah if I sold them all I could probably be completely out of debt yeah that was that was the look on my face doesn't he whoa no no okay I I don't think he was necessarily including
like a mortgage okay but like no like like the worst kind of debt he has credit card debt I don't know if it's credit card okay don't if you're sitting on that oh I don't know if it's student loans or credit card uh now I didn't  much okay student loans okay it could be student loans that's way more reasonable it could be anything let's assume it's not credit card let's assume it's not let's assume it's not cool but if you have any kind of debt other than a mortgage totally um and you have something of
significant value guys you are going to be blown away by the sheer by the sheer volume of plastic in Elijah's home um o interesting does this make do do I suck cuz if it was Lego I probably wouldn't judge as much yeah does that make me suck probably yeah a little bit yeah okay yeah I'll take that sure yep yeah no and and and to be clear like I I I fully acknowledged to him that there have been things that I have collected I forget what the example I gave him was you got Lego you got nice Lego yeah I've
got and stuff I will tell you this I didn't have any Lego until oh yeah my house was paid off so yeah there's that um but I definitely I definitely had a nice computer um we are I'm saying we because you are in this category even though I always get called out for it which is fair but you are also in this category we are both very cheap you don't get to completely squirm away from this one no I I've never denied it and and and as as the company has grown my my mentality around it has changed a lot yes like
I I still don't like wasting money I hate I would I would rather spend "$110,000 than waste $10 if you if you" know what I mean like wisely spend "10,000 than than waste 10 yes" um yeah but uh but no I I was still able to come up with something that I that I collected and there there were definitely impractical purchases I made looking back buying designer breed cats was like the stupidest thing ever I I wouldn't do that again in fact I don't the our last four cats literally were
rescu them from outside your house scavenged from our yard because they were little kittens and they were going to die and then scavenged from the shed of our neighbor's friend cuz they were little kittens and they were had no home like that's where you should get a cat from like I I have made mistakes um sure we all do yeah but I just you know it is very it it is it it was a very painful theme for me to be surrounded by so much value of stuff when they're are clearly higher priorities but you know
what the thing is that to each their own at the same time if you enjoy something if if it if it genu see I think my biggest problem with it is I cannot relate to it genuinely bringing me any form of happiness at all if it brings him happiness if he thinks it's genuinely worth it all that kind of stuff you know what go to town okay it's just I'm just personally not into it what if it genuinely gives people happiness to put a Dal skin stupid on that dog skins what if it genuinely gives them happiness I
still it's it's like that thing where like I'll I'll I'll fight for your right to have an opinion that I don't agree with it's like that kind of a thing like sure dude do whatever if it makes you happy I don't think it's and when I see if I see you running around in a video game with like a $400 skin I'm going to laugh but I'm going to defend my right to laugh at it too like it's but you know what if if it genuinely makes you happy that shouldn't bother you who cares what I think well except that it
it does impact you because it has changed the entire calculus that game developers use to develop their product yeah cuz like Funko Pops haven't changed anything for me no they're just random plastic that peopley maybe that is why yeah yeah good job yeah cuz that sucks and it hasn't infested everything yep and Elijah made some aot of stuff Elijah made some wise choices most of his upgrade was really centered around his streaming setup and he's apparently averaging about 80 concurrence now which
is growing which is something that doesn't maybe sound like a lot if you compare it to the lik of summit or whatever it's a lot when you compare it to grinding at one viewer zero millions of people that are streaming to nobody I'm pretty sure genuinely having 80 viewers puts him in like probably top 1% or less oh he he memes now because I think it's above six he's in he's in the top. 3% on the platform now yeah yeah like six viewers is top 1% oh that's what you're saying yeah yeah no he's
he's he's up there in the best and so he's actually so I was very encouraging of like anything he was doing to improve the stream yeah that's cool except and he cares about it a lot I know that part except I found a box of model rocket engines oh yeah the face you're making tells me you don't know what he's planning to do with it oh he apparently already tried this once where he tried to do a rocket assisted punch using 3D printed like gauntlets  arm I tried to confiscate them Colin
wouldn't let me I mean he can't like steal things from his house well I told him I'd pay for them okay that's a that's an ethical but I didn't want him to have them yeah cuz I think he's going to do it again you shouldn't have paid for them though cuz then he's just going  more that's not very effective you should have just stole them the ethical thing would have been theft I think I think you're actually right I think the I think the ethical thing to do would have been to steal them yeah I
could still do it I mean I know where he lives now yeah we're going to have to do that I think okay you're gonna have to get yeah I it's the right thing to do sometimes theft is is actually the answer yeah I told him you can watch eyes show speed you can enjoy eyes show speed don't try to jump don't model your life after I show speech yeah when he set his house on fire it was fake wasn't it I know kaats was I don't know don't set your house on fire yeah don't set your house on fire
wait he didn't do it inside did he the rocket punch I don't know okay I don't know he just shouldn't do it at all you never really know look Elijah's precious and we must protect him at all costs even the cost  things oh speaking of costs it costs a lot to sponsor this show yeah the show is brought to you today by LG do you not lift like Dennis thanks to our sponsor LG you don't have to at all the gr Pro 17 in is thin and weighs just over 3 lb about the same as four to five medium

sold to gearbox do devs that sold their  defamed uh no I mean yeah once you sell it like it's it's kind of like this is why when George Lucas whines about what Disney did to Star Wars it's like first of all look in the mirror brother and second of all you sold it I don't really  do devs that sold their IP deserve money for their game being like kind of screwed up yeah no once you sell it you give up control and this is why uh you didn't sell lus Media Group well not why
it was part of why like it's you you're relinquishing everything when you sell it that's the whole point you don't get to you don't get to get your cake and eat it too yeah um it's not yours anymore yeah so sorry I realized I was miked there cuz I was eating a bite of my pizza um I was saying it's kind of like you know George Lucas whining about what Disney did to Star Wars first of all look in the mirror buddy and second of all um look at you sold it yeah you sold it yeah well yeah there's a lot to
unwrap there that's a that's a deep Rabbit Hole you won't be able to look at him very easily today oh oh my I mean shovels exist oh my if that's even what happened nobody knows um but yeah I don't know like it that sucks I didn't kill himself I feel bad for them uh but at the same time you sold right like it's that's what happens when you sell it's not yours anymore and your customers have every right to be angry at you for selling out cuz that's literally the definition of selling out
and they can also be angry at the company that ruined it yep they can be angry in general because this is something that they loved there's nothing that they can really like do about it it is what it is but they can be mad absolutely yep it's all it's all part of it I responsible big and small one there was once a time with you're responsible I don't know you get the responsible one I I they don't know me at all we're only described by size and you get responsible maybe they don't
know how how sized I am or maybe H I don't know I feel like they probably do they're wrong anyways we can keep going uh there was once that time with desktop CPUs and laptops but due to Intel having only two gens per socket it didn't make any sense why do you think we never saw that for am4 all right I think you may have your wires crossed a little bit there was a time with socketed laptop processors back in the day um and you could make the argument that part of the problem was that Intel
would only support a particular platform with new CPUs for one or two two generations um but the real issue was that the volume of those laptops that were sold were so little that even with multiple generations of CPUs going into them you couldn't move enough of them to justify the R&amp;D that it would cost to create them now that's separate from the Once Upon a Time of desktop CPUs and laptops that absolutely exists today and absolutely did exist for am4 uh desktop processor laptop uh Cleo is a
company that does all kinds of wild stuff and here you go this is from two years ago uh the xmg Apex 1550 Max with b550 chipset am4 socket and RTX 3060 here's here's a thing uh oh wait this is just a German translation the point is xmg is just a like a a dealer for Cleo and and uh man some of the other ones don't spring to mind right now but clo in particular has done a lot of desktop CPU laptops and they they definitely have existed for am4 I'm not sure if anyone's done an am5
one I I'm not aware of any but I I wouldn't put it I wouldn't put it Beyond anybody no I haven't actually I I don't I don't immediately see any there's also not that much of a point these days like the mobile Zen 5 stuff is really really good and most of the benefit of these desktop chips is having a higher power envelope but these mobile chips are the desktop chips are coming down in the amount of power that they need anyway and these mobile chips are able to Turbo a core or two cores up to frequencies
that are on par almost in many cases with these desktop chips and most of the loads that most people are yeah most of the loads that most people are using on a laptop are only going to take advantage of a couple of cores running Peak turbo anyway so it's there's just not much of a benefit these days and it's hard to create an attractive design that has to deal with all that heat when you're going up against products that are honestly pretty competitive anyway  thin okay and last one for now hey dll
uh you never mentioned what part failed on the lowest rated PC I'm really curious what died we still don't know uh we didn't really invest a bunch of time in figuring it out because we just didn't really care I mean the whole point of that video was we bought the worst stuff that in many cases was really low rated because of its high probability of failure and faed and then it failed what all of them no way so we're just we're just looking around like okay well it's dead now um we've
made our video I don't really see what else there is to we made our point so no further testing required I mean this is the thing that uh I feel like has been controversial at some point in the past but once you know a certain amount about a product I remember this coming up when we did our um I'm going to go outside you guys I don't what you guys think I'm talking about but we did our true wireless headphones up okay yeah that makes sense yeah um when we did our true wireless headphones Roundup
way back in the day uh one of the initial uh categories or one of the initial evaluation criteria was Comfort because from point of view it could sound like God's lips Whispering into your ears but if it sucks to wear but if it was extremely uncomfortable we weren't going to recommend it so some people took issue with that particular uh conclusion because to them um comfor about the audio quality was not important like they didn't necessarily agree with the with the tiered approach
that we had taken to whittling down our contestants but the reality of it was we had like 50 wireless headphones we couldn't put all of them through the suite especially when like if we found something that had 35 minutes of battery life who cares if you're not even listening to an entire album before you have to charge it yeah it's that's pretty annoying it's uncompetitive and it's not relevant right and so so there are cases where you know say for example even if the performance did live up to
what the manufacturer claimed if the cost and utter inconvenience of using it not to mention incompatibility with any other part of the ecosystem already disqualified it from consideration it's just not really relevant and so in the same way the the the the lowest PC we had evaluated it for what it was a crappy computer that had a high likelihood of failure diagnosing what exactly in particular about it failed was not relevant for telling the story of this particular product or or collection of
products it wasn't it wasn't relevant to the story all right what else you got oh you want a fourth sure sure why not uh okay let's see rule Breakers I cheating hey lonus Luke and Dan oh wow a normal one for once my wife is crunchy okay never mind I love to install Smart Home Tech but her friends and family think I'm causing health problems with all of it do you  effects well if you wrap your whole body with just little like holes in particular areas with tin foil you're
fine yeah then they should be uh they should be able to be crunchy yeah and still sound crunchy as well um I don't know there's there's a subset of the population that seems to treat science like a sort of religion and it works both ways there are people who are Pro science who treat it like a religion and there are people who are anti-science and treat it like a religion but science is not a religion science is inherently different from that in that it is constantly evolving
and challenging itself to do better as a as a system of shaping our worldviews theoretically but because there are people on both sides of the pro- or anti-science argument that treat it like religion it sometimes gets extremely muddy if you're dealing with those people on either end of the spectrum and you try to have a conversation about what our what our knowledge base tells us at this current time you are bound to be met with resistance so what I'm trying to say is if someone believes now that
Wi-Fi or Smart Home Tech is is harmful to the human body you are unlikely to um change their mind in the only way that could possibly change their mind which would be to show them the facts about the impact of that radiation on their body compared to just an hour of sitting out in the sun eating a banana um but I would say if you want some amount of compromise it might not be a bad idea to no Wi-fi Zone parts of your house like something uh &amp; have started doing is a very hardcore no
phones in bed rule not allowed that's it just no no like for anything so it's interesting and I genuinely think that has been life improving because even if it's like I'm just going to dgen and scroll on my phone well okay get up yeah which I think is good because half the time I'm we're both so add that by the time we've gotten up it's like well now there's things to do so I'm not going to sit and just like scroll on my phone so it might be a decent idea just because I think um a lot of Modern Life
and a lot of people in Modern Life are are too terminally connected to the internet to have certain areas of the house that like aren't and the bed was your priority yeah there's other activities there's things to do   uhhuh oh that was dangerous I didn't even do it I'm just going to put that a away all right uh what are we supposed to be doing Dan well more topics sure more topics yeah I think we have that power Dude where's my Tesla um according to the San Francisco Chronicle Oakland law enforcement
sought to obtain warrants to tow Teslas not because they were parked illegally or were involved in any kind of illicit activity but because they happened to be parked near possible crime scenes on three separate occasions between July and August of this year what police apparently wanted to obtain footage  cameras so by simply driving a Tesla and parking it somewhere oh what you could be turning your car into a surveillance station for Oakland law enforcement a representative of the
Richmond California Police Officers Association told the chronicle that this is a common practice and that officers will typically try to contact a vehicle owner to solicit voluntary voluntary cooperation but they will resort to getting a warrant to tow the vehicle if they don't receive a timely response I'm just going to say man nothing really happens that makes me not everything that happens in the automotive space makes me more and more happy that I have the car that I have
nothing happens in the automotive space really there's like maybe something here or there very rarely that actually makes me like want a different car all of this stuff is like oh sweet my car will never be involved in this yeah that's awesome I don't want my car to randomly get towed because some officer dude is like h i could like another angle like that sucks I don't want to deal with that at all tell me this though if they asked nicely and they were like yeah someone
was mugged here and your car was parked there would would you would you cooperate with law enforcement if if it you know could help them track down some n do well you know what I'd probably do is I'd go look at it myself and then determine because we've seen enough uh enough not good stuff um that I'd like to know basically yep that's fair enough oh speaking of law enforcement unfortunately the collab with the Maple Ridge guys on the big phone bust is not going to happen yeah
they need everything for evidence and whatever we we can't get access to any of the devices so that's a bummer I had really hoped to be able to kind of talk through exactly how the scam works I thought it would have been a really cool like Public Service uh or uh yeah PSA Public Service Announcement um but unfortunately the the wheels of Justice turn slowly and really weirdly sometimes so even though my understanding is they have like a ton of devices as part of the bust they can't spare any because
they need it that's a bummer no this just a bummer Windows mixed reality is disappearing now to be clear I don't care I never really understood what the point of Windows mixed reality is so maybe if there's someone who's an Enthusiast out there I'd love to hear from you cuz as far as I could tell the main attraction for Windows mixed reality devices was just that you could run them in Steam VR like I couldn't figure out anything I needed to do in Windows mixed reality um
so I don't personally care but what is a bummer is anything that people have invested significant money into just going away and that's what's happening all the headsets even ones that people paid hundreds of dollars for um some that launched as recently as October of 2020 and were sold until late last year W are set to be deprecated in version 24 H2 of Windows 11 which will soon roll out to most users users who remain on 23 H2 will continue to be able to use their headsets but this will likely stop
working by November of 2026 furthermore according to a former Microsoft employee much of the systems back back end will be difficult or impossible to replace either because it's a black box to users or because it is completely lacking in public documentation so guys so does this include holar there was a cool Halo game no Hollow lens is separate that's augmented reality and it's its own Standalone device it's called mixed reality on Microsoft's website yeah it's not the same as Windows mixed reality
though it's a completely different okay uh business unit like it's a completely different I don't know if it's a separate business unit but it it's a separate team for sure there's there's like big serious industry stuff that uses that so I was going to be pretty surprised no no no this isn't that okay I am not nobody seems to um people still yeah nobody seems to what even is Windows mixed reality yeah we reviewed one headset long time ago and then had a bunch of Brands like
Samsung and aser I forget which one we covered but we had a bunch of Brands like hey do you want to cover our Windows mixed reality has some like no like what lot of Brands jumped on it what would I even say about it well Microsoft seems to provide a significant amount of resources to help them push their initiatives this one just seemed extremely misguided yeah like I couldn't figure out who if anyone was asking for this I don't even know what it did really nobody really knew what was even
going on in like when they launched that that was like the the wild west of VR um and I think they they kind of did that and Hollow at the same time and then just decided all right well no one really liked this anyways let's just go the hollowland route yeah I wish they didn't pull support for it but I understand them not wanting to drive it Forward more if that makes sense what exactly is it um great website  overview it   though before you start they don't say why I need you're muted oh they never
say at any point why I need it you might be mute King now I might have lost my title yeah I might be mute King now I'm going to do better I'm going to do better um this is full of how but not why does anyone have any resources that might explain why Windows mixed reality like it seems to be just instead of steam VR is is that is that what it is you you get you you you get apps or like you is it like a runtime because there's steam VR there's the Oculus one I I don't know I don't I don't know
if anyone really understood what it was it looks like it's a runtime of some kind blend of physical and digital worlds unlocking natural and intuitive 3D human computer and environmental interaction yeah but like but is it though like what um oh man look at these amazing resources here that just don't answer my question at   anyway let's see oh do you want to talk about Concord I uh it was a huge news this week I don't know if I've ever seen more actually no I lied I think the
Borderlands movie probably comes close to more discussion about a thing nobody did more discussion about a thing absolutely nobody actually did um PlayStation announced that they would be taking live service hero shooter Concord offline less than two weeks after the game's official launch yeah this is huge not because live service games don't get pulled offline all the time but because the game had allegedly been in development for8 years costing According to some estimates
hundreds of millions of dollars to develop I have no idea if this is legit I've heard the $200 million price point thrown around a bunch of times I've also spoken with some some people who pay attention to you know PlayStation who are pretty mythed about the whole thing in general because this was just Sony in their mind chasing that live service game cash at the expense of the kinds of rich single player experiences that PlayStation has been so well known for and honestly how they won the current
console generation yes and so they've been really frustrated that so much development has gone into this piece of crap that could have gone into games that they could buy for their flipping PlayStation and instead they have nothing to play right now yeah um the only person that I know that played it or bought it is Conrad and Conrad said that he thought it was pretty all right I if I remember correctly he said he thought it was about a seven out of 10 while the some argue the game was solid there were some
strange design decisions such as encouraging players to switch characters on respawn to get Buffs for their team when play players typically like to stick to their Mains in character focused games hate that decision with a  wow so I read that for the first time I didn't know about that until I saw the wock originally I was skimming through topics and I saw that I was just like what are you kidding me you know what's funny is as a casual I'm like oh yeah that seems like a good idea no like
encouraging people to try different play Styles and blah blah blah blah blah like I can I don't even agree as a casual because you're not a casual so because as well fair enough if you get tossed how many hours he has in like League those are old hours just take take whatever he says as the ignorant ramblings that it is a compliment on the W show what's going wrong this is compliment from lonus um the uh the the idea is a casual that you'll spend some amount of time getting used to a
character and then just as you're finally like you've learned most their abilities you're kind of getting the groove and it's like nope but remember it's it would level it would level things the other way as well not really you're you're going to have I feel like it would make it harder to catch up person you're going to have the obsessives that know absolutely every class within two days cuz they stayed up for 48 hours but but I think a lot of people jumping in would it would take I
think the intent was that it would take a little longer for people to master everything and it would force people to to kind of level themselves up in a more balanced way and maybe find new play styles that they otherwise wouldn't bother to find I understand the intent but it's not going to happen you got you have to understand human behavior but that's the well not just get is you need to understand that player based behavior that too but I I straight up believe I I don't I can't say that I guarantee that
this happened just cuz so few people played um but if a lot of people did actually play I guarantee you a thing that you would have is people that immediately Dodge on character respawn they're like I don't want to play this alt f for promise you that would happen yep there's so many things the the if you are at a computer connected to the internet the options that you have are practically infinite if you spawn as a character that you hate why are you going to keep playing just quit people
already Dodge if they don't get to pick their favorite character in other games because someone else picked it and they are unwilling to take their second favorite character now you're going to give them a completely random dice roll it's not going to work terrible decision hate it the game isn't dead per se game director Ryan Ellis says they're going to determine the best path forward uh and in the meantime every person who bought the game will be receiving a refund so that's something although
that's very nice it's it's less of a of a gracious thing than it probably sounds like because it's in the grand scheme of things oh cuz there a of money bought it oh this failure has caused concern about PlayStation's future live surface titles such as Marathon yeah I know there's a lot of concern around Marathon hopefully it works out I really hope it does in other news maybe our phones really are listening I I have I have this is a particular conspiracy theory that I have
absolutely Gone full tinfoil hat on I do believe that whatever people say our devices are listening to us because I have had experiences and we've talked about tested it and people still and like just H I don't know yeah people just say it's it's oh it's it's it's coincidence I'm like come on it can't be it can't be there have been times when I know for a fact that and and not like I knew for a fact that I didn't click through that fishing email okay there have been times that I have
known for a fact that I didn't look this up on my phone and I didn't look this up on a computer or you didn't look it up at all I was just talking to people and I have gotten ads for things so in a recent pitch deck to prospective advertising Partners Cox Media Group appropriate Name by the way claimed that they can listen to users through their smart devices microphone using so-called active listening software this same pitch deck cites Amazon Google and meta as some of the company's major clients
when reached for comment by 404 media meta and Amazon acknowledged their partnership with CMG but denied participating in this active listening program and made vague statements about how Partners who were found to have violated their standards would be reviewed this sounds an awful lot like the kind of couple Degrees of Separation that we see with these corporations and say for example or excuse me say for example there a delivery driver Contracting partner yeah or warehousing
Contracting partner oh someone got crushed by a forklift in that warehouse that well we don't own it and we we disavow that particular contractor that warehouse that company is going to be closed down and respawn up by the PE by the money people and then renegotiate a deal with Amazon overnight like that's how the whole grift Works um so yeah maybe they didn't participate in Cox media groups active listening program but maybe they participated in an intermediary who did participate but
they didn't know the point is I have definitely gotten ads for stuff that I've just talked about Google meanwhile appears to have responded by removing CMG from its list of Premier Partners the pitch deck likewise claims that this active listening is legal and Compares it favorably to a Black Mirror episode it calls the company's own program creepy sure great for marketing  God holy crap oh man yeah so speaking of that that that guy with the crunchy wife um you know certain parts of your house not
having uh any connectivities I'm going to leave you to do a topic or two cuz I drank all of this no problem I'm going to watch the Minecraft movie trailer I'm kidding yeah yeah don't watch it yeah watch it watch it watch it I've already seen it what no yeah yeah no don't watch it on stream just watch it and react oh is that going to be fun you think it's going to be fun I don't know I haven't watched it we can watch it together hold hands the stream doesn't get to see it
though no you just get to see us like start crying I can't hear it though uh well I need to make that hear it I mean they can't hear it though cuz it's going to play music and stuff I guess wow this looks horrible we're like 10 seconds in I'm I'm watching it oh why is it live action I live action stuff why would you even do that oh God  understand why okay so is this like an attempt at a Lego movie but badly is this like Honey I Shrunk the Kids like yeah we've uh yeah it's got
Jack Black in it they accidentally fall into the M must fall into Minecraft so he's Steve I'm sure and then these are just  so okay you know the scenes that don't have people in them look a lot better if they don't have people and they don't have Minecraft animals they look a lot better yeah yeah I mean where is like the cutesy character like is that the cutesy character cuz everybody has to have a cut side you to have a plush that you can sell yeah exactly stuffed llama makes sense except
it's it's kind of icky digital Legos the Minecraft movie is not targeting the original Minecraft audience it's targeting the 10-year-olds and under my kid think hilarious  cool they care they said they don't care that it's bad cuz it's not meant for you it's for kids okay well when people I don't like that take when people make good kids content it ends up being for everyone yeah you make good things for kids I mean the one that I hear all the time is Bluey I was going to say blue is
like I'm probably the only example true that's good you just make a good movie that is just kid-friendly like you don't have to be like you're an adult you don't get to like this you can make it for both people like uh what was it the The Lego Movie that did really well and was approachable for a lot of people and movie was great and was a kids movie Everything Is Awesome except the sequels if you live in Universe other attempt at doing that yeah I don't I don't know I don't know everything is awesome if
you're in the first movie of The Lego Movie before it was ruined by being successful and if you make a spaceship cuz that's that scene was awesome SP it was all good SP up it was fun it was fun even if it was just a advertisement yeah but sometimes people with passion can make advertisements with you know look at Dennis yeah Dennis makes fun hats Dennis should make the next Minecraft movie no cuz he should stay here I mean sponsored by LTT store I don't know what about did we do
like all the topics no there's still okay there's a bunch left mind I'll take it back I'll do an AI topic cuz L won't care anyways uh Federal prosecutor has been Federal prosecutor have charged an American Musician okay with defrauding multiple streaming services to the tune of $10 million using AI Michael Smith allegedly used AI That's the fakest sounding name in the world so I don't know uh Michael Smith allegedly used AI to make hundreds of thousands of songs which he then attributed to fake bands
like callus post and cerie screams like bands that start with c and have two words uh he then reportedly used Bots to stream those fake songs billions of times and collected the royalties over "$3,000 a day over the course of seven" years wow crazy how many AI scans will we have where the illegal element of the scheme really has nothing to do with AI uh a bunch of them I'm sure by the way you misunderstood the concord thing you didn't get a random character on respawn just a small bonus
if you chose to switch oh there are you are you okay with it now okay because then Min maxing gameplay is going to result in you switching characters which people will do people don't play games for fun anymore everyone thinks they're going to be MLG superpro it's crazy but it's a thing you know it mhm everyone's like I'm going to I'm going to be at the the international Masters I'm going to be amazing it's like no no you're not just have fun anyways Connor is uh reviewing
the video removal video right now with plof so that they they they snagged me to ask a couple quick things and I was like yeah guys don't don't be here till 1: in the morning just if there's a little bit less you know visuals and animations than usual like come on what are your thoughts on the Minecraft trailer have your kids seen it here's a good question no okay I wonder what your kids think because everyone in the flow plan chat was like it's not for you it's for kids uh and I was like content can
kids wouldn't even know who Jack Black is it if that matters then it's for adults so you're argument sucks um I can say what I think about it  think there was actually some really good material there oh I couldn't I didn't have audio that might have heard it um no there wasn't much there wasn't much in the way of audio I think the movie could have actually been really cool if they went super meta on the whole thing at the very end they're like who are you and Jack Black stands there looking like
Jack Black like he's going to the grocery store and he just says Jack Black and he says I'm Jack Black and if it turned out that like he was streaming Minecraft or something like I think there could have been room for them to go like super meta and he's a and he's like a celebrity streamer and there's some kind of like as a as a seed as a as a as a piece of sandst this if he had just stood there and said I'm Jack Black and like then something I don't know something interesting it's almost like a like like
a more like a matrix like Inception like kind of I don't know that'd be there yeah see okay an fro agrees that'd be a cool framing device it would be cool is um so am I am I judging the properly they like fell into the Minecraft Universe and now they're like stuck the like family or whatever that group of people is I think so and then Jack Black is just Steve he's Steve it would be more interesting if they had to like work with this streamer person to figure out how to like beat the game so that
they and people were like stream sniping to try to prevent them because they were sent there that like formed to try to stop them from getting out of the game would be so interesting and like Twitch Plays could like something like I I don't know who knows but they fall into a sub Universe where it's all the weird mods but I was sitting there right like there's hundreds of you could do so much with it dude I was sitting there I was sitting there going oh my God he's going
to say I'm Jack Black he is he already is the actor that more than almost anyone else just plays himself yeah so they they so they go full like self-awareness and he just goes I'm Jack Black and he goes I'm Steve and I was like what yeah what do you mean you're Steve you don't even you don't even look like a Steve yeah like you just what are you even talking about yeah so there that's that's my pitch that's my pitch they can save this they just have to Sonic movie it I'm a
heroine that's what he should have said that would have been that would have been sick that would be sickud he's actually just a real person I don't even trapped in Minecraft I deep lore I see a lot of people upset about the mix of animation and um and live action I don't even mind that I'm kind of tired of live action stuff a little bit I don't even mind that if he's like I'm Jack Black it makes it instantly infinitely better people are like that's a sick pitch I'd see that there's even like the
like log off scene when the streamer like goes to bed or something or maybe their their mom like yells at them for being on the computer and then they just like Boop and then the people are like oh we're in this like on our own now there's like so many things that they could take from the streaming like online content creation Minecraft public server like yeah oh man yeah like they like someone someone manages to unlock creative mode and like there's you could do like a like a bizarre hacking scene
where like they they like try to get them into into creative in a in a public server and they have to achieve something or whatever right like there's so much they there there's such a rich Community around Minecraft and instead they did that having a having like a war with the people that are trying to keep them in the game where they make those like those like moving structures that people do with the the the goo and the Pistons and they're like shooting the TNT cannons because they're or they build
some they build something out of redstone that like solve some kind of problem for them with like logic gates or like I be really sick if the thing that they build out of redstone is actually reproducible in the game so like people that get inspired by that could go into like more advanced  yeah uh talk about this topic while you're gone to be clear it doesn't look low effort or anything it just looks kind of bad that's all looked kind of bad I didn't I don't think I was tooo
interested in it the internet archive lost their appeal that's not to say they're not still appealing well okay I don't know if they filed another appeal but the okay you get it an appeals court has ruled against the internet archive in the case brought by several prominent book publishers the court has likewise forcefully rejected the principle of controlled digital lending which libraries across the US have used to justify buying a physical book digitizing that book and lending the
digital copy as if it were a phys book rather than buy often pricey or wholly unavailable digital licenses according to the court the practice does not fall under fair use or existing Jurish Prudence likewise the Court held that the internet archives use was not transformative and served the same purpose as the original allowing readers to access the author's writing the court did however reject one element of the earlier ruling the internet archive was determined not to be involved in commercial activity
regardless of whether or not the archives sought donations from VIs visors to its open library and gained non-monetary reputational value yeah the internet archive has a long difficult road ahead of it constantly forever um overall I think there are Force for good and um I wish them for the most part luck the Z2 Extreme has been confirmed by AMD at eepa AMD gave a behind closed doors presentation revealing they are working on a successor to the Z1 extreme the chip that powered basically every steam
deck competitor the strix point based D2 extreme will arrive early next year and AMD says the chip will be able to more than triple battery life during high-end uh gaming from about 45 minutes to 3 hours on typical devices crazy part of that savings though will come from new features like amd's fluid motion frames or frame generation so is it real performance I leave that up to you guys it may already be in the hands of man have handheld manufacturers according to Windows Central Lenovo is already
working on a strict Point based Legion go and this may be the processor that powers it our discussion question here is what does this mean for the steam deck and how should valve respond I think I think sometime next year is probably time for steam deck to I also think in valve fashion they might just not they sort of proved their point they did what they needed to they don't have to release another te I hope they do I really hope they do but sometimes valve seems to just like kind
of show up in a space and push the space forward and then fade away I think you make it sound a lot more intentional than it probably is oh yeah it's probably just people get bored and they can work on whatever the heck they want so they just don't bother work on the next one I think they'll do another steam deck I hope they do because what no one else can replace that valve can do is the console model subsidizing the hardware yeah with the royalties or with the um the fees that
they collect on software sales if they do release one I think I want one this time I think I think I finally do want one yeah there's been enough  what I really should just have that right now so that I could do something it's not even always gaming yep it's just like that would be the by far the most convenient platform for me to be using right now I don't know this is an interesting one to me X is banned in Brazil uh panel of Brazilian Supreme Court Justices has decided to uphold a
Countrywide ban on X uh this was specifically in response to the company refusing to appoint a legal representative in the country but it was part of a long-term dispute where Elon Musk refused to comply with other orders to take down alleged defamation and disinformation on the platform on freedom of speech CRS yada yada yada it's been a whole thing but the real discussion here uh for me is this part in response many users have migrated to other platforms especially Blue Sky
which had only half a million users last Friday but added 2 million new users in the space of a few days Brazil's a big market and our discussion question here and oh I'd like to clarify something from the last W show some people I couldn't even find that understood what idea what I didn't remember you saying that what I said was that Brazil was a relatively uh unimportant Market where Elon was making a stand whereas he complied in other ones that were more important to him and I wasn't saying
Brazil is a small Market Brazil's not a small Market what I was saying was that it was a relatively unimportant one and his principles were not being principles were not being applied equally in different territories uh someone actually posted an excellent summary on the Forum of what my point was and I was like yes this and then that thread completely de-escalated right um I don't know I'm not going to bring it up right now though but the the conversation that I wanted to have here was what I guess
but anyways are our current social media platforms as Immortal as we think they are like we've talked about this a fair bit especially when there was all that halalu over on red with the API charging and all the like cool services and Alternate readers and stuff that were getting shut down by and thenly nothing happened and and practically nothing happened and and you've kind of lamented the current state where these incumbents have so much power and so much momentum and such a huge back catalog that they
seemingly cannot be replaced and yet here we are Twitter got kicked out of Brazil and immediately Blue Sky got sucked into the void that it left immediately I suspect that this is pretty much the only thing that can disrupt that space effectively right now um if you look at all of the social media platforms they're all old um and I think that's largely because of Technology Gap and expense of startup effectively um it's not very reasonable to try to make a YouTube right now just
to be honest it just isn't there's no one's going to compete with them if Microsoft tried they would fail so like if that's the case what are you going to do I mean they couldn't even they couldn't even compete with twitch and that's likeing yeah just a small part of what YouTube is Twitch itself isn't even super viable so like yeah I don't know that's that's a bit of a weird one but um yeah it's tough so like maybe government disruption is basically the only thing that can cause that to happen
but I suspect as we've pointed out with apple that this is much more on company's radar now and I think some of these big companies are going to I don't know I I I think the like hey everything is good yay hooray Lego movie is going to make people think that like oh all these companies are going to be great now I suspect just lobbying is going to crank up things like that are going to happen and this is going to cool back down um pure tube fety verse yeah it's a it's a cool concept
for half of 1% of people um I think it's unlikely to really I and I understand half of 1% of people are now extremely angry with me um but it's just like they've existed as options for a long time and normies don't want it yeah and maybe something changes down the line and it becomes more viable but right now normies don't want it it is what it is yeah I think that in our Tech bubble we we think these severely overestimate sometimes the viability of a solution y um Intel's having some struggles at
the same time that they're launching their new core Ultra 200v lunar Lake Mobile processors they're currently running low on I9 13900 K and 14900 K chips most likely due to a mountain of RMA requests in some areas of the US it is apparently taking 3 to four weeks to have a replacement chip delivered Reuters likewise reports that Intel's 18a silicon Wafers have failed to pass tests set by broadcom an important client for Intel's contract manufacturing business furthermore Intel
today announced that it was cancelling plans to use its own internal 20a process node for its upcoming aerol Lake processors and would instead be using external chips most likely from tsmc the discussion question here is does Intel have the resources and capacity to survive this is there something that could explain all these issues cropping up at the same time I mean it's clear they're trying to do a lot right now I've said I like Pat Ginger's plan I like the plan I've said
I don't know if they're going to execute on it it's going to take a long time but I like the plan of splitting Intel into the the design side and the manufact facturing side I mean I liked the plan of us kind of splitting ourselves internally into a media side and a lab side but it's been clear at times that we bid off a little bit more than we could chew and there have been some gaps right it doesn't it's not for lack of like trying to do your best the good thing for us is that
we are privately held right so as long as we're not losing money then we kind of can write the ship and make the corrections we need to make at our Leisure if you're a publicly held company and your valuation dips people money right now they'll just leave and you're at risk of something like U uh a hostile takeover someone can just start buying up shares I mean look what happened with Twitter so it's a it's a scary perilous time for Intel I still like the plan and I still hope they can
execute on it uh not least of which just because not least because I just want to see a competitor to tsmc like I we should all be rooting for a valid competitor to tsmc no Monopoly is good I mean look what's happened to the cost of our Electronics guys especially The Cutting Edge stuff that's not that's not purely  in other news this is fun AT&amp;T has filed a lawsuit against broadcom for retroactively changing contracts for Perpetual software licenses that it acquired alongside its acquisition of
VMware am I the only one who's delighted by the irony here in December the company announced that it would end those Perpetual license sales in favor of bundled subscriptions imagine a company whose entire Fortune was built on bundled subscriptions and forced subscriptions instead of being allowed to buy things like set top boxes going to court fighting the good fight for the Perpetual licenses that should exist I for one love it it's great because and I hate to say the corporation cuz it's just such a it's
just such a cliche right the mega corpse but the mega corpse they they love subscriptions they love pay forever thanks for yeah exactly they love pay Forever Until all of a sudden the script is flipped and they go but my Perpetual license I love it in our case we absolutely have Perpetual cost so we kind of need to do it that way but um taking it to the gears on on VMware I am happy that AT&amp;T is doing that um would I ever say I like AT&amp;T no um but I'm happy someone with
weight to throw around is going after VMware because man this stuff they've  frustrating AT&amp;T uses VMware to run  these are these are really dry yeah you've also got you've got like pizza  laptop what are you going to do about it what's going on dude wow it's not going to make it to my laptop totally dead right there yeah you see look watch you brushed it off 100% I'll bring you some huh no oh my goodness get out of here it's a good laptop it won't break LG gam stop it no I don't no stop it
chunk AT&amp;T uses VMware to run around "75,000 virtual machines across 8,600" servers slimy Pizza while AT&amp;T would be able to continue using the software as is the company claims that broadcom is refusing to renas support services for the period it is owed I muted you I'm sorry you seemed like you were dying and we didn't need to listen to you D um the last thing that's on the dock for this week is is that wow we finally collaborated with Mr who's the boss and DIY Perks at the same
time what wait we worked on that mm oh no they just basically what Aaron said is like I don't know you just seemed like the person who would most appreciate this test we're trying to do and I was like M my laptop and I was like thank you I am bothered that's so cool so you guys should go check out how did we wait our only involvement was that he thought of me when he wanted to test video calling on it oh cool good enough yeah sweet it's crazy super cool yeah they built the the biggest iPhone
and it is shockingly iPhone like and shockingly um shockingly functional I expected no less from DIY perks probably the funniest part of the video is that we had a side conversation during the video call where we just had a video call you know I wasn't hosting he wasn't hosting we were just talking on our video call and we got onto the subject of my note 9 he asks me oh what phone do you use and I go oh a note 9 he's like that's got to be a bit and I'm like no that's my phone I pull it out of
my pocket and I show him all the cracks  video that's pretty funny actually yeah I've had I've had a one of those cases where I I thought an interview was going there was going to be like a minute or two of it at Max in a video and then it was just like an uncut like half an hour segment I was like whoa okay yo oh yeah he left a ton of our interactions in there I was very surprised cuz normally he's got like a a very fast-paced style to his videos um but he left literally I think almost 3 minutes
uh yeah almost three minutes of us uh doing this video call on this gigantic 88 in diagonal phone uh really really cool project um I haven't actually watched the whole thing it's a 24 minute video and I didn't I didn't catch all of it I've only made it to about 15 minutes but I'm going to watch the rest of it uh so cool Guinness World Record he gets to join the club now his is cooler than ours ours is pretty cool yeah ours is n Luke nope Luke NOP super cool Luke our started with lowlander win I have
getting a Guinness World Record on my bucket list what is the easiest thing we can do you know that his started with let's do something really incredible and cool and see if we can get a world record for it it's a completely different Journey we need to do lowlander we don't need to do lowlander you guys know what the idea for lowlander is ah there's been various ideas for lowlander they're all kind of stupid there's been one good one well fine what is the good one underwater yeah that that's the stupid
one they're all stup not in like a like in a submarine yeah I know but we're not going to do that be so sick we're not going in a submarine be so sick though do you want to Ocean Gate yourself no we get like a real one not one made out of what was it aluminum I don't know what it was made of carbon fiber it was it was carbon fiber carbon fber all right that's probably not best thing to make a out of oh you can make you can make things out of carbon fiber but you have to test them extremely
diligently and weave them correctly this material is extremely good at one thing let's make it do not that see what   all right the buttons are pushed are you ready I'm ready oh this one's not even for you Luke are you ready yeah hey Luke what advice would you give someone who wants to get budgies what are some unexpected things to carrying for them can I try yeah let's just give it to go for it okay way more interaction than you think you absolutely need a pair of them and
you absolutely need to be prepared to spend spend time with them on a very very regular basis I got they do have some advantages oh seriously was I muted that just the start I managed to catch M balls thanks Dan um so yeah social pairs interact with them way more than you think they're pretty good as far as cleanup you know that's one of the best things about them is they're relatively low cleanup for a a a parrot type bird um but you have to be prepared for how extremely fragile they are any
contaminant in the air basically they drop dead in short true to go back and do it again I wouldn't recommend yeah you you are going to need to change lifestyle things like there's cleaners that you can't use around your house that you probably currently use which being able being not able to use those is going to make cleaning things more difficult and don't be a slob you still got to do it so it takes more effort to clean your place you can't cook with Teflon uh you you a lot of cooking fumes depending on
uh like someone said no smoking yeah I just kind of assumed um there's there's issues with like do you live in an apartment like most of us these days well it's going to be difficult to do anything that could have any type of fume or any type of air contaminant anywhere in your entire apartment because your apartment's probably not big want to take up painting models how about no how about no do you live in an apartment again oh well you can never have your sliding glass door or windows
open because people in your building probably smoke um and they probably smoke constantly so your apartment this is Def I'm not talking about my own apartment at all they probably smoke absolutely constantly below you so all of the smoke just comes into your house and that would that would be bad for your birds as well it's it gets there's a lot involved with it it also gets wicked expensive if you're going to try to keep them alive at all because the vet bills crank up fast and
even then you might not be able to save them so so in summary to go back and do it again would great they're great I love my birds they are tons of fun they have really actually very vibrant personalities um they have very unique personalities they want to be involved in everything they're they're very fun they're much more like if you're that's another if you're getting them as a Cage pet nah you got to let them out and let them fly um so that's another thing to consider if
you're like oh they're a good thing that can sit in the corner no they're not um they like their cage as shelter they are going to want to leave it and they'll get pretty frustrated if they never get to it's bad for them um and the the get a buddy thing like if you're if you like and your partner aren't full-time work from home all the time and even then you should probably get them a buddy they're flock animals they're not supposed to be just like left alone all the time um so now you're
getting two and that's two times everything I just said including vet bills and all that other type of stuff so um get a dog the birds are great get 10 cats yeah or five cats might be literally easier oh probably I don't know I think my cats are probably less work than your birds probably yep yep you got to meet the kittens by the way they're yes hilarious yeah the one is just like the most outgoing thing I've ever seen the first night we brought her home she's just like crawling all over us and like
running around and she you know the thing cats do where they like go sideways and like she well she's like this big and she does it like constantly to her brother she's like always like I'm being super aggressive with them and not in in like a play fight way they're hilarious are they mixed yet like with the other cats no no they um they have fleas from living outdoors and they're too young for flea treatment got it so we can treat them I think on Tuesday and then as soon as you hit hit them with
Revolution they're apparently good to go to mix in because it like kills the entire flea cycle so anything they have on them will just like die or whatever so then we're good to go cool hey lldd my son is in college and is very introverted I really hope he opens up even a tiny bit and has fun any suggestions on how I could help encourage this I can already tell you as his parent probably no yeah like that's  people pushing doesn't help it almost has to be like a pull if you know what I
mean like you can't you can't push them they have to be enticed towards more interactions so you know if they can find like a club or something like that that they can get engaged with find some like-minded people those will pull them out of their shell like I there are a lot of those at post secondary as well I got these I I got these gel blasters um and I I told my son I was like hey we should try these we should like they shoot Orbeez and we should like blast each other in the yard or whatever like
have a you know gunfight um and he was like does it hurt I'm like yeah and he's like no and then his friends were over for a party and I was like hey do you guys want to shoot these and they're like oh yeah that looks awesome and I was like okay but the deal is cuz they had all been given me a really time during the pool party like like just going at me basically like a bunch of you know pre-teen boys um like shooting me with like every water gun and like chasing me around and like grabbing my
stuff and just you know you know they're having fun right anyway they'd been going at me real hard all evening and I was like okay well here's the deal because these are my Orby guns so you have to let me shoot you once and then you can shoot them as much as you want and they were like okay I'm going to do it I'm going to be the first one I want to be first and then all of a sudden my son's like I want to be involved in this thing now yeah and so that's what I mean by a
pull instead of a push no amount of me pushing him would have made him want to overcome that pain or anxiety or whatever it is but sometimes peer pressure can be a sort u a Force for good yeah can be terrible under control but it it can yeah absolutely um another thing that I'd recommend is try to find small groups like uh lonus and I this surprises some people lonus and I both kind of actually lean more towards the introverted side of things um you'd never know it yeah like
watching this show but it's definitely a thing like I I I leave here and I like so drained every Friday after decompress for a very long time yeah well into tomorrow oh yeah yeah Luke I think both of us have said that we've stayed up to like 5:00 a.m. just decompressing yep cuz like I mean if it's a if it was a particularly long and rough week and then if wano goes for like a really long time I might have really enjoyed wano but just I like wo oh yeah the this the the battery afterwards sometimes just
needs to be alone like sleeping isn't going to recharge it I need to spend active Time by myself yep and then it'll be okay um but another thing that helps me in that regard is small group groups so I don't know like a a DND group or a if there's like a um a hacker space like there's probably not going to be a huge per amount of people in there so they can get used to the the three or four people that they engage with often and they can socialize with that group and then maybe when they get used to that
one they can try another one and then they can grow their Social Circle that way instead of trying to meet like 20 people 20 30 people at a time now you know within a minute of being in the space you know everybody's name it's a little bit easier to navigate you can you can focus on those smaller amount of people more it's nice when it's something where everyone is working on something in common too I I that way you don't have to talk make small talk you can work on a project that's that's where a lot of
um that's that's where a lot of the ice breaking happens for people like me anyway I yeah I need some form of uh activity that people are focused on to like function properly if if we're literally just standing around talking and it's like a big group of people I I have like my brain is constantly like du what are we doing but if if like anything else is involved if there's something going on and food is pretty good for this I think it's one of the reasons why a lot of people uh meet for
dinner and stuff like that but um anything else some form of Central activity and you're you're good oh I found that Forum post uh so man um summarized it well I think it was more a jab at Twitter following us regulations like a well-trained dog while taking a relatively less significant Market as a supposed moral High Ground Battle the confidence wasn't so much about the size of Brazil's economy as it was about the thought process of complying in one region as opposed to another essentially doing the
same hand wve Zeon presumably did in the decision to play the moral High Ground game exactly there oh and side note to Elon the Brazilian Market was relevant he'd be working to keex in Brazil relevancy is not just about being a big economy relevancy to a bonehead can be quite boneheaded yeah yeah that was what I meant they just man just said it a lot better than me yeah good work all right hit me down sure hey lldd any thoughts on school phone policy my high school has started requiring
students to put their phones in a basket at the start of class using phones in class sucks but this seems a bit much well let me say I love it let me say  um I think it's good that you have fewer distractions because this is not the correct form of there and there is no punctuation in here at all so I think you could stand to put your phone down for a little bit okay okay okay I'm just I'm mostly I'm mostly teasing I'm mostly teasing um I'm sure there's problems where like in
emergencies it makes it more difficult for people to call home and all that kind of stuff overall I think it's a good move overall the world functioned before cell phones and and people are really too chronically connected like it's and I I I know that well back in my day doesn't necessarily mean it was better sometimes progress is just that it's progress um but I think it's become pretty clear that there is some development that is being lost in the in the loss of face-to-face human interactions that
that we're forced to do in school like it's not because I I wanted to talk to people I would have actually rather not done it a lot of the time I I often hung out in Mr mcl's portable at lunch where we would watch Simpsons reruns and play video games on the crappy old computers that he had in there like I I absolutely dodged human interaction that sounds awesome that sounds sick but what I'm trying to say is it wasn't always an option I do that now and I'm glad I got forced to talk to
people and interact with people because it's a valuable life skill even if it's  yes hey W.D I'm playing ff3 sness version on my steam deck I'm finding having the instruction man ual would help a lot AKA Blitz okay hold on hold on mattman 87 in the chat says Counterpoint education is to prepare for the real world and most people will have their phones immediately accessible at work and many jobs even require it yes but many many jobs will expect you to put your phone away and get your work done
so you've got to be prepared for both and I don't think we need to prepare this generation for having their phone on they're going to have an abely exive amounts to have their on them they're also probably doing homework so they'll have an experience of doing work with their phone with them all right hit me uh lus and Luke what have been the mechanics you had no idea what to do in ff3 um is that is is this the Japanese number versus the American number thing and I'm playing that game you are
playing that game okay you're playing Final Fantasy 6 mechanics was did I give you a manual I think I gave you my manual did you read it yeah yeah very cool was it helpful yeah cuz originally I was actually Googling things and then now I'm like no I can do this the right way which is sick and the manual intentionally doesn't have everything in it yeah which is great there's lots of items and stuff that are not in there that's cool yeah super I'm down with that and I would I would like to play
Within those limitations and it's vague sometimes like what exactly the ability does is like kind of poorly translated or intentionally vague I love it I do prefer that over Googling just with no reference it was like uh cuz Googling you're going to it's almost TMI sometimes yes it'll be like yeah and here's the optimal build and you do this no I didn't want I just want to play the game you know it wasn't designed to be completely broken by you know stacking up Genji equipment on this particular
character and leveling them in this particular way and going to this particular place in order to like oh man no promise you my team is not optimally set up yeah I guarant I can't even fully tell like I'm still kind of learning like Okay so this character is sort of supposed to do this thing you got to stream again so I can tune in yeah you never stream anymore so lame yeah you want to so basically what has been a mechanic you had no idea what to do and I guess they're just talking like kind of more
broadly the the little like the little kid that like learns other people's abilities things yeah or something yeah oh I think he has a new name uh no I think I thought it was GA the second you  me let me see what I can find uh I still think it's G is it g okay maybe it's still G anyway yeah the guy you find on the V yeah so that that took me a sa it wasn't too bad then he sort of figure it out yeah oh man it took me forever to catch him because I I didn't figure out to like use the dried meat on
him or something like I kept oh no that was pretty weird I kept eating dried meat myself that segment of the game yeah with the three parties split up on three different a couple spots where it was like what the heck am I supposed to do now um but you figure it out yeah mostly it was like where am I supposed to go when it's totally free map there's no Quest log all that kind of stuff but I I morind enjoyer I like that feeling so I'm okay with that I'm going to explore I'm going to try to find things
I'm going to try to think of what I'm supposed to do next and execute that and if that's not right well I went on an adventure anyways who cares go back try to find the right way okay I've been told a lot of times that my pronunciation of veg is weird V does it stand out as weird to you vag no what is it supposed to be Dan vague vague vague your description of this game is vague that sounds like the same thing to me yeah no it's it's just his accent V remember he talks remember he talks like
a valley girl you know go for your re your truck Dairy kind of thing right that's not a valley girl accent that's an Eastern Canadian accent I was comparing it to an Eastern can how dare you how dare you just because y'all invented the language doesn't mean you get to dictate how the rest of us speak it it's like egg versus W take your imperialistic and get out of here everyone is a foreigner but the  it's like egg versus whey vague vag yeah tomato tomato tomato kind of thing yeah except Tomato's stupid who
says tomato I don't know I hate them if you're out there I will fight you stop being incorrect all right what else we got  goodness blus I need an update about bike at Gat at Gat what at Gat is this like of course at Gat uh I'm sure it means something all the gear all the time um it just means always wear your gear I have been so tired and so busy I have not made any significant progress getting a significant amount of it painted and then needing to unpaint it has been really frustrating and I had
such a hard time stripping the gas tank that I used a more aggressive media when I was sand blasting it and it left a bunch of like divots in it that are not sanding out easily I have so many so many hours ahead of me that I have not been getting motivated about it and uh I had like really good momentum going and then my sister died and I just kind of fell off of working on stuff like that for a while and I just got to kind of pick it back up again um just been I've been tired um yeah I will I will ride
next season darn it yeah next season I will ride yeah hello Sun dad and Grandpa "you guys are coming up on 7,000 videos" currently "6,984 what is your favorite LTT moment" ever impossible yeah I don't even remember most of them dude we did a dive a while ago I think it was on W show and we saw a bunch of videos that I was in that I have no memory of yeah like at all we've been we've been doing this for almost as like my YouTube career can drive you know how long until it's half
your life it's kind we're coming up pretty close few more years yeah so it's it's so hard for me to say and we've done so much wacky oh yeah incredible  that wasn't on LTT yeah that doesn't count that was on channel super fun all right um let me see if I can find this so someone in FL playing chat guessed what I was laughing dildo racing the fact that someone guessed that great job Top Gear that's crazy I  anything that's wild you're in my head my goodness yeah like we've done
just we've done weird stuff you know um I came across this a little while ago because I don't I don't know how but I stumbled across it this is from 12 years ago and like I I can't explain what would have been going through my mind when I decided to make this um I think we were an independent company already by this point highlight the Highlight the 12 years ago it'll it'll say the actual date yeah yeah uh yeah so this is this is this is over six months into the existence of lonus Media Group
and you know so we were kind of a serious company doing serious company things I I'm unboxing a cable I I I think we needed a thunderbolt cable wasn't that 2012 for something yeah or wait sorry is this a year before yeah we defitely filmed this together though yeah uh do you remember this do you know what happens I remember doing this I don't remember what happens no so I unbox a cable for some reason and then like I don't know where I don't know how I got the idea in my mind but I was like yeah
Thunderbolts and like you know power or something oh my God am I really looking at the documentation for a thunderbolt cable thank goodness I lost patience with doing that sort of thing like you could like what a what oh wait no I remember I remember oh oh my goodness oh my God why did we do that I don't know but it's so hard to watch the second you started to pull it out it all came back I remember that jump even I yeah what am I doing why is this this doesn't make any sense you dive in
of course you do ridiculous why am I wearing my helmet like I'm dude I I'm you're probably trying to be a power D I'm 26 years old yeah I'm 26 what am I doing being a Power Ranger dude nice nice the worst part about that is you probably could have done that perfectly fine and you intentionally fell no no I can't I can't do a flip off a tree no I meant even just like jumping off oh yeah no I'm like definitely doing worse than I oh like what was I thinking there did you take I fight a drone fight the Drone
and then the Drone you tell I put the camera down so that I could fly drone yeah yeah the camera's no longer moving did this have a mid roll or is this a post roll ad the heck yeah did the video just end right there maybe yeah the video just ends there like what what even what even is that oh man what is that have you ever seen that Dan no I'm I'm I'm rolling over here this is how we made it dude my uh my face hurt where it came from I I mean so that crap the company theany had
our videos used to be better liar they have the same soul and I love that it's like you know you're saying you're 26 and it's like I'm going to have fun and be a child because that's entertaining and like keep it I I don't I don't take myself seriously right it's about being funny and fun yeah Thunderbolt cables it's like short circuit if it was cool cam dog 13 says get wreck Bell that's the equivalent of' 7s fashion was better exactly yeah we can move that that was pre company but that was
after we had decided to do it around the time we were deciding to do it I think that's a little early for after we decided okay we're definitely talking about it at least I forget why I needed a 2 met Thunderbolt cable but I was like okay I need to monetize obtaining this somehow still do that right I was at I was at smash Champs and you're like wow everything's Crap free content film crew here tomorrow I did not say it was crap and it took more than one day to get a film crew there
okay fine KN to let me editorialize your knock to a door is very cool Dan do you like my knock to a door thank you it's good thank you it's a knock to a door yeah don't go in the lower CL I thought we were going to put a Jank Jank Jank all right all right who do I work for okay where are we uh Dan and alen L can't believe I almost missed these glad I could pick up some they are the scrunchies is there a reason they're leaving what will happen to the shirt  um is there just not anymore I don't
know that's a good question I I think they're being discontinued is what I've seen a couple I will  email maybe we'll have a getting a modern remake of that epic video I don't think you can even do that we're going to thr into some Blackberry quick that sounds fun I just I don't think it'll have the same it won't it it it won't be Earnest yeah it won't be the same thing I think the closest modern video would be us bushwacking the fiber run through the bushes for because LOL yeah to be
honest I still wear those jeans energy just applied to where we are now you still wear those jeans what are they I ripped open one of the knees when we were doing that yeah but now you're like cool and stuff what wasn't cool back then yeah wow rude so  good I feel you got you got to report it like a like a workplace injury you got to go tell Ariana oh yeah exactly you don't report workplace injuries to Ariana she's on the safety steam technically oh okay fine well I don't think luk knew that
yeah I totally did yeah yes all right here's a here's a question for Luke how have float planes content policies changed over time we definitely have those and they're they're very stringent don't break them or we'll come for you we are very serious I mean we've talked about just like you know adult content and stuff like that I think uh I I don't think anyone has ever challenged us on content policy I think our only policy is if it's have and our policies are bulletproof they're bulletproof okay
yes um yeah no basically if it's legal where we are and where you are that's fine then we have nothing to say about it pretty much that's what we've gone with the nude stuff um there are problems there because of the payment processors not because of us so we'd probably have to like clone the site create like only planes.com then use different payment processors they have they have made it very clear that unless you know in strip's case this is very highly selective because if
you're only fans then sure because you're bringing in so much money we're not going to say no to that contract but if you're anybody else oh we have morals no no no very frustrating very the the the arbitrary enforcement of these kinds of policies no wait that's a lot of money okay you can come through everybody else no yeah and and then at that point why because there's clearly no principled stance here so like two okay to Apple's credit at least they are genuinely prudish yeah that honestly genuinely
wasn't bother me because they're actually consistent yeah uh I mean I think it's really stupid because they released a VR headset without addressing what people use VR headsets for yeah and like actively working a game um the consumption of such content on their VR headset beat saber it's just like all right next merge message I'm so sorry uh I work is setting up trade shows I was wondering what was the biggest challenge you faced while organizing LTX and did anything learned
carrying and did anything learned carrying into company policy as you grew um biggest challenge was definitely communication and that continues to be our biggest challenge as an organization did you learn anything to carry into company policy yeah um that we should communicate better we still have a lot of work to do on that I I think that's the hardest thing especially when you have a company that's made out of a lot of like Tech enthusiasts and uh they're ilk we we've got a lot of people who are
not naturally extroverted and are don't naturally seek conflict and and so that can be a really difficult environment sometimes especially when those people just bottle it yeah and then all of a sudden and it's like what yeah so I I think you know remembering we're all on the same team um it's very very important I just noticed on the dock I was scrolling around the dock for some weird reason I just noticed on your face partway through the dock right after the sponsors it says I've been silenced new
line I said too much yeah that's the title suggestions oh okay that's the title I was like who was this what happened are they okay oh that's great I'm just going to start writing only way they've been able to speak out I live in your walls all over the document in like 0.01 gray font and then adjust Luke's contrast on his screen so only he can  it oh no I have given him too many ideas no but that that I can see that being terrifying oh yeah yeah no I just write it there so it doesn't get lost uh hi
LDL Sam Alman is coming to my university for a fireside chat next week what questions should I bring to potentially ask I don't know whatever questions you want to hear a Tech bro answer to yeah have you watched any of his interviews dude like dude the one of my one of the most interesting things I find about his interviews are the hatred the hatred behind his smile I feel it in like almost no one more than him it's actually crazy it's you have to watch I don't remember the
particular interview but there's an interview with him oh God where someone starts asking him some questions that he doesn't really like and he says something along the lines of like basically that question isn't worth my time but in like a super PR friendly way and he's smiling super happy the whole time but he's just dunking on this person and you know that he's doing that and you know that he feels that way but he's smiling and his tone of voice is all happy and perky and I'm just like
this is incredibly fake to the point where it like uh I do not like it I'm not down be a human I understand what you're trying to make isn't that but you  goodness what's next will we ever be able to buy new products without AI now do you think AI is just the new VC hotness or will it continue to infest every corner of our Lives until it's unavoidable it might be bubbly right now in terms of the valuation of the companies that are capitalizing on this sort of Boom um but it's not a fad it's
uh it's not going away in some form or another this type of machine learning not only isn't going away but has been with us a lot longer than I think mainstream media in particular realizes like um neural networks um large language models none of this stuff happened in the last year um yeah it's just that we reached this sort of breakthrough point where it started becoming usable and that drove a lot of interest in it that's that's the only difference um and the the hardware
is getting to the point where you know it's fast enough to to do in real time um yeah it's going to be everywhere absolutely don't even don't delude yourself into thinking that that's not happening as tinan said in float plane chat it's the new Ray tracing which I think is an interesting comparison yeah yeah CU when it was it was first introduced it was super overhyped and people tried to use it and it was kind of eh and then years down the line it's like oh this is actually
really sick and in the long term it'll be the only way that makes sense to do things because like manually coding what light should look like will seem stupid when we can just simulate it splatting thank you none of masks any chance for opening merch messages sooner for EU customers it's 6:30 in the morning here um we got to try to find the balance when we had it loaded towards the front of the show people got really upset and they felt like it was just the promoting LTT store.com show oh no I I think they
mean being able to do it no I don't think so I think they mean responding to them they said opening up yeah like opening them no like enabling them oh oh uh I don't know if we want more merch messages you guys like we we do we really appreciate your patronage and uh and all of that but you know for the most part LTD store is a store um not a  will and last one I've got for you here hey DL I'm one of the fun few working at a media company with huge layoffs been working on my indie game and wondering
since you have invested in projects what should I maybe do to find funding I got to be honest with you I don't know pretty much anything about that world I uh I there's a couple projects that uh that Nas software and framework that I've thrown some money at um because I just think they're super cool I did functionally zero due diligence on either of them with framework I was like this thing seems amazing I I I I have no idea if this is going to work but I want it to be the next thing I'm going to put
my money where my mouth is I I I like a big part of it was just like I thought it'd be a splashy title for the video like I just you know I thought it was a cool I thought it was so cool and I just wanted to be part of it um I I didn't I'd never met the founder other than like exchanging a couple of emails and uh I didn't know anything about the team that is abely and then with the software I knew the guys on the team uh from their unraid days but like I didn't do any due diligence with
respect to like their other funding or like I I I personally never even read the shareholder agreement I I don't know what it says ion says she looked at it but like at the end of the day um you know these were guys that contributed in a big way like John was realistic The Mastermind behind seven Gamers one CPU like he made that thing happen I did a lot of the work too but like I couldn't have done it without him and so sort of looking at how helpful he was I was like okay well like I don't know whatever
here's the money and like do it or burn it um we'll see what happens um I I don't want to announce anything you know out of turn or whatever but I think there's going to be some stuff to talk about hopefully in the span of weeks rather than months which is pretty exciting because nice yeah I uh I have some issues with my Nas setup right now that I'm just like I could fight through like forums and documentation and try and fix this or I could just not bother I could just wait
for I've been kind of itching to improve my Nas setup but I've been waiting for this thing yeah to be honest so like I think we're not the only ones that sounds great um yeah I know I'm I'm I'm pretty stoked but like what I'm kind of getting to here is I don't know how that world works I just stupidly thrown amounts of money that I am 100% willing to lose at these companies that I just either the people or the mission I think are extremely cool and important I don't think you would ever find probably
another investor like me because I really have zero involvement and demand absolutely nothing from them because as far as I'm concerned I was just kissing the money goodbye most in s expect a return and they expect it within some period I have no intention of cashing out my framework shares you're like a unicorn investor except I don't have unicorn investor money like in both cases it was not going lie didn't know that was a term that existed oh yeah it's a thing oh um like I I I don't sorry unicorn would
be more of like a term for the startup that has like a huge valuation and huge growth sorry so when when you said that what I meant was like I'm not the kind of person who can like single-handedly come in and like turn you into a unicorn was what I meant by that understood um like in both cases angel investor people are saying Angel that's it thank you um so so like I don't have angel investor money I uh yeah that's that's that's it I knew they were related um in both cases it was a couple hundred grand
which uh it's been kind of funny to see accusations of like how compromised I am now over that over that investment um let me put it this way that wouldn't  for I don't think that would cover our  week yeah I think that's about right now so like it's yeah it's a ton of money and it's really meaningful to those small teams which is why I wanted to support them but it's like in the grand scheme of lus Media Group and it's and its operations and obviously I would rather it makes a profit or whatever but um you
can't do that all the time yeah I can't do it all the time so much that you can do that with we only have two cases of this ever happening so like this is not something that I just do casually on stream yeah we even we even had like the the community was quite I I think the community seems to have forgotten about this sometimes but the community was quite involved with the framew work investment y we like asked them if it was cool yep yep and their vote mattered if I remember correctly I don't fully
remember but yeah absolutely yeah so I don't know guys it's um I I don't know anything about it I just have have done a couple random things cuz I thought the people were really cool and I thought the mission was really cool I don't know I don't understand it I don't uh I can't relate to the usual investor mindset and I I have done enough looking into raising Capital as a business owner that I've just looked at it and I've gone that looks horrible and I don't want to learn about this I was going to
say we're we're the wrong people low amount of total Investments the Investments that do exist are weird and  sorry oh and sorry I think the show's over oh we will see you again next week same bad time same bad Channel  bye oh someone asked uh what happened to the GameStop shares I think at some point yvon just flipped whatever was left of them and uh she was trying to pay something down and was liquidating things so I don't I don't actually know what they sold for but there's that so yeah I do not
