this is photographic proof that TCL snuck into my basement and took my TV also it has a different name but I'm pretty sure it's the same one and it's absolutely gorgeous and we only had to go 20 Paces for them to get Wilder this high sense set has four times the pixel count double the peak brightness and "twice as many local dimming zones 40,000" but TVs can be transparent as well Samsung here has a micro LED TV that's completely see well mostly see-through they have a cool 3d effect by placing
the transparent TV in front and another LCD panel behind it which is pretty crazy but you know what's even crazier this is the cced N1 a 137 in microed display that folds it freaking folds man
