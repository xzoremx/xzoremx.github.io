imagine this you're at the store and there it is the biggest TV you've everever seen you need to have it okay that's fine you'd rather go home and talk to your wife and kids anyway but then you notice the open box section Woo is that nearly 100 in of TV goodness "for just 1,500 bucks take my money but" on the way home you start to watch wonder what sacrifices had to be made to get a TV this big this cheap I mean surely it can't be 4K with support for HDR oh well there's no way it supports
High refresh rate gaming oh okay does that too I mean but there's no way that it has a segue to to our sponsor really OD do their all-in-one business management Suite lets you dump your mismatching apps and unify your processes check the link in the description for a free 15-day trial and start running your business the way it deserves to be run if like us you find an openbox TCL 98 S550 GH the first complication is going to be getting it home this particular open box model
wasn't available for delivery so we had  ourselves and TV's this big they're heavy but hey we got it here time to unbox it now Adam and I are are seasoned pros at unboxing giant TVs now so I'm sure this is going to go very smoothly were you really cutting toward my face oh seasoned Pros we don't have to worry about safety we're so good at it hey this one comes with legs he mentions that because the 150 in one that I bought didn't okay we managed to open it backwards unfortunately uh okay all right I guess
we're looking at the I/O first here's something that's a little confus using to me though what is it about a 100 in TV that allows it to be packaged relatively normally but the 115in TV which is know only this much bigger had to come in a crate I guess part of it is that the other one was thick she's a trunky boy yeah this is like half of the weight I think of your TV but it looks very similar in terms of the ID yeah it even has the the square pattern and then also Ultra base your TV
can also work as a project mat like are these 1 centimeter by 1 centimeter it kind of looks like it they're Clos you could cut fabric patterns I need to know now for the io we got four HDMI ports the top one is 4K 144 Hertz which is weird cuz didn't the front of the box say 120 useless useless the squares are exactly 1 cm by 1 cm but then the gaps in between just throw the whole thing out of whack well I I'm glad you figured out that mystery uh yeah so we're not really sure what the deal is with that the
input's 144 Herz but the panel says native 120 maybe it's overclockable I guess we'll find out as for the rest of it it's pretty usual but uh it's weird to see a composite input on a modern TV still so that's nice one other unusual thing that I was about to point out before I realized that the back of the TV does this was the Vasa bolt pattern it's 500 mm x 6 00 mm so it's not square and because this thing is heavy what I would strongly recommend doing is something similar to what you guys saw
me do in the cleanest Living Room Makeover where I put a big piece of wood just like a flat piece of plywood screw that into the studs and screw the mount for the TV into that since we're not doing any of that today we need to put the feet on H H how do we do that they said refer to the manual smart first get a table that's bigger than the TV where the hell am I supposed to get that soft cushion surface what is this look at this hypothetical soft cushioned thing that exists who has a giant cushioned table
where are we going to put this here's the thing this video really was inspired by us just stumbling across this open box TV at what seemed like an unbelievable price at the time um so it doesn't have the little protective soft covering on the screen we don't really have a way of laying it down down I have an idea I have we we put there we go oh she's heavy yeah damn boy okay now I've done this trick a lot of times where the air cushion that forms between the TV and the ground
keeps it from hitting very hard so we can just let her fall I'm kidding you were going to let me do it I wanted to see what we you were going to let do it it would have been cool why would you do that content h all   gosh it fits what was the TV back what's the size of this is that a 65 I think that's a 65 in behind it that was a 65 in TV it's gone sitting on a pretty normal height couch this belongs on r/ TV too high do you think we also maybe we're just like  sure still way too high I didn't really
think about it in the theater because it has Theater seating in it in fact it has tiered Theater seating so you're really aiming for an optimal Middle Ground between the front and the rear row but if I was putting something like this in my living room I would only want it like 8 in above the floor like 20 cm above the floor right out of the gate Google TV is standard on all all of tcl's TVs at least here in North America mine doesn't which will make it really easy for Adam to turn off the gross motion
smothing yeah it's it's pretty bad right now you know every once in a while I'll go yeah maybe it's you know not that bad when I haven't looked at it in a while like I I'll say to myself maybe I wouldn't notice if I went into someone's house and they had motion smoothing on and then I get a new TV and I'm like ew when I first was testing this even the boot logo had like motion artifacts and I was like w turn it off immediately it was so bad whoa is that a display hey you have a monitor I do several in
fact I love the hoodie you're wearing today it's so appropriate it's huge it's not very bright it goes up to a Max of 500 nits we got 498 this ends up looking kind of flat overall though which I'm surprised by because in the past the larger the display the greater the volume light it's throwing at you even if the peak brightness isn't as high and it can really help with immersion I still think it looks pretty okay for how giant of a TV this is and it's not OLED how much "this cost you 1,500"
bucks comparison is the thief of Joy if we had another TV right here I'd be like oh yeah this thing sucks but like as is just walking into this room that's a big TV good it's a big TV and it's fun watching it I mean it sucks the Plex is loading right now but uh yeah I don't think it has the fastest Wi-Fi card but in the time since we bought that open box the New Gen one has come out so you can get a brand new one from TCL this size that's 2 Grand how much better is the brand new one is it brighter it
seems to be pretty darn close but maybe better they say surprisingly little about anything but their Flagship TVs of course because TCL is not like a big Flagship brand like Sony is so what are they going to advertise well there's nothing wrong with buying TCL they don't know that I had TCL TV in my home for a long time they're the TV of the NFL hey like the colors look okay I don't tell I don't know if they're correct but like it's colorful enough they look pretty okay and I think the measurements
had it at a Delta e of about 4 and a half what on average yeah just on in the movie mode uh Vivid mode gets awful and of course yeah yeah don't turn on Vivid mode if you care about the artist intense and everything no matter what trends a little blue sure sure it's wild how much like how far that's come in just the last four years if we were looking at this TV 5 years ago 3 years ago oh it would be over "$10,000 and it would be terrible yeah" now how many local dimming zones does it
have did we count them does it have local dimming cuz this the contrast does not look great it looks like a boat in fact I don't know if it has local dimming zones is this just a VA panel with pretty okay contrast we counted one  Zone the brightness is okay but a part of why it doesn't pop off the screen is that to appreciate the Peaks you got to have the valleys credit to their anti-glare though this is a very demanding environment for that with studio lights all over the place it's
not bad I've got like a pretty good string of lights in my field division at least right there but other than that it's fine and that's a pretty small like when you consider how big the TV is that's a pretty small portion of the TV if one of my friends bought this thing for5 $100 and I walked into their house and this is their TV i' be like that's a sick TV one thing that is uh kind of disappointing but also understandable is the black uniformity yeah like you can see patches of
whiteness brutal there's like a big triangle here yeah you're only really going to notice that though in those big panning shots yeah yeah when we got it dark enough to test it was very noticeable oh super noticeable there's a hot spot like right up the left side because you don't have local dimming you're relying on that diffusion layer to absolutely perfectly spread out the light from the backlight though two tcl's credit they didn't go EDG lit which ratings found recently does not
really have any picture quality advantages but can lead to premature death so even though it doesn't have local dimming zones it is direct back lit which I would say is a good thing yeah I've seen that too when one part of the light fails and then it's just dim like that one part of the monitor TV so I found a listing for an open boox S9 "95b that's $1,600 that's a great deal so" this is a generation old but QD OLED panel really nice TV it's too bad it looks like the child of that one yeah
even with the not amazing ambient light rejection of QD OLED it's a lot better dude look look where you can see both of them I know but remember QD OLED has that kind of Purple Haze compared to Wed so this is even as good as this can look at M dude this Sun the color volume that's the thing is anything that has to do with full array local dimming is just going to it's going to lose the one that really stands out to me is the richness yeah of these tones here yeah this has
no saturation this looks like I took some like cheesecloth and I put it all over the front of the screen I'm looking through a veil and all the Shadows have actual depth to them mhm you don't lose anything in the image whereas with this it doesn't even get that dark it's not it's not it's not crushing blacks or anything cuz it's not even getting look at how much more realistic the sky looks that looks like blue looks real especially with the like leaves and stuff yeah but big big TV big TV okay
but let's talk about gaming cuz you've kind of left me waiting here I got to say this doesn't feel that bad no it looks like it's 120 HZ I don't even mean that I just mean the the latency yeah how do we set it to 144 though I don't I don't I don't know actually I'm I'm not going to lie it's really confusing did they did they advertise it yeah they call it they call it game accelerator 240 I'm pretty sure it's just a backlight strobe oh what what do you mean 240 no I'm talking about the 144
Herz yeah I don't know how they get that can you stop messing with it so what do you think where am I  mean wow dude this level's scary scary you know what though this feels great try it sorry it's funny that's fine nice nice nice nice you got needled did was really nice up until when it wasn't nice yeah it feels totally fine feels completely responsive I could game whatever game you want to game on this TV and it would feel okay way better than LCDs that came out in the early 2000s felt awful I
think overall I think it's totally fine yeah I I guess I'm like who's it I guess it's for old people and bars frat house yeah actually if you walked into the "frat house if they can spring for 1,500" bucks for frat house is still a bit much you and 15 of your friends pitching a hundred bucks right you bring this bad boy in play Smash on it eight player smash yeah no problem at all I have no idea what the long-term quality of it is going to be like obviously this is like
not by any means a bad TV no no and like I can I would recommend it to somebody if they were in the market for a really big TV and had a very low budget um that was their goal yes yeah big TV cheap it's mindboggling and we'll link to it in the description and everything like that uh as well as some other good TVs that you can check out if you don't have the space for 98 in whoa okay I just found something that's cheaper than this what and bigger cheaper and bigger that's right that's right wait we're
