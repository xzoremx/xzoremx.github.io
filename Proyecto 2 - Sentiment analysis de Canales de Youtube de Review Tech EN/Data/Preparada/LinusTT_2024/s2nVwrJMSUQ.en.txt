what is up everyone and welcome to the W show we've got a bunch of great topics for you guys today including a special guest that's right we've got oh there he is he's kind he's kind of in the middle of the frame now oh he's he's leaning he's Le oh he's leaning out of the frame now it's got hey uh we've got David on the show to talk about the incredible amount of effort that went into this year's April Fool's prank I'm really not quite sure how he pulled it off but you guys might not realize this if you're
not sub crib to float plane we actually had a lot of those people working out of the house so it was the joke was that it wasn't really a joke so we're going to talk about everything that was involved in getting entire Departments of the company moved into that residential house for almost a week for some of them seemed pretty inconvenient uh we're also going to be talking about how AI it turns out is just underpaid foreigners it's like that always has been meme yeah exactly what else we got today uh uh uh
Discord wants you to monetize your friends that's I don't know about you guys but my friends are worthless so uh good luck with that  situation uh I didn't even have another one I was just so focused on that Intel Mega faab uh possibly haunted yeah yeah that's the whole thing actually I   guess see Sonic square square paste Square P what would a square paste Square spast yeah it's our Square paste yeah you walk like but you can only move in squares it's like artisanal uh
toothpaste anyway Squarespace and MSI are the sponsors for the show today so I think we might as well jump right into what exactly went on over on Flo over on Flo plane it's been an extremely long actually couple weeks so the first thing that happened in order to make this April Fool shoot work was uh because we accidentally double booked it with my vacation I actually had to fly home from Japan do you know this I didn't know that was why I had to come back a week early because we accidentally scheduled
our vacation during the April Fool shoot which couldn't be moved cuz you would think oh well surely we could have just gotten ready and done the shoot a little bit earlier but um I don't know maybe maybe we'll have David kind of talk about why that might not have been feasible well some people were speculating online that the house was you know in between tenant but no there's people living there currently and so we had to send them on vacation for 2 weeks so that we could have access
to the house for 2 weeks and move all their stuff out oh my gosh yes when I heard that I it took me a second to like properly process what that meant yeah well the thing is like where you hold on sorry where did you even put it where did we paid for storage okay yeah so the idea was all right we're going to move into the office but the tenants there are very much in the middle of lease like this is this isn't like a yeah we can get easy access to it some it's full of their
stuff so I got to say if I was them and my landlord called me up and was like Hey so here's the deal I want to move all your stuff out of your house for two weeks I'm going to send you somewhere and then when you come back it's all going to be moved back in probably in the same would you do it I'm think I I think so would you would you take the deal free vacation let's say uh yeah let's say it was uh if there's some amount of assurance for like hey if we like break this thing we'll replace it I
mean I can tell you they have nothing in writing I think it would really depend on the landlord but but maybe yeah David would you do it okay your landlord right now would you do it 100% I would take a free vacation like you you go today today okay what about you Dan sure yeah yeah okay really okay we're all doing it so apparently this is just a completely normal thing I I it's definitely not normal I would definitely bees any of us are normal no not normal I can think of a lot of people that would never do
this that's fair but I'm just thinking like okay if I like take a couple small valuables and like store them at my at my parents place which I could do in like half an hour then yeah whatever just send it so I think one of also see you I think one of the biggest challenges with this though was that David and I approached it with very different Creative Visions from the start so David why don't you talk them through what could have been and we'll let the audience kind of ruminate on it
themselves cuz honestly the issue was not that his idea was bad in my opinion I think it was great it just wasn't what I had had in the back of my mind for the last two or three years or whenever I originally came up with this idea and I was like can we can we change this to anyway so David do you want to talk them through what you what you had thought of yeah absolutely yeah that first meeting we had was pretty contentious it got pretty heated um my idea was more mockumentary style so we're kind of
doing it more skits uh room by room Department by department and separating it more so that I could move people in and out of the house a little easier and we could you know have something set up for them but it doesn't have to actually uh be super real Mr consider it over here meanwhile I'm like let's just move the company in yeah and it was going to be definitely more absurd like one of the first jokes that I wrote and I think it was the the point at which we were diverting uh was like oh yeah we don't
have enough power so we handed out typewriters for people to work on uh and it was going to be kind of more silly and and absurd in that direction but lonus uh convinced me uh he he we we we argued and then after a weekend of me cooling down I was convinced uh that that he was right and that having it be real thing is something that you can't fake uh and so we decided that we were going to really move people and set them up in this house and set up this real Network infrastructure uh and bring real
computers real monitors and have it that every single person at that house could do real work and I'm pretty sure that every single person that was in that video other than labs labs is probably the one yeah um they were really doing their job in that house yeah so that was what that was what um David told everybody was in order to make it feel lived in bring other like Logistics will will bring in the monitors which were graciously provided by vew Sonic and um and landfest yeah um so the monitors
were brought in from a third party but everyone was told okay other than the basic like we'll have buckets for you to sit on gather up kind of everything you can carry such that you could do a day's worth of work yeah and so that's why it really felt lived in and worked in because the editors were actually editing real videos if you look if you watch the video cuz the turnaround for the April fools video was really fast if you screen Peak you will see videos that are not out yet being worked on by the
people sitting in the house one one of one of the more insane meetings I've probably ever had was talking to David because I I I got this like message or something I don't remember what it was saying basically like yeah we need some like servers and cables and I was like oh okay we're just going to like take some dead servers off the shelf we'll just lay them there and we'll just like toss some cables around so it looks like there's table cables in the thing he's like yes we need like a working nass so
the editors can like be productive while we're there and I'm just like what is h what like how is this necessary for anyway so the part that David left out of the story from the pitch beating was that we reached a point where I felt like we were at a bit of an impass and one of my favorite conflict resolution strategies is to bring in a party to get a third opinion um in this case it was less of a third opinion and it was more of I feel like David was being so sensible and practical about
everything he was trying to make sure brought in like the most CU when he does this it's it's great he'll always bring in a loaded person who he knows is going to agree with his side I so who did you pick no I didn't I didn't even I didn't oh fine Dave not not David fine Luke who do you think I brought in then I don't know um well make a guess cuz cuz you're  no come on come at I don't know I don't  no where where was this meeting uh no no it took it was in my office in the okay
yeah he's not going to get he has no chance there was you might not remember but there was actually two people brought into this meeting oh oh oh I forgot about and fourth party okay okay oh oh oh you're right oh okay so first okay fine go ahead you get one more guest you haven't gotten either of them yet James okay yeah yeah James was the first one the thing you said two people I was like well okay I forget what he said though David what did James say he was on your side almost right away and
that's when I knew I was like okay maybe my Brilliance is not true okay I forgot about that but it wasn't it I mean realistically I don't feel like you were digging in that much based on the difference in Creative opinion it felt like a lot of it was just like  for doing this and so a fair that's a fair thing to be concerned about so the party I called in and where I think I actually got David to come around to it was I called Taran okay yeah so I I called him and I basically went
okay here's the pitch I actually think I would have eventually got that as long as we as long as we make it clear to everyone that we understand that their deadlines are going to be pushed yeah and that their productivity it's not going to stress people out and as long as I had teran's Buy in on the opportunity cost because like dude David I don't even know what the bill was for this I don't know exactly either does anybody know we should find we should find out sure one of the I'm sure one of
the accountants do I don't know if you want to find yeah there's like no way it was worth it but the yeah so I don't even know what on a podcast format I did air quotes what the actual production bill was for this but it was probably if not certainly the highest cost production we have ever done and that even ignores the opportunity cost oh yeah because it's one thing to hire a bunch of talent to come in and produce a thing it's a whole other thing to shut down the I I would say David how many
people ultimately volunteered like what percentage of the company did we actually have in there I think total it was probably around 55 is people okay so that's over half that's like because cuz out of the locals that's almost 70% of the actual local staff then like 60 something per. that is absolutely wild so was anyone volunt told or was it all it was all volunt it was all volunt cuz I first would meet I first met with the managers and I was like hey uh you know can you pick people and I mean I don't know
Department by Department how it went um but I basically was like hey just pick your people and then uh we'll we'll go from there everyone I've talked to about it was stoked on it so like oh well you haven't talked to all the same people as me fun no everyone was such a good sport about it and like I think there was such a great energy being at the house um everyone was having a good time and it's rare that we get to do stuff like that alt together and it's even rare that we
get to do that stuff with that many people for production and so I think it was kind of a real treat and everyone sort of cherished uh the days we were there I think for the people who weren't part of that um they the vibe for me was a lot like like old Channel super fun when we would just like grab people out of their desks and be like okay we need to shoot a channel super fun guess what you're getting you know shot with Nerf darts uh it's going to be a battle uh your team basement we're Team atct let's
go like like it really had that sort of chaotic Vibe but I've got to give credit to David to the logistics team I've got to give credit to our partners it was shockingly organized we booked 2 days for the shoot and I don't think we went over one and a half oh not even we were like uh maybe 9 hours of shooting absolutely wild actually super good yeah very difficult to do with any form of production yeah and the the number of moving Parts there were in that mess the and it was this was David this was David
being an absolute mad lad um I didn't intend well I thought of it as we got to the point in the script but David had was already way ahead of me the idea of actually shooting TechLink there oh yeah on the janky green screen that's not that's not me the thing the thing I was going to say before we started and you stopped me cuz you're like say for the show was that the the interwoven story lines was crazy and like easily my favorite part you've got wow seating interest you've got the the techlinked
seating interest uh you've got the the the the prank at the end everyone's like what is this that's a float plane Exclusive by a float plane exclusive like this one video is just like morphed into so many different content there's so there's so much like ah there's so many lers circuit yeah there's a short circuit that was shot in the hot tub by the two J oh yeah yeah yeah I forgot about that but totally yeah yeah I knew about that that's yeah so many different things oh I freaking love it uh Porto
asks this is in the float plane chat did you guys have that had to talk with the neighbors so I did see one of our old neighbors you remember our neighbor on the one side who we we had I felt like a pretty cordial relationship with until I think she's a bit of a like vegetation Enthusiast um oh and we had an arrangement me and Luke where his rent was significantly subsidized by his upkeep of the property yeah totally upkeep of the property that he just didn't do um kept the internet going yeah
the state of our lawn the state of our lawn was the straw and that's what it looked like it looked like straw was the straw that broke the camels back and was what made the neighbors ultimately come and complain to the city and get us kicked out see I just I don't believe in short Lawns because it's not good for the environment it's not good for the insects which are good for the the whole like ecological how do you explain the parts of it that were so short they were dirt uh so
uh you want to make space for new plants to grow so I saw I saw that neighbor over the fence and uh I was in the middle of a take or something but she just like I don't want to have anything to do with you yeah yeah she didn't say hi or anything so I'm like all right yeah I guess you didn't miss us yeah yeah that's okay I mean we were realistically we were only in there for probably about 80 hours like a little over 3 days did you ever tell her that I was supposed to upkeep the property I don't think so
interesting cuz she was really good friends with me the whole time all right I like helped her with something in her house one time I helped her move things in and out all the time like we we were actually we were good I thought we were good too until it was actually her daughter that like came to the door and gave me a hard time about it interesting so I'm not 100% convinced actually that she ever had a problem cuz she might have just like not recognized you to be honest yeah that's possible it's been a
long time and if she had no primer that you were supposed to be there why would she think it was yeah that's true yeah yeah that's true that's true the thing I was most worried about with the neighbors was there was six or seven days where we had moving trucks and it's a it's a compact Street uh and there's no parking spot so we would just double Park this moving truck from different companies cuz there was different people that were involved uh and people would people were really nice which I was
grateful for but I could tell by like the six or seventh day of a moving truck neighbors were starting to get curious about what was going on yeah nothing they'll go and they'll check and there'll be nothing everything's gone everything's clean the Perfect Crime man and some of the stuff we did was just could have caused an immediate call to the city like that shot we have of all the cars in the back alley I totally forgot about that how did you do that how was that okay we
locked out M so hard David wasn't even coordinating it he was in one of the cars and I was I wasn't thinking about this at all I was like hey um it was Andrew shooting at that point I think right yeah I was like hey Andrew um you know what and people were kind of like pulling in from both sides I was like Andrew maybe get like a panot I didn't mean immediately I just meant maybe get like a pan shot of all the cars cuz we wanted to feel like the whole alley was packed and it did didn't it in the shot
so he just starts doing it immediately and it just happened that everyone like like stopped right as he like the yeah I was I was like David I don't think we need to do another take everyone get out of here it was so lucky too because I was really getting frustrated I was like I need I need five people in cars I need six people in cars I need cars right now and no one was moving I was like oh goodness gracious and then eventually we got like four people that were there but
then all the labs people rolled up just as we were doing it and so all of a sudden we have like eight or nine cars packed in there and it was it was perfect who whose car had been PE recently Colin able to get that key shot okay the amount of convincing that happened for the video too I don't know if we want to even say who it was but a certain news organization reached out asking for comment um okay wild this is really funny that's crazy this is funny hold on I'm going to I'm not going to
say who it's from but I will say that this is a serious um and then if I if while you looked at up if I remember correctly there's a whole thread on the Forum about how everyone was mind blown that you guys keyed a car for the video y there there was a few people that were like oh you can see if you look frame by frame that it's didn't get pointed out but a lot of people were no Andrew's Andrew he man he worked the camera we worked the angle so good okay so this is this is
the email sent to me and our CEO yeah um hey guys sorry to be shooting you a work email on Easter Sunday saw this super odd post on threads from your account and wanted to reach out to confirm whether it's real or a joke I've attached a a screenshot um and it's just and it's that one that's like guess who's moving you notice of eviction dear uh something of lonus Media Group we regret to inform you due to your continued failure to make mortgage payments blah blah blah blah blah it was
just part of this it was part of the whole April Fool's bit yeah oh man I recognized the the meme yeah I I I love that um you know what no I think this might identify the outlet so I'm not going to I'm not going to yeah I think my favorite fake out was there was a brand that reached out and was like oh can we get your new address we need to send some stuff to you and it was like no I didn't hear that oh my God cool that they still wanted to support yeah yeah I mean even though I you know I had we had our
accountants looking up how to commit tax uh tax FR or whatever and I outright said that you know sponsors weren't going to get stuff back they're like God you been paid before yeah sure should be fine he's good for it I fig he couldn't  Diddy it's true I don't have a private plane yeah just a just a vision room yeah yeah exactly you like you like raising up into the that I broke at that moment you know what's really funny is I screwed up the take I had my eyes closed I couldn't see
sh oh my God that's really funny I was like hey David I think we got to redo that tap cuz I I had my eyes closed it was so good and they were like you know what no that's actually kind of kind of funer oh man the the behind the scenes is over an hour and even though I was there for almost all of it I almost all of the actual shooting of the behind the scenes I wasn't there for a lot of the setup because I was on vacation I come in jet legged as heck kind of with a little bit of trepidation no offense no
offense understanda little bit of trepidation this is a major major investment one that we have absolutely no hope whatsoever of recouping any any of of our costs from straight up tax rate off straight up tax off we lost so much money on this production oh yeah all the money and so I'm coming into this shoot going okay you know we had a good script review I think everything's in probably in pretty good shape I think it's in capable hands but you never know what my first big project um and it was
enormous yes yes so there's there's there's so many moving pieces and so much that could go wrong and I walked in the door and I I had not intended for it to be in the cut of the YouTube video when I walk in the door and I just lose it right because it was the intention was for me to be more like in my just like you know character right um but when I saw the rough cut for review and I saw that they had left it in I went you know what it kind of It kind of works but that was it I hadn't seen it
yet that was that was the moment I walked in the door was like okay cuz I saw the editors there dude the the four-person desks with with the that's so funny like I just I I can't that's all David the bunk Des that was so funny I and like it's actually efficient sort of and like bra like hold on a second this this kind of works yeah and you're like why do why is this like why does this work in my head this shouldn't work at all why why am I sort of okay with this but also not
and then watching people like I think you had to like crawl over someone to oh my goodness it's just so good it's so good I want to clarify that one wasn't my idea and it's it's one of those things that it's like I had so many meetings and like brainstorm sessions that it's such a mish mash of a million ideas so I don't want to take credit for too much but uh I'll take credit for some of it yeah yeah I mean absolutely a team effort was it Justin who put together the like bunk desks and like so
that was so early on I recruited Logistics in order to make things possible and I'm someone that doesn't like to ask for help I'm a I just want to do it myself I'll I'll put in the leg work this was too much but it was impossible this was a good it was a great exercise for me cuz I had to communicate with people and be like okay I need need help um and so they were really good about finding smart Solutions like I remember going to Justin being like okay I need this bunk desk for social to sit and he's like
just use the shelf and I was like I was like oh yeah okay yeah when I saw that I was like oh smart that was really funny yeah yeah um and the same with the desks I had given him a drawing of like oh here's kind of like what I had in mind and he and then Logistics I think Alex was like can we just put a desk on top of another desk I was like yeah okay sure fine uh the pered Retreat asks the only thing I'm trying to figure out is does Gary actually like Ark at all obviously
he's holding Intel stock but lonus can you comment don't read too much into a joke there is knowing Gary do you guys have any idea what his background is the guy's the guy's ethical there's no way he's holding Intel stock and boosting Arc what Gary is an Enthusiast for is exciting Innovative new technology that's why the guy buys dumb stuff like quad effect that's why buys into and daily drives stuff like Ark so that he was there if it takes off he was there before it took off he's an early adopter
um to a fault right his personal computer is like super sick yeah of course it is it's not necessary yeah it's Gary yeah exactly um so fit the bill he he likes the idea of there being another competitor in the GPU space and so should you and to be clear when I say his personal computer is super sick I don't mean he just like bought expensive parts and put it in a box it's like very artfully done and took some craftsmanship if I remember correctly it's Hardline water cooled it's very
nice it's been a long time since I've seen it but it's very nice yeah uh man there's honestly there's like there's so  um oh man there's a lot of jokes that did not make it into uh the Youtube video or cuz the script was kind of rough like there's scripted Parts but then there's parts of the script that just say crawl around on you know the people in this area and interact with them a little bit right and so man we had uh did the did the line about the the clothes being red because of the
blood of the PE the underpaid people who were making them did that make it into the cut the blood making the shirt red did make it in but it did I think it was Sarah's blood though oh no that's a separate thing s Sarah or Sarah's blood is on the merch shirt and we're like why is there blood on this shirt oh because I put Blood Sweat and Tears okay got it got it got it got it um yeah anyway there's there's some stuff that definitely didn't make it in the the energy was was great was
incredible uh just you could tell people it's the kind of thing that feels like a chore in the moment or like as you're getting ready for it but then you do it and then it's over and you look back on it and you're like I'm glad I'm glad I participated in that type too fun I I couldn't believe the commitment to the bit when I got out to the backyard found out that the hot tub heater doesn't work and Jake Bellon wait it actually didn't it works but it takes like 24 hours plus of of heat Heating
and I couldn't leave it overnight cuz I'm not watching it and so every hour the day before and every hour that morning I got there like 3 hours early to put it in to give it a chance uh but it made no difference it was freezing cold it was freaking cold it was raining wasn't it and the fact that Jake bance and Jake tyy were like Belle was in there a long time because he was in there from when we shot the LTT when we shot that portion of it I didn't realize they were separate
that makes sense until Jake tyy arrived and got in with him and then shot that entire short circuit video oh man I I I I couldn't believe it like the and the poor editors like they were there almost all day on their buckets oh they weren't sitting on buckets they were sitting on the ground oh right right their desk was made of buckets their desk was made of buckets yeah I got a I got a pretty good idea of what the vibe was going to be like when David messaged the general chat and he
goes hey does anyone have any camping chairs or five gallon buckets I need as many as I can get it wasn't the Whip and Piller that uh that tipped you off I didn't see that fun fact that riding crop that Dennis is using to hit Gary with during the uh the torture scene yeah we already had that yeah create a warehouse that's some upcoming merch our new lineup oh my it was actually an inspiration piece for the ultimate cat teaser oh yeah cuz I had told those guys I wanted the quality to be um kind of
similar to like a like a leather wrapped riding crop  play I had meant more like an actual riding crop you know you know the like type of people when you you ask for that and they don't go to like Stampede they go to a slightly different organization to acquire one yeah it's like hm any cuz we we have like literally down the road yeah there's a shop you could buy an actual one for horses I know like I know pretty cool yeah now that it's over are you ready for the next one oh I
thought we weren't doing another one we're never doing April fools again that  fools so did did you did you was it worth it it was definitely worth it and uh I had a good time doing it I was very exhausted I'm still like kind kind of recovering but uh I go on vacation next week so it's perfect timing um but yeah it was a thrill uh this is kind of the projects the kind of projects I want to do so I'm uh I was very happy to be doing it all right cool all right thanks David appreciate you sticking around
with us for uh for a pretty late day for wait no sorry hold on I can't let you go just yet um speaking of you being tired okay there yeah there's um we have some mer I forgot we had some merch messages um pertaining to this uh Robert asks uh this year's April fools video was probably top three for me uh how far out do you start planning writing and shooting the April fools videos well we started next year's so that gives you an indication uh I was brought in to this one a few
months ago uh and there had already been the idea uh and I was kind of given like hey write a script and or come up with ideas and we'll talk to lus and stuff so it's been probably three-ish months that has really been sort of in prog and then the last 3 weeks here for me have been 100% dedicated to this um maybe like 90% I have other stuff to do but um so it's 3 months of planning kind of going and then 3 four weeks of like Full Tilt making it happen I'm trying to see here
when we asked the tenants um if they were chill with it uh November 20th wow was when we was when we pivoted because we had originally planned something else and we realized that it was not going to be possible to execute in time I think I was still a shooter at that point yeah so that was that was our initial Outreach um oh no that wasn't even initial Outreach that was like Ivon connecting everyone to talk about it in more detail uhing wait what did lwig just do what did lwig just do oh no oh
no we have a curse lwig video released during Wan show whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa what is what did he do what is this about is this is this is this something to lewig video just dropped okay hold on whoa why is everyone talking about this I oh no stop doing this emergency stream is that it that's live right now I don't think so oh okay they're confused float plane notification you mean our lwig video oh oh oh the lwig video is out oh okay well that's probably bad timing anywh who
well let's continue with W show yeah floaters are floaters have got a lot of content to watch okay sorry let me just see if there's a couple of other I love you guys calling them floaters is Aaron asks the April Fool's joke seemed like a lot of work what was the most difficult thing the most difficult  off I think it's the people I think there's some departments that were like super on board and there's some that I had to make it just so so many accommodations for uh and I had to make
a lot of my work was making sure that they could arrive at the house and start working um because they were more concerned with making sure that they weren't losing productivity so cuz some deadlines are not even they're not self-imposed they're not management imposed they're like government imposed so I'm sure accounting had some concerns about like hitting deadlines well they they weren't too bad I don't want to name the department I'm not I don't want to that fair enough fair enough but I
think um but I think it's getting the people there is the hardest part there's no like single prop that was super hard um it's just like timing the people having it all work out and I think like I just we got so lucky that everything was lining up uh and there was no huge issues and it was like spitting rain sometimes but it didn't rain too much and the times we really needed to be outside and walking around it let up and like there there was a lot that went right it kind of reminded me of some of
those old uh like production ad production shoots way back in the day for like Asus and Funk and stuff like that where like oh yeah I'm sure it had started if the wind had picked up like this 20 minutes earlier we wouldn't have gotten the shoot done if the if the if the water seal had broken on the camera you 5 minutes earlier we wouldn't have finished getting the shoot and like just it it reminded me of the old days in more ways than one uh all right let me see if there's uh
any other the the old days as far as I can tell we have fairly diligently after the fact labeled all of the April Fool's video with April Fool's joke at the beginning of the title so if you want to look up our old videos it's actually pretty easy to do I wanted to look at our 2013 one and found that a lot of them are are labeled April fools 2016 April Fool's jokes well Luke do you know why no because we had to because too many people believe [Laughter] it was actually causing problems and
before you guys say hey um oh yes oh yeah we'll do that right away uh before you guys say they're probably trolls lus you're falling for the no you have no idea I can tell the difference after we labeled it April fools this this should tell you after we labeled it April fools the problem went away yeah but a significant number of our previous April Fools have needed the label sooner rather than later or it's been a real problem that's pretty funny yeah I I just I don't really know what to I don't
really know what to say other than I think was it George Carlin who famously said think of an average person half yeah half of people are dumber than that I I still I still love the fractal design R for unboxing April fools it's just like I I Adore this type of humor was it your idea to just leave it there for 11 minutes yeah because back then I here we uh no back back then that was the typical length of our videos and uh there was no preview like that there was no thumbnail preview or um like U like
timeline preview that's the one so the video is just um yeah 10 minutes of it just sitting in the yard so this was I think the third time I had unboxed this case yeah the first time I unboxed it again so the second time I unboxed it was because I forgot yes I legitimately made an entire new unboxing about the Define R4 not realizing I had already done it you know you've unbox too many things when yeah and then yeah you you drop it yeah I just I just find this so  H I don't even know what I'm saying I
watched the server room on fire one that one was not funny yeah I I cuz my kids asked if we had ever done a prank on our staff for April Fools and that one if I recall correctly you guys didn't know didn't know but like figured it out I guess uh pretty quickly why was the reactions like really bad yeah it's just it just like isn't funny and the fire pole one is not very good but I'd say the rest of them the fire Poole meme lived for far too long Luke the fire Poole meme is
still alive still alive still alive David can you tell us when was the last sighting of the fire pole it's in the April Fools video okay people kept saying this I didn't see it it's very short if you watching that video there's 11 more minutes of nothing other than that case just sitting in the grass it's it's amazing that's my type of April fools yeah I I love that kind of stuff um so hold on I got ads what is this ad okay so here's a here's the video oh look we've got David just floating here
I love it hell David um he looks like a suggested video I I click on me click on me please I get credit for this one go Linus uh but going out my executive exit oh wait no not the one a little bit further uh hold on wait for it where did I go oh yeah here we go here we go here we go going out my executive exit Okay this is David the executive exit just like out the window so I don't have to see everyone I totally ripped that oh did you see it you see it I didn't like put together it was supposed to be the
fire pole I thought it was just like a  and that's really funny actually dude this video is worth watching at minimum five times yeah I didn't really think about watching it again but I feel like I have to there are especially for someone who actually worked out of this office that it is so full of inside jokes and references to the old days and random weird little Easter eggs and props I don't think that if you gave me 6 months to do it on my own right like this is not something that could have
been done in one mind many Minds I couldn't have come up with this many references and I worked there the whole time like I yeah it's absolutely brilliant people are like whoa I missed that someone said why didn't you was on a float plane which is a pretty good question that is a good question the reason is because I didn't have another float plane window oh no I did have another float plane window open okay I usually don't have a second float plane window open and then I always screw up
redirect the and I go somewhere else it takes away my chat and there's a solution to that there's a very easy solution to that but I just am in the habit of not browsing float plane because I I always do it and then it Clos my chat yeah um I just wanted to Raz you yeah oh man so yeah float plane if you are not subscribed on float plane now is the time to do it there's a couple of reasons for that one is that pricing is actually going up in a little while I've heard about this um but
because of our commitment to uh to to to honoring our agreements uh anyone who subscribes at Old pricing will be grandfathered in at that pricing that's cool because I haven't confirmed we can do that yet so we'll figure it out no they have to be okay yeah it has to be that it has this is the way sick uh yep anyway so thanks yeah m is Leed development yeah um I'm I'm pretty sure it'll be fine we already have a grandfathering system I just don't know about extending it to multiple tiers but
we'll figure it out so we'll make it work and uh the other the other reason is that it is full of amazing content right now they did spring break on float plane um which involved a whole bunch of exclusives so we've got Labs hide and seek we've got extras from the uh bedet shoot with lewig we've got Tanner revisiting black lab computers he went back for a six-month update to see what it looks like now there was the departmental airplane paper airplane battle um which I totally won don't
bother uh checking extra is from the world's biggest gaming screen and of course the hour and a half long behind the scenes that uh the reviews are in and people are loving it's good it has an Infinity like dislike ratio um I was pretty upset at you in the video cuz you keep being like the behind the scenes is going to be better than video and I was like screw you the video's going to be great but uh you're right the behind the scenes is better well it's not I didn't mean that in like an insulting way I
just meant I just meant there was so much depth to everything that was going on that there was absolutely no possible way that it could be absorbed in a YouTube video length there was no possible way so the behind the scenes has all this additional context and all this additional interaction uh you get to see you know just everyone kind of goofing around like the energy on the shoot was so positive I've already it's so long that I haven't had time to watch it but I have literally marked out time
to watch it tomorrow uh I'm genuinely quite excited I think the best uh the best review of it that I saw was someone saying I clicked it without checking the Tim stamp and then didn't check how long I'd been watching and I was an hour and 15 minutes into it that's a that's a good review that's extreme they watched a movie yeah so kudos to the social team for putting that together and of course the editing team helps by kind of earmarking bits that don't make the cut um but they but they
do go into the behind the scenes and uh oh yeah I got to give credit to Sammy for just being an absolute unit because while you know Andrew did awesome you know getting the the real video shot the YouTube video shot when Andrew could turn off his camera and take a break I  rolling um yeah anyway now's a really good time to get subscribed over on float plane we've got a ton of really great content over there and of course the entire bad catalog as well all right I think that was it for Merch messages
that were explicitly directed at David okay now that we started acknowledging them a couple more of them came in um okay no no okay no I think I think you're good I think you're good David I think that well I wanted to ask chat question cuz I haven't seen very many comments one about my favorite joke in the entire video which is the Mad Max joke where a 100 people enter one person gets rich and I'm very disappointed no one has commented about that cuz I think that's a brilliant joke Oh I thought was
hilarious so funny it's one of those things I was a little worried about because you know I mean you know how Reddit can be uh the the fact that the fact that actors have to have it in their contract that they can't like be mean as part of their character because then fans might not like them anymore they might think they're mean like that kind of thing the fact that that has to exist I mean George Carlin once did a bit about how you okay whatever we we've talked about this already um but that
was one of those lines that honestly I read it that's David's line that's not my line um I read it and I went can I trust the audience to be smart enough to know that this is a line I am playing a character and I wasn't sure but I thought it was so funny and I thought it was worth it yeah that was one and before it got to you I was told I don't think people will get that you should cut it and I was like I will not I will fight it has to make it one of the things that I liked about that was even
if you didn't get it from like a Mad Max reference it's still funny yeah mhm it's still works so and it's just more funny if you get the reference the other thing I was wondering too I wish we had a Tracker but we we we had that PS5 uh jailbreaking joke that has a link in the description cuz we faked you know the the the the UI to make it look like we had a hacked PS5 and if you click the link it's a Rick Roll and I really wish I could know how many people click that link with oh did we not use a track I
didn't know that was a thing we have one if you ever want something like that in the future just let me know yeah we we have our room set up for sponsors chat some of you guys can let me know what uh how many people clicked says I  screen that's all I wanted to there's a lot of people saying they clicked it that's awesome hate and love you clicked it I clicked it clicked it yeah twitch chat yeah I mean well those guys are idiots so I'm I love you twitch I love you twitch
chat I love your Twitch watch ads watch ads um Colton Colton turned the ads back on that's why the ads are back on so I remember I kept turning them off yeah yeah so Colton turned them on he told me not to touch it anymore like okay all right fine buddy so good all right all right thank you so much for hanging around late today David my pleasure thank you so much for having me all right take care see you bye bye thank you all right moving on to your regularly scheduled programming oh wait
no before we do that uh we got to talk about our collaboration just going to say are you going to suit up yeah dog yeah you guys might have sizes in there oh okay hold on I'll make sure I get the right size then actually this game's like the kind of thing that David would want hey David before you wander off let me just see if I have your size here I think you'd be into this okay uh we got one extra are you a medium or a large uh probably large these days no I new medium W okay all right everybody from
aex chat check this out check this out we heard from the Terry Fox Foundation who we have never actually collaborated with even though we've talked about Terry a little bit on the show before and um basically the extent of it is that they were like hey it would be super chill um if you guys if you guys wore the shirts that we're doing this year and then there's a hold on there's a message inside here here it is uh that I just wanted to read actually here uh Luke do you want to read this because
I'm probably going to cry if I do it so um I'm just going to change into my  cry all right I'm going to throw mine on thanks David it would be a really funny combination of you like flexing in the shirt him crying and I'm reading out the note I would find that very entertaining thank you for the shirt uh yeah the Terry Fox Foundation Terry's courage and determination to always keep going no matter what continues to inspire millions of Canadians 44 years after his iconic marathon of Hope the Terry Fox
Foundation is kicking off the 2024 Terry Fox run by once again teaming up with Ryan rennolds to launch a limited edition shirt that features the tagline no matter what as a reminder of Terry's strength persistence and commitment to fund raise for cancer research Canadians can now order the limited edition shirt at Terry fox.org with all proceeds supporting critical cancer research in Canada we encourage you to share a photo wearing the shirt alongside a caption outlining how you'll honor Terry's dream
of a world without cancer tagging at Terry Fox foundation and # no matter what on April 12th the same day that Terry began his marathon of Hope in 1980 Canadians will be able to register and begin fundraising for this year's Terry Fox run which will take place on Sunday September 15th 2024 thank you so much for your support absolute Chad how did I read that I don't know properly I don't know it's an important message apparently apparently you could you you got another gear man
uh so guys go check that out we're gonna we're going to throw uh Dan do you mind throwing some links in the in the chat for everyone and we'll throw that in the video description absolutely absolutely yeah there was uh I think this was supposed to go out next week but uh registration for the Foxon will open on April 12th oh okay uh did did we jump the gun I think so I'll throw some I'll throw we were late we ended up being early uh well you know what we can give it another shout out yeah we're going to
give we're going to get you guys a reminder next week okay so uh let's Dan do you mind actually making a note of that as well to make sure that we get a reminder in there next week can they buy the shirt now though I am unsure there's already people in floing chat saying they're donating already aome great well you can always just donate like that's cool too cuz like the shirts the I mean you know it's no LTT shirt but yeah yeah yeah it's it's a cool shirt but realistically what they need is not
shirt sales what they need is money uh the Terry Fox Foundation has done absolutely incredible work over the last four and a half decades uh in the fight against cancer and you know what cancer um let me just see I do like both the shirts are cool but your long sleeve having the writing on the arm is like pretty sweet there we go I think it's that way yeah yeah no matter what let's go pretty cool all right so uh here it is just head on over to ways to give over here you can donate once you can
donate monthly um yeah absolutely incredible incredible organization do they all right thanks Dan oh show off the back of the shirt hold on what's on the back is writing on the back oh yeah there we go okay hold on you want to read it for me no matter the distance no matter the obstacles no matter the journey no matter the odds no matter what uh Terry Fox run for cancer  yeah um okay should we jump right into the show yes oh what do you want to do should we do should we do AI as just underpaid
foreigners yeah yeah let's do it all right let's do it Amazon Amazon will be phasing out its cashierless checkout system called just walk out which launched in 2016 you may remember that was one of my first big controversy actually it might have been might have been the first big one I think that was the first time I was ever covered in mainstream news who never talks about me unless it's something negative um yeah so uh it launched in 2016 we went and checked out the Amazon
GH store which uh was in Seattle and was the very very first prototype of that um it was available at 27 of their 44 Amazon fresh grocery stores and the idea was that it was supposed to allow customers to scan in at the door then have the items that they pick up tallied and automatically rung up by a machine Vision system using cameras and sensors uh my understanding was it was more than just cameras like there were weight sensors on on the shelves and stuff like that however it was recently revealed that
the system was actually heavily dependent on a large team of over a thousand overseas workers based mostly in India now when I say underpaid I'm sure that Amazon was above the legal limit in India but what I will say is that you know probably they weren't paid that much compared to Amazon's balance sheet if you are interested in this uh there's a lot of coverage on these groups and it's like really bad uh so Amazon CLA I mean I'm sure they'd rather be working on this than you know know training like
Gore algorithms or whatever which is another thing that they do Amazon Mechanical Turk I'll jump over to my screen really quick oh no what is this they definitely don't just uh work for the you know Amazon walk-in stores this is a service that you can get from Amazon for a global on demand 24/7 Workforce did you know you can hire people through Amazon Mechanical Turk mean I don't know am I missing something here I don't know no seriously though what does Mechanical Turk mean like can like
what what what is the what is the what is this branding M Turk offers developers access to a diverse OnDemand Workforce through a flexible user interface uh or direct integration with a simple API hold on a second can I just say that that use of the word diverse is quite possibly the most toxic that I have ever encountered ever I wonder if they count it in like in their  diversification organizations can harness the power of crowdsourcing via Mt Turk for a range of use cases such as
microwork human insights and machine learning development so cool dude so Amazon claimed that these workers were mostly tasked with improving it machine learning algorithms by annotating training footage yes um and that is totally a thing that doesn't mean that AI is just low wage workers from overseas uh okay apparently Mechanical Turk was a I I remember this because I looked it up when I first heard about this Mechanical Turk was a a chess playing robot a fake chess playing robot
okay yeah I still probably wouldn't have gone with that oh yeah definitely not for sure cool um anyway so that is that is a real thing there a fraudulent chess machine that makes it actually genuinely funnier to me sorry the Mechanical Turk also known as the uh automaton chess player uh or simply The Turk was a fraudulent chess playing machine constructed in 1770 which appeared to be able to play a strong game of chess against a human opponent for for 84 years it was exhibited on various tours the machine
survived and continued giving occasional exhibitions until 1854 before when a fire swept through the museum where it was kept destroying the machine afterwards articles were published by a son of the machine's owner revealing its secrets to the public that it was an   company it's like ltt's new product  and we'll we'll we'll use the diverse  people I love how the third benefit of Mechanical Turk is reduced cost yeah oh they talk about how great the the team is and then they're like reduce
cost okay so anyway hold on hold on okay so back to back to that just because you are using humans to validate the data that does not mean that it's not machine learning it can still be machine learning machine learning needs to be reinforced and you can't just have another machine reinforce the other machine you actually have to have humans go in and say okay no no that was that was a sandwich uh that was not a wrap right um okay sorry people people are yelling at me to read the next paragraph
um oh no so and I I skimmed it dra rayu says wait is this Amazon's April Fool's joke no this thing has been around for quite a while yeah so yeah the part that I think they want me to read cuz people are saying the next paragraph other people saying the third paragraph I think it's the third one uh The Turk was in fact a mechanical illusion that allowed a human Chessmaster hiding inside to operate the machine so it's a it's a hidden person inside of a thing that you think is a
machine wow so it got too real here yeah okay I think they're being like super literal they're like this is an AI program that is actually a bunch of people the soil in is made out of people all right okay okay okay it's not quite that well I don't know anything about the like working conditions or whatever but anyway this is this is 100% still machine learning the fact that 30% of them worked without human intervention is is something um but that's more like probably where they expected to be
within a few months of launch not where they expected to be 8 years on from the launch uh according to a report by the information around 70% of transactions required the intervention intervention or assistance of an unseen off-site employee as of 2022 this apparently sometimes resulted in customers waiting hours before receiving a receipt that makes sense Amazon will however continue with another cashierless feature that it's been experimenting with since 2020 Dash carts which are a combination of
shopping cart SL self checkout uh this is similar to another odd case discovered in December when a supposedly AI powered drive-thru Presto automation which also needed uh overseas workers to step in 70% of the time according to a  SEC okay um so our discussion question is um what is the value of making it feel like something is totally automated even when it actually still takes a lot of human work to pull off uh one thing not mentioned in our notes Here is apparently uh one of the other issues
was that however whatever labor they were saving in cashiers um they were more than paying for in the army of people that had to go around and make sure that all of the products were perfectly faced so that the cameras could tell what people were taking off the shelves oh wow yeah you know what I mean I made a video about it because I legitimately thought it was really cool it seemed I I expressed at the time some doubts about the the viability of it I was like wow this kind of amazing that
they can do this because like uh I don't see like you know Machine Vision indicators of any they don't have like a DOT code on it that you know whatever angle it can kind of catch a glimpse of and and and be sure like I I was I was really impressed but turns out I got Bamboozled turns out Mechanical Turk worker number 47283 was like I'm going to charge this guy yeah x amount of dollars yeah while making a scent speaking of which anle Turk fees  assignment okay well that tells you
everything you need to know about how much people are being paid because unless they can do 700 assignments well hold on per hour Amazon's definitely taking something no just hold on hold on no no I know but that's not the math and that's also minimum fee I know that's not the math though the math is that unless a okay I see what you're doing can do 700 assignments per minute which would be or per hour rather which would work out to what 11 per uh 11 per second no hold on I'm not I can't math math me
help me 700 let's let's say let's say say 600 let's say we're aiming for $10 an hour okay so they've got to do they've got to do what a hundred every six minutes no a th every six a th every six minutes okay hold on one cent oh my God so that's a thousand things so they've got to do a 100 every six minutes right yeah okay so 10 a second so about 10 a second is that right I don't know no hold on I hate can time be metric please okay uh 100 we should we should divided 60 we should hire mechanical go
so they have to do about 1.7 of those a second and that assumes they are being paid $10 an hour which is not a good wage and that assumes Amazon  nothing 100 every six minutes is 10 per second where did you get 1.7 oh I missed a zero oh so every six minutes 6 minutes is how  help me out oh I'm so tired I was walking you oh they tried metric time people hated it okay okay okay okay so hold on a second okay oh I said that wrong is that what I said I didn't mean to say that I meant one
minute okay apparently chat apparently can't do it either because they are all over the place why are we so bad at math okay all right we're trying to do it fast we got to slow down okay okay okay so it's 1 second it's Point uh uh 1 cent per interaction okay so it's 100 interactions to a dollar it's a th000 interactions to $10 right so we've got a th000 interactions if we want to get "paid $10 in an hour we divide 1,000 by" 60 that's the number per minute so that is 16.6 interactions per minute we divide
it by 60 again that means we've got about 4 seconds per interaction I have done math with a calculator this time 4 seconds per interaction and that assumes you're being paid only $10 an hour and that assumes that Amazon is taking no cut what the isn't it 3.6 per second yeah I think so but I think he rounded up yeah I rounded okay what the heck is going on here has anyone worked for this  man that is that is wild here's the Mechanical Turk worker page  o one dude said he did I worked for it
you need to pick jobs carefully okay what does that mean uh I think that oh because the minimum payment thing so if you select the job I don't know if that's how this works but if you select the job you might be able to select ones that are higher value I was also reading the page and there's like different qualifications so maybe if you have a higher qualification you can get higher value jobs and then you get paid more per job quite a few people in float plane chat are talking about
this uh someone says M Turk is pretty dead now but I used to do surveys for extra money in college uh someone else said I did some murk in college never saw a scent uh someone said I knew someone who did work for M Turk they said it was mostly just transcribing documents yes I did it for beer money in college it's not full gig stuff um  H I've worked for Less with a family business okay I mean yeah fair enough I guess um in theory says Mt Economist I think the one-cent ones are supposed to be
click on the picture containing a bicycle I mean man for how long it takes me to solve a capture sometimes yeah cuz like even that you'd have to do one every 3.6 seconds and consistently with  wow all right anyway um okay okay okay so trash cat says I've i m Turk work and yeah you need to pick M carefully but generally minimum 10 cents per task in my experience okay so that's quite a bit better that's way better that's literally in order are those more complicated tasks or is that click on the
bike oh like I wonder how much would have someone would have been paid to identify your order value from that store it must have been a lot higher I would hope so because you reviewing video footage can be very timec consuming it's not just scrub through yeah we're good because they need to they need to be sure that's the whole idea because if they're training the Machine Vision model and they they feed it incorrect data that's that's a disaster like you I mean obviously people are human they
make mistakes from time to time esally if they're being paid you know pennies per interaction or you know whatever but the more of that noise that you feed into your model the worser it is going to get the more perfect the data you give it the better there's a very wide range of tasks apparently some will give $5 for a 15minute server I have worked for mtk and used it to find participants for studies interesting interesting all right well there you go M Turk man I I don't know how I'd never heard of this
before cuz apparently it's a big deal Valen cry said you'd have to be very diligent and hardcore to make uh more than minimum wage the good jobs are taken quick that makes be allocated within a couple minutes every few hours right cuz it's going to be like every and people in every time zone around the world just like sitting there waiting for the a gig to show up crazy yeah okay I love twitch chat this all this Mech Turk stuff looks it's like Outsourcing low paying jobs to third world countries
legally good job twitch gets there eventually and in this case I'm pretty sure they're all contractors they get there eventually Luke yeah that's twitch chat they got it they got it they got it they figured it out the contractor thing makes it way worse here's a cook key um yeah the fact they're contract H yeah contractors cuz there can be really good things about being a contractor there can also be super bad things about being a contractor and there's a little bit of a pattern of certain modern like web
companies that need actual like people physically doing their jobs using specifically contractors and paying very little it's not great uh you know what is great merch messages that's true you guys can interact with the show using a merch message don't do a super chat don't do a twitch bit the way to go is merch messages all you got to do is head over to LTT store.com and in the checkout you're going to see a box anytime we're live where you can fill in a merch message uh do we have any merch updates
that are in the dock here Dan I don't uh  here um oh oh oh wow yeah okay right we've got the a limited edition shirt that we did for April fools yeah these are going to be Printing and I believe the next week or so well going to printing in the next week or so and then they will yeah so it's going to be available oh until tomorrow this is this is available until tomorrow and then we're going to be hopefully printing them yeah over the next few weeks here so they'll go out there it's a Sarah did
this up uh pretty quick it's it's a welcome welcome home shirt it's got the uh the old house got the old got the old lambo car which is U you know it's going to be more of a reference to pl's car soon I think with what we're planning to  vacation oh boy well I didn't want anyone to be jealous about the fact that he's getting free upgrades for his car oh yeah so it comes with a condition oh boy we get to decorate oh boy yeah it's going to be good you should do a whole company paint party
like last time yeah so when you leave a merch message right in the Box in the checkout you will either have it show up down here you are going to get a reply from producer Dan or it will be forwarded to someone internally and that person might be me and Luke where we will address your merch message on the show we're going to show you guys how it works Dan's going to pick us a couple curated merch messages but first I've got a quick Poll for him to set up for you guys before we do those so that you
guys can weigh in on what you want to see um we're working on a new short short we're working on a new shirt and we want it to have like a like a name tag holder mechanism of some sort and we want your feedback on what you think is the best so option A is a little reinforced ring so that's like a little a little metal ring so this is how it would sit all right there's option A Luke are you going to waigh in on this sorry I got linked something that was option b d-ring with a little
Carabiner that can be tucked into the pocket when it's not in use I kind of like that okay all right hold on so right right right this one has uh options so you can either hang it right off the ding or you could hang it off the Carabiner if you have to uh scan in on doors and stuff like that option C simple folded webbing Loop there we go and option D is Ding and Carabiner base of pocket okay so those are our four options a b c and d is this a like tougher shirt or is this a dressier
shirt it's meant to be an everyday everyday wear shirt so we understand that a lot of our audience are like Tex yeah and they're going to be crawling under a desk sometimes but they still got to look good okay so it's like a little it's not you're not working in a mechanical shop but you're not just sitting at a desk it's it's a it's um yeah it's a take a little bit more it's an office office worker yeah and when I say worker I don't mean like you just have to sit at the computer you can wear
it for that it's great for that too but we want it to be a little bit tougher than that uh all right so here we'll get our results I think in that case if I had to vote it would probably be are they saying B yeah I'm thinking I'm saying b as well because if you need to slide around on the ground being able to tuck the whole thing into the pocket really easily seems like a cool feature yeah that could be a bonus I like that a lot all right all right why don't we do a couple of merch messages sure first
one here hey din Duke and Lan do you have any tips for someone struggling to stay disciplined whether it be for work  hobby oh man I think Nike said it best like just do it yeah I I don't really know what else there is to say you you you have to decide what's important and you've got to you've got to commit no excuses there's there's a lot of different way like if you are incapable of doing that there are other things you can do we talked about this on last wow actually accountabil auddy type
situation um yeah don't go to the gym by yourself it doesn't work you have to go with someone you have there there has to be a reason unless they're sick all the time yeah well I mean everyone I think I think it's fair to say that either everyone or at least almost everyone has better discipline planning ahead everyone knows that they should work out tomorrow everyone knows that they should go grocery shopping on the weekend and cook their meals but not everyone in the
moment is going to feel like working out right now or going grocery shopping and cooking right now something I do specifically for both of those two things is like I'll pack my gym bag ahead of time yeah and like I'll I'll leave it like by the door so that it's like it's shaming you yes it's a reminder the food thing prep it before you're hungry and then when it's that meal comes up it's like oh you like could eat junk or you could go get some food or you could order delivery or
whatever but actually the easiest option right now is eating the stuff you already prepped so like remove barriers  and I don't know if people are going to like this but yeah in increase levels of like you know have a have a buddy that does the thing with you or your partner or whatever else um try to keep you keep you on it like have a workout buddy or or do meal prepping with someone else I don't know so I uh I I I never book badminton by myself I book it ahead of time because I know that you know I
should go exercise and you know do stuff and then when it's time to go well there's a lot of obstacles to not going I'm going to have to pay anyway because I signed up ahead of time and I'm not going to be there so they're going to be short people so the rotations are going to be off so I better go someone in fling chat said we have no friends I actually don't agree that that's an excuse got them because not only is there a bunch of online communities where people are in the exact same boat
and you could probably find an accountability buddy there but I've found if you go to the gym for example if we're just using that that one it's actually quite easy to make friends everyone there is there for the same reason yeah everybody and like I like I made friends with this dude literally earlier this week cuz I saw he had lifting shoes and he finished a set and was just kind of standing there so I walked up to him and was like hey what's up he's like hey what's going on I was like I saw you
have lifting shoes how do you like those and his whole he just lit up everybody if you ask them but like what they're doing or why they spent all this time researching it they spent all this money on it they're using it actively they've worked really hard no one in their life cares at all like not even a little bit wow you sound uh you sound mad it's I'm not mad are you mad bro it's just real cuz like he's always trying to tell me about how much he lifted I'm like doesn't even
care a little bit is that a lot yeah that's the worst one that's the worst um but like sounds like a lot good job nobody cares gold star but but that other person at the gym yeah might actually care yeah so like it's it's quite easy to make friends with people there um if you if you work in an office try to find someone else like if they're if they're often going out for food every lunch you know try to make a PCT with them like let's let's eat let's take our lunches together and eat
together and eat stuff we brought home like brought from home like let's make this like a thing hold each other accountable let's try to save some money eat better stuff like that um and you don't even have to you don't even have to do it because you're like uh I want to lose weight you could do it because you want to to save some money you can make great things at home I don't know it's an option oh man common twitch L I actually hate you no super chats just buy something from me and I'll mention your
comment so you'd rather just throw money at the screen than get something in return this is actually better how can you not see that yeah like I've I I've had people at the gym well I'll ask them about like a certain movement that they're doing or whatever and it'll get they get so excited about it and like these they don't know who I am I'm just some random dude at the gym yeah they'll get so excited about it that I they end up talking to me about it like far longer than I had hoped they
would I'm like ready to do my next set of whatever I'm doing like kind of hoping this person will stop talking but they're just like like so stoked to talk about this thing that they're really interested in oh no they're still mad cuz they don't have to spend cuz they don't have to spend shipping costs on their D then just buy a gift card and never use it yeah it's crazy there's loopholes it's it's a it's a nuts why do you want to give me money for nothing buy a backpack set the shipping address
to like a a homeless shelter boom sure you donated backpack like oh man you guys are killing me here you're killing me you know what you know what b boom Oh you lost your privileges it finally happened you lost your privileges all right look what you've done twitch no wait hold on no no that's not that's not bring them back one person can't represent the whole there oh never mind Get  Wrecked uh all right two two other things I'll add just you you just can't shut up about this
you are actually you are actually perfectly exemplifying the phenomenon you're talking about you get a gym person talking about the bloody gym they can't shut up it is a problem it's not possible I could literally go on forever I've I've done it to Dan I'm I'm living vicariously through Luke is it it's not it's true though right I think every time I have brought it up people are like well have you tried this cuz it's all it's all interesting I'm like no  shows I've done did you hurt your
shoulder well actually I didn't hurt my shoulder I read the papers on them full like partials are good for the um anyways no but like there's there's two things that I use as well one is try to do better than yesterday so if you're if you're like oh I I don't want to take the stairs today I'm tired and then just let that thing in the back of your head go like you did it yesterday you did it yes you found a way yesterday and then it's like oh fine and then you go do it it's great um and then
the I had another one well that's fine cuz it's time to do another merch message Dan hit us okay sure uh let's see Hello wdl pran Dill hello w. Dill uh I'll be starting my first home lab soon and would like some advice on security what's some ways I can keep my family safe while they use my services such as jelly fin well I mean if you are the one running the services I don't think there's much that you have to do to keep your family safe um they're a threat your family no the this person oh
um how do I protect them for myself yeah I mean okay I'm going to get I'm going to get flamed for this I I know I know it I know it realistically unless you are some kind of a jelly fin server and like having a port open on your router probably fine is it fine vulnerability yes it is are you running Windows Defender probably it's probably right it's probably fine um I mean I would say I would say you know a more realistic concern keep would be you know how do I manage the parental settings to ensure
that young kids don't just have access to all the R-rated movies in my library like I I I I would I would be more  you know change your default passwords keep everything up to date you know the the basics the basics just make sure you're going in and making sure everything's chill uh check the logs for the devices that have connected to your network once in a while use guest Wi-Fi guest Wi-Fi totally awesome uh if you want to be if you want to be a little bit if you want to be a little bit more
careful you know have a really strong password on your main Wi-Fi like there's if you're asking this and you have iot devices running on your main Network you're addressing the wrong problem I would also say yeah that's another one I mean we don't know that you do it's possible that you that you've got a separate iot Network yep my family was murdered by an open  monster I saw someone say last pass was hacked by uh Dev having Plex on their system or whatever but that's almost
like proving Linus's point if you are a person that would be a very particularly interesting person to hack for whatever reason like a Dev on a piece of security software that stores the passwords to like millions of people's accounts yeah um then yeah doing that type of stuff you're opening yourself and if you're that person then I shouldn't be advising you on cyber security anyway go figure it out yeah so there's that yeahh all right got it um do you want to do another talk oh we
should do sponsors let's get sponsors we do three merch messages read the sign no did we do it though no we're we're a little bit strange on time let's do sponsors and then yeah show is brought to you by C Sonic one of the hardest parts of our April Fool's prank or video was trusting Dennis to be in my house again uh my notes just say briefly talk about the car break-in prank so so I come out of the house and see this someone is running away a bunch of stuff is spilled you can

so exhausted afterwards which I really you even asked him about it I was the whole time when he starts walking back and he's like huffing and puffing I was like you literally went around the corner like yeah he didn't go very far I mean you saw him try to fight me right buddy was Gass wait you were you were there in person so it didn't really make it into the edit because Dennis edited it but he man the number of times he should have been disqualified from that M I was actually frustrated like not acting
frustrated I was actually frustrated at like he he was taking it didn't make any sense it wasn't fair he was taking extremely long breaks In fairness I got the same breaks yeah but I didn't need them you would have he was completely unable to fight and would have been disqualified yeah like he couldn't move yeah anyway so yeah he he apparently hasn't been working on his cardio no so he he jogs around the corner and you just like speed walk after him well why why did you even go if you're going that
slowly okay so there's there's a number you only caught him cuz he gave up cuz he's probably too tired from going around one corner there's a number of elements here okay one oops I keep absolutely nothing of value in my car nothing ever oh the backpack was Chase's car okay yeah there was what what was like spewing out of the car uh that was the contents of my glove box so basically there's there's a power inverter there's some napkins there's some sanitary pads um there's like uh oh
there's some extra hardware for my offset license plate Mount there is nothing of value in my car ever like if I go into a restaurant you've seen me do this hey you bring the back I bring my backpack in with me I leave I mean look at that stupid thing if that's not a high-profile Target I don't know what it is so I make sure there's nothing in it it's clean you look in the window you're like damn that's a clean car like nothing not not even crumbs of food there's nothing in
there so that's number one what am I chasing him for nothing so you had you had that thought yeah I know there's nothing in my car but your your glass is broken number two that glass is not going to be unbroken by catching the guy I'm going to go through the exact same Insurance rigar roll regardless of what happens with him so what difference does it make number three what if the guy's armed so okay I don't know what I'm going to go I'm going to go put my body and my life
which I value by the way I'm going to go put that in even if the even if the risk was 1% I'm going to take a 1% chance to to have a violent encounter with someone over literally nothing of value so here's my counter hold on I'm not done yet and glass that is already broken the glass cannot be unbroken through anything other than insurance and dealing with the hassle of taking it to the shop means finally number four I caught a glimpse of his face and I thought it might be Dennis oh
okay follow him at all because you thought it might cuz my thing is like if the first three are two which is fair fairly good reasoning why go anyways well I was no you were putting Chase yeah but cuz he was so slow he was also so no his speed varied it was hard to tell from the footage okay but he like booked it and then like slowed down it was like he wanted me to chase him so I was like now to be clear when I say I saw the face he kind of had his hood down I didn't know it you wouldn't know
for sure I didn't know it was Dennis decent distance hood on so I didn't know and I told him I told him at the time I was like you got me because even though I I had all those thoughts and even though I thought and he actually found the frame where like yeah yeah yeah yeah where I was like he's like is is this cuz I smile a little bit but then but then no no because but he got me because after that the the fake glass the fake glass was what convinced me so they rolled down the window and they made sugar
glass and like put it so I've gone through that before I've actually had my car broken into multiple times and that feeling of kind of shock not not shock but like that feeling where it it actually takes a second to process when you when you come into a building and it's been broken into everything is right except the things that are wrong and it can actually take a second so this one time I I parked my car outside of our garage overnight because there was like something in the way and I come out in
the morning I sit down all the way in my driver's seat and the first thing that registered for me was actually that the seat was way back interesting I didn't actually see because I'm not in I'm not doing a pre-flight check on my car I'm not inspecting it I'm just getting in and driving and so I sat down into my seat and well this isn't quite right and then then I noticed the shattered glass all over the passenger seat so like it it can it can take a a second for something to click and um and so when I
saw the shattered glass I actually like had that click moment I relived the like my car has been broken into like the glass was the the thing that made me realize two times when my car had been broken into so what Dennis did whether it was intentional or not was he tapped into like a a an experience I've had before he tapped into a memory there's no way he knew that and recalled that emotional state that made me sort of be dismissive of my suspicions and kind of go my car's been broken into yeah so it
wasn't the right color and like yeah some of it was like almost a yellowy cuz it's cooked sugar yeah exactly but some of it was okay yep soing you know maybe it got some gross water on it or whatever that's what did the discoloring yeah uh the videoos on on Flow planes you can check it out um yeah the the only time my car has ever been broken into was there nice I I don't know if you remember but I oh hold on so uh here's where the here's where they're setting up uh I don't know this
so that's when they were preparing the fake photo of Chase's car oh here if you go if you go back you saw the orange backpack so he's editing it right there okay yeah cuz this is this is the fake he's trying to use AI to generate the glass and then he ends up just doing it himself yeah so he um he he kind of planted the seed in my mind of cars being broken into yeah which was really smart actually yeah I honestly at the time I was like why are you telling me this like cars can be
broken into anywhere like I I don't really sure I guess um yeah so they had they got Sammy to have me shoot an intro for something that he didn't need at all um and I was like yeah sure I'll shoot an intro for you I mean I like to be helpful so here he is making the broken glass see some of it is really nicely colored and then other bits are are the yellowy sugar glass yep uh Dennis told me by the way this might be in the video I'm not sure but he told me at the time that they carefully did not get any
sugar glass in my car there was definitely some in there there was sugar glass in the car yeah there was sugar glass in the car they got C they they burst one of the ketchup packets that was in my glove compartment and it got all over the passenger seat oh no it's like anytime of your stuff getting his car dirty and like dumped a bunch of my stuff onto the like wet dirty sidewalk and I'm like okay cool thanks thank you for that like what anyway um yeah my my car got broken into
at the old office and I had I had this the first nice piece of clothing I ever bought was this leather jacket from da that was called the name of the jacket was Luke nice and I didn't know that until I had picked it I was like this is perfect and then yeah it was stolen out of my car um sag oh tinan wants to know scratched floor or dirty far more annoying definitely the scratch floor that is permanent yeah that's forever it's like a diamond diamond floor baby um yeah I might have to fight Dennis again so
we'll see budon asks why do you have ketchup in your glove box well where else would I keep it under the seat they don't give out ketchup packets by default at fast food restaurants anymore oh so it's for if you like forget to ask okay then I have a ketchup packet and it turn turns out that if you keep them forever they do go bad in case anyone was wondering about that was that one bad no okay no no no no it been replaced recently because now I know well some of them don't have expiry
dates on them some do I just love that this is like an actual problem that you've sought a solution for found issues with the solution and improved upon and iterated that solution MH that's fantastic that's my whole life [Laughter] Luke like what I'm going to eat fries without ketchup this actually does sound like a particular Linus problem that you would like seek out a solution for I fully would believe that oh yeah 100% And like man I I you need exactly the right amount of ketchup I take my fry and I
like you've probably seen me do this I've seen that I I put a strip of ketchup on the Whole Fry so the ratio is right yeah I've 100% seen that yep okay what are we doing two more topics three more topics somewhere around there oh Dan wants to do merch messages all right sure Dan I don't think we have that many this week we're a little out of order unfortunately oh I see yeah I've got some uh I've got some cure rated ones for you here all right hit me um I don't know what do you think about that top
one I mean I haven't paid enough attention to it but Luke might know and Buddy spent like $500 so I guess we can uh who yeah bought a screwdriver a backpack other more different screwdriver a stubby screwdriver a banana for scale a whole bunch of bits a sticker pack and a shaft extension uh so is this is this stop killing games that's right yeah and I don't know I've seen this guy for a while do you want me to do you want me to read this out yeah sure if you know what's going on CU I haven't I haven't I
haven't looked into this so yeah high lus and Luke what do you think of Ross Scott's call to action against Ubisoft killing the crew do you think we have any chance of preventing future games from being destroyed um now I've followed this guy for a while um and yeah so maybe Dan can do this merch message because Luke and I haven't paid attention to this I I had had it flagged for me and I've seen some Community sentiment around this that is like that this is something we need to be
supporting but I hadn't had a chance this week to dig into it yeah I've seen his videos but I I'm not up to dat on this yeah he had some really good thoughts I think I hope it was him ages ago about always online games that are single player that the companies go oh well you know we can't afford the server upkeep anymore and so the game that you have paid for you are now no longer able to play and so a lot of uh a lot of people will take these servers and host them themselves I know there's a bunch of
different games that kind of have Community hosted servers and there's no more dedicated you know first party ones anymore um so I think this is probably a call towards that right a game that lonus and I enjoyed to play every now and then is like that um SubCom I don't remember what's Supreme Commander forged Alliance forged Alliance or wait forged Alliance forever is the the community takeover of the game that was allowed to happen after gas powered games went yeah yeah but was it was it gas powered that
let them do it like some some there was like a I forget which party ultimately uh enabled that but it's pretty cool and recently I think it's City of Heroes there unfortunately a lot um and I think the worst offender is probably single player games sorry Forge Alliance forever was an example of a good thing Curr trying to talk about good things I think I think it was City of Heroes that recently just publicly was like yeah people can host their own servers and iterate on the game and
everything and good luck I don't remember what it was I might be seeing the wrong one yeah but there are some few good examples there are good examples and I think those are probably the outliers in the situation mostly bad it's mostly like this yeah um right and and it's very frustrating especially because there's still an active Community even though they may be small but they're still active well yeah this blurb here says um the video game The Crew this is on stop killing games.com
this blur says the video game The Crew published by Ubisoft was recently destroyed for all players and had a player base of at least 12 million people that's an interesting number that's not a small I'm assuming that was at one point in time I can't imagine there's that many people playing the crew right now or there's no way they'd be shutting it down but I mean you might be surprised yeah I don't know due to the game size and France's strong consumer protection laws this represents one of
the best opportunities to hold a publisher accountable for this action we are Su if we are successful in charges being pressed against Ubisoft this will have a ripple effect on the video games industry to prevent Publishers from destroying more games and then there's like buttons to click where you can take action in in various countri and stuff like that yeah yeah that's right I watched his video on the crew about a month ago it came out Dead game news is the series yeah yeah
it's brutal we talk about on W show all the time um this seems like a good thing to jump on the train for so yeah I mean look I'll say this is not a creator that I'm person I'm not personally acquainted with so I don't um but you know what I do know is I agree with the cause and if all you're being asked to do is sign a petition that says that you don't think this is okay then I think that's something that I can wholeheartedly recommend without like I already said doing any due diligence on this um I
intend to sign the petition once the show is over and I I can do that um I do think that please don't right now yeah no I'm busy right now I I do think that these companies need to be held accountable and I think that if there are no mon AR consequences not only is nothing ever going to change it is going to get so much worse oh yeah because a lot of especially younger consumers don't even understand what they've lost yet even the games that do still exist the the the the the modes the ways of
playing them that have changed as games as a service evolve are gone I mean think back to think back to what it was like when you finally quit wow and how badly you wanted to just play classic wow again and blizzard finally did it and then my understanding is they kind of bunged it up cuz didn't they start like updating it again yeah and like you you already can't actually play classic again now because it progressed through the expansions so it's already so what they need to do is they
just need to do like a like a wipe system yeah there are some there are other games that do that like if I remember correctly EverQuest has a very similar like you can play original like uh 1999 EverQuest or whatever it was 2001 I don't remember maybe RuneScape was 1999 whatever um and they they wipe frequently and most the active players as far as minor C goes for the Everest one are on the servers that are fresh because people want to play fresh experiences where everyone's starting
back at scratch all that type of stuff um but yeah in the RuneScape speaking of RuneScape didn't the RuneScape Creator just make a new game ashy you can still play classic era okay yeah uh I think I forgot that was a thing oh okay well there you go I don't know older School ruins Gap yeah is classic era wiping though I don't think it's wiping they're just permanent servers right I don't know whatever either way um okay next up yep hey L LD is there a reason why 256 characters is the
default Max path on ndfs still we run into this on my work ndfs server and it's infuriating especially because some apps don't serve proper errors man that's a question for a Windows developer um if I had to guess I would say it's because it hasn't been a priority to fix it I mean there's so so many things in Windows or Gmail or basically anything you use that um just haven't been updated because it's not the most important thing I can work on today right and I mean we run into that
all the time stuff that theoretically is a quick bug fix but in practice it's just never the thing that's on fire today I've T I've talked about that to a few people here where it's like I I wouldn't worry so much about your job security in the sense of you running out of work to do yeah there is effectively an Infinity list of tasks that we could do yeah yeah don't stress the the biggest problem is figuring out what item on this Infinity list is the thing that we should work on right now and
sometimes it can be frustrating CU someone can be really passionate about one of the things on the list yeah but there's this other thing that maybe it has to be done for some and you might not fully understand why that other thing is more important but it is yeah at least we strongly believe it is people make mistakes we get things wrong uh this is a suggestion Quantum Rand in float plane chat says try asking Dave's Garage on YouTube if there's anyone who is likely to both a no and be
dish I would say that it would be Dave's Garage um also apparently this is according to PA a drawn there is a uh registry edit where you can go in and you can change it to a higher limit uh you have to change uh file Set current control set control file system long paths Ena uh and that changes the limit according to Matthew o to 496 characters which ought to be enough for anyone that's a reference which Bill Gates apparently never said anyway it doesn't matter okay there's um there's some reason why
I had to do that in the past I don't remember what it was I think it was like development file paths that were just getting ridiculous developers developers developers developers developers got to go the nest folds for days yeah Dan sorry uh let's see uh good evening DL question for you three or whoever answers Ivory Towers are very prolific in manufacturing companies DOD subcontractors included uh how do we better guard against detached decisions I don't know it's tough because even
making a conscious effort to talk to people and work in the trenches at this company as we've grown it hasn't always been easy to fully understand the daily challenges that people have uh we had someone raise a concern so I was frustrated on a shoot recently when a prop that was integral to the intro was not sourced um well a we we had it at one point but at some point we lost it and then when we realized we lost it we didn't Source a new one and I I I I landed on set and I was like wo I can't
arrive on set and like the intro doesn't work because the prop I need for the intro isn't here we don't have one this was so preventable and the conversation that ultimately came out of out of that was hey we don't have a process for just anyone making a petty cash decision and then begging for forgiveness later there just isn't a means for it and it was a funny thing for me to think about because even before I ran my own company or whatever that was 100% something that I just did
if something was like 50 bucks and I knew that I could defend it to the CEO I would just spend the $50 and worry about  recommendation if there if there's for real though right like I got away with being a bit of a Maverick but that's not that's that's not necessarily good for your career wonder you now would deal with managing you back then oh God I it would actually be like quite the Clash I would be very frustrated both of me would be very frustrated always yeah anyway the point is what
came out of that was that hey we don't have a formalized like one of uh CEO taran's favorite words is explicit we don't have a formalized process that gives people explicit permission to make a decision like that um a lot of people just do it anyway so especially people who have been around since the old days and who have been doing it for years but especially new people don't know they don't realize they come from other companies where where spending 20 bucks that you weren't allowed to spend could
literally mean getting a dressing down right like I and that's so that's so foreign to me like I that doesn't make sense in my world cuz I never worked in that environment and I'm not going to Foster that environment here but that's efficient yeah I came across my supposed uh approval limit I don't remember when this was like a few months ago or something and just erupted with laughter I was like oh I I have approved things wildly Beyond this many times like that's actually bad though I didn't know no one
told me oh my God because the approval limits were set up when float plane was completely separate so it was genuinely not communicated to me at that time so like our Cloud flare contract which is like enormous certain other on I fought for the best genuinely fought for like the best thing we could get in a lot of these occasions and that's the thing though is which I think is why I didn't get in trouble in in good faith if you are doing the best thing for the company
and you can defend it like that's that's honestly the The Guiding star that I lived by was could I argue this and win yeah and if I can argue it and win then the conversation's over and this is not advice and realistically the trust level goes up it can however if you if you just do what you think is right and it turns out that either you weren't right or your boss is an idiot and doesn't understand you were right it could be very harmful to your it could even get you fired depending on
what's going on so like it's it's genuinely not advice yeah and that end uh my my mom loves to loves to phrase things this way especially around like traffic lessons for the kids uh she goes it doesn't matter if you're in a crosswalk it doesn't matter if the light is red it doesn't matter if you see the little Walky man you check you make sure they are actually breaking because sure you can you can be right and dead but you'll be dead right yeah yeah um and and I think it's those are those are
words to live by in everything you know walking across the street uh career relationship it doesn't matter if you're right if you get killed in the process yeah XG Ford says boss's idiot is the issue that's fair enough uh data frecking says got hit in a crosswalk yeah 100% yep yep Arbiter case says I was hit by a car when I was in a crosswalk had the right of wa 100% man I uh I I didn't take a course until I learned to ride a motorcycle and what I found out was I just kind of naturally do a
lot of defensive driving things but one of them is that I do not start moving when a light turns green no way scan I am making sure I making damn good andure that the cars on both side are decelerating with enough space to not enter the intersection every single time I've been honked at cuz I've been like I have not determined that it is safe to proceed yet and I'm just sitting there um I had a I I have a very clean driving record I've never hit anything I've never been hit I've
everything's nice I had a scare the other day it was raining really really hard yeah visibility was not very good I'm turning in a uh it's like off a seldom used Street into a parking lot there's someone that comes out from behind my pillar like I couldn't see them and they're wearing all black visibility is terrible it's raining and I see them come to a stop and I slam the car into a stop at the same time and it's like possible that that could have been bad and I was just like oh man um
and cuz like it doesn't matter that you're wearing all black it doesn't matter that it's raining it's my fault it's still your fault yeah uh CEO tan CEO Taran has uh had a really good uh trick that uh I've used since I saw him do it uh whenever he goes around a blind Corner um he'll flash his beams or honk like if it's a bad blind corner and I saw him do this in a parade was where where it like was where it f first came up to give you some idea like how blind this corner needs to don't don't punk
your horn every time you turn your car obviously uh but like um that's a good one yeah in there's a there's a par there's a parking lot that I often pull into that has an uncontrolled T intersection where there is not a lot of traffic and you may have even seen me do this but if it's night time I flash my beams as I'm going toward that intersection to make sure that's it's obvious someone is coming you never you never know like people people get hit by trains and that's not because they're
dumb it's sometimes it is but it's often not because they're dumb it's because it's not always obvious unless they're is like motion there there has to be something to break us out of our out of our Zone super zoned out sometimes yeah exactly exactly yeah I I have caught myself being really aggressive about like physically moving myself so that I can check behind pillars whenever I'm going around corners I've always been really good about checking for bikes all that other time type of stuff but I I
realized in that moment that I don't think I've been super good about making sure there isn't a thin pedestrian behind the pillar you know it's something I've noticed too as I'm getting older shoulder checking is more work it's like actually harder now that's interesting I don't really thought about that I used to be I used to be like skinnier and just you know just generally Wier like I didn't take up as much space uh like I've probably since I since I worked at NCIX I've probably put on about 25 lbs
which at for 56 is like a fair bit I'm just like generally stiffer like I'm just always like sore from working out in your defense I think a lot of it's been muscle yeah but I just mean like like I was just like you know just like moving around in a seat yeah was easier it does get harder yeah um and like you know you my neck's stiffer than it used to be and stuff so so it's it's something that I I realized a little while ago and I was like okay I need to make a very conscious effort cuz I I was
the kind of person who would like make sure I've got nothing in front of me and like look behind me like not a peripheral Vision shoulder Checker I was like anything back there let's go yeah um but yeah just I just my my cheapness doesn't want my insurance rate to go up so I don't want to hit anything that is not the reason and I care about everyone   me hey man they both count what a dick at least the car is already red all  be that's a good point my my my leather is white do you know how you know what a
bad decision that  was yeah you can keep doing topics if you as ag even further and the incontinent sets in oh I mean there's that too ohle Ian we saw Dan leaking in the uh Badminton Center tour oh yeah that's bad what there was like a puddle on the floor and I made an off-hand joke about Dan peeing himself or something or like I was just getting over food poisoning something and he goes and like what did you do you like crouched over it or something I don't remember I actually
can't remember he did something everything here is just a fever dream she like Dan the joke you've taken the you've T the joke was awful and uncomfortable Ed to to cut back yeah the editors can find the line yeah who has more power in this company than the editors for real though oh they can make a break you yeah they are the most important thing they absolutely can that's yeah that's something Ed taught me early on not not in like by doing it by making me look terrible yeah cuz you
were all like never piss off your it admin and he was like never piss off your editor cuz he he kepc first joined he kept saying like it's all in the edit it's all in the edit and I was like it's all in theit way and then I was like oh yeah we'd film something I'd be like this was trash no one's ever going to want to watch this and it comes out of the edit I'm like wow it's pretty good it's pretty watchable like okay like a couple frames can make you seem like a nonf funny like bumbling idiot or sharp
witted and hilarious actually like frames even just adding yeah exactly a little bit onto the end of every clip so you just see like you're kind of nothing lands and there's like awkward pauses and then you turn back and it's great or the whole roast video that had no laughter it's amazing to be clear it didn't need a laugh track people were losing it um but we didn't have the we didn't have the audience miked yeah ironically one of the first Productions we ever did where we hired a
professional AV company to come in and run the production for us I had we had so many comments on that video yeah these dummies never get it right blah blah blah blah blah blah blah it's like it wasn't even us come on I mean we do make mistakes absolutely but if I'm going to own mistakes I'd like for them to at least be our mistakes it's got 6 million views yeah did okay it's really funny I've gone back and watched it a couple times I I'm sure I've said this a bunch of
times but I I I'm guessing on on average I watch it like once a year yeah it's so funny I always forget at least a good chunk of it yeah Dennis and Ivon are so good oh man Ivon did not hold back [Laughter] no oh it was great anyways we doing topics topics let's do it we have a lot of topics today you got about 40 minutes till after dark Intel's Mega faab possibly haunted Intel's planned German MEAP faab has run into a potential snag in that the currently empty field where
it's supposed to be built is also the site of several Neolithic burial mounds "estimated to be about 6,000 years old" archa archaeologists have been examining the area since last year and noticed that a small hill in the industrial park was actually an ancient grave complex the site contains multiple Graves including a chariot burial where sacrificed cattle were buried alongside a human being in formation that was meant to imitate a driver and cart pulled by The Animals archaeologists
will be working to preserve the discovery though Intel is still expected to begin construction on schedule can you imagine being that archaeologist like usually I would imagine you're kind of working you know within budget at a pace that is reasonable and it's going to be like Pat gillson you're breathing down your neck can we build yet can we build yet billions of dollars you have any idea how much our stock just crashed based on how our Fab business is looking right now I have some investors to
please can we build yet it would be kind aake if they did like a statue of the The Chariot setup to be clear to be clear I still like Intel in the long term but I made it very very clear not investment advice never investment advice not investment advice when I said that that it was a long-term play longterm play like geopolitical at some point something might happen to tsmc and Intel's Fab business might do really good long-term play okay that's all uh what else we got Google deletes Incognito
data yeah Google has agreed to delete all data collected while users were browsing in incognito mode in order to avoid a potential $5 billion fine for failing to adequately inform users that Google was still tracking them Google initially argued that its incognito mode Landing message that users's activity might still be visible to websites that they visit was was a sufficient warning but gave up quickly after judge decided that this language was obviously misleading meanwhile Google is testing
device bound session credentials great a way of cryptographically tying session credentials to a specific device in order to prevent Bad actors from accessing sensitive accounts by stealing and cloning session credentials discussion question is this enough what about all the money they made with this data while they had it that's a good point that is a good point I have no idea I think this should decrease their fine I don't think it should eliminate the fine yeah I like they did the bad
thing it's not like you can be like oh yeah I killed that guy but like look look how alive he is um hello welcome to the W show yeah exactly you like that's  so for something like this in my opinion they should figure out how much they profited off of them and that should be the fine if they sto doing it now impossible though how could you possibly quantify that I agree I mean that's how I would like it Google might have their own internal metrics for how much they think the data is worth but you're
basically you're just trusting Google to tell to tell you what it was worth yeah weakened at Google they should absolutely I can't take credit for that joke that's uh that's GDB in float plane chat heck yeah it should um there should absolutely still be a fine this this is getting off with nothing essentially they did a crime until they got caught and then didn't get in trouble for it yeah it's like you've been robbing banks for a long time yeah it's like you're cheating on your you're cheating on your
spouse for 10 years and she catches you and you're like okay well I will stop I will not cheat anymore in this specific way and then she's like great yeah well no harm no foul then like what that's not how this works that's not how I Works apparently anyways one that I want to talk about yeah Discord wants you to make your friends watch ads nice this week Discord will be expanding its Quest program which I didn't even know exists which sends notifications to some users
with an offer of in-game rewards if they play certain games and stream them to their friends these streams will have ads that live in the bottom left uh bottom left hand corner I guess of the screen these ads will be targeted based on information collected by Discord though users can opt out both of this data collection and all no notifications related to quests H I have been wondering this whole time how streaming on Discord makes any sense for Discord at all and this really didn't help me understand do
tell are there costs like is it is it direct user to user somehow are they I don't think so so it's going through Discord I mean all the bandwidth of streams is going through Discord and they're going to offset it with this I mean this is better than nothing but I just I just I mean honestly Luke it must be it must be going through their infra because otherwise why would they limit the quality so hard yeah I mean that's a good point like it could be just you know to make you pay for Nitro like you make
compability reasons cuz some people's computers won't be able to do it but realistically I I I doubt it because when when Discord was in hey we're just VC funded and don't need to make any money let's go mode they they made everything as great as they possibly could like I think I I I I actually even from a even from a user safety standpoint I kind of feel like they would have to have it go through their infra yeah because there are public servers that people stream in for sure yeah
yeah and and they could potentially be liable for what someone sent to someone else on the platform like they'd have to have some kind of record of that um apparently it is direct oh Discord streams usually go through stun turn servers okay hold on hold on we're getting some no we're getting some uh conflicting information in the float plane chat so I'm not 100% sure hold on people are saying yeah Google did not commit a crime um just okay technically probably not but stealing
telling you you're not telling someone you're not going to take their personal information and then taking it is that not a crime it might not technically be a crime but it's certainly not nice and it should be that's that's where I'll that's where I'll leave that sure we if it isn't it should be none of this is  yeah if it's peer-to-peer I've never looked into this cuz like I don't care that much it just seems a little weird to me if it's peer-to-peer I totally get it sounds good
um yeah routing it through their service yeah yeah whatever um but if it's peerto peer then sure okay they found a cool way to monetize it whatever you don't have to do the quest you can opt out of the data collection stuff seems all fine to me um how it all goes live yeah I don't have time to read this right now but if if they are doing like transcoding or anything for it it makes no sense to me at all if it's directly peer-to-peer then sure okay makes sense go live streams are transmitted to discord's
backend and then routed to viewers this hides the IP addresses between users on the call and allows the service to control where the data is routed for example the service will only relay video to a participant on the call if they are watching it the go live stream is constrained by how much data can go through the network because the stream needs to be watchable for every viewer the streamer will not transmit more data than what the slowest connection can so that could be a major reason that they
don't allow super high yeah in addition a streamer will only translit data if at least one viewer is watching estimating bandwidth is complicated how we measure performance so yeah yeah they're not transcoding that helps a lot no yeah the no the client transcodes yeah yeah  everything okay but do they still are they still absorbing the bandwidth cost  know I'm not sure either way discord's model has always been kind of wild to me you look you look at how much teams and slack
cost and then you look at what Discord does and in a huge amount of cases far better than either of those  maybe the real question should be why does teams cost that much well and isn't slack like uh did you see teams as being decoupled from office did we talk about that on WN already we haven't talked about on W but that is very interesting yeah it's a interesting timing Microsoft's clearly going hm we push this really hard in a way that Regulators are going to be probably
super unimpressed by maybe if in good faith we decouple this now they won't go back and look at it cuz you know what it's the only reason we used teams was because we were effectively forced to buy it because we needed office I would have happily paid less  teams it is a really interesting thing because like the Taran linked me that  crime that's actually pretty funny yeah I mean I guess if in good faith you stopped being faithful before she found out that might earn you some brownie points oh man I
think with most people not enough I mean it's it's some if I did that I am still dead oh I well yeah I won't be at work the next day dude I won't be alive I'd be alive ivonne's made it very clear what would happen to  out understood yeah makes sense and when that woman says something you believe her yeah she be scary sometimes um what is it like okay yeah I thought I heard I can't find anything on this right now so I don't know if it's true but I thought slack was like somehow managing to
be uh to be having Financial issues but I'm not finding anything on that so I don't that that might have just been completely made up but anyways um it is something to now reconsider is the use  what AK Panda says you cannot bleed out from such a small   anyway we uh I'm no [Laughter] Drake we we uh do we keep using teams there's so many problems with it internally I know and if it's being decoupled anyways I just hate the pain of switching yeah uh it's kind of bad though I
know yeah it's kind of usable though one of the frustrating things yeah is slack also has a ton of problems I've said it before I'll say it again if Discord had an Enterprise mode I just put us on Discord 100% I'd support that but it it there's just a few things doesn't quite it honestly really doesn't need much more which is again so interesting to me like kind of infuriating yeah like I can understand the Discord branding just not really making sense for them for a corporate product yeah but they could
roll the same thing different logo yeah  dis oh my God Sid Rock what's Rock chat like I don't know what's what's the I don't think you want that I'm sure they could come up with some name I use Discord for my company head of it here that's cool we used to use Discord for float plane as well there's like some issues with it though yeah um I don't know it's not I I don't think it's I'm you could probably get it most of the way there for what we need if you had a probably an arrangement of like
different Bots and things to manage different stuff um but there's like there there's reasons you don't actually necessarily want the window that someone looks at this is less from it this is more from like operations I guess but you don't necessarily want the window that someone needs to look at for work to also have all their personal stuff in it and then okay so are you getting them to have a different work Discord account you can't moderate what other things they're joining on the the work Discord
account um like removing adding and removing someone from the server is not as clean it's pretty easy to get off task in Discord I'll tell you that much you can data retain in slack and in teams which ha has very important um benefits for companies right like if you have former staff that's not with you anymore and you need to like really need to have access to those records uh you can really need them like it can be it's not the kind of thing that I would ever be comfortable
snooping on for no reason but if it was really needed it could be like oh this changes everything kind of thing in that defense if you did Snoop on it for no reason I don't think there's really a way to do that without majorly alerting the user so like which that's cool actually um but yeah if you want to like data retain direct messages that someone has from their like work Discord like yeah good luck unless you are creating the Discord accounts for every one of your users which then becomes like an
onboarding Nightmare and you have to track all this stuff and it's just like ah I don't know man I I think it's cool that you use it I actually liked it for a lot of when we used it for Flo plane the reason why we the reason why we stopped was uh Maxim maximum message length um and code Snippets and a few other things that were problematic back then I've heard that those have got gotten better and easier to deal with I still don't think migrating back to it is fully an option because of some of
the things that I just mentioned but I honestly I really wish that yeah Discord would figure that out because the calls on Discord the amount of times I've had issues with calls on slack and teams that I just know we wouldn't have had these issues on Discord is insane Discord calls are solid yeah I will have issues in teams or slack sometimes and certain people that I know will be around on Discord I'll jump off the teams or slack call and call that person on Discord just to be sometimes I've
actually done it sometimes with just employees if I have their Discord um but sometimes I'll do it to friends just to be like hey is my mic working and stuff and they're like yeah I'm like okay bye just hang up right away go back to the work call to be like okay now I confirmed it's not yeah yeah anyways 100% um they're they video they're they're streaming even just camera great screen sharing great never any problems there text chat flows really super well their bot support is
fantastic there's a lot of things that they have going for them that's really really good Google podcasts speaking of companies that have things going for them that are good and then just I don't know uh Google podcast go byebye see I actually don't care I don't listen to podcasts but so but you seem more passionate about this let me podcast let me read the thing really quick Google podcast has finally shut down in the United States is this going to be your Google Play Music
cuz Google play music is like I I will die on that Hill that YouTube music is a piece of garbage and if they just brought Google play music back in exactly the form it was in like 5 years ago or whenever they discontinued it it would be better than anything else on the market well I I agree cuz I used Google play music I was I was a big Google play music person why are you using spotify stuff like that all right so anyway Google podcast has finally shut down in the United States and will
soon phase out in the rest of the world as well in their announcement last year the company indicated that they would be focusing on YouTube music's podcasting features instead oh good we've heard this before apparently around 23% of us podcast listeners use YouTube as their primary podcast listening platform and only 4% use Google podcasts Google's own podcast made by Google though isn't available on the YouTube music app yeah that's a fun one so um why do you care why does this matter
like it's it's audio right so does it matter what you play it in just help me out here uh my the way that I had mine set up I don't know if this is normal I don't talk to anyone else that listens to podcast about podcasts um but it would it would I was like subscribed to a couple podcasts and it would download them for me so like when I'm on Wi-Fi it downloads it yeah when I go out for a run or whatever else it's downloaded I don't have to this helps you not me cuz you pay for my phone plan but like I I
do run that feature because I actually don't want to just burn through mobile data for no reason um I I like that it's one specific subscription feed that doesn't have the rest of my YouTube junk in it that's just for podcast so when I want podcasts I go to just this thing it shows me the podcast that I'm subscribed to and only those there there's there's not a like I don't I don't remember because I mean the app's probably gone at this point but I think there was I'm fairly certain there was a menu that I
went to that never had any recommendations or anything it was just the things I was subscribed to I could see all the most recent things there easy peasy no problem it worked flawlessly I I saw no reason to need any other thing for using podcasts it was perfect just pulled up our podcast because I guess this is a podcast analytics and Google podcast is the third highest at 8% of uh yeah there you go so like cool okay a bunch of people watch Joe Rogan on YouTube did we really
need to get rid of Google podcast because of that like I don't fun fact you said the app is probably gone um is it still here it can be gone but it can never be forgotten I I keep the Google Play music app on my phone just just to never forget I had where's the focus I had the vessel app on my phone for years yeah um do I still have vessel on here I don't I think I eventually deleted vessel I think I did too um TUV yes I deleted vessel I think I do have something that you haven't been
able to get for years though that isn't vessel let's see is it the PT demo  now let's see I don't think other platforms that work like what you want Luke because oh you still can get it okay cool all all kind of podcasts work the same way as whatever but I have a Google phone and I had the Google app and it's fine that makes sense I don't have to worry about there's there was no like ads or anything it was free easy simple that's probably why they got rid of it um yeah not profitable enough got
yeah I don't know it just it just sucks like in other good Google News Google invents the Super Skip oh uh the source here is Creator Insider YouTube is experimenting with a potential new feature he's feeling physical pain this is great potential new feature called Jump Ahead which allows premium users to skip immediately to the best parts of the video they're watching this will also be available to creators on their own videos even if they aren't a premium subscriber I guess so you can see why
the heck this positive feedback loop exists where the most popular part of the video is now the only part anybody is watching and becomes even more popular and then so basically shorts wasn't enough they want to turn vods into shorts brilliant if a user has already double tapped to skip forward they'll get a jump ahead button that takes them to a spot that YouTube's algorithm thinks they might be looking for based on their previous viewing Behavior Google of course used the term
AI multiple times to describe this feature our discussion question is could this be valuable if implemented properly or is this just encouraging us to turn our brains to Mush would you get Ed to script a thing that just constantly edits our videos and moves where the graphs  are no cuz we've got our own that the LTT Labs website hey yeah like we're we're we're going to we're going to save you the trouble if you don't like the videos then we'll we'll have this sorted out for you in the in the near future
okay yeah speaking of which they've actually got another article up there yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah of course I did um so it's another GPU just because that's what we are most we're most set up for right now but we're we're still optimizing a lot of things we've made a lot of changes based on your feedback from last time and a lot of those changes are already live so all that's up here all right so you can author and you can share it yeah no looks man it looks Pro dude it looks Pro
links to where to buy purchases May provide compensation we had a lot of people started asking are these affiliate links yes yes they're affiliate links oh yeah um expand you can learn about the hardware you can we got some pictures wait we we've got we've got work to do on our pictures we we know that I still really like the Luma field scans I know so sick so cool I would jump to these articles just to see that I think those are so cool yeah that thing as well we have a a dedicated
video coming on the L Luma field CT scanner man oh we scanned Buzz Lightyear from the tech shop just we scanned all kinds of cool stuff for that yeah it was Alex in charge of that video so you know we scanned some memes um and not going to lie like looking at the charts on here is is a great experience yep there it is you can if you guys didn't watch last time then uh here I think it's up here yep you can configure what colors you like for for charts if you are colorblind or have any other kind of
impairment that makes it difficult you can change the theme of the site change between Imperial and metric units super  site you can just you know see whatever charts it is you feel like looking at what what's the best card for 4K rocket League well basically anything okay uh uh uh uh cyberpunk Hey here we go freaking awesome oh wait hold on a second what if I want to know about Ray tracing performance I guess I could see that here f123 oh we only do 14 for that actually
kind of makes sense uh so there's our R tracing performance and productivity oh yes in a bench GPU yeah man it's going to be great once we've got oh  bin and add this to the comparison bin oh there's a faster way to do this add to the compar does the comparison bin work no way okay so I can see the highlights I can see the tested settings I can see their supported features  ooh OEM Technologies I can see what test bench they were tested on to make sure that they are comparable very cool I can be linked to
this product if it were to exist at some point uh oh that's just to buy it okay well it'd be cool if that could go to the um our product page for it eventually eventually when we have it um maybe I I kind of like the affiliate link thing there so maybe we could actually have things for both or something super cool got to make money somehow you know we just want to make things we just want to make things both we can link to the review and the affiliate but we just want to make 
uh it would be nice in the long term to standardize our testing to the point where uh we can with a high degree of confidence show you both cards on the same graph but as it is now there's a lot of work to do before we can do that with confidence it's a dangerous step it's a cool step y it's a dangerous step cuz I think there's there's going to be a time in the future where people are going to want and we are going to want to fulfill the need for this um people are going to want to compare things that
weren't tested Apples to Apples so if we can figure out through similar work to what we did when we were testing our 7800x 3DS to see which ones were close enough if we can if we can do the work to figure out what those error bars should look like um we would like to be able to present that data with asterisks right because we can't uh we can't test every single GPU under every single circumstance um so if it's like yeah okay these are both on the same graph but note that this one is using a
generation newer driver or even a faster Ram when we had upgraded our test platform or something like that in time in time sorry I wanted to get that very exciting though man the teams worked so hard all right what else we got today oh truth social I can't believe we've never talked about truth social have we not we've like mentioned it in passing it's a big social media site is it they went public oh yeah their valuation valuation uh8 billion 8 billion dollar yep IPO a few weeks ago March 26th under the
ticker code djt it closed the day at almost $8 billion the site has around 5 million active monthly users and then 7 Days Later FEC filing showed that it had lost $58 million in 2023 and made $4.8 million in Revenue isn't that better what than what Twitter was doing uh no I thought Twitter was losing like a lot more than that right but Twitter had revenue and like user growth user growth yeah so uh users aren't growing got it yeah uh following this Revelation the  um wait yeah what the ticker code is djt
yeah that took me a second to like someone in float plane chat questioned it and I was like hold on there's been a bunch of behind the scenes Shenanigans um former president Donald Trump uh sued a couple of the of his co-founders in an apparent attempt to consolidate shares in the company um a pair of brothers who were early investors pled guilty to insider trading related to the merger of digital world acquisition Corp and truth socials parent company so that was part of the deal that took it public
um I don't know how much it's worth right now let's let's go have a look oh no not Dow Jones Transportation um that that came up for me too I mean it's a more relevant stock why why am I not just getting why am I not just getting a proper stupid thing here yeah weird not Digital World acquisition oh man I just want oh well okay it's a trending it's apparently a trending ticker so here hold on I just all I have to do is click it course it is here we go all right so uh how we doing here so at launch is
there even a month of History yet no yeah so at launch it actually went up which is uh which is something um and then this is honestly not as bad as I expected yeah yeah it's only down from a high of 75ish to uh 40 which if you put a lot of what if you put a meaningful amount of your money into it you'd probably be pretty disappointed about absolutely but we've seen worse maybe I'm just desensitized from looking at coins I'm not sure I don't know anyway the only the only thing the only really
the only thing that we're really um the only reason we're really bringing this up is this is not Financial advice but oh do not with this stock people smarter than you who have been playing the game longer than you are manipulating this both up and down you do not want to be caught holding the bag this is not a real social media platform there is no real business model watch out $4.8 million in Revenue truth social is a smaller less profitable company than lonus Media Group Incorporated in
fact hold on time to raise that 8 billion dude hold on a second let's go  lab in Revenue you going to tell people Revenue in Revenue okay it is no no no no no just relax oh my reverse look at his hands he's like uh yeah yeah yeah no so in in Revenue in Revenue it is not even triple the size of float plane media ink yeah I never even did that okay and I have intentionally fudged things a little hey man I'm down with less than a just a little bit less than a third of 8 billion yeah let's do do it just to give
you guys some some much needed context if truth social is worth $8 billion float plane media Inc is at least A2 and5 billion dollar company so we're we're going we're going out for Stakes after this is what you're saying it's not sorry you can get a higher approval limit now Luke we can get new pens new pens new pens would be awesome the only pen on my desk is one someone gave to me float plane media float plane media is also more profitable than truth social that's yeah I
mean the fundamentals I would hope it would be do wow ly did the bare minimum you're you're not you're not like you  so watch out I mean should we take float plane public no I could use a billion dollars you know if we're going to raise if we're going to raise a Big B I'm down  mean pajama pants for all no pants at work just I mean we got a billion dollars in the bank who cares yeah yeah people like shut up and take my money do it do it guys guys no you shouldn't invest in float plane no that wasn't my
point my you guys collectively have a billion dollars yeah my point wasn't to invest in float plane my point was do not get mixed up in this truth social thing because whatever you bet if you bet it's going up it's going to go down if you bet it's going down it's going to go up it is being manipulated on both sides be smart be smart that's uh that's all I really wanted to say that Riley was super worried when I was like yeah we're going to talk about truth social on the show he's
like like no no no no no no no no no no no no no we're just we we are just what we're really talking about is how flow plane is worth a billion dollars yeah this is not Financial advice I'll put all my lonus coin in float plane heck yeah hey when's the Ico boys man if we were willing to grift hard man ah we could have made so much more money could have made so much more money yeah H sometimes I wish we were eer there's been a few discussions where we're like wow we could really do this hey the best
can you believe how much money there is in promoting gambling oh man oh you could have probably overd doubled the company revenue and I'm not kidding I know yeah I know like people might think you you heard the valuation that was or at least the proposed evaluation that that happened a while ago that would just you would completely blow it out of the water it wouldn't even be close wouldn't even be sort of close it might be significantly more than 2x actually like there is trust me I've seen offers
a disgusting amount of money offers come it's not that we don't promote gambling because we never got contacted come on don't kid yourself I know creators personally CU I don't think I've seen our offers actually but I've seen offers to other creators I know creators personally that have received offers for gambling sponsorships that are many times bigger than other unrelated to gambling offers that I've seen us receive and take because we thought they were good this Creator in particular if I remember
correctly was significantly less than like a tenth of our size just Monster money it's crazy and you wonder like turns out stealing people money is good business yeah yeah I shouldn't say stealing you gave it to them sure yeah but just taking people's money is good business soone like planty time no no that's a that's a lot less than that's a that's an inside reference um y yeah it was incredible amounts of money and you think too when  like smaller creators I can see they do it got it's
got to be hard it's lifechanging it's like if you've got medical bills people if if money's super tight and someone knocks on your door and it's like hey this is a really important point because I have the luxury like I have to I have to step back and appreciate that I have the luxury to say no we can make it without it yep I that was a big moment for me was when we reached the point where I could walk away from any deal and it from any company and it wouldn't matter yeah cuz
we we walked away from some deals early on but it hurt man we've walked away from entire relationships Nvidia is back though you saw that sponsored video they're back upgrading our wor setup uh Jessica making not her onscreen debut cuz she's been on W show before and stuff like that but this is the first time in a Mainline LT video I thought she did a great job um we really really improved her setup so if you haven't watched it yet you're going to want to check it out her podcasting setup was
literally in a closet um sorry and it still is but it's a better closet improved closet new and improved closet 2 now with 30% more closet do you move a wall uh someone in Phil PL Chat N golden 2020 said nearly $200 million us doar were bet in North Carolina's first week of legalized sports betting wow how are there even $200 billion million oh M oh that makes way more sense yeah even so I might have said billion I meant million2 million fifth of a b yeah like that's a fifth of the 
plan sometimes I do sometimes I do wonder sometimes I do Wonder having the community that we have if we were just like hey realistically we're pretty upfront with you guys anyway so what we just formalized this we release quarterly earnings reports and blah blah blah blah blah and if you want to give us your money I just keep all the controlling shares kind of like Zuck did and like sure by all means and then what like I just maybe I just lack creativity but I wouldn't know what to do with it like
let's say our valuation wasn't $8 billion let's say it was $8 million okay more than that let's say it was $80 million what would I even do I have a I don't know if this is spicy take or not I have a take on this it feels like a spicy take okay yeah let's hear a spicy take what what what   insane not because there's so many things you could spend your money on but because you'd need a new thing to Chase and you'd have so much money that it would be so hard youd have to like make
a Fab or something ridiculous like it it would be but like think about it okay not that we couldn't afford that with  oh cuz he does this we'll like we'll like be very successful and then he'll be like okay now we're going to do this crazy thing and I'm going to go super negative I'm going to risk it all we're gonna I'm going to like Leverage all the different things I'm going to do all this other kind of stuff and we're going to do this it's going to be successful we're going to be fine this so this is
why I don't promote gambling because I  problem but it's like usually the plans good and it like yeah we will fine it has worked I every time well some are some are TBD but yeah I'm feeling good I'm feeling good but liance will get too comfortable and then he's like I need something I got to I got to buy a building figure out something to put in it start a game publisher you know like like stuff we stuff we've kicked the tires on we start a system integrator man when we did that video uh upgrading
my game here and uh David's Game Boy Advance I was like I had we had you and I had a conversation about starting a company I was like man the problems in this space are that there's it's it's like I can have a reliable source for the part a good price or fast pick one to two yeah right often one often one and so I was like man if we could we make like a like a retro console you know modding like One-Stop shop where we we basically take on the inventory risk of you know ordering enough that these small
manufacturers can afford to do a run of stupid Game Gear backlights or or whatever it is so so we hold the inventory um we use our brand we use our trusted brand to um give people confidence in in the product we we stand behind the product with the trust me bro guarantee uh we we continue to expand by taking our stor room of parts and allowing people to ship in their consoles so we hire technicians to perform upgrades for people and offer it as a service like there's a whole
there's a whole road map here boys I I actually ran the numbers I think we could get it started for probably less than 150 Grand like no no no no I don't need another project part of his problem is that he surrounds himself with people like me so I'm just going to be like yeah cool let's do it it is cool it is a lot of the ideas are cool it's a great idea but this is a problem if you just suddenly had $80 million oh yeah you're going to be like we do 80 ideas yeah you're not
wrong yeah you're not wrong see that's the thing it's like a lot of people talk about that offer we got and like like I have like I have that's in the bank how many figures is that I don't remember nine nine like I have nine figures in the bank it it doesn't it doesn't work like that that's uh that's theoretical that's theor iCal net worth it's not it's not real and if I if I were to sell it today it's probably not worth that much that was based on the kind of exponential growth that we were
experiencing at that time we've gotten things are a little bit in more of a mature state right now and um we've also got some big bets that are taking time to reach fruition um but yeah we we don't have that kind of actual like cash reserves just sitting around it's not really how businesses work and borrowing is uh so expensive right now to be clear I'm not going to complain because a lot of people are worried about the borrowing that they're doing on their bloody homes
and how to figure out how to pay their mortgage payments but debts it's been challenging on the business side as well without just free money flowing the way that it did um so yeah we just you know we just got to pick our battles but yeah  be unnecessary we we've talked about it a lot internally and I just don't I think I mean realistically I've told I've told Taran he's got the wheel like nothing's off the table if he wants to like if he thinks that's the the right path then
he's you know free to make a case and and try and do it and and make a go of it but I I don't I don't see I think you would want to anyways I could see I I've kind of wondered before about like a part of the business a particular part for some reason like maybe maybe you actually wanted I don't I don't know I don't know maybe for some reason not even necessarily to raise money let's say something wild like we started um remember that gaming Hotel I stayed in like 5 years ago yeah so if we were
to start like a gaming Hotel business okay and it's a complete spin-off it's got like LTT branding on it it's like there's gaming systems in every room uh but other than that it has no Financial tie to Linus Media Group or float plane or the you do would be wild oh it'd be so cool with gaming IPS well or or even like Hardware IPS I don't know how I don't know how gaming IPS would work if everything you buy is licensed does anything restrict you from putting it in a commercial space Oh I was even
thinking getting them to like pay you to do it potentially some I mean there's certainly companies that would not give us the time of day but but if not yeah what what are they what are they going to do like if you have a a a figure of a plumber who goes into pipes sometimes I mean the company you're talking about the figure sure they way is there is there a terms terms of service of buying a figurine I mean if it's an amiibo I  but yeah yeah I wonder about that that's something you'd have to ask you'd have
to ask the lawyers but if you created it yourself like if you drew it I think you'd be in trouble interesting nobody goes after like you know the the local Tim Hortons that you know draws a Christmas scene on their thing and then wipes it in Janu anuary or whatever uh but in terms of like if you are offering a a a plumber room at your gaming hotel and you've like custom created Mario alike assets i i i i that's that's a commercial Endeavor you are effectively selling access to
Mario's likeness like there's no way yeah um Tim SP asks are you going to talk about all the Geek Squad layoffs that came out in the past couple of days does it change you look back at your experience having them try to fix a machine for you I mean my experience was my experience I um I take back nothing of what we said uh I think I think Best Buy owes me a refund um they did not fix my problem they charged me 200 Canadian rubles I haven't watched it yet but as an ex-member of Geek Squad it just makes
me sad um as for as for the layoffs that's extremely sad because like so many corporate layoffs this feels like one where it comes down to mismanagement right like whether you over hired or whether you're not bringing in business well enough it's not the fault of those Frontline agents right that that customers aren't coming in it's part of it honestly computers just don't have as many problems these days I mean that's that's that's fair but also oh man that's a tough one because
it's not like it's not like Geek Squad is something that um it's not like they haven't had plenty of opportunities to observe a slow decline in unreliability totally and and adjust their Staffing levels accordingly I just I I don't know if I buy that as an  fair I just scrolled down to where people are talking about um just like Nintendo and amiibos you don't own the amiibo you bought a license to look at it at Nintendo's convenience yeah exactly oh my goodness love it all right in other news the indie
game Gold Rush seems to be over Red Hook and medrite the Developers for darkest dungeon and slay the Spire respectively say that funding has dried up for Indie Games I think it's megacrit oh sorry yeah that makes way more sense uh notably sources like exclusive deals for the epic game store and Xbox game pass which have both slowed significantly they say that most other devs they've talked to have reported a similar experience of finding typical funding streams significantly cut back
or canceled both Studios say they're lucky to be in the position to sell fund but they'll be putting on a triple ey Showcase of upcoming Indie titles on April 10th to give other India developers more visibility that's a really cool thing to do very cool and uh we'd love to see what comes out of that that's uh that's 5 days from now our discussion question is is this the end of the Indie boom or just a gully and I I don't think anything's going to stop the Indie boom if if anything I think
we're going to see another boom from all the talented people that are getting let go from the major development houses right now yeah um they're going to need to do something and their experience is game development so you put two and two together and I talk about that in the flow plan exclusive where I said I was going to talk about Starfield and ended up talking about the game industry I talk about that exact same thing very nice yeah uh Mega crit they they make slay the Spy I'm a massive ridiculous
slay Spire nerd um you know when the the whole Unity thing went down Unity got weird with their which one yeah I think it was I think it was one of the more recent ones but that that is kind of funny um mega crit responded by looking into gdau essentially and they made a free game called dancing duelist and it's actually like amazing new game from Mega crit this was about 6 months ago which lines up pretty well I think with the last time that Unity went a little crazy um it's a it's
a deck building game similar to how say the Spire is a deck building game but it plays completely differently and it's very fun free little game you can like essentially fully beat it um in like probably I don't know a day or two or something but I I would check it out Mega crit super cool yeah uh what else do we have for topics today outlook's been doing some sketchy stuff uh email service proton is accusing Microsoft's new Outlook app of being a massive net for user data
collection according to users in Europe who downloaded the app a popup user agreement discloses that Microsoft shares users information with 801 third-party Partners the app also prompts users to pick their own ads layout for where advertisements will appear in the app Mac users will have some ads that appear as Inox messages both from Microsoft and from other parties UK users can access a list of advertising Partners in the Outlook settings menu menu which shows a large
number of AD companies these settings are unavailable in the US and Switzerland where proton is based while UK users have some ability to refuse to share with certain advertisers this appears to be purposefully confusing with some advertisers requiring affirmative consent While others require an opt out according to German it experts at Heist online this new outlook also takes IMAP and SMTP credentials your username and password password from other accounts synced with the Outlook app
which would also give the company access to emails from those other accounts even if you cancel because they've already stored that information Germany's federal commissioner for data protection and Freedom of Information rri kelber has expressed concern about the app's data farming capabilities and announced that he intends to discuss the issue with relevant Regulators in the coming week common EU win I suspect the same stuff is not happening to Enterprise look accounts I mean who knows but you know
what is happening somebody tried to corrupt Linux from the inside yeah there's been some unfortunate things going on a single off hours Microsoft engineer has apparently foiled a longc attempt to embed a serious security back door into a widely distributed Linux utility developer Andres FR was spending his long weekend doing some micro benchmarking when he noticed that encrypted logins to excuse me um okay lib LZ sorry not sure how to pronounce that um we're using a surprising amount of
CPU he tracked the issue to a back door in the Upstream XZ utils repository which appears to inject malicious code during SSH authorization in order to enable unauthorized remote access the back door appears to have been added in February and never managed to make its way into the production release of a major drro it was uncovered in beta versions of Fedora Rawhide and Debian which have been rolled back accordingly fend track the changes to a user who goes by gatan or g75 who has been a regular contributor
since October of 2021 however there is no evidence that this person even exists outside of their presence as a project XY contributor leading some security researchers to speculate that they might be sing a single purpose identity created by a state sponsored attacker G t75 is believed to have gradually amassed increasingly invasive permissions in part by making genuine code contributions but also possibly through a sock puppet campaign to pressure the original Dev to speed up development by
opening those permissions to others absolutely Insidious um which makes you wonder how much of this did make it through at some point yeah I mean this type of stuff has happened before um like the login credentials for contributors to open source projects that are widely used are like very valuable um to like maintain your accounts and whatnot it doesn't happen very often I think I just said it's happened before I didn't say said it happen often um because I think that Community is
like pretty on the nose about this type of stuff um there's there's it's it's relatively commonly said that like open source stuff is generally more secure because more people are looking at it it doesn't mean it's immune to security problems it just means it can potentially be more secure um it does it definitely doesn't mean it is more secure you can have projects that are abandoned you can have not eyeballs on it doesn't automatically mean a lot of people are looking at it and assessing
it um but yeah it sucks it just another reminder that absolutely nothing is fully secure at any point in time that's it yeah it's frustrating to see this kind of thing degrade trust in open source overall I um I would say overall you're probably still better off there yeah it's like I just said everything has problems everything has problems you shouldn't have been blindly trusting open source um you also shouldn't blindly trust some close source application from somebody else um so it
is what it is you also shouldn't blindly Trust Twitter turns out there's still a bunch of Hypocrites when it comes to privacy I know right no way the intercept has acquired emails between the Secret Service and surveillance firm data minor that show that Elon musk's X has continued secretly selling massive amounts of user data for the explicit purpose of government surveillance this goes against X Twitter's own use policy which forbids conducting or providing surveillance or gathering intelligence
so it's only okay when we do it for money while Twitter is not directly selling this information to the government it is knowingly leasing the information to an intermediary broker which is immediately turning it over to the government for law enforcement and surveillance purpose surveillance purposes for the last decade Twitter has also been pursuing a lawsuit demanding that they be allowed to publicly disclose more information about national security letters that the government
uses to compel social media companies to turn over user data m continued the suit after taking over the site and called the Supreme Court's January decision to strike the case down disappointing a discussion question here is Twitter's hypocrisy obviously predates musk's tenure but how has an overt Free Speech Advocate managed to wind up with such a similar stance on cooperating with government surveillance as the people he sought to usurp I actually have a feeling that it has less to do with
financial incentives and more has to do with like you must do this uh I mean you don't have to take money for it I have a feeling there isn't really another option it's like here take the money or will'll just destroy you anyways um I don't know not sure I mean I would be interested to see if there's a similar arrangement with meta I'd be Sim I'd be curious to see if there's a similar arrangement with you know a Discord we know this just happened with YouTube yeah but that's not really the same arrangement
yeah yeah they weren't selling to data Brokers for it to be used for government surveillance I I really don't think that's the same thing yeah yeah oh yeah all I'm really trying to say is if right now at least if the government wants your stuff for the most part they're going to get it this is why companies that like really really really talk about privacy don't have anything they don't have any of the information so that when the government comes knocking they literally can't give it to them
it's not a function which to be clear is not something that you can necessarily trust either no I mean a lot of VPN providers say oh yeah no laws but you are just it's full trust me bro you can't prove they don't have anything unless it's actually been tested in court before and even then just because it's been tested once doesn't mean that something didn't change something can change on doesn't mean that there isn't like a malicious actor in there somehow who is personally
yep like it's it's yeah I don't know  thing I think the main thing that I'm trying to say is that I don't trust that it would completely stop even if there wasn't Financial incentive I don't trust that it would completely stop but um it might be different it might be smaller in scope it's not in the dock but apparently like it's it's it's basically like an all you can eat API access is is my understanding of it it's like no it's it's like it's bad it's yeah it's you know it's it's really bad I had never
heard of this I don't know the scope of it or how much money is being exchanged I mean it's one of those things where if thep y wasn't already obvious when um uh when he sued that that Watchdog group that like anti-hate speech Watchdog group for saying stuff he didn't like really yeah it's like free speech is not just speech you agree with it's free speech oh wait was this the Anti-Defamation League stuff uh no I don't think it was them I think it was someone else I don't know basically I
like actually try not to follow it cuz it just yeah there's a not for-profit that reported on an increase in hate speech and that that may be true that may be not true he might agree he might not agree but what it what what what they said was was free speech it it was free speech and you can't just be like no I don't like that free speech and try to sue them to not say it I will say it's not what the you can't be a free speech absolutist if you are going to selectively yeah it's not how it works
yeah I um yeah I always hated Twitter I will absolutely admit it is more useless now than like ever I use up a ton of people were saying it was going to go down and I was like I don't think so I got a lot of hate for that and it's still up so it is still up screw you guys but um it is definitely more useless the amount of like I I think there's more spam now I have no scientific reason to think this but it sure as heck feels like it so much spam oh my goodness I can't even it's like
overran man when I when I click a trending topic it's hard for me to even find out why it's trending something sometimes okay I felt that before the biote I never had that problem interesting usually the first 20 or so were relevant enough and had enough likes that I could I could tell you know is it are they dead is it pedophilia you know like like what is it why why are they trending you know now I will click on something and I'm actually not sure for and sometimes I will even go as far
as just giving up and Googling name controversy to find what the heck is going on it's it's pretty I I definitely use it less than I ever have yeah yeah and I and I and I don't that's true for me as well and I don't even really think I'm using it less because like musk bought it I'm just using it less cuz like well you made your position very clear you always considered it a dumpster fire I still need to use it for DMS yeah so I'm still on it a little bit but I think my
I think my app limit right now is like 3 minutes or 5 minutes or something like it's really short but realistically you're objectively wrong because even a trash tier crappier clone of it is worth $8 billion so you've clearly missed something here what oh man yeah that's okay the purchase price for Twitter that's all right was a bargain based on the value of Truth social that's a that's a that's a really interesting take actually would he pay 44 million it was it was 40
something he should write the art of the deal yeah yeah um incredible deal absolutely incredible deal the best deal um hey a a a co-authored book between musk and Trump on making deals there's no way they'd be able to agree on Whose name goes first on the cover please oh man it's like it's like it's one of those reflective ones where you have to like look at it the right way to have the name show up but then they who gets to be the one on the right yeah stole my joke and that's why my name would go
first oh man that was pretty funny oh terrible I I love that joke I don't know if it landed with the audience but I thought it was hilarious I think you did great thanks it was pretty funny uh we have a good pivot I can't find the topic though the Google SEO thing oh wow this is a huge topic how did it take us this long to get to it house fresh by the way I've never heard of this website before potentially because Google's squashing it this is a very well- written article and this I I know
I read some other stuff on the site it seems great cool I like actually like want to use this site now y so hopefully you guys find it interesting too this write up is fantastic it's really long we're not going to be able to cover it all you should go to the website host fresh this particular one is David versus digital goliaths yeah y incredibly well written um we'll give you the kind of the the summary that is going to tell you enough to make you want to go read the article and find out how you are
being misled this is something that I have been aware of for a long time it's something that I am aware is getting worse it's was the major major motivator that made me ultimately say okay we need to build a testing lab so clearly it's something that I believe in very but hearing someone else express it way better than I could and dive really far into the intricacies of like how and and patterns and all this other type of stuff how product testing is dying and why um and like being stomped on its
head while it's being buried at the same time so house fresh a product review site that focuses on air purifiers has published a an incredible analysis on how a small set of large media publishers are gaming Google search by flooding the web with lazy listicles that recommend products that they have never even touched it's it's lazy listicles is fun alliteration I would go as far as to say it's basically fraud according to house fresh these articles are all extremely similar to one another
at least in part because they are all entirely based on Amazon listing information and marketing materials put out by the manufacturers these articles are branded under well-known seemingly reputable names like BuzzFeed Forbes Popular Science and rolling stone but they are sharply lower in quality and effort than most of their other articles to the point where it can be kind of jarring actually and they and they they talk through how this happened with large um hold on a second yeah with large
media publishers acquiring the rights to these names and then leaving only skeleton crews in place to continue publishing a little bit of good stuff to keep the reputation going while just lazily dumping garbage affiliate Revenue maximizing crap down people's throats while house fresh says that Google's product revieww updates generally improve the ranking of articles that actually provide independent information and thorough research consumers looking to make an educated purchase are still
having to Wade through countless reviews from people who have never even seen the thing in person and this is absolutely something that I've experienced but something that I didn't dig deep enough to understand just how broken it is like there's this one air purifier that they kind of go into in the article because they tested it and it fundamentally doesn't work and is loud and is expensive and they're just like they're sitting there going there is no way on this green earth that anybody who knows
anything tested this and recommended it and yet it tops all of these recommendation lists and they basically dug into it and they like oh it's because it pays the most affiliate commission and we've talked about this before um remember I figured out why "$80,000 area rugs exist and it turns out" it's because interior designers get paid a percentage of the total bill well the higher the price the better the listicle commission because it's percentage based so you're basically being misled to buy
a more expensive thing and it's disguised as editorial content I mean it's one thing if it is an ad an ads an ad a properly disclosed ad like when Miss Vicky paid me to tell you about their zero trans fat low and saturated fat no preservatives kettle chips uh that's what the style of chips is called right I don't know it doesn't yeah kettle cooked potato chip okay they didn't sponsor us but the point is when something is clearly disclosed it's an app it's clear that these talking points
are coming from the manufacturer but these listicles are not they're not disclosed it's not clear what the relationship is and it seems like editorial content and some of the people publishing these if they're people at all or writing these rather some of the people writing these assuming they are people are publishing so many of these that there is just there is no feasible way that they have ever even laid hands on these products and I've seen it before I bought windshield wipers for my
tyan from one of these listicles that ended up not being compatible because they never actually tried it yeah I made  compatible Dan's into it Dan's very into that so much respect so let's go um but they weren't but like actually though um so yeah you you need to go read it Dan can we get this Linked In the description as well this is really really really important this this is why we're building the lab because it is so hard to find good information anymore and they lay out a really convincing and
scary case for why it's going to get so much harder I genuinely don't think there's been very many articles maybe even single digit that are like more beneficial to go read instead of just listen to what we've said there is so much information in this it's actually it's crazy dense with two s's it's really long and it's very dense each individual paragraph is interesting like actually go read it yep and it actually really matters because you need to send this to anyone you know who shops online basically or
looks for basically any information because it shows you just how easily gamed the system is and house fresh doesn't even blame Google outright for this yeah it's clear that this is a case where Google is in good faith trying to do the right thing and surface accurate information which is interesting but there's just the the Avalanche of is just it's burying any nuggets of good information because and we know this we know this from building the lab testing products properly is
really freaking hard it's a ton of work um I mean oh man uh we showed off the latest draft of power supply circuit internally and even internally there's a lot of commentary on for example the uh the aii voice over that we're using and the kind of um monotonous sort of scripted shots and they're like I don't understand the value of this and it's like whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa this is completely different from anything we've done in the past enyclopedia the value is not in
the entertainment for this at all it's just that we understand that consumers are going to look for information in video form even though this really would be better off as an article and an article will be available but we understand people are going to be looking for this information in video and if we look at what other similar power supply focused videos are doing in terms of viewership on YouTube our production budget our total budget for each of these videos would be somewhere between $2 and
$60 so we're between a rock and a hard place obviously we would love to use humans to do all of the work and humans are doing a lot of the work humans developed all these processes humans are testing the power supplies that's that's that's the meat right there that's being done by skilled humans right we would love to use humans for everything and have a human host and uh have bespoke editing for every single episode but if I were to tell you okay well your production budget is $9 and I were to
pay humans in such a way that we were able to survive on $9 of Revenue I'd be a monster I'd be a stop I'd be a monster and then if I say okay well this is net new work that nobody was doing before and actually creates additional jobs building these systems and doing all this testing um but this is the way to make it sustainable you tell me I'm a monster because we're using an AI voiceover and it's like okay well now hold on a second this is in my opinion a best case scenario for machine learning it just
doesn't exist we're not going to do it without it can't exist yeah that's the thing it's not that it doesn't it's that it cannot it's not economically viable for us to do this the traditional way that we've done things and I think uh there is a pretty good point brought up in phili you have an unlimited budget because it's a tax rate off thank you for that um there are legitimate concerns like that people have brought up okay well if we're doing it in power supply circuit then could that infect the other
channels um that is I mean that is the last thing I want yeah I don't I it's not like good you don't want to listen to that AI voice no not at all I mean if we can get to the point where power "supply circuit is averaging 100,000" views and we're taking on we're taking on sponsors and hey have faith yeah sure and we're taking on sponsors and we're doing like huge affiliate Revenue through it because people really value the independent testing then yeah let's let's let's build a proper Channel
around it but we have to start somewhere and right now the meat of it is the testing and we just need a vehicle yeah my only real notable take from it was that I don't think it should be you personally yeah I um I've seen people feel strongly about it both ways it's about 5050 interes interesting the the feedback that I have received directly the like non-anonymous feedback that I have received which I will now keep Anonymous um but was all in alignment with that but I mean it was a very small
portion of the company as a whole so it's not representative it's both ways uh it as it turns out and I think that I can't tell because the feedback form itself was Anonymous um so I can't tell like good and bad you can't continue the conversation seems like based on the perspectives like I don't know which individuals responded but it seems like based on the perspectives that the lines kind of fall between departments um so some departments feel more strongly that like having it be
lonus will make it feel less like someone whose J got taken by Ai and more like Linus didn't have time that day okay and then on the other side it's look if we're going to be uncanny valley can we at least just be uncanny valley with someone that is not a real person and it seems like there's a clean line right down the the middle that's really interesting yeah I know uh zenel says I'm confused LTT isn't using real voices so again you know our budget our production budget for some of these videos because we
don't know what the budget is until we publish it and see how much money comes in right our budget for these videos based on what dedicated power supply videos are doing right now on YouTube could be as low as2 to3 no no there's there it's not even yeah it doesn't make any sense no and we need we need to get this out there this is even really a it's not a business move it's like rtra says you could not do a video and promote heavily the written article yeah that worked great for written
media over the last 10 years also some people just will not read it yeah even if we're we're completely ignoring the business case cuz these videos are going to make no money but even if we completely ignore the business case there are people that will not read an article but they will watch a video that is absolutely a thing yep there's also people that are just never going to leave YouTube there's been this consolidation issue this the the the house fresh article kind of talks about
this and there's been other people talking about this recently as well where like the internet is turning into a very small the whole surf the Internet and check out all these different websites thing is like dead already it's become a very very small pool of websites that have all of the even smaller than you think because a lot of the sites that you think are separate are actually owned by large publishing by large Publishers yeah so like it's it's it can be very hard when
that's what you've grown up in or that's the practice that you've gotten used to uh it can be very hard to get people off of that small group of websites so they're just going to want to stay on  else uh pfy I don't know F on on Flow plane chat said my my younger siblings search for products SL restaurants on Tik Tok so we've already so coming back to the plan to uh to have these videos AI voice overed AI edited because the shots are all standardized because a power supply that's why we started with
power supplies cuz they're all fundamentally the same size and shape yeah with fundamentally the same physical features so all the shots are going to be along sort of pre-planned movements and then it is basically cut together with a template and then validated by a human editor yeah that's it um and so we're already looking at okay can we do a shortened version of the script that and then just dump it on Tik Tok dump it on reals dump it on Facebook um because I mean at the very
least we want to be able to get real valid information in front of people and I think harder than ever there's going to be some compromises that we're going to make along the way but the mission is a good one and you know what we might find out that this just is completely ineffective and we've got to take a different approach and we're going to be open to that but we have to start somewhere in again the non-anonymous feedback that I received that I will now forward as Anonymous feedback
um the people that I talk to would watch it actually but they're they're not going to watch everything I I said are going to be really low yeah no they shouldn't watch everything that's the whole point of this I saw I saw one internal comment that sorry to be clear I'm not saying this to you as if this is a revelation to you I'm more talking publicly I saw one internal comment that  Farm yes yeah it's supposed to be every Power Supply ever yeah and I don't want humans working at the content Farm yeah
I want humans doing the creative stuffff the cool stuff but we need to have a result when someone searches for this power supply on Tik Tok and that's a power supply that blows up or costs twice as much as one that's better we we have to address that and on a$2 to $60 budget we aren't going to be doing it with handcrafted human content it's not going to happen right now now and it's not intended to be like a like popcorn viewing yeah it's not supposed to be entertaining objective this is for
the bottom of the funnel where you have you are aware of computers and you have an intent to learn about computers and you've decided to buy one and you are choosing a particular component and you want to learn about it or it's been recommended to you like say you go to PC part picker and you pick one of the recommended builds and you're like uh I've never heard of this power supply before you look up one of the videos you're like oh yeah okay it's cool now you have the confidence when buying the
thing good kind of like what I think it was uh Casey neistat said about the Vision Pro that this is the worst Vision Pro so the first video we upload will be the worst video you know in terms of The Uncanny Valley of the AI voiceover in terms of the choreography of the shots um it's going to it's going to take time yeah it's going to take time black smoke Rises says it sounds kind of lame but I see the plan yes it's not supposed to be super exciting content it's not it's supposed to design
it's supposed to be what we could make for under $60 and remember it's not even under $60 by the time Lucas tests a power supply we are underwater on a $60 budget very significantly so it is are are you effectively a negative budget don't don't even worry about the the human time are you counting the the like time on that machine oh no exactly just do the time on the machine I forget how much that thing even costs but you have to get updates to it oh no I'm not factoring hey don't forget about the
square footage that that whole setup with the environmental chamber don't forget about the environmental chamber literally just the space it doesn't just run off of the chroma other cost than space yeah yeah floor space Oh my God to buy a lot of these power supplies if you owned a parking lot how much more profitable so much more like your an Roi on one parking stall yeah 20 years like that's the thing guys you got to try to try to look at what we're doing and see the bigger picture here
this is not isn't a business move no this is not a profit-taking Endeavor if we can turn it into something profitable we will if we can take this data and we can find nuggets that turn into LT videos that we can get sponsors of course we're going to do that it's going to feed into the businesses that make money that would happen if we made the videos or not guys the intent here is we understand this is going to take time but we are trying to build something we're going to make some
mistakes it's going to take some time we're going to have to learn some things but that's that's part of the journey right like if we I  you got to dream big you know you got to dream big I I heard there was a I tried to invite you to I think you accepted it whatever it doesn't matter but I I went to invite you to a meeting next week to talk about like the launch of the labs website um and I gen genuinely don't remember who but someone told me that like and you had talked about it with
them at some point in time and you were all excited about like what we can do next and I was like yeah they're like what do you mean I was like like is is just this just how it works it's it's that's good you know but like I would be more stunned if you were like this is the end I have no more ideas I'd be like oh no oh yeah what happened oh dude my idea Doc is is uh  bulging all right uh merch messages next topic we have a lot next topics do we have super checks after party
today I'm never going to get to go home am I uh we can we can set up I mean home's overrated uh uh if you want we can uh we can get that going do you want me to do that I don't know it's up to the float plane people I'll tell you what you can uh you can see if they care that much this week I probably shouldn't do many oh okay because I have to shift relieve oh yeah okay no maybe maybe no no checks after I could do like maybe three yeah but that's that's a lot to like Dread the whole thing up there no
no no sorry sorry I apologize I have sick birds at home y Luke's got Luke's got bird babies to to to take care of yeah all right Dan hit us uh sure let's see to be clear you're still not off the hook on playing yeah I just I had already planned to tell you like I got to stop at 3: so I don't know probably shouldn't do the whole setup it's all good yeah greetings LDL I have troubles for getting my point across whenever there's a collaborative discussion between me and 10 other people in the group any
advice for a timidly shy person like me um this is a tough one you're asking the wrong two people I don't know about Dan so much but um I'm actually pretty diid yeah maybe Dan could field this one I was hoping that you guys could tell me uh I don't know you just yell over them uh okay I have an idea you turn them off you just turn off their camera yeah exactly they don't exist anymore he doesn't he's still talking somehow how's this working I don't get it I turned him off he's still there's a
ghost in the machine he's still talking uh something something that I've seen people do that I think has actually worked pretty effectively and also helps if you have you know an issue with public speaking is to present your idea in some form that is like textual or through a photograph or a chart or whatever and then paste it into the chat that everyone's using I was going to say take notes and if you need some time to process and collect your thoughts you can always send it as a followup hey
during the meeting uh these are some thoughts that I had uh or these are some thoughts I had after the meeting if it makes you uncomfortable to to to to talk about how you know you you need time to process because not everyone wants to like just say that yeah I kind of you know I'm a thorough thinker but I'm a bit of a slower thinker no one wants to say that out loud so you just yeah you you can you can take some of um some of that pressure off by not necessarily trying to address it right in the middle
of the meeting I understand that that's not always perfect because sometimes things will hit an inflection point decisions are made and you can either you know Steer it in the right direction or allow it to Veer off course and it can be tough I I find if you can get something that draws everyone's direct attention that they have to like you know read or look at for a second to fully absorb you can actually get everyone thinking about that thing for a second and then hopefully you can talk
through it or just by looking at whatever thing you delivered whether it's a chart or a graph or a thing of writing or whatever hopefully they can get a point from it and then go from there um it's not a perfect solution but I've seen it used and I I think it works pretty well hello guys do you think the PS portal was a success I've been trying sorry I've been trying to get one but they seem to be sold out everywhere live in a studio with one TV and wife can't sleep with light I don't think it's a matter of
whether we think the PS portal was a success the PS portal was clearly a success it just wasn't for you if you're someone who doesn't understand why people want the PS portal uh and Tulio clearly is one of the people who does think the PS portal is a good idea and Tulio the good news is there's lots of other options uh with an app you can pretty much replicate the experience of the PS portal whether it's on a tablet or on a phone but you know it won't have a dual sense style controller with smaller
joysticks mind you um so you know that might work for you that might not work for you uh yeah there's no there's no question PS portal absolutely a success did you see that thing where it was it had been um it had been hacked to run like emulated games and then uh Sony got tipped off by um by someone and they were able to patch it no that doesn't happen very often yeah yeah anyway huh yeah they disclosed to Sony how they had  that Luke if you had to buy another car what would it be also thanks
for just the first part okay uh I have no idea I think I would know what I would do if it was a new car but I think the chance of me buying a new car is very low okay well yeah but tell us I think a Prius Prime they've been doing really good yeah the new one makes a lot more sense than the old one I really like the whole plug-in hybrid thing um they actually like look pretty cool which is weird for Priuses but they do look pretty cool um and they they have good stats on them
for the whole plug-in hybrid thing um but yeah I'm not I'm not super into the new car thing so then I have no idea cuz I don't know what the Ed Market looks like right now people are upset cuz it's a Prius yeah the new ones are pretty cool hey I'm the guy who bought half a dozen of the old black hats and got a couple of the pro hats and recently and uh got a couple of the pro hats recently and love the lack of button on top and clasp what other small changes in  miss so much uh I I wish we just filmed
our product development meetings because there's so many good creative juices flowing in them and there's so many little details that even we forget by the time the long road is over and we actually released the product we put up the product page and we're like how the  um I don't know am I going to be able to am I going to be able to come up with  oh man we obsessed over the location of the LT branding on the cable management arches it was actually I think me who ultimately made the call after we saw the
prototypes um because we did prototype it with an LTT logo here uh and I think it was me who made the final call to say no uh no visible branding because the reason that this thing exists is for people to obsess over their cables and as much as we'd love to have our brand all over your stuff because you know Brands like that kind of thing uh it's not the right thing for this product uh so actually I I don't think on the product page you can actually see the LTT branding at all oh you know there it
[Laughter] is so I don't know that's not really a detail you wouldn't have noticed I'm sure you noticed where The Branding was on it but that's the that's the background for why that happened that you probably didn't realize like  sometimes amazing uh good day uh actually I wasn't sure if you guys T touched about this with the AI thing  ow what oh oh oh wow did someone point that out or did you just think of it h someone oh  transition all right L show after dark let's go there
we go that's better can't remember if we touched on this when you were talking about AI with AI how do you think about disclosure of use of AI in your content should there be a consistent policy should we even care as viewers I think you should care but you should care if it affects the quality which it almost certainly will unless humans are hand curating it and hand reviewing it in which case is it really AI or is it more like disclosing that you used a word processor then no you shouldn't
care so yes but also no but yes but maybe no uh we don't we don't have a policy right now it's a really good point um because I think everything that we've used it for that's public facing has been very clearly machine learning like the uh I I showed you guys a preview of what power supply circuit is going to look like it's machine learning up the butt um definitely not attempting to hide it in any way yeah I mean oh I mean okay hold on no we uh we did we did um actually use an llm prompt to get get
some starting points for the smash Champs logo I think or we at some point we we got some some drafts and then we did a prompt and then we got some ideas and we came to the final one so it was very human done but AI was used as a as a tool I mean I've done AI idea generation for T of things like how would we even disclose that like we launch a new feature on float plane it's like do we disclose that AI was used as a troubleshooting tool for some codes like I software developers have been all over
this for for years I don't know man um I I use it for sometimes I I'll not even I wouldn't even necessarily say writer block but sometimes I find starting an email to take me too long and it's like frustrating and I'm like I have to respond to like 100 emails today so like I just I need something to get me going or like this is a long message I have a lot of information to convey I need to get them to actually read the thing in the first bit and I I'll yeah I'll use chat gbd or whatever to help me
start the writing but I never really send actually chat gbd written things so what does that  know I dinus Duke Lan and leid how how much of din's little ones remember the Langley house I doubt they remember it at all I would suspect yeah  all sorry I got to find another one of these sorry go for it look I was going to say didn't most of them not exist I'm trying to think of the timeline I think only one of them didn't exist at all okay during that time yeah yeah hi lldd good morning from Taiwan
compute tax is coming up any Taiwanese food or places you definitely going to have to go got to get me some soup dumplings yes oh those are nice so good dude that place Taiwanese style fried chicken that place we were going to get soup last year was awesome went there like three different nights or something oh yeah I don't even remember damn where was I'm sure we could find it yeah it's in it's going to be in my Google uh timeline I I have like super creepy location tracking on and the only real
reason that I do is because I just like curiously going back and seeing where I've gone like my uh my Google maps location history is hilarious cuz like there was a few years there where I was TR boy was I ever traveling a lot all check check this out give it a  cities oh boy oh boy it's like red dots everywhere um yeah everywhere as long as it's in the northern hemisphere I realized I have never been to the southern hemisphere yeah yeah typical Northeast they never think about the
south where did that accent come from I don't know nowhere in particular okay hey Luke what's your oh no oh God sorry s I'm almost ready uh oh crap there's two places that I really want to go this year Sun Moon Lake and another one that I'm struggling to remember the name of uh Jen J surprised you're not going to like the eclipse or whatever that seems like totally up your alley I wanted to actually yeah I know I couldn't go right now all right yeah bummer it's okay I've gone to eclipses in the
past it is what it is I there's a couple people on the lab's team going I was like take me nice pictures and and Dan seagull I have already seen very nice pictures taken by him so I trust all right he'll get it done I believe sorry what are you saying hey Luke what's your rarest Pokémon go finds in your connection uh collection uh I don't know I assume it's Pokemon go yeah yeah Pogo is Pokemon go yeah yeah um probably shiny pacher  lonus and Luke if you were to wake up in
a Freaky Friday situation what would be your first actions as each  other okay moving  dark you'd have to check check to make sure that the birds are okay that's what he's talking about the birds are very important y yeah um yeah yeah yeah unplug all of the UniFi cameras I would I would jump off of something not not too high but relatively High to get some gravity in me and see what the impact is like weighing that much you mean that little that little yeah but it's going to be a way bigger fall I've
I've weighed twice as much as lonus for like you know what quite but I'd go somewhere where there's lots of short people I was over in Japan and like I realized that that whole experience that people talk about where it's like just like being taller than everyone else well I've never had that you know what I would have the being taller than everyone else experience okay yeah that's what I would do I mean that would require some planning would that be the very first thing I would do probably not I
don't I feel like a lot of what I would do wouldn't be that different yeah no really like I don't really see how being Luke would actually change my lifestyle a ton we do a lot of maybe not the same thing but very related yeah Li says badon I work out yeah man I would hate dragging your gigantic ass around on the court this is why I was saying the first thing I would do is jump basically that would suck cuz I would just be like wow yeah you'd be older though yeah it's not that much older
yep would your wife consider ITA we will not be discussing that would you sit on uh opposite sides of the WAN table o that would probably feel the most wrong no no yeah not at all I don't even think I could do the show seeing colors differently and like tasting things differently and stuff would would definitely be a lot more jarring yeah um yeah I don't know I don't know I definitely do something really embarrassing as him because being a public figure I kind of like I have to be on my best behavior
all the time and yeah he's a public figure too but I don't give a because it's him so I do something like really weird like streak in the park or something you know nice yeah have we gone streak freaking no nice I'm I'm far too conservative and shy M yep I uh actually it's it's funny like I play a very outgoing character on TV but I am like not on TV yeah yeah when I'm I'm I'm actually pretty withdrawn when I'm not on TV yeah um like being being  like doing an underwear shoot for me
very uncomfortable and challenging especially the first time like I have to push myself for a lot of what I do here here's a question if you had if there was the option yeah for like 24 hours would you do it yes or no I would immediately no question I feel like I would for like pretty much anyone though yeah I just think it'd be such a such an interesting experience Freaky Friday that's for sure yeah even even even just the like Vision though I mean be really interesting to see you're
downgraded ass Vision probably wouldn't be uh you get wrecked great for me but even just like the color shift of it I'm still over 2020 baby I just got my eyes checked nice yeah I'm definitely not there's a matter it's a matter of time for me though it's it's it's not like as good as it was think that's pretty normal yeah um seeing things differently hearing things differently tasting things differently experiencing things differently in general I just would be so interesting you know what's funny is
we've talked about this before but it's been in the context of substance use and what I have said before because I've I've not with you this particular from this particular perspective but I've had the argument made to me that it can be good for broadening your perspectives and uh and helping you experience things in a in a new way and and sort of what I've what I've said is is that I tend to be um quite controlling of my experiences and I tend to I tend to be um I tend to like to be in control of
myself yeah and this would be me literally not being in control of myself at all honestly I have it's a big ass I have considered the ramifications of what the other person would do practically not at all so yeah that might change my mind a little bit I'm just like I'm thinking like to be clear if it my own shift if it was you if it was if it was you and this was a consensual body switch with ground wasn't really thinking about it it's cuz I'm not too worried about that
then that's one thing right but if you don't touch the partners right yeah leave it alone yeah exactly but I I I feel like most of the like ground rule thing like yes we should lay them out if but that's also not really the point of Freaky Friday necessarily that's true it it's part of the point is you are I think that's another reason why I'm okay with it though is because I don't think we would have to actually have to establish those yeah like I wouldn't be worried about
getting my body back with diseases you know like it's not it's not like that um but I I I would literally not be in control of myself which is something that I am deeply unsettled by so it's not an obvious yes to me it's something I'd have to I'd have to Fester on for a little bit I wouldn't be too worried about it you bruise me up a little bit it's fine cuz there's there's got to be if if it were to happen the first few minutes of God would be just pure chaos I would think so
yeah yeah like it's what's going on and when I and when I like accidentally hit something it like damages it you know feel like an ogre no offense I you would  though you'd be like this like looking up at people when they're talking to you I have noticed somewhat of a pattern is that I find smaller people are more clumsy and my conclusion is that I think it's cuz it matters less yeah the consequences are like like what I fall over I'm so close to the ground anyway like the the impact is pretty low
you know yeah yeah anyways hi big Luke have you tried hold on willing spy says oh no you'll have to go to the bathroom eventually yeah but I yeah I always sit  look you'd have to you'd have to experience it oh yeah oh yeah yeah oh yeah no but like actually mechanically oh my God to go I I don't think I'd have to do that anyways have you tried a virtual challenge such as the Conqueror on your fitness journey my girlfriend just started routinely exercising and virtual   say no I have not and if it's working
for them that's absolutely fantastic and they should keep doing it and that's great to me I'm a big hater looks like a  grab you all challenges they have like themed ones but they all they all cost money do they yeah you get this cool metal thing at the end okay so like if your little Goblin collector brain is motivated Enough by that to go out and do stuff great sure yeah but like Pokemon go Pokemon go doesn't even doesn't even work for most people yeah but but what I'm saying like like I I don't I'm not
into this I it looks like a cash grab to me personally um all that of stuff but if it works for them great you saw what happened when we launched our series 4 pins right yeah so some people bundle is sold out some people might be super motivated by this and if this motivates you to to get up and go out for runs and do stuff like that that's awesome it wouldn't really work for me and it's an expense so you might guess how I'm going to feel about it um okay it cost more than Z yeah so
I I genuinely don't want to trash it because if it's working for you then awesome but yeah I don't know it is what it is question for slick I have recently transitioned from IC to em for a newly minted team uh individual contributor to engineering manager yeah I Googled them earlier but I can't uh and I'm experiencing some trepidation about the shift any advice or reference material you found helpful uh reference material most of what I learned about it is from Wendell uh I don't think he talks about
that stuff a ton on his channels um the mythical man month is a cool book bit of an outdated title but it's a cool book um other than that there's tons of books I read a bunch of books I'm still reading books every now and then on the topic um for the most part Honestly though you'll be fine just care about your team and you'll be fine this is great trendy says sitting down to pee is a prison thing and uh dei's got my back here it's a tired in the middle of the night and not wanting to turn on lights
or clean up a mess thing 100% I also uh I also find that the other way is pretty unsanitary because even if you don't hit the seat the splashback is very significant oh yeah yeah completely agree also I often go in pairs to the bathroom like number one and two I often go in pairs so like it's just inefficient yeah cuz I'm going to end up sitting down anyways like what was the point of that whole charade I don't know it's also one of the few times that I can get an interrupted time on my phone yeah there
there's a lot of factors yeah there's a lot of factors relax yeah I I stay a while yeah to be clear I was joking that I always sit down but I actually do quite often cuz it's just like yeah man I'm just like I'm I'm chilling in here and I don't need like pee all over the wall next to my toilet I just actually don't need that it's one of the reasons bathrooms smell so bad especially men's bathrooms even if the people who use it are accurate the splash the splash bag it's real even and
even okay even if it doesn't like come out of the bowl you're very likely splashing the inside of the yeah it splashes the underside so um and then it doesn't get washed away properly I realized this I realized how bad it was when I was giving my uh one of my kids a hard time and I bet you can imagine which one about like aiming badly and not cleaning up afterward and realized that actually it wasn't that it was that it was all collecting under and like drying there and then it dries on and
it's gross just sucks gross gross it's not worth it I sit down all the time unless I'm if you're at like a public thing yeah I'm not a huge fan of that I'm I'm a like foot with K kicking up the seat touch nothing guy in public washrooms yeah yeah 100 100% me too totally like but if I'm at home like if it's a particularly gross one I've even been known to make a little toilet paper seat for myself I'm I'm lazy about it have you done the just power squat don't touch no yeah no I haven't done the
power squat I've done that before that can be uh can we talk about something else now no ah yeah too bad can you relay to Luke that he has a very nice laugh and it is very contagious is this a question no thank you though it's funny I I read the comments often I am I read the comments often and it's so divisive oh yeah some people hate it oh yeah it's and it like no one really seems to be in the middle people are like like it a lot or I ruin the entire show and their whole lives
and they hate me Vite you're basically vomite yeah yeah yeah hey dll Luke if you were the chief Vis I don't know Chief Vision officer at lmg would you have started Labs knowing the immediate return on investment and why yes but not in the same way and I think I've communicated this to lonus and I don't I'm I'm not exactly caged about my opinions on things um yeah I don't know I wouldn't have gone as hard as fast um if it was which I'm not saying this is better to be clear is what I would have done um
but yeah I would have started with fewer verticals I probably would have started with like just like GPU CPU and potentially nothing else or even just GPU keep it really narrow figure out all the processes figure out all the speed bumps that you're going to run into with just that vertical that apply to multiple other verticals and then start growing from there but kind of like Master one and then grow that would have been a lot slower that would have accomplished the main primary goal that
lonus has a lot slower um that wouldn't that would have caused major delays in a lot of different ways um yeah but that is probably maybe a little bit more expanded than that maybe like depends kind of who applies and what spe Specialties they had maybe it would have been a couple more things maybe it would have been like GPU and keyboard I don't know um but it would have been fewer total things um probably kept the original location oh the little one yeah yeah okay but the smaller team would have
actually been okay there's no way that team would not work out of that office you had to get something else oh yeah but I would have kept scope scope small and then tried to stay in there that's fair um I mean the reason we didn't was because there was so much work that was going to have to be done regardless of how many verticals we tackled like we would still need the website and basically it's exactly as it is form yeah I'm not I'm genuinely not saying my way is like for sure better and I'm not
saying my way is better either yeah I'm just saying there were there were pros and cons either way and uh there's definitely been speed bumps that we've hit that we wouldn't have with that method but we might have hit different speed bumps if you put all your eggs in two baskets and one of them hits a showstopper now you've got one basket good job you're launching half as many things as you set out to launch it's tough and this is like the the kind of like riskier way but if you make it the
payoff is bigger and faster so the linest way that is it is often how will go and yeah Urban fervor says you have to pick a direction eventually yeah y That's you're never going to agree with every single thing that the company that you work for does and that's actually okay and if that's not okay then you're going to have a lot of problems even I don't agree with everything the company does yeah it's just it's true it's a thing no exaggeration I dll big fan of y'all Luke a few weeks ago you mentioned
mattermost uh having its own issues as a service could you elaborate I work for a government organization that plans on using it for secure messaging oh man it's been a while we  um man it's been years since we tried it so I'm not entirely certain if I remember correctly this is selfhosted if it's been that long it might be I don't want to say challenging for us to say too much about it yeah um I mean maybe maybe hit us up again once you guys have tried it and let us know if our perception of it was
outdated I would be interested in that take especially because with teams decoupling it might legitimately be time to reassess the chat Solutions Market papaka says I use matter most with my college buddies and it works great so yeah but that's totally that's one endorsement and that's all that's worth but um yeah let us no we'd be we'd be happy to to learn more about it the professional self-hosted plan is $10 per user per month build annually right now wait a selfhosted and you pay $10 a
month well there's a free and there's a self-hosted got it okay um I believe the self-hosted tier the main difference is things like SSO um ldap user sync Advanced access controls things like that that you probably will want in an Enterprise environment um maybe not for your Bros at University but at an Enterprise environment probably so you're likely going to be targeting $10 a month there's also a Enterprise option which sounds like it's maybe them hosting it okay um I don't know
okay I'm worth 40K in a bottle of beer nice hell yeah LL what do you think or feel about the framework I hope everyone is okay glad I got so cool I can't believe how fast tsmc was back at work yeah like hours wild um yeah I mean obviously having all of your manufacturing Consolidated in one place is a big challenge but I know framework has had um some feelings about having their devices manufactured in China and they've opted to keep their Manufacturing in Taiwan at least for now
and um it's risky but hopefully uh hopefully nothing too disastrous like the um the Thailand floods that like almost trashed the hard drive industry for uh for a number of months there um hopefully nothing like that happens and of course uh hopefully if something like that were to happen uh laptops and hard drives would be the least of our concerns and we would be uh more worried about how to help the people yeah I'm glad you're enjoying your framework s uh framework 16 though
I obviously super super proud of what the team is doing over there not proud because like I helped necessarily but proud because uh they just seem like really cool people and I'm I'm proud of their efforts they're working hard and they're doing something they really believe in and I think that's really important and sorry I was muted for that one it was uh what do you think about the framework and the earthquake oh yeah and they were enjoying their framework 16 that's right
