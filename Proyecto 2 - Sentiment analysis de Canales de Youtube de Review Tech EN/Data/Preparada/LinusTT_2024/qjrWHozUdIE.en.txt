after reddit's excellent work selecting the LG Wing as my daily driver phone we decided to ask for their help again oh but this time thankfully it's not for me you see I need to build a PC for my boss something worthy of the CEO of lus media and Tong Linus's face all over everything no ooh the all chrome and gold PC I like the way you guys think and so did C Sonic who is sponsoring today's video we're going to be using their focus px850 power supply the same one that we trust for our commoner work
machines and we're going to be powering the most blinged out shiny system possible but why did it take so long to start the build you ask well because we were waiting for a one of one case to arrive which I've been told absolutely needs the white glove treatment oh my  funnily enough we were actually introduced to Sinister cases by Taran himself when he emailed me their website and was like hey these look pretty cool what he probably had in mind was that we would unbox it on short circuit or
something but uh he must be new here we reached out to them and they were excited to not only send us the first unit made out of 7075 aluminum off their 5 AIS Mill giving it this super high polish look but they even went the extra mile and engraved it with his name so that he can get rid of that tacky paper name tag that all the commoners have to have now if I had to critique the product I would say it's a little impractical and the packaging could definitely be better but come on guys
let's be real this is more of an art piece than it is a regular computer case anyway and Jordan from Sinister does say that they're working on the packaging so let's get to building or rather unbuilding you see the reason that we told you guys that we didn't want any hardware suggestions was that we plan to actually deploy this thing so it needs to use our validated Hardware meaning uh it's time to prep Mr Tong's PC for surgery this is a great opportunity then to talk about what we use on a daily
basis starting with our CPU the Intel Core i5 12600 K yeah it's a couple of generations old but it's got six P cores and four eor making it totally overkill for email spreadsheets whatever it is the CEO does so this days but the cooler has got to go why you might ask I mean that's a fair question the noct to nhu1 14s is chrom is already but the ice block xpx Pro Aurora from alphacool is far humbler sorry excuse me far chromer everything else on our isus perart z690 creator board is staying the same
including including our 32 gigs of trident Z5 ddr5 and our 1 TB crucial P5 plus Drive honestly I would actually downgrade that SSD if there wasn't a performance penalty because it has been company policy for a very long time that all data gets backed up to our redundant network storage since local storage is how data gets misplaced or lost now it's time to actually assemble our case using these things we can mount our GPU our radiator and more to the back of the back plate on our case which has
42 different mounting holes allowing us to arrange our PC in a variety of cool different exploded configurations now 7075 aluminum is a lightweight strong material that's been used in the Aerospace industry and in military applications that allows us to mount heavy components on these tiny little arms it also happens to attract fingerprints like an absolute so we need to give it a thorough wipe down before we give it to the big boss we don't want him mad you wouldn't like him when he's
angry that's why NC is under no I'm just joking stop laughing my question now is how does this thing actually go together because it's not obvious no thankfully Sinister on their website has instructions for each individual part as well as the case as a whole the case as a whole I thought it was a frame well just follow the instructions it's only like 100 pages long what I actually don't know how long it is but with all of the parts combined there's definitely 100 pages every single
surface of what I assume is a foot has its own individual peel on it this case is Sinister oh my God you better carry around a glove and a baseball with you if you're going to have this thing in the back of your car you want to take a  one damn I can't wait till we hire a second tan Tong and we need to get a second one of these how many people are named Taran in the world yeah not many not that oh really I feel like it's common name Jesus is a common name Taran is definitely not would you say that more
people in the world are named Jesus than Taran yeah yes really you mean would I  one wait oh oh dude really precise laser engraving that's not a laser oh that is no way they that's an engraving bit in the mill oh well that explains why it looks so good the Precision of that fit though do I even need screws look at this that's pretty crazy that's how much wiggle there is you could barely even make out the scene wait I need a step two is the other leg all right and you need these plugs yeah so what's in that 
plugs and this goes on top there ah yeah okay I see it and then we do two more of those screws again really what oh sorry I forgot to screw you there you go step three motherboard Mount yes oh so this goes on only one way correct screw me any day oh my god do you think I could hang from this case oh don't do  oh The Next Step says it's the GPU but we don't have to do that because that's where these arms come in and we can put it anywhere along so we could Mount the motherboard next okay Dem some tall
standoff boys also only eight you can't have the center one oh well that worked out uh okay never mind it's see it happens to be exactly the same size as the socket for the screwdriver and for a limited time you can get 20% off your own ratcheting screwdriver in this fun Retro Gaming colorway all you've got to do is purchase through the YouTube shopping tag here on this video there's a limited number of these discounts available though so don't wait that looks gorgeous
oh wow we went Push Pull considering The Pedestrian Hardware he's running that's uh pretty overkilled next step is the power button and that's where any one of these holes can come in where do you want to mount the power button uh I mean it could be here sure or it could be here sure where does this go I guess we should plan our Loop order uh we could just have fun with it sure Alex could mount it wherever he likes where would you like it I'm so down so because of these arms
they have the I don't even know like 12 14 different mini holes around the main hole you use these tiny little pins that Alex is putting in and that's how you can actually adjust it so you can have like several different angles while  position that is crazy for the power supply this case takes a similar approach to some Mini ITX cases putting it behind the motherboard so the octopus of cables coming out of it is relatively hidden and for our build we'll be using the px850 from seic who is our sponsor
for the video today these have been super reliable in our deployments and they come with a 10-year warranty and thanks to the modular interface we can paare it with custom length silver cables like these ones from cable mod which is a pretty necessary step here since this case clearly lacks anywhere to hide the cables that do have to wrap around to the front a consideration I saw you guys kind of sizing up this side for the reservoir yes um she's a little imba right now what are the odds you want to put
that over there sure it's just an idea it's a good idea yeah now normally one of the cables we'd need is a 12volt high power connector for our super fast GPU except uh our standardized machines use RTX 3050s which not only don't need a high power connector they don't even need liquid cooling but I mean come on leaving this air cooled would just be embarrassing that's why we took to AliExpress to find was this the one 3050 block on the market this is from bixy who apparently wasn't bothered by the
fact that you'd be far better off just spending this money on a better GPU what a freaking waste hopefully Teran doesn't have to go all tech industry layoffs on us to cover the cost before I get the block on this thing what are we thinking in terms of location just freaking like I know know out here or what I think it's going to be wherever we can hide the Riser the nicest oh we're not going to be able to hide it where are you going come on over here oh my God that looks so bad no put
it in the top one oh my then it's going to cover all of this see I think that one looks pretty good and realistically do we need all x16 PCI Lanes it's a 3050 where do you want that I kind of want it right where the power button is oh did anyone ever actually verify that this  here this is a 360 block I told them to or oh moment please there you go oh you just don't know how to put a block on it actually is sitting really far above the die though maybe it just needs to be mashed
on yeah it's time for our PTM 7950 phase change thermal pad available at LTT store.com this stuff is super cool it's a thermal pad that performs outstanding even compared to pastes and probably the best thing about it is its endurance this is more of a commercial grade product from Honeywell that's designed for very very long-term applications hey guys y what's up remember how I said that this does fit after all yeah yeah there's one surface mount component here that is just a quarter of a millimeter
off see that y I have a solution oh you just want to cut up the block yeah yeah I mean that's not the sealed part sure yeah it's fine okay you won't see it done worse yeah buddy okay what kind of angle Vibe are you feeling here going to have to go in the front there oh yep okay so kind of like that right yeah heck yeah that looks amazing how the are we going to get these tubes done uh with a a whole whole bunch of these guys oh we're going to cheat just heaps of those oh I love it maybe it lines up
now look at that it only took four adapters don't tell the people they won't notice while they work on that I'll be fixing Elijah's ugly Cable Management it's fine it's not fine it's you'll get fined what it's fine wait are you allowed to use power tools yeah you've let me use power tools before is he allowed to use power tools oh my God [Applause] my hand is very vibr how forever is this build uh theoretically forever okay why do you ask because I'm about to do some stuff oh my God 90° just already
in the tube awesome this has been really fast yeah is that a thing in plastic tubes as well I think so y you can buy pre-bent ones we've just never done it cuz we were like oh that's for cowards man I've had my nose so close to it that I haven't been able to appreciate how it's shaping up this is awesome this is very pretty wouldn't pay that much for it but as a gift certainly makes a statement please don't fire me that's the statement right why why' you glue this piece it's like $70
us this one little arm is $70 something like that yeah and this plate is like $200 for the machine time involved that's not even outlandish yeah yes it's expensive no it's not overpriced we've  store.com got him also by the way Elijah your your tube wasn't in on either end what yeah it was there's there's two O-rings you need to be in the second one too can we cut that editor am I missing something here boys something's leaking they missed a stop and the rad you doing okay over there bud just
looking for a C13 it's only an 850 watt I don't need a C9 it's a good 850 WT though oh yeah seic holy oh yeah we haven't really shouted out seic much seic good you think we want to recable manage this when some power supply dies no that's why we choose seic this is the weirdest way to plug in a display I've ever it's like it's it's like you're plugging into the monitor yeah monitor experience holy man I can't wait for him  chair H I think it was "$1,000 oh we got $100 off though we"
sweet talked them all right  God I freaking this looks so sick love it that flow rate not super high it's a lot of tubes a lot of bends a lot of elevation change hey all right okay let's go can't take that for granted guys I can't wait to see the look on his face this is sick oh my God  here wait who put the yeah who why do it say Pope I want to do a few little upgrades to it to surprise both Taran but also Elijah who's the writer of this video am I going to get like a like a in
Barber well no it's your gold throne for a CEO it's worthy of a CEO it's a throne "we spent $1,000 of company money on" it why don't you have a seat it's in really good condition oh oh did you just put a fingerprint that was painstakingly Polished by your servant does this turn  lb comfortable oh my God it has a built-in footrest oh it's wibles I swear to God this is this is not a barber chair it is a barber chair a barber chair you know with the complexity of your haircut that
you probably do yourself um we felt it was appropriate excuse me if my wife doesn't you talking about my wife no no no um I've never met her oh she's great you got your Chrome keyboard yeah the are finger prints all over list yeah I tried wiping it it's not coming off also man are the these are not actually made of these yes they are oh my God they are not yes they are they're not it says on their website this is not made of copper it says on their website wa it's really
heavy yes these 16 key caps were like $200 you haven't even looked at the computer yet o so you can see there's Engravings oh wow oh it's a LTT yeah yeah but hold on you got to look at the other side you got to look at the other side is it me on the wall hold on uh thankfully no oh one one that's super sweet did we do the house or do we even like Eng everything Sinister cases did it for us need to thank those guys awesome can you figure out how to turn it on you got it here here you can stand
up here hold on sorry oh my God it's so heavy if we cut a hold this we can put this in the washroom so so we have a no I guarantee you there's something that you haven't noticed about this yet that is metal tubing uhhuh because the theme of the build is chrome and gold chrome and gold yeah that was what Reddit felt was CEO themed very Mad Max yeah yes which is timely yeah angry Teran is what not Mad Max are you going to try and find the power button yeah that's a PCI Riser it's been a while
since he's worked in the computer review industry ice to PC Riser the io  here I see bubbles in the loop who uh I blame Elijah okay Try It Out Try It Out take it for a test drive oh we should probably help him move the chair again that's all right no no we can no no no no no no no that CEOs don't move the their own chair not clear oh there we go anything for our CEO this is awesome that it has none of the things I need for oh none of the things I need for work but it has they got you linked in
here you want to boot up a game we got rocket League Doom cyber Punk yeah you can play cyber punk I can play cyk this doesn't run really well on my computer um no it doesn't and this is the exact same Hardware you had before it's just pretty H okay game crashed do you think this is a bad example our CEO gaming at work probably how many likes do we need to get on this video to sell that as a poster we should we should stock this as I store.com yeah like how how many like
"100,000 likes sure let's do it we should" we should do this kind of photo for all our hosts or dark or dark Boards of our capture both the haters and the lovers Elijah we never told them the price I don't know the exact because each piece we used is slightly different price depending on what you get I'll add the to here and let's react to it whoa you work at a YouTube company now you got to react a PC worthy of a CEO truly Worthy
