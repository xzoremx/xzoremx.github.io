welcome to Scrapyard Wars where Luke and I compete to build the best computer on a fixed budget we get to play with an enormous $800 including a hundred bucks to spend on whatever we want from our sponsor Jawa at the end of the week our setups will be put through the ultimate Gauntlet to find out who wins scrapyard Wars  it's day four the systems are done they're tested although there is still time for us to tweak them for better perform yes there's still time to tweak
them but the big Focus today is going to be on the setup which is going to be a big Advantage for us except for one small problem we're going to have a little less time today yes that's right they were so late yesterday we're going to delay them by the equivalent amount of time you can penalize us however you see fit for the next hour these two are going to have to play board games oh no like board games the real punishment is because lonus didn't read my instructions yesterday I'm going to
steal all the instructions from every game what do you mean read the instructions please no yeah no I'm not going to take that you pulled in the parking lot at 7:00 we were told to be done at 5:00 you were 2 hours late what a joke this whole thing's a sham I don't like it when dad's argue you know what realistically we don't even need the time we got this does that mean we get to go you're good to go you're free yeah no punishment okay we're going to go you got got the monitor you got to start
clocking the 1700 let's get going going might want to use another chair just to keep this one in good condition cuz the wheels broken so Coen names the only Clues you're allowed to give is one word at a time for example like model you could be like train sure this is going to be too easy have you seen how well we communicate I have not it  late wa this is the monitor we got dang thanks Jawa you got that right me from the past huge thank you to Jawa for sponsoring scrap dreed Wars Java is the
Online Marketplace where both teams found great deals on new and used computers and parts like the monitor or linus' GPU and Jawa vets each one of their verified sellers to make sure they are providing the community with top deals and service check them out using the link in the description and enter their scrapyard Wars giveaway they're going to be giving away the computers we built and signed Java special edition screwdrivers oh I want one is that a high-end mechanical key I'm just trying
to taunt them with our mechanical keyboard now sport three sport three one of them has to be Cricket yep one of them has to be dance yep and one of them's got to be Stadium yes let's go I noticed your uh Cable Management isn't particularly nice so I have a gift for you which is the magnetic Cable Management Arts oh nice LTT store.com this is a actually nice kit there's another layer too there's stuff Bel it w observe for two well watch yes and spy yes yes yes let's go I had a little bit
of a revelation I was trying to type in Steam and it wasn't the smoothest  tester it's registering like 30% of the keys I am not happy right now one of the judges is ayoob so that's definitely going to come back and bite them I just tried our first overclock and it crashed when rendering I'm going to try adjusting the voltage on it and see if that'll help this is my first  overclocking I've never overclocked before I'm glad this is news for both of us so are we done our punishment now y
you're free to go I've had far worse punishments should have had far worse punishments got them deal with it Luke oh I will everything can be ready for the judges at 2: p.m. 2: p.m. I thought we had a full day today they'll show up at 4:00 then no problem when are we going to judge and Benchmark and stuff are we stay until like midnight no this is the last day line is Oh what you go so we need to get the mouse pad and leave a tuny under the guy's mat yes let's figure out where we want our desk
this is an option okay I think we can just leave it like this that's also an option I like this really with the lamp and the wood how much of like the space are we allowed to use to help with our aesthetic here you can't take items from the sets and use them on your desk but if you want to put stuff elsewhere around that's fine wait but they have the cute corner that's not fair oh we didn't even think about using that thanks lonus yeah The C Corner is off limit okay if we can't use the c corner
we should just try to use that corner I just don't think we should be able to use anything to be honest it should be like this the desk right here what kind of food is on this side panel but I'm going to remove all of it I'm going to double check our budget don't we have to figure out an adapter Sammy didn't you say this one had display port we might have to get a display port to DVI adapter if we want to run it 120 HZ so we'll have to see how it goes um I'm going to plug it in and find out for
sure we have 30 $30 remaining I'm thinking we hit up a mini so cuz it's actually kind of close this one's a Guilford also I think if we just got a Guilford straight up yeah there's a bunch of dollar stores there stuff okay how we doing we're holding at this now 3.65 I mean it's a lot better than it was it's better than three and it hasn't crashed yet kind of expecting more but it's a good idea to find a stable good place you will also get a care package of magnetic management Arches from LTT
store.com very nice so we can use that to make sure everything looks really clean aesthetically do you want it facing forward facing forward probably all right cool tilt this a little bit so that you can see absolutely cuz we've got this expansive desk see these guys are all sign language whispery We've Got Confidence that's why we talk out loud about how freaking awesome our setup is we're just bored cuz we're already done uh-huh sure I have a question for both teams did you
read the judging rubric nope nope by the time you sent it to us we already had everything procured so it's not like we could well let me help both teams out by telling you how you will be judged by the judges so there's going to be four categories there is Aesthetics worth 25 points there is sound worth 10 points and that's partly the PC noise but also how good the audio will be there is strategem or creativity as I like to call worth 25 points so judging how creative is the setup how neat are the
Solutions and then Effectiveness for 40 points so how much would you like to use a setup and that's combined into a sweeping score and that's scoring metric I like to call the asses score the asses score yeah aesthetic sound strategy Effectiveness and then a sweeping score I might have these for free I have a bunch of people I'm talking to right now this is the one that I think it's these were LG speakers I assumed it would work on a computer I saw a picture on the back that's speaker wire I think
the person messaged me by the looks of your profile you seem like a funny guy and I appreciate your joke offer but honestly these are kind of muffled and junky speakers not anything close to what I thought when I got them if you want them you can have it for free but then no refunds they're not taking my $2.7 very seriously okay so we are going to go pick up some speakers but as we've been driving my phone's been popping off with messages so we might be able to pick up a keyboard while we're out as
well well there's a few free keyboards around we might have an option do you want to grab the peripherals you know what for a $10 keyboard it's not the worst oh yeah just needs a little bit of clean up and then it's good to go honestly it's not even that bad it's not that bad there are no weird gross fingernails in there yeah maybe we focus on other priorities all right so we're just going to Guilford now um I guess this is kind we're going to set things up right do you want to plug everything
in and make sure it works first it wouldn't be a bad idea yes yeah so here we go just confirming Labs didn't break our computer real quick here let me oh yeah good call we could still replace this if we need to okay the whole keyboard works and mouse too this is actually the first time we fired up the mouse it probably won't track well on that so no it's actually doing okay okay great I did a bit of a goof I thought those speakers looked like computer speakers those are home theater speakers
they have speaker wire connections but that guy was awesome gave me just a bunch of extra stuff for free one of those things is this he said it's just like some piece of junk he got off AliExpress said it barely works and massively overheats but I will let you know there's left and right audio inputs so with a Y adapter we can run these speakers oh my God we're on our way to a dollar store SL cool kitchy stuff store to pick up some things to beautify our setup a little bit we've got a $30
budget basically to get a mouse pad and beautification question for you Sammy yes seeing how much of the score is audio right do we need a mic we can try to find something at mini so and then our worst case scenario if we can't get a mouse pad for a decent price is we just drive to that place and leave it to any the under the guy's mat yep hopefully he still has it out yeah yeah yeah all right oh my God this is not that cheap though dude but this is the Branded stuff this is officially
licensed so it's more expensive I see Care Bear's battery bank man that 30 bucks is not going to go very far dude maybe there's a dollar store here there is a dollar store here we'll see what budget we have but I think Dollar Store candies can be pretty good you're not wrong you're not wrong one thing I was a little concerned about was that strip yeah it's like okay yep we're talking about the same some kind of like sticker what do you think of just like whatever this is like a piece of ribbon or
something across the front there but then this is a little wide okay you want to just go with the silver or the the we go with the silver that's a cute little basket yeah for $150 not bad this fit like I almost oh $1.75 oh that matches our chair too yeah okay go with this that's the one is that our candy dish or is that something else that's our candy dish oh yeah I was going to look up USB microphone it's $10 for a Blue Snowball ice but we have we have an hour and it's
AUM that's close to here okay here's a black Blue Snowball for 20 bucks I mean how badly do you think we need a mic it was like a quarter of the score for audio you're right yeah and like we can no no cuz we can still get this and some candy and some candy and a microphone maybe hard for a dollar wait did you just say hard mints yeah okay Boomer maybe we do like these I'm like hey your previous candy was for Boomer she goes here let me improve that with worther Originals literally my grandfather Ranch
my grandfather is the only person I've ever seen e a worther original Jolly Ranchers are a good bet oh wo wo wo $10 Blue Ice uh just responded to me up right now what is your ETA can holy crap tops 10 bucks anytime is fine just let me know before you come okay we sent the money money sent I sent you my money please respond did you ask him if it's fully functional I mean I didn't really read the listing like new okay great please hold yeah yeah yeah I got you hey where was the address for the mouse pad
oh she left I'm on my own now well uh it was nice having a teammate while it lasted super lucky I guess she just wanted to get rid of them but we got a keyboard and headphones I don't know if any of it works there was no opportunity to try  so got some macros and guess what we still have left $2.7 did you just like Rob someone the person with all the speakers that's the person who messaged me and was like I looked at your profile you seem like a funny guy ended up giving me all of this
stuff this stuff bit of a problem he also gave me this thing I don't know if we can use this forget about that but he gave me this oh bum it's got an ax we can plug it into the computer with this he solved the problem without me even bringing up that it was a problem we could mount it in like a CO nicely like under the desk here something yeah the keyboard what's this story some lady was just trying to get rid of stuff these were a thing when I was a teenager I don't know if it's going to work what
are you doing what's your story what's going on okay so I I have some before and after pictures this was just with a CPU overclock on Shadow of the Tomb Raider 1080p with everything on Ultra including R Trace Shadows did a little bit of GPU overclocking it's not much but anything higher I went we started thermal throttling which then means we were getting lower let's not bother with that 4 FPS when you're out of less than 100 yeah it's like 5% let's make sure I don't have to keep running out so let's
test this really keyboard yeah sure I don't know if any of this is going to work literally everything that I have right now I have headphones I have a new key well this is nasty it's not new lights lights lights okay there you go okay but we need to see notepad oh  keyboard cool we have a functional keyboard headphones it has a mic I didn't even think about that play some  Noise We got working headphones nice crank them crank them brother that's what 0 sounds like let's
go thank you great thank you so much oh we have 12 $1 with tax we have 10 bucks essentially so we go buy something cute do they have a figure for 10 bucks wait we don't have any stationary to put our  out Nicole goes by penu pandering uh well how much is it $4.99 we have five more dollars so this we're going to leave our little notes on like guide to fully appreciating our system or whatever is this 2299 yeah if we get this penguin okay [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] win yes going to gamble on a blind box that might have
a blue penguin in it okay which one this one has less space this one has ears and this one's taller and this one's taller we want a kind of shaky one cuz this one's a little lower or one that has like more space on the side so if you shake it like well that one has no space on the side no try this one oh this one is good I think okay do we want this one I think okay we're going for it we'll take these items please you have a membership with us oh no thank you um just for membership okay I will be a member
thank you uh let's go get our microphone I sent them an ETA already the reason why we bought this is because we saw a little penguin in here that we really want okay 3 two 1 so you can't see through the bag you pull it open oh my God we got the dock our penguin let's go we're going to win oh my God for $3 and all you had to do was sacrifice your personal information to  great thank you problem all right take care and it it works uh yeah it works okay great thank you so much thank you
oh do we have mouse pad address yeah I have oh you got it yeah based on the current timing we are going to arrive back to the office with about 5 to 10 minutes to Cable manage and for Sammy to accent that front piece and like it's going to be tight and if Buddy didn't leave the mouse pad out we are not going to have a mouse pad which is going to cost us big time I'm a touch worried that we've put absolutely zero tuning into our system I think our best bet for that is to kind of spin it as a win so
like as part of our system presentation we talk about how like the system is not just for you know Extreme Gaming or whatever it's stable enough for anything you'd need to do explicitly not overclocked in any way Rock Solid stable like that kind of thing okay okay oh the guy replied oh so sorry I forgot to leave it outside wait we're not going to have tomorrow okay oh sh we have $5 left I should have confirmed with him okay there's got to be a Canada Computers or a Memory Express somewhere around here
as well Memory Express Langley are we going to make it in time we can make it calling Memory Express Langley this  Friday long story no time to tell it I need the cheapest mouse pad possible what is your cheapest mouse pad that you have in stock I'm talking like five bucks uh cheapest we do have is five bucks can you do five bucks including tax like can I give you like a $5 bill um yeah should work out yeah thank you so much I'll be there in 5 minutes yes hi look at that here's $5 you want
to type the phone number don't worry can I get a receip do you have something for like $7 uh next one up goes to like 15 15 okay than it's going to be this then doesn't really have a rubber backing here's what we're going to do Sammy the first thing we do when we get back we plug in a glue gun okay and we glue it down to the table so that they can't tell exactly how we glue this and then it'll be a rubber thing oh that'll work he you have a great day thank you so much take care not going to lie this is
barely a mouse pad this is a piece of foam that you can put a mouse on but we'll take it how I'm imagining this is I could almost see either the computer on the right outside or or underneath on the inside cuz if it's underneath on the inside we will need to drill another hole if it's on the outside we don't need to cuz we could theoretically just have everything run up along the back I feel like if it's on the desk it's going to make it not very even like to the eyes I like the idea of the speakers and
no Tower I think it's pretty cool I'm just wondering about the amp I think we still drill we can run these speaker wires directly off the back nice and neatly they can come up and in this way and it can be mounted there something like that are you going to get a a drill yeah right now all right I'm going to go try to get a wheel is there anything else in here no hey get out of here get out of here I'm not looking I'm not looking it's okay I'm com look away look away look at your own as we were driving
up today I spotted two chairs in the wild I don't think I want the chairs the  wheels that was easier than I expected I don't know if it's like compatible or anything well there's   way solved that is sick squiggly is the way to go uh I got two just in case it occurs to me I never thought to take a close look at this cable said it was a little flaky what buddy let's try this other  Bamboozled okay well that sure as heck isn't it well that is the flakiness of the cable revealed come on come
on what you know what I think it is this adapter doesn't support that do you have another adapter maybe okay do the cable management first okay I'm on it all right going to get everything starting to wire before we plug Mount this wiring it while it's mounted might be difficult but I don't know we don't have much time though we got to move real fast technically I think we have 12 minutes oh my god really I am not going to get this perfect I'm getting stuff off but there's things here that I believe have
lived here for a while can you give me a time check 15 yeah we officially only have 10 minutes LT on okay magnetic Cable Management  balls not game banter how are you guys doing for time uh never better I'm okay with adding some time if you want never better okay I may have to swap out a defective cable but that's my only  stickers I don't know feel like off to the side is a little bit better I don't know if it's exactly centered okay but it's pretty I'm going with it then
okay that is wired in and then we can plug plug headphones in up here yeah I think we're okay just keep cable matching you've got 3 minutes and I'm going to keep cleaning this isn't movie Magic this isn't reality TV show magic we're actually just running out of time it doesn't look very nice but it either looks nice or it works does it feel okay it's a little lumpy oh it is okay do more glue where's all my adapters be at here if you can go that way that's better I can go through
the front though if it needs to uh that is plugged in that's plugged in it works 25 seconds lint roller are you able to um make the mouse pad a little bit less horrible first it be pencils down exactly how you leave it in 15 seconds I don't have time to fix the glue uh I may not have a working computer in 15 seconds we got just slide against the wall five can everybody get like one more minute three two one is the screen on this okay everyone pencils down you guys need
another minute huh they can have another minute they don't need another minute nope we don't yeah it's done way to go every every bu you did it I think we did great look at the setup yeah I think we did pretty good it was better than I expected I don't know if I've ever been this sweaty at the end of a scrapyard Wars I think we overestimated how much time we had to do the setup itself but I'm happy with it it looks good but it looks good we are here in the final stretch of
scrapyard Wars and we have our three experts Nicholas plof our displaying keyboard expert Nicole Yun our Aesthetics expert and Riley yeah that's regular guy wait can I be Vibes Riley murdog Vibes yeah you don't know which system is which right no why don't we start over here oh this is it this is it I thought this was something somebody left here by accident I'm really impressed that they have a chair this time around not bad not bad oh okay this is a short person friendly
I like that the keyboard yikes is that like orange dried up goop yum is this bribery absolutely how do we split that three ways we could get maybe a small Slurpee they got a 3080 in here oh wow who did they steal this from okay these headphones are also orange crusty  flavor yay there it is that's not bad odd stains on the chair I'll sit down anyway honestly I'm pretty impressed by the speakers one thing that I don't think Nicole touched on is uh looks like they got a Dack here highi stereo audio
amplifier okay it's just an amp it's not a oh it's just an amp still though to drive these massive bookshelf speakers I don't even know if you can call them bookshelf at this point headphones aren't amazing but they're not bad and they got a mic you know it's not the best monitor they've ever used but for the price point that they got to that's not bad they really hear the fans around spinning up that's why they've got the speakers and the headphones and I love the zooming mouse pad they have a mouse
pad yeah wow that that orange crusty definitely is High Fidelity up close that's got some crust on it okay well this is very smooth obviously I mean like we got a 3080 144 HZ screen one thing that's irritating to me as someone who whose desk is on the set where we film is a loud PC I cannot Abide a loud PC and this one is very loud it's all red all the time yes I would have liked something a little something a littleit more they're also not showing it off at all I just shoved it in a corner if
you're putting this forward to be judged why are you hiding in a corner this is a big desk you could you could easily put that up here so I mean minus some points for shame uh on their part overall Vibes I mean for $800 for this complete setup that's not bad at all don't give your scores yet it's time to go look at the other system and immediately wow this looks way better to me it's so comfortable you've got some personal affects look at that look at that little penguin it's so happy to see me they're
showing off their system it's nice and clean there's no sign of any orange crusty anywhere you know there even more personal affects oh that's so cute there's candy see this is a station I would be happy to sit at and use let's see how it feels so right off the bat the monitor is much less impressive but it's cute I don't understand what's going on with this mouse pad there has to be some kind of crusty there's okay one second that's something blue crusty crusty blue crusty ah The elusive blue
variant interesting I guess that does provide grip Mouse is very fancy and then there's a nice blue microphone ooh with a cute little bow very nice quiet knock to a fans one LT Edition modern platform runs with runs Windows 11 oh I didn't even think about that one keyboard is nicer it's still mechanical but it it it feels it feels better newer feels pretty good it's definitely I'm guessing 60 HZ also 1080p okay that's fine they're on a budget edifier speakers they're much smaller than the
huge bookshelf towers that were over there I don't think the doing doing something these aren't bad I think they're pretty similar they also mentioned zero overclocking for gaming every day so it's going to be nice and stable allegedly W the bribes are really getting you yeah oh I'm such a sucker for candy the frame rate is a cable issue but this monitor's capable of higher refresh rates allegedly so the refresh rate issue was really like uh we're speeding to the end of the Finish
Line only to trip kind of oh I'm so torn I hate that this is stuck at 60 I think it's the better computer but I think ultimately a way worse monitor we got a DP 1.4 8K thing yo going into dongle to d That's not their fault that's not their fault what do you mean it's not their fault that's something they had to think about when they were they should have thought about it no free lunches here so I had some immediate thoughts upon coming over here the vibe is immediately more welcoming just because
of the high contrast between the dark peripherals in the PCS and stuff and the lighter desk over there we got a darker desk and dark peripherals it just kind of looks like I think the word is Dink is is there no headset there was no headset on this one if anything I would expect that one to not have headphones instead of this one this one looks like you've taking the uh how it appears to other people into account I don't know what who I represent when I say that uh 60 FPS is like just fine for me in most
things o oh oh oh this yeah yeah I I I I can tell that it's 60 nice Boomer scored see and I think I'm already getting used to the 60 and this is the thing have you ever heard the term comparison is the thief of Joy that's what this is all about and they scored on us God damn it it's not screaming oh yeah that's I can't even hear it at all it's not making any sound who's this guy what's his name it's a friend it's funny you know I wouldn't guess that something like that would
work on me but it does I like that it's I like that he's there I don't like the ribbon though did they do this to cover oh okay you're disassembling theu well I didn't I didn't know I would be disass I mean that's shotty workmanship wait that's the same that's a blue glue that's a blue crusty the rabbit hole goes deeper what's up guys hey if you want to see the whole uncut uncensored version of us judging these systems head on over to float plane what happens on float plane stays there all right see
you later before we get to the judges score I want to announce what settings the benchmarks will be run at for the teams okay for Red Dead Redemption medium okay for cyber Punk medium no R tracing oh however yeah I mean if you had read The Benchmark document you would know that you get to pick a benchmark and every single setting at which it runs at we're going to pick shadow of the Tomb Raider what it's way better I I tested both I promise you it's better and L Sammy have
you picked your benchmark do you even know what the choices are no you can pick from the list we'll take f123 low okay the judges have conferred and it's time for their scores in the category of Aesthetics this one over over here is nice lots of room but it looks a little old 17 out of 25 this setup gives me sketchy and hidden in a basement where things that shouldn't happen are happening oh so I give this a 15 what kind of denn is it called goon cave yeah a goon cave I largely agree
with Nicole on this one it doesn't seem right I'm giving it a 10 the next category is sound this system had bigger speakers I'm not saying they're better but they're bigger and it had an amp I'm giving this one also headphones a temp while it had both headphones and speakers the headphones were so crusty that I didn't want to put them on I forgot to clean those No No I gave four each for having both they both work so a total of eight I also appreciate that this one had speakers and headphones but
as Nicole said they're kind of crusty I'm giving this one in eight next category stratem or also known as creativity toal creativity I think it's not bad I'm going to give it an 18 out of 25 I actually think that they were incredibly creative with what they've done here they tried so hard to hide every sketchy part of the system even with a tempered glass panel that was pushed up against the desk it very creative it's full of problem solving I'd give this actually a full 25 what let's
go right there buddy very good despite the aesthetic being concerning the strategy here is clear they wanted High frame rate and they achieved it I think so I'm giving it a 23 can only get frame rates that are so high with that CPU uh it's pretty good actually well and the monitor is capable of it burn it actually is capable we would know the last category is the effectiveness of the system how much would you like to use this setup I'm very torn I don't like most of the peripherals I do love the monitor I'm
going to give it a 30 as much as it's creepy and kind of sketchy kind of crusty gross it's very usable it performs well I give this a 30 if I'm thinking about this as something I'm going to be coming and sitting repeatedly at uh it's not very inviting but you know it's not horrible I'm giving it uh 20 out of 40 I will tabulate these scores but it is time to move on to system number two it's much prettier and more inviting so I'm going to give it a 25 it gets full points I
really like the whole thing super comfy brought me joy the only thing was the mouse pad that kind of got me I'd give this a 23 I'm giving it a 20 I like the contrast the light desk dark peripherals it's inviting but there's also some weird stuff going on there not having a pair of headphones and being stuck with desktop mic and speakers I'm giving it more like a seven if the other was a full 10 I'd actually give this a six because while they weren't as gross they didn't really blow me out of the water I
like headphones a bit more than speakers so I'm going to give this one a seven next category is stratagem they tried real hard I think overall they tried real hard hey hey I do love candy I love candy in terms of creativity I genuinely like it without the bribe I'd still give it a 23 I was very impressed but the fact that both the mous pad and the monitor were kind of Jank I'd give this a 23 I forgot what I gave this one but I wanted to give them the same score because they went for different things
but they both kind of achieved what they were going for 23 23 me and the last category is Effectiveness I'm incredibly torn I really prefer that monitor but the peripherals on this one in terms of mouse and keyboard and just overall smoothness of using the computer was a lot better so I'm going to give it a 35 just the fact that sitting at the station it doesn't make me not want to touch anything and to shy away it brings me comfort and joy this gets a 35 I definitely wanted to use this one a lot
more and despite the lower frame rate the overpowered Hardware made things smooth so this is a 30 for me you guys better hope you win some benchmarks yeah we're going to that concludes the judging thank you expert judges you may now leave please please leave please leave I'm going to tabulate the score and while I do that the contestants are going to take a look at each other's systems your chair is actually this is horrendous I think there might be more shmoo on your setup I think they just
saw the bright desk compared to darker peripherals and thought it was nicer I think yours is actually more goon cave than ours is like this armrest on this chair is gross it moves that's a sound ours doesn't move great either yeah you pulled your wheel off of a dumpster chair you know I didn't have time to tune the sub yeah I wish I had tuned that first what is that is that a 3060 or 3070 3070 that's the 3070 from Jawa yeah so that was my original idea as well uh this is
a ryzen 5 4500 nice we've got 16 gigs of 3200 Ram we did manage to enable XMP it like worked immediately 3600 never mind so 3600 is a big Advantage for CPU performance for us here you had no time to overclock though right I had no time to overclock cuz we cranked a bunch more performance out of the 1700 yeah but your Zen one how many cores is this one again is it but they're fast they're much faster and we have faster Ram let's see your goon cave setup yeah hell yeah welcome to the dungeon oh this front fan
is barely spinning I wonder if your GPU is just like starving it's probably starving this case has literally no front intake yes we were trying to get more fans and stuff it kind of ran out of time this was a very short scrap Wars we also we had lots of fans yeah and lots of cases yeah we have headphones maybe if you've gotten that Cris we have a mouse pad yeah nice Mouse it's so brok it jumped you're supposed to have light mice they're supposed to be light it jumped out of my
hands the glor it fell down behind oh from Zu Lang wolf brand hey it's actually all right if you don't Smash It Anyways there's a good there's a recess portion at the back of the desk that we thought about mounting the computer on instead of having it in a case oh yeah but that was another like we don't have enough time for this situation I can't believe this monitor how much you get it $75 off Jaa okay that's a good deal it was actually sick figuring out the balance was really
tough um what' you pay for that GPU 500 500 CAD yeah I still like our deal better I'm sorry the original I had decided 3070 immediately on yeah we saw that deal and we were like like we should buy the 3070 spend the rest on everything else and then it was like but the like turbo gas gas gas option is buy a $500 380 so we just like did it for fun and now we'll see what happens your XMP is not working uh it should it was not working during when the judges were there what Elijah it was
I literally had it on and I unplugged and moved it here when Mom and Dad start fighting that's fine we'll just re we'll use one of our reruns you can set x&amp;p now cuz you're like allowed to overclock oh are we all right see you later well we're just going to rely on software we're going to download ryzen Master software and we're going to download MSI After Burner and we're basically just going to turn the power knobs all the way to the end and hope for the best so we are 65
higher that was the only stable I could get and then we do have XMP I mean there's not much for us to do in the 10 minutes overclocking time cuz we're already pretty dialed in we'll do c bench first all right we're just hitting start on single core start on single core hey we're done 72 points boys that's uh lower than your lab score so we're going to go with your lab that's lower than our lab score that's 74 well okay hey there we go 60 all right multicore are we giving it a moment to
like chill or we just nice try we're running oh okay going what's your score 564 545 545 that's close though yeah I don't know if I would dance that much we knew you going to win CPU benchmarks uh GPU this is where Things Fall Apart a little bit all right 3 2 1 go what was your "score 12, 653 what was yours 10135 sorry" 10135 well I think we know who won that one what do we do next it is now the blender render okay am I missing something here is this going to take 46 minutes no it should be like 90 seconds
okay yeah time remaining 41 minutes let's just skip this one and do the lap score yeah sure fine what are the scores  what's next we're doing Red Dead cool so then we just hit run Benchmark yeah okay 3 two 1 go are you guys done we're almost done almost 9.96 80.2 all right next one is cyber Punk on medium wait so did we win this one you did win that one yes so medium no braid tracing that sucks so much I was specifically confident in cyber Punk and the fact that we're running it so
low makes me not very confident to be honest okay what was your average they're scoring 98.53 105.3 2 Team balanced okay next one F1 everything low it's close but we needed to win that so I think that's kind of it oh did it crash I don't know did they crash good thing we chose this game tone down the GPU a tiny bit oh should we tone down the CPU that was what was unstable before just do it like very  slightly got to Huff it Huff that copium  wa okay 194 194 okay let's come have a
looky boo all right let's see average  190 but that's not that bad they were supposed to spank you on this one this is their chosen Benchmark but we still win a win is a win win's a win a win is a win well our chosen Benchmark is shadow of the Tomb Raider move on Luke W is a w bit I had to reboot I hope our GPU overclock was on on nope it wasn't wait what yeah look's going toing kill me is that legit oh my God Elijah forgot to initialize the GPU clock after we restarted so that was completely not
overclocked well turn it on now quick for the last one yeah we did you can still win this yeah sure so on Graphics everything the preset is highest okay oh yeah R Trace Shadow to ultra okay [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is this the last Benchmark this is the last Benchmark it all comes down to this we'd have to beat them by 20% or more on this  go that's a butt nice butt so many butts that's what this setup was made for even get that you're too down come on man it's fine what is it what is it you guys
want I'm sure yeah I don't know why it was so bad guess what ours was 78 90 90 wow that's so weird do you want to know what's you know you know you want to know what's crazy I can't hear what you're saying over the sound of your fans that's fair oh damn you want know the worst part Glenn I have a picture here of me getting 94 okay I guess I have a 92 don't they get to keep the better of their two tests though yeah that's true so if they got a better score when Labs tested it theoretically
Labs didn't test this one this is a chosen one they tested it and got a better one so you could be really kind and give them that David every time I do that I lose the game over it you know that right how much confidence you have in your system you know what I'll do it again they can have it yeah okay what what was your highest score Elijah he had 94 94 95 95 on our average FPS it's insanely close when it comes to these Benchmark drag races out of a possible 900 score it's only 13 points of
difference and team lus is ahead by those 13 points with 764 by 751 but there's two different modifiers there's the judging differential which they so the average score uh for Luke's team was 71.3 okay and the average score for Linus's team was 85.6 so it's a 14.3 boost to their score team Bal we we just like fall over and when it came down to the labs differential which was a 15% boost to the winner we have five categories so someone needs to win three categories and order to take that win you guys will
crush us on sound but your drive might hurt you if they actually are you let them talk first category is the out of the box experience which is a little bit of a subjective experience the winner of that one was Luke so one Luke zero L you can take it up with Labs okay I like Labs now second test was thermals and it was close Luke actually had better CPU thermals but your GPU thermals were very problematic you had a hot spot of 104 on the GPU broken fan he didn't broken fan
and so lonus takes that category one1 baby repasting for the win then we tested memory speeds and it was really really close even though the specs are different but lonus did Edge lonus no Ed lius lus edged Luke just a little bit on this one but then it was storage and even if I only included Linus's SSD score he still would have lost to Luke 22 we did spend a notable amount of extra money on assistant but unfortunately for Luke's team the last  sound got you and so the winner of scrapyard Wars 2024 is team
Ry good job I'm ready for him to start crying yeah we have to gather the tears so I can season my food and the tears you have as tattoos don't count I asked for those you should have told oh yeah it's probably better you didn't yeah probably and it's probably better you guys didn't miss any of this year's scrapyard Wars I hope you guys enjoyed this we'll see you again next time oh yeah shout out Jawa for sponsoring this video and we all got good deals on Jawa if you guys like these systems they're
going to be available for giveaway on Jawa so get over to java. that's super cool and they're actually really legit and one is really loud leave a comment under the video letting us know which system you'd rather have uh well let the  yours I mean it's pretty nice ah if you didn't get that system that I wanted we would have crushed that
