the fans inside your computer probably look something like this or this or maybe this but what they don't look like is this that is unless you happen to have a meshless aiio by meshless design a case that contrary to its name does in fact contain some mesh but the mesh or lack thereof is not what Drew Us in it was MD's claim that round fans are sickness and our long fan is the here really though guys a 14900 K and an RTX 490 in this case with no other fans not even on the
radiator I'm skeptical and so is our sponsor nexigo whether you're in need of webcams or accessories for your VR device nexo has a great selection of products to choose from check out their giveaway at the link down below cross flow cooling fans have been used in gaming PCs before creative modders have used them to cram water cooling where no water cooling was intended to go and the Silverstone fx11 was available as an optional accessory for their first generation compact case the sg1 way back
in 2005 so then where has this technology been all of my life hiding in plain sight it turns out cross flow fans are favored for their compact size Even airf Flow distribution and low noise and can be found in everything from household fans to air conditioners to gas fireplaces to computers apparently that also have seat bels in them yeah but to really see how cool it is we have to get inside so let's take off these panels ooh that is a tight fit good gravy promise you it's not cheap we'll
get to that later how does this side come on it doesn't oh the rest of this is all like one connected piece of metal no yeah it totally is did they extrude this entire piece yes like that's amazing like how are you like this wow you're just so cool wow sorry sorry is he even famous anymore to be clear there are some screwed on pieces the power supply Mount right here this angled SSD Mount that's made out of I think PL oh metal that's fun the optional carrying handle and what
appears to be an adapter for the top that allows you to mount conventional fans if you really want not quite that's for the radiator for your aiio oh I get it your motherboard goes here there's a little clip and a routing path for your tubes over here and then you've got this one fan that blows air out the top of the radiator no it actually pulls through the radiator and blows all out the side right here oh oh one fan to rule them all except for this guy oh presumably it's for Ram not for sheep
only Ram that was a bad joke I don't know I think it was the goat you kid you kid a I'm defeated so let's Shepherd this away from the puns and back towards the case yeah otherwise we might not be able to keep the uh viewers hooked ooh I like it and there it is custom cross flow fan apparently the manufacturers not just sourcing these from AliExpress or whatever but rather they've sourced a motor an impeller and put together an assembly that they think offers a unique value proposition for cooling well your
entire system just this this is cool I don't think I've ever seen a small form factor sandwich style case before that fits a quad slot GPU is this a 490 actually they claim that this case was specifically designed for 490s and I9 core processors like absolutely crazy specs you are putting the GPU in upside down oh yes I certainly am really yeah it's okay this is the first of many wacky mechanisms in here ah GPU installation bracket I see I don't know what that's for I thought you
said there was an airflow guide that must be what it is it must be it oh yes I saw that as an option on their website but I didn't realize that that's what it was at the time because when I built this and tested it we did not use it I don't know where it goes and I couldn't figure it out so I just didn't put it in okay fair enough they're working on manuals right now they're in the process of making it they sent us some early versions but it's all like Laura mipm stuff right now GPU bracket is that what
it was oh good what you just got to get some screws on there that's pretty clever it allows you to just screw your standard screws into this and then something yeah NE I'll put the screws in sounds good is that an 1100 watt power supply mhm dang I feel like we do this every time we bring this out we're always like holy crap there's 1100 watts in there and before I put this in I'm going to put the cables on what is this for this is one of our many quirks we have our GPU support bracket that just kind of like
sits in there it kind of fits between the case and the fan uh-huh and then it just just kind of sits on there just it's really weird okay sure fun fact we can actually screw this into this one oh well that's cool want to see Quirk number two I guess I haven't even put the GPU in yet though they give you custom length cables oh well that's cool yeah is that just for reviewers or is that a thing that's for that's you ask for the kind that you want with the case oh wonderful yeah and they're super
flexible do you know why they aren't all this flexible is it like a safety thing because the silicone covers are more expensive I know this because we're going to be making our own cables and we're going to be using really really soft silicone covers yeah cuz these are nice yeah they're so nice to work with LTT store.com at some pointtm all right I think I figured out how to get the uh GPU connector plugged in yeah sure actually there's a smarter way oh if you look at the bottom of the case there's
panels oh look at that you can just uh open that up and then you can plug it in like well I didn't do that well you're going to have some problems in a moment but I I'll let you discover those on your own okay I need this to go in you should go from the other side oh you made this so much harder for yourself yeah no no just just give up no I can do it no stop no I can do it no cuz you got to hook it on it's going to make it no it's going to It's The Little Engine That Could the little
GPU that could go in this way you mad bro a little but like not mad that you did it I'm just mad that you refused to do it the right way so you're mad that it worked no oh no is that does that have to oh do I have to slide it all the way out this way now in order to latch it onto a thing yep I was I was I was telling you dude I maintain that my way still worked ooh that's cool look where the bracket mounts onto have you noticed the doohickey super cool wait a doohickey I noticed this wa and there's
a do hit key so because of how tight it is to get it in that allows you to disconnect the pcie slot oh no way it's so fun to spin it goes okay how about it goes in the computer yeah how about you put that in there yeah okay dude did you get this in here with this GPU before yep it's not even what what have you done I have done nothing I have broken nothing I just need a little bit more sag I hate that that's the solution to their credit it's not that hard to build in though it's surprisingly easy power
supply bracket just goes in a little something like that and we're about to get our motherboard in and then we're almost there wow I realized now we haven't really talked about the rest of the specs of this build at all oh yeah well we got a 7950 X so not quite I9 territory in terms of thermal output but a lot a lot of thermal output uh we got "32 gigs of DDR 6000 Ram your five 6,000" RAM and did we throw a pcie Gen 5 m.2 in here just for good measure um I'm not sure what the m.2 is in there it's one
of our standard I think it's a 990 Pro it's a lab standard one nice and now it's oh not going anywhere because the screws are in the standoffs and now we get to see yet another fun Quirk of this case well how am I supposed to screw these in I introduce you to Tiny screwdriver wait they even have a little Notch shut up this comes out and I do that that from the all metal construction to like all of these weird unique bits you can kind of see the costs adding up we'll get to that yeah later now I just
got to run the CPU power connector which conveniently goes right here look at that and I can put in our aiio oh yeah uh something no fans no fans at all you don't even have space for them it's like me in August no fan why why don't you have fans in August last August oh the oh I was thinking like house fans and I was like dude that's the hottest time of the year interesting thing to note about this case is that currently it only accepts 2 80 mm radiators which is why we went with a white one cuz we don't
have another black one curly no that's an aesthetic Choice that's valid um is there a reason this is not going in uh yeah the the the pipes don't want to you really got to put them in there they're really bent oh I'll let you do your thing I'm GNA come over here and install the 24 pin there we go wow that's tight yep good gravy even to the side panel it's tight very delicious gravy wait did  didn't yeah um that's a lot of goop yeah you managed to not goop the part that you tried to goop that's good that's
okay oh jeez do you not wipe when you're finishing oh sorry what no the hey that's it folks it's all in this didn't take that long no wait the strap that just slides in on top oh just going the other side get a little oh yeah look at that you can just like you can just hold it you could just wave the whole thing around like that that's enough of that that's a lot of money there I can't believe how painless this build was yeah they've put in a lot of thought as to how to put it together and
they also actually have like really really nicely done build videos to show you as an instructions which we didn't even look at no we didn't need to it blows it blows oh yeah I want to see the cross flow fan o it does move yeah wow and that's interesting I don't know whether they've got any kind of ducting on it or anything but it doesn't blow straight I can't feel it at all here I feel it here so when that hot air is coming out of your system it's not coming out somewhere where these fans on
the GPU are just going to suck it right back in it's going away yeah that is super cool let's hear  up I need to feel this she moves though she really does it's a lot of air you could probably see my arm hair blowing in the wind here that's quite the thing oh my God you're going to hit the GPU now too yeah why not I mean sure we actually have head room on our CPU right now that won't last forever I want to hit it with combuster first first because one of the things we'll notice is that it'll
prevent our CPU from getting hotter it's really good at throwing air out of the case in general something I'm noticing here is because we're using pwm control for the fan that means that the hotter the CPU goes the faster the fan spins well the GPU doesn't affect it and as long as our GPU stays cool enough which it looks like we're going to level out around 65 to 70° I mean it's a it's not that loud it's a four slot 490 it's going to be fine if it was a thinner 490 I would
have more concerns about it I mean even then not necessarily I've seen small for Factor designs where the exhaust is basically just kind of getting sucked back in and recycled even though it is being thrown out into the room and you can kind of stand near the computer and go oh yeah this is The Hot Zone heat dome right yeah but this thing it just it's at 550 watts and it's just hucking the heat away let's crank them both let's go okay 800 watts the number number I'm most interested in is our
liquid temp because our ryzen CPUs are going to boost all the way up to 95 just by how they're designed so it's tough to tell how hot it's actually getting seeing our liquid temp going up over there is kind of giving us a better idea when we were idle CPU it was like 26° we've seen it climb to 30 over the course of like a minute maybe and I've also found a bit of a flaw in the design of this carrying strap it tends to get sucked down onto the rad which is a good indication that it's pulling a lot of
air into it but is giving up some of our surface area to strapp oh yeah there it is CPU clock speed is going down as the liquid temperature goes up our GPU is fine yeah that's Rock Solid don't need to worry about it it's made byus cuz it's heart touching remember their old slogan Rock Solid heart touching no I don't yeah it doesn't matter you know it's loud but it's a pretty broad spectrum noise it's very tolerable yeah it's like a white noise machine it's not whiny at all yeah
and if you were to have like a bunch of like 40 mm fans or even 120 fans you're usually going to get more noise than this well even right up against mesh have you listen to the have you heard of fractal Tera with fans right up against  bad the performance of any thermal solution comes down to three main elements air flow static pressure and sound air flow refers to how much air can be moved without any restriction static pressure refers to the ability of a cooling solution to over come
obstructions like radiators and dust filters and sound is obvious how loud it is of course this casual onset test isn't enough to draw a real conclusion so we had the labs team test the case at the low medium and high presets um before the button broke in combuster we see our GPU like we saw here totally fine cross the board uh it doesn't get that hot but the CPU really wants that high preset and even then it stays it's at 40 it's at 4 no then it's good yeah but it does need to max out yeah and you
can see like even with a 15-minute test we still had a little bit of climbing to do it's not quite flat and in the acoustic tests yeah it reaches as high as 54 DB from the left side where most people would be positioned but like we said before subjectively the quality of that noise is not that bad and if you're not running all core loads you don't ever really need to have it run that fast no I mean if you're gaming you're not going to see anywhere near that yeah so in summary then cross flow fans are fine
which doesn't answer the question of why they aren't more common well one reason is that their best quality is their compactness if you had components spread out laterally a cross flow fan takes up minimal space in two of its three dimensions and creates a laminer airflow stream across its entire length ensuring that everything ends up evenly cooled only problem is that makes them kind of irrelevant for to style PCS so I guess that answers that question but in theory they should be great for servers then so
why isn't that a thing to answer that we need to talk about the downsides servers need minimal downtime and having five small axial fans instead of one big cross flow means that one or more of those little fans can die without losing all of the cooling capacity of your server this gives the administrator time to install a replacement of course that could be overcome if it was for some of the other issues that we've uh tiptoed around until now in addition to our original three factors there's money and
niches crossflow fans being less common and more complex tend to fail more often and tend to cost more than typical PC cooling fans not to mention it can be harder to find replacements and in an industry where every penny counts and standardization drives prices down well the cheaper standard solution is going to be the one that wins anywh who are we finally going to talk about the price of this thing yeah it's uh it's expensive $360 is the price and that's just for the case yeah that's not including some
of the extras that we got like the handle and stuff I see to be fair they're a really small operation just a few people it's a small run of a case it's all metal incredible premium build that's true and I got no problem with any of that and really weird just doing something different and non-standard means that they're going to have to come up with all sorts of solutions to manufacture it which is going to drive up the price further the fans are expensive compared to like a $6 whatever
fan for a normal computer you have to spend like what did you what did we see like $30 minimum they were in the range of like 20 to $30 starting price that's for the manufacturer not for the end consumer so like the whole thing is just expensive but it's also really really cool but that's not the same thing as overpriced because there's a justification for why it costs so much just like I Justified the price of this segue to our sponsor paper like if you're looking for a screen protector
