what's up everyone welcome to the W show we've got a great show lined up for you guys today I forget what our title was so oh yes now I remember ah a judge has decided that Elon musk's statements about um you know the things that their cars were going to do and be capable of were simply puffery which is not a problem awesome and not fraudulent good precedent so for advertising on the heels of our discussion about what is or isn't a scam last week we'll be talking about an actual scam and how apparently
that's legal yeah the LT screwdriver by the way is going to automatically screw screws in for you um okay I don't actually okay that I get what you're trying to do here but I don't actually want to make false statements about our products they will not do that what your uh what your smart glasses might do though is docks anyone and everyone who happens to be near you a couple of students made an invasive DIY facial recognition glasses system that does just that um and we'll be
talking about how this could Usher in a whole new level of future dystopia yay do do you have any good news can you do good news uh let's see we got Amazon dark patterns we got I didn't yeah I was going to say I didn't have any prepped give me good news good news let's go let's go uh I don't know if that's good news or not Minority Report is coming that's not good burs returns is actually not good either suing people can't protest anymore uh Nvidia is doing Nvidia things okay forget it 
things the show is brought to you today by manscape Squarespace one password and of course our chair partner secret lab our laptop partner LG and our skin partner dbrand have you not even looked at the table did you not absorb the table yet oh the table's orange I love how you're able to do this sometimes I believe that you never noticed it was an ad I couldn't see it that makes sense that makes sense it like glows it's crazy it doesn't actually glow but just because of like
the lighting in the room and stuff it looks like it's almost glowing that totally makes sense okay cool well we'll be talking about that later or not I don't know whatever the table's orange now cool let's jump right into our headline topic shall we yeah oh man a judge has dismissed a shareholder lawsuit that alleged that Tesla had made misleading statements exaggerating the capabilities of its self-driving systems and this is where I feel like I'm about to go off script and we're about to talk
a little bit more about a personal you know thought thought that I've had many times the legal system seems broken doesn't it oh yeah it seems broken it feels like how do you fix it though it feels like there needs to be like a common sense filter sometimes you know where the argument could be you know hey uh we're Coca-Cola yeah we hired death squads but it was outside of your jurisdiction so what what are you going to do about it that's an actual thing that happened so there you go their
defense literally wasn't that they didn't do it it was that it's outside your jurisdiction so you can't charge us for it that was the defense and I just I feel like we need a common sense well something that I genuinely don't understand about this is the whole Red Bull gives you wings thing yeah like they had to add the like Red Bull doesn't actually give you wings yeah and like isn't there there's more of those it's not just Red Bull it's like a bunch of different isn't it like
Skittles doesn't actually show a rainbow and they have to like clarify that like McDonald's can't say have you had your break today because nobody gets a break and you know not in this economy take a break so you could go do gig work have you had break isn't it kid Kat no dude no no no no no M uh Microsoft uh McDonald's okay when I was a child that was their jingle have you had your break today huh yeah don't don't worry about it and there was never any kind of litigation over that I was
just I was making a really terrible reference to my childhood yeah but essentially false advertising claims in the past even ones that are like obvious have usually had to be clarified if they're just supposed to be fun like the Red Bull thing they still have to clarify and it's pretty clear that Tesla has repeatedly repeatedly and it's got to be knowingly at this point misrepresented the capabilities of their autonomous driving feature and I'm going to use the world's largest finger quotes actually
I'm going to need bigger finger quotes thank you those are much bigger finger quotes than mine that appreciate that no problem um however uh the judge dismissed the lawsuit and Tesla's lawyers this is really important Tesla's lawyers did not defend the claims that they had made on the grounds that they were true right so they you know back to the Coca-Cola death squads they're not defending themselves because we didn't do the thing that was bad it's more about the loophole it's about the technicality
rather they have claimed that these statements that were not true were merely corporate puffery the lawyers argued that vague statements of corporate optimism are not objectively verifiable and that no reasonable investor would rely on these  H how's Tesla stock doing again actually I think it's been on a tear lately I don't don't quote me on that I don't I don't keep track of it um the judge having sided with Tesla's lawyers is therefore agreeing that a reasonable person would have seen CEO Elon musk's  
disagree I mean how many times do we have to go through this whole yeah next year next year next year thing before it becomes pretty clear that it's not coming next year um I mean do you it's been it's been really interesting to watch the recent pivot to the the the fully autonomous Robo taxi project when that's what was promised yeah for each and every Tesla owner I shouldn't say promised because apparently it was puffer that's what was puffer for each and every Tesla owner
years ago was that their car was going to make them money like their car was going to operate as a robo taxi while they were at work making them money it was like an it was an investment I I found this website I just found it now um I don't know how perfect it is I've never looked at this website before Etc but I think it's pretty fantastic actually it's called mother frunker um as in frunk and it's the full self-driving timeline I just found this now so it's different quotes about what
the cars will be able to do you know uh are going to end up with complete auton omy and I think we will have complete autonomy in approximately 2 years from 2015 with the source oh yeah that was not two years ago you just go all the way down I really consider aous driving a solved problem I think we are less than  2016 six months definitely that was back in 2016 as well you'll be able to fall asleep in a Tesla probably be able to deliver Teslas with autonomy in about a year that's up
to The Regulators yeah no it isn't one of the funniest things this is wild I can't believe somebody yeah I can't believe somebody actually compiled all of this it might even be missing some I have no idea like I don't I haven't looked at the site before the thing that I found most entertaining about this actually is that they gave up at some point they stopped tracking in 2022 I mean imagine your defense being if someone like if someone files a lawsuit calling you a liar who misled
them and caused material damage to them imagine your defense being well obviously I lied I lie all the time yeah how could you be stupid enough to believe me like come on I get that there are a handful of you that are musk sycophants and that's cool you do you but I stand behind the things that I do not appreciate about his approach to business business um and lying about the capabilities of your products and misleading people that is that is that is a scam um and scams are
bad and they are not something to be looked up to and I I just I don't know how to I don't know how to have a conversation with someone where we are not grounded in the same basic truth that being a Shifty character is not good yeah and that it's not to be applauded or respected yeah it's actually bad we can appreciate good things that someone accomplished but we don't have to we don't have to respect the extremely Shady behavior that they engage in um yeah cool so anyway I don't I don't know how to I
don't know how to reconcile this to your point with the other with the other false advertising presed that has been set over the years and like it's it's it's a bit of a I don't know it's an interesting line because puffery could make sense like if you're like oh this thing is amazing blah blah blah and it's just okay like that's that's how I think puffery should be used um exaggerated or false praise you know if um exaggerated I think could be okay false I don't think is no no false
praise let me give you a context where false praise could be could be corporate puffery okay um so let's say um okay I'm still CEO okay we hypothetical scenario I'm up on stage at uh at in the in the line of Sebastian theater you know whatever I'm I'm talking about our our latest innovation in um I don't know lapel technology or whatever caller caller technology sure okay and I'm standing there and autop pop I'm I anyway so I'm I'm talking about this great uh this great long sleeve shirt
that's available on LTD store.com and and our our chief technical officer whatever the heck your job is these days I honestly don't even know it doesn't matter walks up to walks up to the stage in like a scripted moment shakes my hand and goes man lonus you look you are the you look better than in any other outfit I've ever seen you know that that's that's that's false that's false praise you know like I think my birthday suit looks a lot better than this personally and well
you the point is the point is that that's not is that false praise what if you what if you actually thought that but what if you what if you didn't it doesn't really matter this is clearly a scripted a scripted moment unimportant yeah you are you are engaging with me in a way that could obviously be pers pered to be just kind of corporate nonsense I'm not saying this shirt will have active Cooling in 2 years yeah I or or saying something along the lines of like this is the most Innovative shirt we've
ever made yeah that's that's just clearly exaggerated and it's puffy and it's kind of whatever and it's non-specific doesn't really mean anything and I I think that's that's one of the problems and that's where I mean I think that's where someone like a Red Bull runs into trouble they're making a very specific statement Red Bull gives you wings which even if you don't interpret it literally you could interpret to mean that it makes you move faster potentially right and it is an
energy beverage and and so maybe yeah potentially there's methamphetamine in it I don't know um you won't slow down like you could actually misinterpret that but that's the thing with the self-driving it's not these are not vague statements our self-driving technology is World leading that's puffery that's nonverifiable that's it's it's nonobjective say go back to the go back to the thing for a sec oh well I I left it so give me   specific go go to some of the newer stuff because the newer stuff ends up
being a oh my goodness the newer stuff ends up being a bit more anyway the point is what is that why can't I it's a solved problem is a very specific statement that doesn't that doesn't mean you know we're really confident our worldclass team can solve this problem that's that's puffery you know you're you're talking up the capabilities of your team you're you're you're engaging in the kind of thing that like if you said anything other than that could be like um you know could be potentially seen as
like bullying like if you were to say anything other than I have complete faith in my team to deliver on on this amazing new technology like if you like say that on a stage I mean that would be that would be terrible the Optics would be terrible so I could corporate puffery is something that you have to say you essentially have to say that you you believe in your plan and that the team is engaged and moving forward with it you don't have to say um let's see it will be capable of level
five autonomy by the end of this year that is extremely specific that's not puffery that's just a lie and not only are you saying that but you're saying it it already has the the hardware capability like we can we can remotely deliver this feature to you in the thing that you already own if you buy it today like that that type of stuff you know Cory is the name says can you think of any examples in which LCT has engaged in corporate puffery um yeah yeah I look at the store I think that um there have
been cases where we've had um oh man nothing nothing product specific I don't think but like we've I've definitely said things that are that are not necessarily true to the best of my knowledge like particularly around someone like a like an ex-employee I would always talk up what they've done really well I would never talk about why we parted ways um whether it was was good or bad really yeah so in that case it is more it's more down to uh you know confidentiality and professionalism it's
less puffery it's not really marketing though okay so hold on have we ever have we ever puffed in our marketing um you know what I'm gonna I'm going to throw this back to you guys I'm going to throw this back to you guys no I don't think trust me bro would count as puffery I think we have in good faith taken the best possible care of anyone who's had a problem with with our products um it's not always been the most timely we're a small team our customer support is onshore um you know so we don't operate
Around the Clock you know sometimes in particular when we have a long weekend or something I'm sorry that our team gets long weekends are videos a product uh yeah I think our I think videos are our product thumbnails is that puffery though cuz the puffery is here what puffery exaggerated or false praise though it's not it's not it's praise specifically how is saying it will have full self-driving praise then well it's not it's not puffery that's the whole that's the whole thing I'm mad about is
that's not puffery at all that's a specific statement about the capability of the product that could absolutely mislead an investor or a customer okay someone in flo plan chat I think got it um oh there's two of them yeah they hit me on the world class thing I I knew that was coming I knew world class was coming I didn't want to address it I will often in fact internally the way that I'll refer to our team as world class is a bit of a meme we have a worldclass team in a literal sense I
don't actually think it's puffery we compete with the best in the world in the tech media space Tech entertainment Tech education uh we we we are very very competitive around the world we are a worldclass team we have a global reach for our brand and for our content we are a worldclass team however a lot of the time um I use world class and and we use world class team in a verbally ironic manner internally so you know someone will leave the bathroom in a deplorable State I was I was going to give the
exact same example pee all over the seat pee all over the floor what looks like it could be pee in the sink world class and and the first thing that people will start talking about on teams is world class  so I don't think that's puffery though I I think I think I think okay yes it can it a little bit yes it can be but verbal irony is also not puffery in order to be puffery it has to be seen as an Earnest statement this this is where like the lines get so blurry they do get blurry
they get so blurry they blurry someone also pointed out world class employees don't have time to aim sorry that was really funny um they're busy making world class videos Another another one that was brought up by somebody was um uh we have a great show for you today I brought a bunch of people have brought that one up okay intro way show great show for you we say it like every time yeah I think that is an example of puffery yeah sometimes the show is going to be and we know it yeah but like it's not good
salesmanship to say yeah we got nothing this week we've done it which we you're not wrong actually I've actually I've found that some of those shows have been pretty good sometimes they're they're yeah yeah you never know it has less to do with the topics and it has more to do with like how much sleep either of us has had and there's a there's like a there's a Goldilocks zone cuz if we' had if we' had absolutely none it's like all right getting on to our next topic yeah I'm mad about that
but if we're like yeah but but then but then like if we're really well rested everything's is pretty sane yeah um so there's this like you need a little bit of derangement yeah there's this magic Zone where it's like we're not really running on quite enough sleep and  caffeinator passed out behind the lens yeah I was worried about him yeah me too he's a tank yep yep um okay so you guys have definitely definitely caught us on a couple of on a couple of on a couple of puffies but I
think when it comes to our products I no I don't think we puffery I feel like there's there's got to be some thumbnails dude thumbnails I don't think thumbnails are puffery though you don't you can't you don't exaggerate the what what is it might you don't falsely praise or exaggerate the praise the video the best computer we've ever made I'm looking I'm not there yet why did I look up YouTube what are you even doing do you even compute by the way that's a great video go back
uh do you not even do you not even alt left Arrow what is what is your problem uh there there down left that's freaking awesome I watched it oh yeah yeah Kut Creator uh just like casually showed up at the studio tining did a great job just showing him some of our some of our prototyping tools that we use there's this sort of perception um every once in a while when we actually do a video in the workshop um you'll see the odd comment that's like man they spent so much money on this Workshop they never
use it they don't people don't know what we use it for and I think part of that's on us because we don't really talk about I've been saying for a long time we should do engineering I think we should have a YouTube channel that has no upload Cadence we commit to no upload but it's lmg or whatever you want to call it umbrella parent company engineering interesting and we just show like like the the the oversized screwdrivers show how we made those the the like metal screwdrivers the Carbon
Fiber One the wooden one all these different cool experiment things that we do we do tons of cool engineering stuff and we tell no one about it and there are entire massive YouTubers and entire massive fields of YouTube that are entirely based around just that and we do it and we're a Content creation company and we don't show anyone and it drives me nuts you're actually not wrong and we could like I understand the pressure that the engineering teams don't want to have of needing to turn
out content so just don't make required uploads for it but making a video makes everything take three times longer and most of what they use this stuff for is product development yeah which would sell products I know I know but it would take three times longer look look look okay look Ry is on the CW team te now I think that will he is hard at work on content around our our in fact in fact he actually shot a video earlier this week or wait was it Arty who shot I think it was Arty who shot it was either
Arty or Sam Sammy they had a camera in front of their face the whole time and I I'm pretty sure it was already anyway um  meeting about the development of the Zuck t-shirt so as part of as part of our development for of a of a gray shirt right because we wanted kind of like our the Steve mock neck we want we want to do a a Zuck t-shirt I'd love to do a Jensen leather jacket as well but that's going to be a much bigger project I don't know how many we'd sell any it's a whole thing anyway the point is we
wanted to do a Zuck t-shirt the Zuck and as part of our development process we kind of went well shoot we don't know what's the shirt he wears we don't know what's special about it we don't know we don't know what t-shirt billionaire wees apparently this is it we answered that question this is the packaging what is what is the that a t-shirt a billionaire wears comes in name sounds expensive Brunello Cinelli we'll be unboxing it later on the show we'll be destroying it later on the show yeah because that's
part of the of the you know product development process well we'll explain what that little machine is anyway the point is um I believe it was already actually shot a video of us having the conversation valuating this shirt compared to our existing blanks compared to our existing cotton blanks sort of talking about what's good about it what's not as good about it it was pretty cool it was pretty cool and so we're trying to do more of that okay we're trying to do more but anyway Kut
Creator did a great job uh tinan did a great job it's a really cool little tour and it gives you a better idea of what exactly it is that we're doing with all of this really cool fabrication stuff anyway um so yeah false advertising let's go or puffery puffery puffery yeah exaggerated or false praise okay so actually giving you a headache but that's not praise I literally got a headache oh my I'm not too surprised yeah uh let's part of it is that I forgot to drink water that day so pray
yeah dude no it's perfect it's perfect it's unusable but it's perfect yeah but both of those both of those are are are true I think together you can't say that's puffery I mean look if Tesla was like our autopilot is perfect it's unusable that would at least raise questions yeah yeah that would give them plausible deniability about the the perfect  right last PC building guide you'll ever need that's not puffery if if that's actually just true that is a factual statement the the first one got like 11
or 12 million views and the comments are just full of like I just built my PC using this guide I built a PC that can't fail uh yeah yeah so it's uh it's um um a high availability PC cluster but it can't fail it can't can't fail everything I mean okay waterproof all right that is slight exaggeration all right you know what you know what you've got me it took it took a lot longer than I thought we we had to go back months I thought it was going to be pretty quick but the praise the praise
part makes it difficult Y which I still don't understand because it wasn't the Elon statements weren't praise no they were just here's what we're going to do this is the plan will have this feature on this if you can't believe the CEO of a company about the product road map then who can you believe and I can well I don't think you can ever believe anyone about any product timeline uh because no one  I think there's also got to be some some amount of a limit to things all right why don't we move on cuz I'm
bored oh hey we've got Riley here I I forget speaking of puffery I totally forgot I'm so sorry Riley I came to Puff I came to puff up something of my own check it out check out check us out guys what is what is this again I forget jaky Jakey Jakey and Jakey attorneys at law thank you should am I am I yelling into this thing do I hold like this I forget it's end a dress yeah yeah you're good um I Dan Dan said he could give me danan said he could give me a a chair but I decided to just come squat in here
awkwardly because I forgot the chair Sor style it is truly awkward forgot I like it though do we have an Apple box at this light is really bright yeah don't don't look at that it's not it's too late Riley no Riley lonus did you know that it was Riley week on float plane this week I did know that it was Riley week on float plane this week did you know that I did a backflip for you I know that you cannot do a backflip whoa you don't know that that's anti puffery  puffery I watched the Star Wars videos
really good I really liked it did you watch the whole thing I heard you were watching it it's fantastic who said that uh I think Sammy told me or Sean did I liked it a lot well I thought it was okay Sammy told me that it took 10 million years to edit that's not it took long time cuz it wasn't praise yeah yeah no I it took a long time it took I uh not going to lie I stayed up all night a couple nights to get the script done and to do the guidance you didn't sh did you really I won't go all the way cuz I
don't know I don't know where your mouth is you've been puffing up a lot of things so oh um oh wow uh this is wan show we got to keep it appropriate listen Riley week is uh is is over now there were three videos right yeah yeah did you guys watch any of them except the Star Wars I watched Star Wars I didn't watch any of them yet it's okay okay it's okay I mean on the Q&amp;A you probably just know all of them yeah if I want to talk to Riley I just talk to Riley because he's right there we we
match almost every day I was waiting for the Star Wars one so was that I was excited about it I don't know what else to to say other than go subscribe to flow plane which you guys already say like five times an episode so I just kind of want to hang out here this is okay this is cool I can make like what is this segment shadow puppets is this just is this just is this just marketing for float plane is that the whole point yeah if you could just keep switching back and forth to to float plane there
that would be pretty cool okay so yeah that's Riley week among our other exclusives why do you guys ever use the space back here there's a lot you could do some you could do some activities the lights have to go there no got like talk linked and we don't have a mic that's on a on a you know freely moving I know I thought that this was going to be more of a handheld thing but this like this feels feels wrong it's two hands it it's a two-hander yeah there you go it's a sander shander I don't think anyone took
it that way but yeah yeah definitely for sure it's a weapon knocking it out of the park Riley um what's your next topic I don't know are you are you joining us for the show like a stool students make invasive DIY facial recognition glasses oh man yeah that that's pretty scary yeah we talked about that on TechLink this week oh yeah dud what do you want me to go I I don't know what we're are you joining us for part of the show Conor is waiting for me to go review TechLink right now but
like with us no I'm not going to do the top you want to read the here read the  really yeah students make in I'm not going to read the whole topic top make invasive DIY facial recognition glasses I'm going to summarize it okay because we reported on this on TechLink uh some students from Harvard okay fine I'll just read it two Harvard students set up a system that uses a video feed from their meta smart glasses to automatically scan the faces of strangers identify them and compile
dossier of personal information such as Jobs personal association phone numbers and addresses while the system made the occasional error notably it once flagged a young woman as her identical twin oops broken aw throw it out the students were able to use this system to approach several strangers and greet them by name while pretending to be an acquaintance or a fan of their work how creepy would that be I mean it's happened I found LA is actually the worst for that and this is
what's funny it's like it's like hey you want to feel what it's like to be famous for a second or to be be a a upper  celebrity the students have published a paper detailing their experiment which they say was intended as a demonstration of what is already possible with current technology Tech giants like Google and meta have considered putting facial recognition into smart glasses in the past and they and they have Google has dismissed the idea due to safety and legal concerns after public after making
a product already but that's here whereas meta's reasons for not pursuing it are unclear meta has not yet committed to not using the footage or images from their smart glasses for use in data scraping or AI training I mean that's all screwed they they've actually thank you Riley that is the summary no as in as in the whole like oh don't use it for AI training everything is being used for AI training already yeah and they've essentially actually said the opposite Zuckerberg on a podcast
thingamajigger said that he wants uh you to have personal AIS that are powered by things like the glasses that they have context of everything in your life yeah but like that's one thing because it's your personal AI I think a lot of people are probably okay with you feeding if it's encrypted and everything oh yeah if you like you feed your data into a personal Ai and no one ever gets it except you yeah it's not going to happen I feel like the lighting on my face is perfect for this story it's like
dystopian yeah it kind of is it's like I  I mean okay what else do we have to say I I feel like this was actually a good topic you guys should continue discussing it but I have to go review Tech link okay okay I really have to go I can't stay we could bring you a laptop you just do it behind the set what's that do you want to just have a laptop you could do it there you can review it on you just hide behind the the laptops I think next I think next show I'll come back and I'll be back here and you guys
probably won't know until I say something nice work place thanks Ry thank you Riley love you subscribe to Flo yeah right my favorite website thank you Riley some puffy right there yeah I enjoy you guys can't see this but he's bear crawling off the what I'm leaving with dignity oh man um that was fantastic wow okay thank you very much Riley that was great that was you never know what's going to happen when Riley walks into the room um but that actually was a perfect example of puffery yeah it's my
favorite website which is fine which is there's fine a near z% chance that's true yeah exactly but who cares but that's obvious yeah and that's the thing puffery should be obvious and it doesn't matter yeah all right so let's come back to these smart glasses um this is what's funny about this topic to me is that you and I have actually talked about this for years many times in the past and close to the whole time we've known each other and if you go back far enough because Luke and I both suffer from some
form of undiagnosed face blindness slash oh yeah just complete inability to remember people's names and we have talked about this many times in the past how what would ultimately sell us going all the way back to like the launch of Google Glass what would ultimately sell us on this technology would be if it could serve as like a a Rolodex essentially when you're at a party or social function or a work event and it'll just tell you okay uh that's who that is bring up the last
email that I exchanged with them uh tell me like how many kids they have so I can ask how their kids are doing and if you go back far enough you and I were naive enough slash the world hadn't distended into distended descended into dystopia enough that we were actually bullish on it and wanted it now I read about this thing that I asked for that I wanted because it would be really helpful to me in my daily life and I look at and I go holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this is this is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we're
fed everything's fued yeah well because I I I think the thing that we were wrong about and I think a lot of people including us were wrong about these types of things were that we we thought it was going to be ours like the whole Rolodex idea is that you knew these people yeah you were essentially inputting this information it was checking locally to your information and then letting you know and that's that's just not going to be what it is because data makes the world
go around so instead of it being yours it's going to be Zuck or whoever else is and you're going to be checking against their information and giving them more information also known as updated facial recognition information for these people to make sure it's more accurate and any uh data and Analysis that you're able to scrape from that moment is going to go up as well to sh into a pool I also didn't think about at that time I maybe I was just younger and more naive right like I didn't think about an
authoritarian government using this technology oh yeah to keep track of absolutely everyone and where they go and what they do and who police officers or whoever else yeah CU they already have it in in cameras so that's not really new but this would be yeah give them to police officers facial recognize figured if they have like outstanding warrants or whatever else and but it's not just like the outstanding warrants like this could tell people suspect level all kinds of stuff all kinds of stuff about people
that comes down to we have another topic that we'll talk about later but it's um The Minority Report thing yeah like like buddy here buddy here frequents you know the the the the the CD theater you know on Sixth Street and and that might and and and and that might be factually true right but that could activate someone's prejudices you know what I mean so it's not like I don't even mind if it scans someone and it's like there's an outstanding warrant for their arrest that sounds
actually reasonably helpful it's one like say there's a say there's a a riot going on because every time that there's a riot there's some people that are you know in involved with the bad things and the riot and other people just trying to get away and it's like that woman voted for Hillary Clinton and this R is based around whatever so she has an increased likeliness of being one of the people that is involved with the damaging of cars so arrest her even though you didn't see it happen yeah yeah like dude
that that level of that level of and if you think if you think law enforcement doesn't profile it they do they 100% profile and you give them more and more tools to profile we are I don't know if I want to live on this planet anymore you know I had a conversation  was I I mentioned that I I want to die on Mars and I was like yeah that that just increases over time handyman says to be fair I think you should mention the story is kind of exaggerated since you can already achieve this using your mobile phone
camera or any kind of camera it's basically just calling third party services and and we did acknowledge that it already exists that's their whole point is that this already exists but it's the form factor that's scary because somebody can walk into a bathroom wearing a pair of glasses you can't walk into a bathroom with your phone out streaming data to some third- party you know image identification service unless your name is ghee whatever his whatever his last name is Dr disrespect yeah I don't know yeah
like like no this is the no cool person walks into a bathroom with their camera out that's a pretty normal looking pair of glasses just glasses that's what's scary about it and the fact that you're right this is just totally a thing that already exists is exactly their point they're not they're not developing this as a product they're not even trying to they're not even releasing what they've done and to your point what they've done is not a huge technical achievement all they did was take
off-the-shelf stuff and hook it into other off-the-shelf stuff but that's the point right now today you could have someone walking around it disorderly says but you can buy a spy camera that looks like a pen you clip into your pocket yeah absolutely but it's the it's the ease yeah it's the ease and it's the Integrations and it's the it's the it's the smoothness of the workflow like if you just have a pen a a a pen if you just have a pen camera sticking out of your pocket and what you have to
ultimately do is like go home at the end of the day and and ingest that footage and then crunch it on your like you know multi-gpu server cluster and it you know retroactively go back and figure out who you interacted with that day like that's what we'd be talking about 10 years ago right that wasn't that scary but this whole real time you know how many kids do you have and what are their names and you know where did you go to school and like dude that's that's scary I still want the local Rolodex
thing where like you have to input the information of the people but then that doesn't even work because I'm sure there's just going to be databases you can download you can you can use it that data will leak yeah yeah all all data all data will leak leaky data it's our  condos just saying it's a it's a it's a widespread problem leaky data it's going to cause all kinds of trouble dude you see 23 and me is in trouble oh that whole data set's going to end up with someone I'm so thrilled I'm so thrilled
that relatives of mine have used these Services I'm so excited about that really thank you thank you for that Y and like every time we talk about that this kind of stuff and we'll we'll have people in the audience that are like yeah but like legally insurance providers can't use that data and guys laws change laws change the only and people ignore them yeah that too that too if laws mattered then we wouldn't be where we are today I can pretty much guarantee you every single
person in this building currently has broken the law at least once sure I probably sped in my car on the way here today I probably did as well yeah probably sure yeah for sure sure yeah and and like that that's the thing right so you know whether it's so just to give some insight on that um I bet you every single person that drove in BC did yeah our our no one follows the speed limits here the where it would be dangerous if you did so I watched a really interesting documentary like ages ago
I've I've looked for it multiple times and I haven't been able to find it so it must have been pulled off of YouTube or something it must have been copyrighted but it was basically like an investigation into our speed limits and why they're too low and why it's like actually dangerous and it just they just need to go up and how the provincial government just ignores it for the most part um yeah really interesting it's wacky man you you'll be driving with a police car behind you following the pace
of traffic like 20 kmers an hour above the speed limit police car is not lighting you up and they'll like go around yeah they they'll also get frustrated because you're actually going too slow it's just like what what is this like what oh man what a joke anyways yeah culat uh in float plane chat says and this is such an examp this is such a great example of how laws are are often so sort of myopic in their in their in their implementation goes legally I can't ask age in a job interview because
that could lead to age-based discrimination I added them the end part there so I ask when you graduated from college it's like yeah you make a law sometimes with a really solid intent age-based discrimination that's bad okay but people are going to people are going to find a way around it they're going to find a way to to you know technically either they're going to just do something illegal in a way where they're not going to get caught or they're going to find a they're going to
find a loophole they're going to find a  just our data is not going to be protected these products are absolutely going to end up in nefarious hands and I I'm I'm so uncomfortable with it yeah and then out of the other side of my mouth I talk about how I want to do like automated scorekeeping at the Badminton Center and how we could use facial recognition to track people's gameplay and you know whatever else In fairness to me I trust myself to store that data only locally on site
but maybe I should and that still doesn't technically mean that it's invulnerable and it doesn't and and and it you know I hate to open this can of worms again but let's say that I died or I sold the company or whatever else there might be an expectation I'm not I'm not laughing cuz he said I'm going to die I'm laughing because I realize the can of worms that he's mentioning that he's opening my bad my bad uh my point is that that that data sitting there could be seen as a treasure Trove
by whoever you know inherits or or purchases that business and you you saw what happened with the servers at NX yeah like this happened the thing the hypothetical that I'm talking about right now actually happened at NCI the owner didn't die but the data was not managed correctly and people who ended up with servers from the auction ended up with customer data from the auction   right um cool uh we're supposed to explain merch messages and uh do two merch messages now thanks Dan okay so
merch messages if you want interact with the w show the best way to do it is to send a merch message like Chris F down here instead of sending super chats or twitch bits or anything like that we strongly encourage people to send a merch message that way you can throw money at your screen you can support the WAN show and all of the you know cool people who produce the W show and me um and you can also uh send in a you can I don't know something whatever you can send a message uh so it'll either be
replied to by producer Dan or he'll send it to someone internally can answer your question for you or he'll just pop it up on the screen if you just got a shout out or something like that or he will curate it and that'll look a little something like this Dan you have a couple curated merch messages oh I didn't tell people how to send one go to LTT store.com and add anything to your cart and you will see a box where you can fill it a merch message all right there we go sure yeah I've got one here
for you hey lldd did you ever get any contact from iFixit with how they feel about your Precision  yes um I I'm not really sure I'm not really sure what to make of it are you talking about the tweet no oh no no I'm talking about uh I'm talking about an email that came through after we talked about it on the uh after we talked about it on the WAN show basically we got an email yeah you know what screw it we got an email from their agency saying that they going to be pausing our relationship um they
provided some reasons for that that are like whatever um I told our team they they agreed to continue throughout the rest of the month of October but I I told the team if they want out uh we shouldn't force them to work with someone that they don't want to work with so if it's uh you know if it's the reasons they stated then you know cool they can keep going or whatever or if it's different reasons and they're not comfortable working together you know that's fine uh basically what I what I left off with
was um we take our Partnerships seriously we want to maintain positive working relationships with everyone who shares our passion for repairable technology um just tell them take their time we'll be here when they're ready I'm good or whatever I mean we're we're at a scale right now where no one sponsor can do anything to impact us important which is which is super important um and and to be clear guys there could be totally totally unrelated business reasons or or whatever right
like I don't want you guys to pass any kind of judgment but we have heard back from them um not about this like not in response to any questions um we just heard from the agency so so that's that's where we're at um transparency transparency um no I'm I'm not going to I'm not going to tell the reasons because that's that's their personal biz right so yeah like but but there what I will say is they they sound like perfectly plausible business reasons so I'm not there's there's no judgment here
uh I just want to make it clear that from our side um we have no intention of forcing them to fulfill any kind of pre-agreed contractual obligation if they want out then I have absolutely no problem with that and if they ever want to if they ever want to work with us in the future then the door is 100% open but if I were you I wouldn't expect to see a ton of iix it um sponsorships on uh lus Media Group properties um you'll you you'll probably still see their products show up from time to time
like I've said over and over and over again we like the products we love the mission um we consider them an ally and so it is what it is well all right then next up get some announcements out of you first uh oh wait no don't we have another merch message no you got to do the announcements and then you get one more oh I do the announcements okay the long sleeve polo shirt is now available we wanted to make something that you could wear to the office this fall without sacrificing comfort and without
sacrificing having a little personality little flare a little bit of flare little bit of spark so we created a long sleeve polo shirt made of soft and slightly stretchy cotton elastine PK is that the word Peak PK whatever the best part is under the co collar is a fun little pop of pink you'll also notice that the buttons on the polo shirt aren't buttons they're snaps not only are they easier to fasten but they're great for jobs where buttons aren't allowed like when you're working with
specific Machinery where loose items can't be risked uh available now at lmg Dogg long Polo and that link goes to the Forum uh that may be misdirected uh Daniel besser is looking at it right now because I think he probably saw me click on it and saw me go to lineus tips.com uh yep that link is not working so I'm just going to manually show you guys the long sleeve polo oh my goodness this is such a hilarious shot of Dennis um they've definitely been having some fun with the photo shoots lately massive
shout out to team this sick this is great actually looks dope oh man I love it ta and shro uh yeah I love the post ones yeah I I actually am kind of I'm kind of loving it yeah like these look great yeah dude groups of people posed in in in things the office attire has actually been a shockingly big mover for us just like something can wear to work yeah that's just is there even a logo in this oh yeah very subtle yeah here I can switch to the loot cam if you can show the people the
logo oh yeah it's in there somewhere yeah we want to you know we want to we want people to be able to rep the brand without like feeling uncomfortable if or if they workplace doesn't allow logos or whatever else um yeah it's just just quality product trust me row guarantee all that good stuff uh the cargo pants have been doing really well by the way I have some good news if you're a 32in inseam I believe our reorder will include 32in yes uh inseam so we are we are currently putting together uh a list
for a reorder and uh longer boys are going to be pretty exciting to see that I think that's that's mine I think you mentioned you were too 32 32 32 maybe maybe 32 36 I cannot remember but 32 inseam 32 inse all right so you guys are in good shape Robo 86 asks how much do you pay your staff for modeling uh we actually don't it's completely voluntary it's on it's during your shift oh yeah so we do pay so you get yeah you're hourly yep and it's and it's completely voluntary if people want
to do it then that's totally cool so everyone whoever posed like in their underwear did so because they were like I'm going to pose on my underwear let's go um oh you usually or often or always I forget the exact rules I think you get to keep the thing that you modeled as well so yeah it's just if you feel like it and you want to you want to like rep the brand and you want to be on the site then you can do that or otherwise you don't have to there is absolutely no pressure whatsoever to model the merge
yeah and I just I think it's so cool that people volunteer I think it's so cool that the models on our site are actual people who actually work on actual stuff here uh so like Thomas works for a Creator Warehouse um in in engineering he's working on a cat toy right now oh among other things that I can't talk about but the cat toy is like a low pryo thing that he's working on uh yeah shro from the business team Tatiana from the creat warehouse fashion team like these these
people these are the people who actually you know bring you the content I love that when I clicked him he was actually they were like making eye contact you got you got to look at yourself oh boy yeah so I think that really I think that really sets our I think that really sets our site apart from a lot of other like merch stores we wear the product and clearly people want it enough that they're they're willing to you know they're willing to pose with it for just to own it so Ione said can you stand up to to
it what size are you wearing XL Exel  medium all right you're welcome all right uh what what are we supposed to do Dan oh you still got some announcements unless you want to save them for I have more announcements oh good modmat signups we are another week closer to the launch of the LTT modmat to get notified right when it launches sign up at lm. g/m modmat I really hope that actually goes where it's supposed to go does this one does cool that's good also okay this is
big um want to shout out ghost keyboards last week I kind of gave them a hard time for publicly misrepresenting um an endorsement from me of their product because that never happened but they made it seem like it did an e blast to their customers anyway I don't want to I don't want on that right now because they have in my opinion done everything that is that is that is right and reasonable for them to do to make it right um they publicly posted what feels like an actual sincere
apology U taking responsibility for misrepresenting the situation taking action to make this right for anyone who bought the keyboard based on a perceived endorsement from me they have offered an extended refund window to anyone who purchased the keyboard in question um during the time that they had that promotion running uh so guys apology accepted thank you very much I am I am extremely pleased that we can just move forward in a in a positive fashion so yeah yeah thank you Top Gear 1224 other
companies take note this this is how you deal with it we messed up we take responsibility here's what we're doing to make amends we are going to learn from our mistakes sincerely boom thank you um yeah you guys you guys you guys made it right and I appreciate that I you know I don't think you should have done that in the first place but look the past has to be in the past at some point and that point is now all right Dan what's next all right I got one more merch message for you and
we're some doing some more topics when. dll lonus you're a big fan of the Apple airpods even though you use an Android would you recommend it to other people what are the biggest issues you've had that I need to know before doing the same is this the announcement but do I use an Android though this is my new phone is this the first time you've told them um no no I've I've talked about how I'm going to go iPhone I actually haven't set it up yet I tried earlier this week and it
errored out because I moved around in the office and I think I went to I think I swapped to a different AP and so the transfer errored out and I had to reset it again so I'm I'm going to I'm going to get switched to it very very very soon it's it's living in the pocket it's going to happen when I have a free moment I'll I'll get the transfer wizard done um but uh overall there's there's some annoyances like the fact that there's no official app to change the functionality of the long press that's kind of
annoying I don't know if it's just because my phone is really old but the uh the performance of the airpods when they're paired to an iPhone is so much better compared to when they're paired to my note 9 like on my Note 9 if I flip on the microwave to pop some popcorn or whatever I I basically can't hear anything if I'm standing anywhere near it because of the 2.4 GHz interference from microwaves um but if I have it paired to my iPhone 12 Pro which was my like utility iPhone that I had that I
will occasionally have them paired to it's like almost flaw it's not Flawless because interference but it's way better like world's better um you know not having battery monitoring I guess is kind of a drag but I just charge them every day I've been using like I just don't really care airpods with Android the whole time and I don't know yeah just plug them in yeah it just yeah it just really doesn't doesn't bother me that much I rarely need them for more than four hours in a row at a time so
the actual you know battery life of the airpods themselves and they charge so fast when they're in the charging case it just I don't know and they charge in the charging case so just plug the charging case in most of the quality of life issues really don't seem like a huge deal there is one really nice thing uh when you're when you're on an iPhone and you take them out it'll pause you take one out it'll pause you take two out and it'll just automatically switch to the phone speaker because it knows
you don't have either of them in whereas on my Android phone it's a Lot F it'll just play through them then again just playing through them on my Android phone is how I found them when I left them somewhere in the house I turned the volume up and then I was able to find them but then again if I had an iPhone I could just use the find my feature so I don't know I don't know it's all good I I like them I I still I I I really like them but there are some really solid Alternatives so you know by all
means check out pixel buds check out Galaxy buds um I've heard the latest generation Galaxy buds are really good  them CompTIA revoked Linus's A+  mark um how could they no they didn't what yeah so I think they Ty I think  internet here's my uh here's my here's my A+ certification so I'm going to here if I read this out can you verify uh sure what what link do I have to is it in the doc okay my candidate ID is comp are you am I supposed to be doing it are you are you doing okay Luke you okay
Luke are you okay over there okay I got it okay I thought you wanted me to actually type it in comp 001 yeah 022 y 462 766 oh wait they totally entered it right yeah okay I'm confused now did they revoke it then cuz I thought chewy said that wait you didn't check well no chewy said chewy told me they didn't and he said that he replied to the thing that they didn't and then that but that it wasn't getting a lot of traction and so I was supposed to talk about it on the W
show uh yeah the verification code oh oh hold on apparently apparently this is the verification code okay well uh verify. comptia.org hold on hold on here we go uh verification code all right SLO they missed a letter yeah active there you go so no no they did not um apparently the the US okay so I gave you the candidate ID so what what what code is this five pie oh oh it's the code at the bottom here yeah yeah I see it not the candidate ID so yeah no here's my here's my framed A+ that I still have
for now um look at you dude yeah I know right people can trust the videos now yep yep it's good we needed this my Bros they can trust me yeah yeah yeah all right yep well is my product that showed up defective going to be taken care of I I think so he's got an A+ certification yeah A+ A+ that's the that's the grade yeah it's like a but better sounds like you should probably trust him bro it's Canadian it's it's enhanced Canadian A+ sorry uh we should maybe do something else now C++ is just hey
look Amazon's doing dark patterns again Legacy customers with Amazon's ring alarm system will soon have to pay double for its monitoring service according to emails sent to ring protect plus customers they will be migrated to the Pro Plan in March which costs $200 a year as opposed to $100 a year that's increase that's double the number of hundreds of dollars a year that's yeah that's bad yes one of those customers happens to be Verge writer Sean Hollister who found it strange that
Amazon's email started with this is your reminder is it's the first time yeah he did manage to find an FAQ that claimed that customers had been emailed about the change in September of 2021 but he then dug up the relevant email whose subject line read important your plan name has changed in the body of the email it read don't worry everything else is staying paying the same the actual notification that the plan itself would be phased out and migrated to ring protect Pro was
located in a small footnote at the  email that is skey you know if they if they got the upgrade for free then sure other ring users have posted emails from Amazon on Reddit which have the heading new name new features same great price these emails then go on to note that their subscription will no longer include alarm professional monitoring and SOS emergency response Amazon has not given a reason for the price increase this is flipping wild here's some screenshots this does not sound like a
price increase here's a here's a question for you here's a question is   apparently that's a throwback to our first topic for those of you who are just joining us yeah that's a massive yikes this sucks I by the way what is happening down there that's the deand spot I I I don't know what it is okay I I don't know how to deal with this because we've talked about this fairly recently actually where I basically said look a contract should be a contract and you shouldn't be able to unilaterally change
it and the response to that is well from a legal standpoint point the contract is auto renewing on a monthly basis and every month it's a new contract so they're just they're just giving their customers a new contract the the problem with that logic though is that in my mind there's an implicit um there's an implicit long-term expectation for anything with an upfront cost that we are that we are not in fact on a month-to-month deal here where you can change it anytime you want
and for something like a security system that upfront cost is a lot more than just you know a few hundred on on a camera here and there it could be creating a workflow around it it could be training people on how to use it it could be the time that you invest in installing it once you're once you're in this ecosystem it's actually a hugely highly frictitious High friction the point is that it can be a lot of work to get out of it and so if all you have is this you know month-to-month agreement
that can just be changed unilaterally by the provider at any time what is your protection what is the point of having a contract and I don't know how to deal with this because yeah you can't you can't force you can't force a company to maintain the same terms of service in the same pricing model in perpetuity that's not fair or right either but you also can't be in a situation where freaking everything is like negotiating with Darth Vader I have altered the deal pray I
don't alter it further well why but I'm but I'm stuck in this deal yeah I'm Lando what what if it what if uh I think we've had these conversations before but what if what if you were offered a full refund at that moment like hey the subscription cost is doubling we're we're going to actually tell you properly instead of trying to hide it to be clear let's make that major change uh and then offer you a refund because I understand the the initial buying thing is is rough but I
can also understand where like you know market conditions might change they might need to charge more for the upkeep and maintenance of something but if that's the case do they just offer to essentially buy back your product I think I I think if they buy back the product I'm okay yeah I mean Google did that with Sadia I wasn't mad yeah like if you're if you if you can't afford if it's not if it's no longer sustainable for you to offer me the service that you offered me at the price that we that the
price that we all agreed on then by all means uh here you can you can take your take your stuff back and and I'll I'll take my money back you can you can say as much as you want about how like they oh well they should have scoped it in better and like understood their costs and stuff like that um and that's all farewell and good when you're talking about things without doing things uh but when you start doing things you run into this problem where basically every company if they want to be competitive
have to operate on economies of scale so when you're developing something you have to assume some amount of scale and price into that and if you don't reach that scale it might not be economically viable anymore but at that point like it's not your customer's fault that it isn't economically viable yeah that's not their problem so you got to buy back your devices squirrel King makes a really great Point here like let's pretend that an employment contract worked like this would you accept that
would you accept an employment contract that was essentially a month-to-month contract that they could just change at any time I guess employment contracts don't but contract contracts sort of do depending on the terms usually they Max at a year and then you have to renegotiate they can but that's more that's a little more complicated because a lot of the time a contractor can also make the argument that if they're fulfilling the role of an employee that they that they should be considered an
employee and protections should be employee grade protections as opposed to just contract Pro protections yeah like there's no I don't think people would accept that and so if we don't accept that you know that we could just be paid less if our employer decides arbitrarily this month that we'll be paid less well then yeah obviously I I agree with that to be clear but it's um I'm just I'm trying to think of scenarios where that does happen and I guess it happens on a company level but I don't think it
normally happens on an individual level like if we if we have a a some form of work contract with some company it's very likely that it might be a a shorter term renewing contract yeah yeah would probably would but that's company to company that's not person to company or person to person I think usually person to person there's more protections yeah and I'm talking about like consumer consumer protections like protections for the individual it just feels like ignored
them for so long yeah and I I'm tired of it Lena KH dude she's doing work it's been getting a little bit better all right what else we got anyway Amazon bad stop it yeah yeah oh sponsors thanks Dan the show is brought to today by manscaped Can you spot me in this photo nice that's what you'll look like if you don't tidy yourself up with manscaped they just dropped the new chairman pro package and it has everything you need to transform yourself from Sasquatch to Sphinx inside you'll find the chairman

by one password imagine your company's security like the backyard of my house huh that's a really an interesting shot that they chose weird shot um you've got some real distance going on there the nice paved paths are laid out for company-owned devices it approved apps and managed employee identities so only the approved ones can enter my house but the shortcuts through the grass symbolize unmanaged devices Shadow it apps and trespassers like Dennis most security tools only
operate on the brick paths but ignore what lurks in the long grass this is such a weird um thing that he's done uh that's where our sponsor one password extended access management comes in it helps weed out unmanaged devices apps and identities ensuring strong and protected user credentials they address issues that traditional I am and MDM can't handle it's available now for companies with okta and coming later this year to Google workspace and Microsoft  slwo cool huh all right okay it's merge message time
apparently yeah hit me Dan LDL hoping you can settle an argument I've been saying for the more yes I've been saying for the non gamer Intel and AMD waited too long to release HT chips and apple now dominates that space with the Mac  no all right next question um well I think should we say a little bit more about it uh get wrecked okay so okay okay I think I think the the bigger the bigger thing that happened to the HDT Market is that the high-end consumer chips kind of took
their place I mean you can get a ryzen 950x which has 16 flipping cores they're they're ripping fast they's zen5 um and you can put that on a commodity am5 motherboard um I believe some of them even support ECC memory even if it's unofficial uh does ryzen 9000 still support ECC I actually did not look into that I'm going to have a look yes they all support ECC memory with the caveat that it requires motherboard support is "that different than the 7,000 Series" yeah okay so it seems to seems to still
be a thing the point is that if you want a if you want like a a random um like affordable workstation you don't have to go to high-end desktop and the only real reason to go thread Ripper Pro to go to go for a true high-end desktop oh right then on the Intel side you've got like their 24 core chips at the high end of their consumer models um so the only real reason to go high-end desktop would be if you need like Mondo memory bandwidth which admittedly the Mac Studio is going to do
a great job of especially if your workload benefits from sharing that memory between the CPU and GPU um or if you need a whole bunch of pcie expansion which the Mac Studio doesn't address at all so I I I don't think the Mac Studio is really up against HGT at all I think it's up against high-end consumer and high-end consumer is anything but dead that's not dead at all um with that said I I think that Apple has kind of killed their own workstation Market a little bit I I was actually I
was thinking of pitching this to Horst as a as a MAC address video like I think the biggest damage Apple has probably done to their to their M silicon lineup is by making the M1 series too good I have not talk to a single person running a first gen M series Mac who's like yeah I really need something newer and I'm sure there's people who are like like hardcore into like music production how old are the1 Max at this point sorry they're like four or five years old now hardcore into music production or who
does a lot of you rendering work or whatever else who who legitimately like needs a better one but in terms of general consumers which let's face it there's a lot of Apple's customers even though they put pro at the end of everything M1 series is like yeah dwin Len says yeah I'm still on M1 and it's great uh yeah 2020 apparently it was 2020 yeah my M1 Max Max studio is still kicking but J5 says M1 [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] um yeah dude there's just there's Apple keeps kind of coming out and being like yeah
we've got new M silicon and and it's really great and if I was buying a new Mac because I like didn't have one I would I'd get the new one or whatever I think I think that type of life cycle is just becoming a thing for all computers now I think that's fair you know I realized the other day my dad who still plays you know not necessarily the most demanding games but he plays the any game that he wants y that comes out new whatever Sandy  wow the point where I never realized it
point where you're a bad son it was never a problem you know which one it is too it's the one you gave him for doing the whole room uh water cooling p no way yeah that's kind of sick yeah cuz I was like wait what like why would you even have that and then I looked in his computer I was like H if Rob needs an upgrade with by the way I have literally given him one he just hasn't built the computer yet never mind okay because he wants to do this like uh I I haven't had the heart to
really tell him that tinan already did it but he wants to do a like hard copper piped cooled system and he's like designing it all and all this kind of stuff oh that's cool with one of the actually one of the members of the community that was uh one of the whales at wh land that's he's designing it with him and it's going to be this like sick thing so he hasn't bothered to upgrade his platform and stuff yet because the gam that he plays doesn't really need it anyways um and because he he's waiting
to do like an epic build yeah yeah I mean all copper builds have been done many times I don't think I don't think it matters that it's he's got like this I don't want to spoil it but he's got this like specific design element that he wants to tie in which is like genuinely really cool so cool Luke's dad AMD ultimate Tech upgrade that would be kind of sick I mean look I can't I can't preferentially you know make sure he gets one but I I think I think if you I think if you
threw him in the thing I mean he's he's he's done some stuff for us behind the scenes yeah I don't know I don't know you know what I don't want to I I'm not in charge of that yeah to we see if the if the rul makers are cool with clear it with the powers that be clear it with the powers that be I'm fine with it though that's what I'll say I'll say that hey Luke Dan and lonus was there a point in the business where you ever questioned where you wouldn't be able to keep promises that you had made to
anyone inside or outside the company that's a hilarious question remember the whole trust me bro backpack warranty controversy yeah yeah that was like that was a big part of it that's what it's based around that's that's the whole that's the whole thing where I was like okay we should we should really thoughtfully craft something that will be enduring and that will capture the spirit of you know what what I would do if I was still around uh but also not be um you know an an albatross hanging
around the neck of someone that might you know inherit or purchase the company or whatever else um and it turns out that what people actually wanted was just a generic sh like warranty statement that basically just allows us to weasel out of anything and we gave them that and they were happy with it and I was like okay bye um oh wait I'm not allowed to say that um okay bye everybody pushing the button crap um no I I think as well like these days I mean we have we have proven uh that the company has a
lot of resiliency these days y um but in the really early days I think we were all somewhat doing that to each other just being like no we're we're fine it'll be okay we're fine this uh this new debt or big risk that we've taken or whatever is fine and then you know a few years in it ended up being true but I think at the beginning we were all somewhat you know if you reassure each other enough times you're kind of reassuring yourself yeah I mean there were definitely times in the first six months
that you know I told Luke and Ed okay we got this let's go let's go let's go and I wasn't 100% sure if we had this but I was sure as heck going to do my best that might been some puffery yeah yeah exactly yeah um back to the um uh back to the the the backpack thing for a second um my point my point was always just that the will of the company to honor the warranty is everything and the exact terms are sort of immaterial and I think that we've seen this time and time again since I said that
um so now you guys have a written warranty statement but if you carefully read it it's basically at our discretion if we do anything and if you read anyone else's warranty it's the same it's basically at their discretion because a warranty exists as legal liability butt covering that's why that's why it's written it's not for you it's there for the company it's not there for you yeah and uh there's a lot of things that are true that way and if pay more attention I I don't know
what else to say I get shot as a  yeah I don't know whatever um but yeah just like stop stop assuming like yeah I  comp companies aren't here to make you happy that's a hopefully intended byproduct of them making money uh Mr blonde 42 says a limited warranty limits the customers rights not the companies yeah um and and uh what's actually really interesting is we did a video recently I don't know if we've actually uploaded it yet or if I've or if I've watched it you guys haven't seen it yet
uh oh no I I think you guys have seen this one where there's this memory uh it's it's the buying the worst products the worst products one uh the memory comes with a limited lifetime warranty and then if you actually dig into the warranty which is not available anywhere on their site but Tom's Hardware asked them for it when they covered the the brand I forget what the brand is but it's it's in that video uh within the first year you get a brand new replacement after the first year for the
next two years you get a refer replacement and then after that they charge you to fix it my my favorite so if you told me you have a lifetime warranty but after a couple of years it basically meant give me that water bottle oh it's broken okay that'll be $25 for a new water bottle is that is that a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] warranty my my favorite but technically legally it is it's a warranty yeah my favorite limited lifetime warranties are when they're limited lifetime warranties only on
manufactur defects yeah so it's like if you don't notice a manufactured defect for 40 years we'll cover it but it's like what do you even mean yeah that's I don't know like dude the warranty for the backpack is like yeah it doesn't cover wear and tear so literally it's a lifetime warranty on that when it you first got it it's good so if you never removed it out of the box and you kept the Box in a yeah temperature and environmentally controlled chamber and then opened it in 20 years maybe you
know and there was a a defect with it or something people had no idea what they were asking me for yeah and you know what I handled it poorly oh yeah let's go poor handling yeah yeah like yeah I I did not explain it well and realistically we should have just dug your heels in we should have just given them a warranty we should have just we should have just had the stupid meaningless piece of paper for you both you should have given the warranty first and then been like by the way it doesn't
matter what matters is this other stuff we probably should have a lot of things um you know at that time at that time I think the CW team was like seven people or something like that maybe even less and we didn't have we we literally still don't we still don't have a lawyer on staff no right like we we didn't have a ton of experience doing we wouldn't have enough work for them but it does suck sometimes oh I know 100% I just mean like I'm I'm at it going like it it just it just wasn't a priority because we
knew that if there was a problem we were going to take care of it and I get it you know you guys wanted Assurance it's just that what we gave you wasn't Assurance the only assurance we gave you was our word and also this worthless piece of paper um Allon I don't know if this is true or not but Allon in flan chat says lifetime is the expected lifetime of the product as defined by the manufacture not the lifetime of the true fire I didn't even know that yeah no the whole thing is just complete nonsense worse 
and yeah I don't know but and to be clear some companies are really good about it y like they will honor stuff well beyond what is what is actually re usually it's companies honoring things beyond the warranty it's not yeah or they have like an agreement which isn't technically a warranty yeah NE exist says it's a lifetime warranty when it wears out or is broken the lifetime is up so the warranty has run out genius yeah I love it um anyway we got you oh interesting Ben Mitchell said lifetime fluids in cars
equals a warranty period a BMW lifetime "fluid in a gearbox is 50,000" mil wow yeah the wording of things is so  yeah oh man that's hilarious um all right hit us Dan sure I got one more hey guys was wondering what are your thoughts on continuous returns buy a laptop at Costco play for 90 days return get brand new one is that bad ew wise I'm pretty sure it's fraud it's called friendly fraud or retail fraud um so have fun with that pay your taxes or don't what do you guys think about not
paying your taxes ever if I never pay them they can't find me they won't know I exist free free housing Speed Run don't be surprised if you eventually do get um put on a on a on a persona non grata list uh you you may not be welcome to shop at Costco forever if you do that look I am not going to lie to you I have taken advantage of generous return policies before I shouldn't have um that was bad I it actually I actually remembered recently uh probably the most egregious example of this
um we woo we woo we woo yeah it's it's it's it's bad it's really bad the most egregious example of this was actually when I was working at NCIX and I bought oh I know this one three TVs from Best Buy so that I could make a video about a triple TV setup and then I returned them um yeah that's not great I got to admit I didn't properly think about the implications like I didn't I didn't think about that these were these were basically going to be sold at a at a loss like I didn't look
at their open box pricing I was just like I need three TVs now um do we have to keep these yeah I don't need them anymore uh I I kept they're in perfect shape I put them back all nice like is this really that much of a problem that was really bad I really shouldn't have done that um uh CH 5609 says don't people do this with clothes a lot I've actually heard that that's a trend that is skyrocketing right now I I forget what it's called there's like a term for it is it called
labeling or something buying clothes and returning Trend uh wardrobing um the yeah the the term wardrobing may not be common yet but the trend is this is from times of times of India um so yeah Shoppers are buying clothes just for the Instagram pick hiding the labels in the shot and then returning them and apparently like high-end boutiques are dealing with a ton of this right now that's super cool dude that's awesome um nice yeah so it's a it's a whole it's a whole thing and
have I have I done this yes do I feel bad about it uh yes should I do that again no no I should not um I think that I think that for for my part um unless I have a strong intent to own the product like I I'll return things if I'm not happy with them if they don't meet my expectations but if I buy something it's because I have a strong intent to own it um I'm sorry Best Buy I've barely ever returned anything I don't buy very many things which is is probably the uh the root of that cause
well you and I have both taken advantage of extended warranties I know that oh yeah let's  one given the predatory nature of them I think I could probably rationalize myself into an I don't feel that bad about it space yeah however it's not technically okay what I will say is I probably took it pretty far oh yeah so but you know that's that yep you just you decide what you're okay with move on and that also happened at a time when I really didn't have any money which doesn't make it okay either but also and
I'm sorry but also that whole extended warranty thing at particularly the shop that it happened at Future Shop was pretty skey and pretty pushy and pretty exploitative um it was realistically only through taking advantage of loopholes that you could ever really benefit from it yes and so I found those loopholes yeah and benefit from them I  that sure how did we end up on this topic that was a uh that was a that was a merch message I don't know what it was but yeah it was all right cool um um uh two three 
me California tries to keep big Tech out of your brain but does it go far enough California became the second oh it's gone California became the second US state to officially protect neural data in state law after Colorado uh the bill amends the California consumer Privacy Act of 2018 and as such prevents companies from selling or sharing a person's neural data it also requires companies to make efforts to anonymize the okay make efforts to anonymize also known as eh why not um and gives
consumers the right to know what information is collected and the right to delete that information however some mental privacy Advocates don't feel the law goes far enough in how it defines neural data while this law protects the raw data from your brain and nerves it's not clear whether the law covers in uh in inferences and conclusions made from that data oh information that is arguably more sensitive yeah oh good lord sorry I'm reading ahead this is oh man for example MIT technology review points out
that that research has used EEG data a measure of the brain's electrical activity to predict volunteers sexual orientation or whether they use recreational drugs conclusions like this may not be covered although what is interesting is that if you you were ever not sure if like being gay is real because I don't know you live in the Stone Age or something like that brain waves here you go cool you're welcome privacy Advocates privacy Advocates have also argued for broadening the definition of
neural data to include to include physiological and behavioral data since brain activity isn't the only indicator of how you're feeling heart rate can indicate excitement or stress and eye tracking can indicate uh what choice you're likely to make interesting oh man yeah ey tracking if it indicates what choice you're likely to make and then if they figure out that you're choosing the one that they don't want you to choose they could do like a flash sale right before your eyes to get
you to get the one that they want you to buy well that sucks that's terrible um I'm happy they're moving on this but I like I mean even like it's not going to be enough there's going to be loopholes we're just we're boned even even at the front right like we're boned dude we're requiring companies to make efforts to anonymize the data that means they're going to the absolute minimum as required by law and try to hide it as much as possible that  it cerin says we already know Free Will
isn't an actual thing you could very much predict a lot of stuff  no Corey is the name says the proletariat will rise up and eat the rich before this all gets too far out of hand just wait I don't know if they can what what's uh what's uh oh man who did that uh who did that good video on um authoritarianism uh keys of power blah blah blah blah blah who was it cgp gray the rules for ERS you should watch this because the thing is when you when you have the tools of mass surveillance and you have
tools of mass uh oppression uh you don't actually need a lot of people that you take care of really well to um maintain power to maintain power over a great many people who you are exploiting and it's it's pretty it's pretty scary uh it's it's an older video but it is definitely worth having a look at the rules for rulers from cgp gray cgp gray hasn't had any like controversies or anything has he who knows okay well I I just mean okay I I hope not too hard I just I don't know who I'm promoting yeah
they just got to audien has got to get over that yeah it's too much I would be so sad if he ever did yeah I I I I I have seen his face oh my yeah which I don't know if it's interesting anymore because yeah he might have he might have done a face reveal I I have no idea I haven't paid attention lately um I would also just like you guys to remember that I I advocated for you don't eat me yeah would you eat me I don't think yeah sure really no like are we talking if I was dead already or you would
actually participate in the murder first well I'm not I'm not going to like what which scenario are we looking at not going to Cesar you  um but if someone else seasoned me Caesar Caesar I meant oh okay Caesar okay all right I'm just I'm just some Franks on when you start when you start I would put Franks on yeah um Lucas and Brutus no um and you Lucas no but when you're when you're running your cult Town yeah okay you'd have to be careful to not get Caesar right oh that makes
sense yeah okay I'm not going to be running a cult Town we've talked about this that's that's your dream not my  LOM oh man um crystal says I'm not a billionaire so I'm not rich enough for that and I am not I want to make that very clear by any measurement of my assets I am where is the line is the line billionaire I had this conversation with David I know like ages ago I forget I forget where the line is and it's um it's after hours so I'm not going to bother him about it see see I'm one of
the nice ones please don't eat me like I'd call Nick like yeah whatever Nick Nick Nick's in management whatever yeah but people are saying most people are saying billionaire it looks oh Canadian or American that's a huge difference oh I nowhere near either like it's not even oh no I'm saying where the line is Oh we got to talk in US dollars US dollars is the global measure measure of wealth yeah so well without without looking at the answers okay so where's your line let's bring Dan into this to to to like
the Eat the Rich line the eat the where's the Eat the Rich line I mean there's a couple schools of thought because there's okay we have an expert thank you Dan yes I mean cuz you've got like a lot of people talk about the middle class yeah and the the lower class and the upper class but there's only working class and like the ownership class right middle class is kind of a design to uh split the people right against the the uh the uppers of society mhm technically lonus would be one of those
people already because he employs people and owns a factory but he does also work yeah but I don't have to though you I think that's an important line I don't I don't have to realistically anymore yeah exactly does lonus deserve to be guillotined well hold on a second let me just jump in and correct you it's guillotined that's probably not going to win me now he did that yes all right I'll go get the one in my car I've been waiting for this uh yeah I don't know it's it's a little difficult
right where where is the line of like Bezos to Linus uh literature would tell us that the there is no line right interesting but I can tell you that the difference between my lifestyle the difference between my life style and my wealth and bezos's it's extremely dramatic absolutely incomparable colossal buddy literally wanted them to deconstruct a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Bridge so that he could get his boat out of the shipyard like this is like this a historical bridge I like my everyone has a price I
like my boat I would like I need to get my shirts out my boat needs to be in slightly different water yeah it's I don't know I don't know I'm sure there's a line shirts out well cuz you have the $400 shirts and you need them in your Villa in in the south of France this is a great this is a great post from imperor the difference between billion and $1 million is approximately $1 billion what if you had 800 million or 500 million or 100 million I okay I don't I don't know this is I I feel
unqualified to weigh in on this I just I'm just kind of kind of sitting here lonus has money right and I think lonus we've talked about this after a few times now right lonus is he's got money but there's ALS there's also but he doesn't have like a lot of money there's also an interesting question because like there the the valuation of the company was something that was brought up a little while ago so we said publicly what the offer was but this is one of those as much as we've tried to
rage against this um we are one of those inverted pyramid YouTube companies where  we're in trouble like the machine ising like Amazon will be okay it might have a pretty flat bottom of the pyramid right inverted pyramid but it's still an inverted pyramid so and we're trying and we're trying we're trying to make that better but it is hard yeah um what we do it's it's not necessarily about that I think right I think it is though because that is not cash that he has that is an
asset that he owns Which is the we take out the equation I think he's just an example in this right take me out of the equation I don't like the direction this is going well pull him into pieces right um like lonus has money right those machines are in Diablo yeah exactly but he doesn't have like extreme levels of wealth intergeneration saying is too is if he stops working also known as leaves the company the value of the thing that he owns goes down significantly but again it's not about necessarily Linus
in particular when we're when we're talking about this line right say lonus just owned the factory that is lmg right sure right he could dissolve it that would be fine he could take the money from the buyout which would be what nine figures or something like that yeah but the buyout required him to stay so he's still working it did require me to stay for a period of two years again you're still using him as the example you had a $100 million right yeah and wasn't working or just owned
the company and did other things like is is that where the line is this is why million because what I'm saying is he doesn't have $100 million I don't cuz he didn't accept the bio mhm and but I own an asset that's worth that but the asset is worth less if I'm not working yeah so it's complicated yeah okay but my question let's get off the subject of me for a minute that's what that's what I'm trying to do no my my question is where would the line be if we weren't talking about me that's what
I'm trying to do does it come down to what you what you do day today is it your lifestyle or is it your wealth like your net worth or is it your cash because you could have a very frugal lifestyle but you could have a ton of cash in the bank and just choose to live like a normal person you could have an extravagant lifestyle but actually have no real assets you're just you're living check to check but you have a huge income you could have huge wealth huge net worth but actually all of it is ilid
uh un liquid illiquid whatever it's not liquid right it's it's it's tied up it's it's in companies that um that are private companies so you can't just like trade the stock on the open market or anything like that so you so in that category you could live a very extravagant lifestyle or you could not live a very extravagant lifestyle or you could live somewhere in between like what are we measuring here I don't know I think I think it depends on too yeah your disregard for
human life which is an impossible thing to measure but I do agree um which is part of the problem because like if you if you own a bunch of businesses but aren't raking disgusting ruin the world level profit margins like a lot of businesses do um and you're employing a bunch of people in jobs that are paying them well and stuff like that if you have a bunch of wealth because you technically own all these businesses I don't think you should just be guillotined I think that that kind of
depends on the person right because technically you would be of the ownership class and therefore subject to um head separation right okay but does it okay so then tell me this on the subject of head separation then does it come down to what your answer to the trolley problem would be would you you own the company that produces the trolleys are you the train company if so head separated if if you are employed by the train company to drive the train over people then you don't get guilty
but does that mean that the person pulling the lever who doesn't own anything regardless of decision is cool I don't know if you had four billionaires on one side and one billionaire on one side like how can I drift across both tracks you know oh man it's deja vu de V I've seen that done a lot um yeah I don't I don't know I don't know where is the line if it's just monetary wealth like lus said it depends how you use it if you just have a lot of wealth uh and are nice like uh okay Bill Gates okay Bill Gates
versus Jeff Bezos um so I could talk a fair bit about how Dro them both um Bill Gates has done a lot of um what if I just owned all the Farmland happened then what about the guy that bought the onion futures for the entire us for like ever and then had to get rules made about him what if You' have just so much money you can just be like I own all the vegetables yeah which happened Gates has yet to provide a really solid defense for why he owns So such a large proportion of of the
agricultural land in the United States of America what if I controlled all of their food um what if I was the one that got to decide if you eat or not yeah I uh that's what he's doing I I don't know that I would draw a distinction between those two particular I don't at all what if it's living outside of your means like uh if you have two houses Guillotine living outside of your means though if anything I think that could you could make the argument that they're a victim of a society that has no hold
on I'm going somewhere with this okay that all right let's go I'm into this no no no of a society that has they're pulling the Rope back that has made they're getting ready what if they are a victim of a society that has set unrealistic expectations for what kind of Lifestyle they have to uphold in order to in order to you know be one of the cool kids if that's you know meaningful to them what if they uh what if they're a victim of of the the kind of lending borrowing culture that we
have and they and they were you know they felt pressured in order to keep up to to borrow money in order to sort of you know build build that is that the way you're trying to use live outside your means not necessarily I think more like uh being inside of a societal place like everybody has enough like eventually you have enough right um one of the one of the arguments that I wanted to make was like okay you make you have more than $200 million just 100% tax you can't have more than $200
million but then thinking about somebody like Bezos who actually has no money because he just has giant loans and then he borrows against those loans so he's in debt forever right he uses his massive stock wealth which isn't really anything to basically be in you know hundreds of million dollars of debt like lonus probably has more money than Bezos probably maybe probably not but you kind of get the the comp probably got more liquid cash just in case he like I don't know feels like doing anything in case
he needs like a goldplated paperly I just I just have a bunch of gold bars in my basement that sort of thing right I wonder how many seconds it would take it's already it's already that many yeah yeah if you have two houses if you own 400 acres of land if you you know have 75 cars you know okay what if what if you have 400 acres of land and it's all Agriculture and and you're you're growing props for people and you're not necessarily making but if you're not gouging yeah then are you a I
think a lot of it to me is is the gouging how how how are you actively using your immense wealth to make life terrible for other people and I think just hoarding wealth and doing nothing with it is a form of actively using it to make other people's lives okay tell me this I mean it's no secret that the Badminton Center um based on the list price is worth anywhere between about 20 to let's see what would the math be 20 to 23 million okay that's not a secret that you can look that up um that I
clearly own a Badminton Center because I made a video about it and this building and this building and the other building and the labs building and the other building and creat a warehouse building and your house and my house you forgot my old house where my in-laws live okay I didn't know that was public well whatever it is now apparently it is I think you have talked  okay Guillotine do we do we make a a fancy one do we get debrand to skin it LTT store we could live stream it the
end of the end of the streak they are official they're our official skin partner oh oh jeez am I doing anything that makes someone's life actively worse that's that's where a lot of it comes down to me in real estate I you invest in business real estate I always respect that about you as you're not buying up houses but I do I I but okay so if I if I own two houses but I literally give one of them to a relative to live in am I evil I think landlords are evil uh landscape like real estate prospector
type people okay am I a landlord if I don't charge them or am I just a land you're like like land bro L bro we're putting your rent down this month I'm sorry I have to pay you now son yeah Lon I don't know I don't know it's it's I mean this is a thing that's been debated for a bazillion years in my opinion it completely comes down to the the yeah the oppression and neck stomping that happens um and if you're you know if you have your 400 Acres but you're doing it to grow crops that
you're selling at fair prices that are not crushing anyone could argue that just having that much capital in general is bad if it is impossible for anyone else to do farming because you own all the Farmland Bill Gates then yeah I agree that that's bad but there is a lot of land like if you have 400 acres in Canada and you're not really close to the American Border who cares yeah but what's stopping me with my vast amounts of wealth to just go to another country and buy up all of their stuff right but
but but you didn't so so is it the power then so back to what where what is where the line is is the line power this is where we go to the ownership class versus the working class right owners the powerg there's degrees of ownership class and so where is the power line right if money is not a problem how much control and power do you have right I think that should be the deciding fact poorly though this is now we're getting into the see I don't back onto the person the terms for what these
different uh political and philosophical arguments are but I'm going to call this the Superman discussion disc mhm because good dude tons of power mhm right so I think there is like I'm saying with this farmer 400 Acres but not competitive 400 Acres that's growing crops and selling them at fair prices that should fight him yeah well Batman should keep him in check you know so like I think I think I would want to pay attention to that guy but I it's fine people need crops Su
for AWS asks don't you still own the old house also as a landlord yes the only reason though the only reason the only reason is they asked me not to sell that's three houses they were going to they were going to buy it it's a lot of business property hold on they were going to they were going to buy it that's the whole company we said we want a lot of things okay give me a sec Pull the Rope we wanted to sell it because we weren't interested in in philosophically I am against spec of investment in
residential real estate I can verify that this all happened by the way we wanted to sell it the tenants asked us not to because they wanted to put together a plan to be the ones to buy it because they like the house they like the area and it isn't nice house I believe they even gave you a timeline yes they ultimately were not able to do that and asked to renew their lease was it because of your oppressive landlord pricing no okay we gave them uh we gave them I believe the same don't quote me
on this I believe we gave them the same or a very similar rate to expand to the rest of the house once you moved out of the basement and we have never increased  leave is there is there a two nice no no there's not is there a well this becomes the other argument too move out nobody has enough money to be nice to everybody therefore it is you're being mean right you you could just use your money to buy a swath of houses and then have everybody living them for free and it just like that wouldn't work either
now we're making the town yeah 400 Acres of forest in northern BC and then build a town and then have everything comes back to L you could even provide them clothing and like food and and you would know the clothing was made well by us I mean the hypothetical people who lived in the town you have my you have my personal commitment when they move out we're going to sell it I I do not I I believe we have we have a demand problem here for housing but we also have a supply problem and I don't
want to contribute to the supply problem um but I'm also so I'm also not into raising rents I believe I mean we talked about this earlier on the show to me a contract is a contract it's an agreement and unilaterally changing the agreement is pretty stupid what about things like here's here's a question like if if the if there's natural inflation and things like power Hydro do you pass power and hydro on I have no idea I'm not surprised um I I bet you you don't just cuz it would be like annoying the truth
is I actually just don't care about I think you're defending yourself and I don't think we need to cuz you're like a good one maybe uh we will'll find out eventually is it possible for there to be a good one though that's the question but where is the power I think there's got to be a limit where's the power line like lonus doesn't have enough money or enough power to be a concern right do I he could who knows I don't I don't know what I could do I've never really like I've never really thought about it I
think I think it becomes a problem when you have so much wealth that you can buy all of the onions in the US oh and like I can't you know do you know what I mean like you could destroy an economy like I can't buy politicians you can't buy politicians maybe I could I heard I heard pretty cheap I was say I think you actually could looking at some of the documentation that I've seen online I think you could probably buy a few um they don't this seems to be a relatively easy thing to do I think so they're
really not that expensive I'm not well read enough on the subjects to like give all of the arguments okay so hear me out uh please please do it please please please please we'll put the guillotina away this is this is a really cool building blade please it has a really flexible zoning this is sick it allows for recreation use Office use uh multi-unit residential use um the to it it has over 600 underground parking stalls this building is the this building is the size of a city block it
allows for uh mixed retail use so we could literally have like a store we could have like a like an LT tech tech shop um where you could come get your computer repaired dude get like you know that Tech Mall in Taiwan it is almost "250,000 square feet it is literally" larger than the entire real estate portfolio that I currently own if it's "256,000 ft that would just be sick the" only problem the only problem is that this is an Infamous building oh oh it was originally is it like haunted or
something here we go vacant since 1998 oh let's do it there's a really cool YouTube video ghost where they go into it from a few years back and this thing has fuing rocked Ed oh it would be a nightmare moving Vlogs for 4 years yeah pretty much um I'm going to get I'm going to get momia from putting all the the cat 16 in it yeah yeah here it is though it's right between Guildford and Siri Central City so it's like actually an amazing location allowed to just be abandoned this whole time wow I heard uh
I heard a story that like an American investor showed up at a previous cord ordered sale and bought it for like a song like a couple million dollars or something like that and then just sat on it and then sold it I think it sold a couple years ago again to someone who thought they could resurrect it there's another court ordered sale coming clearly clearly nobody can get this thing off ground you don't have a world class team be on the floor what if you uh have a whole stall for that could you like
section off half the building or honestly from the sounds of it 3/4 of the building I think that the city is and renovate part of it I think that the city is highly motivated to have this not just be an eyes sore on like one of the major arteries um however there would be serious like like safety and building code concerns around any effort to resurrect this [Laughter] thing I'm so sorry are you though the Reddit is really funny sometimes I used to I used to have problems with the Reddit the
Reddit has been hilarious for quite a while  funny no I need him to employ me yeah don't please um all right I don't know I have a weird opinion that I think a lot of the Eat the Rich stuff has been um like rage I don't know if we bleep that word out or not but I did anyways um he said porn yeah I guess we don't then I don't know sometimes we do I I think it cuz like the amount you hear people say like oh I'm going to whatever like it's either that or it's that whole thing where like
you say you're going to do something but then the second you say it you're no longer really going to do it so if you're going to really commit to things you should just do it without talking about it oh interesting apparently it is I'm I'm all about that now I so now he's not about it yeah yeah I'm just going to quit now CU I've already ACH yeah yeah cuz you get you get the like social credit thinking about it you get the social credit for saying you're going to do the thing right and then it's like you're
satisfied you get the you get the dopamine hit and then you're done yeah interesting yeah like a lot of times especially you should you should start and then form the habit and then you can tell people you should establish the habit first huh no I don't have a doomsday bunker my goal is to live in harmony with the people around me and not need one I hope but 600 car G 600 car garage doomsday bunker six videos if you did a doomday you know you can drive EVS in a  bunker oh man be pretty sick
um dude Bill Randall executive VP of the real estate company said he's been involved in the building for 20 years dating back to previous owners reached Friday he confirmed bansel as the current owner and list price of 63 million little Rich for my blood um the important thing here is you know how the B Center is like 99.8% done yeah well if you just abandon that project immediately and sell the whole building and then sell all your other  just I don't I still don't think we
could afford it and a bunch of debt who cares whatever well yeah cuz the actual cuz the the problem is not the $63 million like we could get we could get we could with our cash flow with our assets we could we could probably get loans we could we could probably buy it um because if if we were going to occupy it we would only need I think 10% down like we could put together $6.3 million we'll do another we'll do another lime sale lonus inventory management experience sale we'll raise a
couple Mill that way we'll like like we could we could probably scrape it together um the problem is how much we're going to spend in renovations and to my point earlier about like safety and building code you can't just be like in there working while you're renovating it you can't well okay you can get you can if you do like seals and stuff the plumbing is rotted out like it's bad it's real bad um and yeah yeah migor says home renovations are always on time and on budget so yeah we would literally have
we'd have sold all of our buildings we'd have nowhere to operate while we're like looking around going okay we're a bunch of like clothing designers and video production people and now we're renovating a building like it's just Co era work from home March 3025 I don't think we could afford to fix it that's the problem even if we could afford the building I don't think we could afford to fix it if we could work out a deal with the city um where where they would allow us
to to you know get a small part of it up to speed while we like Tech Rena it or something over a span of like you said like four years then I don't know it would probably take more than four years yeah probably yeah it's I years I was wrong about the size it's "275,000 ft it's even bigger so so this" this building we're in right now including all the mezzan spaces dude with the amount of parking spots you could you could have in with where it is and the amount of parking spots that
there is you could probably have an income stream just like renting out parking spots no no one would park there 600 isn't it right next to Guilford it's in between Guilford and Sur Central oh it's like in no man's land it's like if someone wanted to shop at the superstore and walk two blocks then they could park it except Superstore has their own parking so we got nothing you just got to make that the happen in place to be yeah dude this would be this would be by completely
abandoning your Badminton Center and rebuilding it from scratch this would be tens of millions of dollars if you're lucky and so this is the problem um in an eight page sales brochure posted online Colliers noted that the 2024 BC assessment value was more than 114 million the problem is that if you buy this thing at what did I say 63 million yeah if you buy this thing at 63 million and you spend $100 million renovating it you're underwater and I think that that is maybe not a 100 million but I do think
that it is not unrealistic for anyone who buys this to potentially spend that kind of money fixing it so you could end up like I I okay I I had a a somewhat I had a pretty not serious conversation with Ivonne that was like we should show up at the auction and offer like $2 million because if this thing is going to cost $100 million to renovate then maybe it is actually worth nothing um well at a certain point it's it's worth the knockdown value dude knock down land oh I I don't know if the city would even
allow you to do it though like you need a permit to knock down a building and I think they I think they the city wants this thing to be a thing um yeah this thing dude this this thing is freaking wild yeah in 2021 2021 there was a tour there was a tour of the building um here I'm going to wait till this I'm going to wait till this ad finishes is that a form of ad block is that okay is that fine by watching this by showing this to the stream by showing this to the stream but not having them
watch the ad did you just perform there's an ad for navigator was that whatever black press media is you all just all everyone watching just engage in p no yep no yep no it's right here there fine okay so here we go so here's the inside actually like looks pretty de oh yeah it's been vacant for more than two decades I bet it smells lovely but many fragran if if you kind of they they talk about it they talk about it in the video you kind of got to dig a Little Deeper to like like no this this is like
actually bad um developers envisioned an Asian showart surprisingly not like discolored that doesn't matter almost at all but yeah what are those I don't know dude buy it didn't you get those yeah free table yeah yeah that's huge dude dude the place is freaking enormous "275,000 Square" ft um just like things looks like here's a Ply wall thing did you say there was residential it's zoned for multi-unit residential so how much residential um I think less than 60% so it would still be
a very substantial potentially very substantial amount of of residential this could this could literally house the entire company this is what I'm and like every Endeavor the company does  like but no and like you don't you don't do necess NE AR company housing you just have it as an option that is cheaper to the point where like you'd be kind of dumb to not do it and then you don't do a necessary company store but you have a store on the premises that sells clothing and food and everything that
you need and then you can pay Linus bucks at the store and you earn Linus bucks for Good Conduct at work yeah we can use the AI tracking to make sure that people are on task and and behaving nice every 10 lines of code mhm you get five Linus bucks yeah and your weekly food ration yeah yeah I like this idea yeah is a good idea yeah sir Board of Trade says they should just tear it down that's what yeah so sorry uh CEO and president of the Siri Board of Trade that's the city uh
Siri all right well anyway um good luck everybody oh yeah okay I didn't imagine it American lawyer Donald pit who helped launch the Phoenix Suns NBA basketball team decades ago bought the building in the mid 2000s construction was completed at that time uh since then prospective renters and or buyers have included Fraser Health Simon Fraser University and the RCMP but all deals eventually didn't happen uh potential uses pitched for the building have included Banquet Hall office space homes restaurants
Bowling Alley even an auto sales lot on the ground floor none of which ever  $2 million so who who who do you have to buy it from is it the city or is it the the the current owner who is um Co de bansel but they're forced to sell it it's a court-ordered sale but I don't know what that means this article is really interesting because it's like it's kind of everything you need to know the important thing here is the lenders and the owner everyone along with us we're trying to work together to find a
positive solution for the property and this is the realtor uh this is a bit of a positive spin on this but there is equity in the building you know the mortgage holders are well protected the court ordered sale is not because there's a negative equity situation here so negative equity would mean that it is worth less than the amount you owe on it right or like the then the total liability but I also think that I don't know if it's worth practically anything I I I am not sure either if you have to
rip up all of the plumbing and very likely all of the electrical and potentially the walls and everything else also I think you're paying a cool like million dollars a year in property  property yeah yeah yeah well so it's probably not going to happen ever but it'd be cool be pretty sick lus media campus yeah do it it's not my debt go for gold yeah I mean it's it's a cool building it is very cool it looks neat imagine you could play soccer on the lawn in the front heck yeah you could company
activity heck yeah you could why not it's like half the size or quarter the size you could do outdoor babon on the lawn in front look at all these windows it's like kind of a cool building why not every single person has a corner office yeah right look at all these Corners there's a lot of Corners it's beautiful what are we doing right now what are we talking about how do we end up on this Luke has 14 minutes oh yeah Luke oh man oh man okay um Nintendo I killed the rugen X switch
emulator last weekend Russ of the YouTube channel oh wait uh no this is about the copyright strike for U uh Russ from Retro Game Corp uh that is um yeah thanks Nintendo for that they got uh their first strike after covering the Mig switch now called the Mig flash which allows you to dump games from your Nintendo switch to your computer according to Russ Nintendo was able to strike that video because the title screen of Super Mario 3D World was shown on his computer the new strike was on a
video where Russ apparently demonstrated a Wii U emulator it's perhaps worth noting that you can't buy Wii U games from Nintendo anymore since the company shut down the console's eShop last year then this Tuesday it came out that Nintendo switch emulator rugen X has been wiped out a year after rival emulator Yuzu was shuttered by Nintendo according to the rugen x development team member rip in Perry Perry the lead developer GDK Chan was offered an agreement by Nintendo to stop working on
the project and remov the organization as well as all related assets while GDK Chan didn't tell the team whether or not he was complying the emulators now gone from GitHub and the official sit's download page has been wiped it is speculated that this was a buyout rather than any kind of threat of legal action because my understanding of rugen X was that it involved complete reverse engineering not any Nintendo IP which was supposed to keep it safe from any Nintendo legal action interesting
um I don't know if any of the rest of this matters that much so maybe we should do a couple more merch messages sure we got to do when after dark yeah that way we can at least transition to when after dark before Luke just leaves yeah sure um I'll focus on the Luke ones Luke did you or have you considered using the flutter flame framework for float plane seems like it would work well to have a unified code base across platforms we're not changing Frameworks right now my dude um I haven't looked
into it if if this was something that we were you know if we were making a platform from scratch maybe we could look into stuff but yeah we're not we're not doing that right now sorry uh the chat is also very upset at this idea I don't know s dudes hey lonus do you have any pictures of that sweet Suzuki you've been painting and Luke have you ever rode on the back of it dude his weight sitting behind me up higher than me on a bik we would tip oh your bike yeah we we'd hit the first red
light and just you know I I rode on the back of a scooter that Dennis was driving in Taiwan me too and we live scary Colton and I both rode with Dennis at the same time it was pretty scary Channel me that's true let's see one actual human or two  um no I don't have any pictures I have been completely stalled on that project uh kind of demoralized by some of the uh setbacks um I I'm going to pick it up again I really need to long I really I really need to pick it up again I'll get it done yeah
sorry this is a bit hard here the person who asked that just wants to know when we're getting the beard back phony Tony said in full PL chat that is that's kind of true yeah that's fair I want the beard back I think I think I'm ready yeah yep hey D question for Luke any thoughts on Star Citizen charging $40 for the atlas essentially making a problem with loading cargo and selling a  made I I mean I didn't know that was part it um cuz I didn't know about this ship because I check out staron like
once a year um I don't know dude they also sell like tens of thousands of dollars for a single ship don't they I don't know the whole thing no I don't think they have anything that I don't think so yeah they do I think so I know they have packs that are that expensive no there's there's a ship that is the like largest luxury yacht and I think I think it's five figures at least most expenses and ships 2022 725 bucks address is old that one how much is that "$25,000 600i executive Edition hey it's"
that's the javelin is "$3,000 largest Destroyer class ship 480" m in length yeah but there's the 600i executive Edition okay 25 Grand yeah there's nobody there's no way anybody bought that uh I pretty much guarantee you someone did oh yeah for human use as an expeditionary vessel for players no for players the ship is only available as a reward upon reaching the legatus nav conci rank which requires a spending oh requires a spending of 25 Grand so even though the ship that's rank for spending money oh I
see that's a rank for spending money my guy oh the interior is in precon stage design and will be updated at some point in the future there's a VR chat level for it so you don't have to buy one ever like a normal person uh moving on so like I yeah I don't know uh that sucks uh Stars isn't cool though they do genuinely some pretty incredible things the tech behind it is super interesting what they're working on is super Neato you don't have to spend that much money on the game at all you can just
play the game and earn money and then buy ships that way and it's totally fine I'm still working on my $60 ship bu since it first came out a thousand years ago yeah and you're probably fine like this cargo ship thing I wouldn't be surprised if you can just make some money in the game and just buy it in the game yep yeah so like I don't know just ignore it don't don't play into those things and move on talking of games have you played zero seert what okay no uh I got another one
hold on can we do something really fun really quick here oh yeah sure this is still a thing there's a $50 Super Chat it's just gone and I have to click here to see it but they they don't stay here forever um pretty dude pretty wild that it's just not in the viewer activity thing this has been open the whole time whole time merch messages use merch messages okay cool bye zero Seer looks sick from just like the steam page but I don't know it's a it's a extraction shooter but it's like a
little top down game oh that's cool I guess new killer focused very positive yeah I don't know cool seems neat there's so many cool games days sorry one second oh am I going back to your laptop they called they called the area zakov which is like the closest thing to darkov all right that's a little nuts all right they know what they're doing uh Luke you've said in the past you wouldn't do an AMD Tech upgrade is it be too boring would you do it uh with this big kicker lonus is in charge and picks what you
get I already pick what he gets for his upgrades yeah to be honest um no I I my problem was that like there it just I yeah I didn't have a an interesting I actually said No at one point one was offered to me and I said no because I didn't think it would be interesting for people um that is no longer true but I I am at the whims of the rules of whoever draws the thing so I don't know if I'm eligible or not it doesn't really necessarily matter I get the free computers because of that
ancient awesome deal anyways so I'm something that could be kind of fun is you were mentioning my dad getting one we could maybe do it that if I get drawn it just goes to my dad yeah why don't we do that um something like that could be cool um and then I don't know if if I there's potential that I'm going to be dramatically changing my setup probably in the new year um because my roommate moved out so we're going to be moving our desks into there and I could maybe drag lonus over to my host for that and
we could just like film it but it wouldn't have to be an AMD Tech upgrade um oh weird um the behavior of the dashboard seems to have changed something was in curated that I wanted to unur so that I could type a response and then push to stream but it seems to have gone straight to push to stream instead of giving me an opportunity to type a response so Anonymous I don't know anything really about the wordpress.org thing but I will say that the whole uh if you don't agree with
this legal fight um take a buy out and then get out uh move seems like not really good leadership is what I'll say about that back into incoming no I I that's what I thought but it didn't seem to go there uh that's fine we can figure it out another time okay all right what else we got uh you got any more topics or is this when after dark officially it's officially when after dark there's a couple more topics I um uh I don't have to leave exactly  um redditors can't protest um platform
changes anymore you have to you have to send a request to um to take your your subreddit private there okay that's that uh I think we talked about the Flappy Bird thing last week uh sketchy Game Dev announced his recovery plan in a new Kickstarter so the background here is the day before was a hyped up Multiplayer Survival horror extraction shooter that was misleadingly advertised as an MMO the game was very limited and technically flawed when it launched in December 2023 and was withdrawn from
sale after Just 4 days the developer fantastic also garnered controversy due to its alleged use of volunteer and severely underp paid labor and its alleged habit of finding employees as punishment for poor output now fantastic has returned with a promise that it's changed its ways and a Kickstarter for "$115,000 to develop a physics-based" multiplayer Co-op Escape game called Escape Factory a demo of the game is available on Steam however according to data miners the game's assets are
flipped Unity store items and its networking and matchmaking features are based on Unity demo code so maybe don't buy it cool all right that's it okay oh we got to cut the the Zuck shirt let's do that should we just do it next week no they need it oh okay it's time to unbox a $400 T-shirt oh yeah I'm excited would you like to do it uh sure this is actually the second time it's unboxed so okay yeah I unboxed it for a FL exclusive you get a little card you got to read the card first all right I'll
read the card you can't open your present without reading first thank you for purchasing from our online boutique we have prepared your order with the utmost care in salomo Salo Sal I don't know some Italian city uh our customer care is available to assist you scan the QR code to contact our team very nice all right oh man I just cleaned the guillotine okay look look I didn't buy it for myself the company bought it for competitive product research yeah and we're destroying it so that we can
research it it comes in a bag I mean you can't figure out how a frog Works without taking it apart that's what they taught me in Biology class why does it come in its own bag so that you have a bag and who it not even a bag you're not good at this is that surprising to anyone okay he doesn't have a lot of experience unboxing any clothes have you never uned a $400 t-shirt usually my clothes just show up at my desk at you're holding it behind your laptop you are actually the
worst of this it's got a big really big  shirt not even like a particularly thick one or anything I'm just I'm feeling like this pinched feeling it I don't know um dear customer please be advised that the product cannot be returned if the security tag is removed okay do it yeah you hold it under the table oh Luke a you need Showmanship classes content's better when you get mad though hey there's another tag does this one show how much it was no why is there another tag oh I guess I
can try and find the I forget what this this product of quality this product of quality fruit of our labor is created in solom MiO a small medieval village at the gates of acisi where men and nature are still aware of the harmonious rhythm of  so we're cutting this thing yep is do you want to cut it in like a specific spot so it's still wearable by someone is that even possible how big is the circle it's pretty big yeah no you just it's still wearable after you cut a circle out of it I mean you dude it's a
$400 shirt do the do thepp someone would do it oh yeah nice yeah you want to here I don't actually I don't actually see it um I'm a little confused is does it say anywhere what the product is like do you have a label uh one  sec okay it feels nice are you going to give me the label no that's just like the label's there you took the all right all right okay so what what is it this is uh C 8190 medium uh that's I didn't think I didn't see that's I think that's a skew hold on I think I can probably I can
probably search by that okay so the little rubber disc C 8190 is that going to work unfortunately it seems we couldn't find any results for that uh okay well I can't I can't find it anymore I can't find it on their site but we definitely ordered this we bought it and now uh okay right right right right right so one of the things that we wanted to do is make sure that our Zuck t-shirt which is just going to be a gray t-shirt but you know comfortable or whatever you know like
billionaires like um we wanted to make sure that it is pretty similar at least like we're we're not going to have the same source of cotton we're not we might even use a blend instead of 100% going to be made the same way it's not going to be in a medieval village it's a great t-shirt and it's going to be inspired by you know that shirt Mark Zuckerberg is always wearing um and in this shirt's defense ignoring the price tag it feels nice it feels nice um but one of the things that we need to do in order to
determine how we can make a shirt like Zuck would wear is we need to figure out the weight of the fabric and the best way to do that I'm informed by Tatiana from the I don't know if she's really fashion team but she works on the fashion team and also with the engineering team on like materials essentially the best way to do that is to use this thing what oh oh did I do something wrong no I just had it all nicely lined up for you okay the best way to do it is to use this thing which basically goes onto a
material and then has like a blade and you spin this thing and it like it's yeah it's got kind of like a nasty little there's four blades isn't there nasty little blade thing in there so you turn this thing and it cuts it it cuts the fabric that gives you a standard size piece of the fabric and then you you can determine the fabric weight well you just stabbed it you got to go around now you got to keep pressure down the whole time yeah yeah well I'm trying  go you don't have to go crazy hard
because you're just going to be cutting  oh theoretically there's four blades so you should you know not have to go technically all the way around uh did we get it all right and here it is nice sorry uh Brunello oh where'd it go it's now in the shirt oh this isn't going to be twitch Twitch TV safe anymore well that was the point really to have a boob cut out yeah where' it go where did it go titty window is it still like hung on by a thread or something it's a high quality resilient
shirt it doesn't just come apart like some peasant shirt would where where did it go that's part of the vanishing fabric Thing no this is what you get for 400 bucks where the heck is it what happened I mean it's not like we can't do it again we have a lot of shirt I have already flipped it inside out I'm going in what this doesn't like eat it no I saw it it was hanging Lo yeah where did it go is it under no are we idiots is chat going to tell us where it is under the rubber no it's
not under the rubber you guys look oh what how did it get under the rubber I have no idea how the heck did it get   idea all right oh wait did they oh did taana also give us a scale yeah oh that's awesome so we're going to find out the fabric weight right now did she give you like the formula for how much the whatever uh it's grams normally and then it's GSM if you 10x it if I remember correctly okay wait it's not zero tear it tear it okay I'm going the other tear oh tear where's the zero oh here we go
okay you good y okay hold on why does it need a lid okay I don't know error eror eror it's a very sensitive accurate scale oh because of the air air currents oh was that 1.71 I don't I don't know yeah 1.71 G okay so uh perfectly 17.1 GSM it shouldn't matter but is that is that like a lot I have no idea fabric that doesn't sound like a lot that doesn't sound right well it doesn't feel super like thick or anything when you hold it oh okay no 17 GSM seems like it could be could be a
thing Alibaba 12 GSM nonwoven fabric here we go okay yeah those look like pretty like normal Fabrics like like you could make a shirt out of or something wait know this is 140 GSM what what hold on is that just like a mat no this is fabric for t-shirts yeah no this can't be right this can't be right grams times 100 oh is it times 100 if it's times 100 that would make forgot what she said I'm sure said the right thing 170 GM sounds a lot more like the range I was expecting I don't know what GSM numbers 
I thanks how much do you charge if they just weigh charge for a gr why do they bother change the number um I don't know okay I don't know uh okay what else are we what are we talking about oh yeah it's it's it's grams times 100 okay perfect she's in the chat oh oh my bad I forgot I thought you said 10 that's my bad no way her username is Material Girl it's kind of it's pretty good I like it song I mean we were living in a material world so uh makes sense that you would be a material girl I took it
off and put it back on again it said 16.9 or something okay well we'll we'll let T6 do it properly cuz realistically we can't be trusted apparently yeah okay just lost the fabric sample there there's a question for her is s does 17 sound High 17 or 170 17 probably about right I I can I can tell you the answer that probably about right is that a high GSM shirt not necessarily yeah okay it's like fine yeah no no your your observation that it's not a particularly like thick shirt she says no that's
pretty normal yeah okay yeah yeah worksman says put the shirt on with the circle all right want to do a merch message in the meantime sure you got one Dan yeah I got a few uh shall we move to after dark as well yeah uh let's see Hello W.D spout V2 I got a chance to meet both Jensen hang and Lisa Su a few weeks ago I froze and had nothing useful to say what questions would you have asked each if given the chance Jensen definitely what is what is the favorite what what is your favorite artistic piece on your 
tie okay pick pick one pick a lane you have to decide well I feel like a billionaire oh hey it's not actually a problem yeah this is perfect nice we should this is a statement I actually feel like that is an artsy shirt look if if the whole point of buying a super if the point of buying a super expensive article of clothing is that you can afford it and other people can't then it should be an even big bigger Flex to destroy it yeah and then be able to afford to destroy it which other people
can't and I'm just following their logic I'm not I'm not really into the whole $400 t-shirt thing also there's some kind of weird stuff about it like do you notice the shoulders does seem to sit a little weird little like like a little peek I think that might just be from it being pressed how it's yeah might just be from it there's a line all the way down your down your shoulder which is almost certainly from it being folded for so long or a dollar sign in the middle of the circle what like on my
skin just I don't want silver Sharpie on my skin no I reject okay you need a black one so it looks like a tattoo oh my God and then it's a window to the tattoo yeah like and it's it's normally you'd have a window to your soul so this way it shows a dollar sign cuz it's it's window to his heart I will say this um uh you guys can see more detail about it in the float plane exclusive if you're subscribed to float plane uh and realistically if you were shopping for a shirt like this you can afford to
subscribe to float plane um but the fit it's not great yeah it's like kind of  opinion the shoulders it has kind of like a weird second Artful seam at the bot it comes really far down unnecessary scene as well um doesn't you look at the way it like bunches if I lift my arms yeah I I have rejected garment that had better sleeves than this is some of this uh being impacted by the giant hole that we put in it no I like the hole Yeah the art full hole Yeah I think having an undershirt on that the
the second seam on the back of the shoulder is weird yeah that is odd are you guys going to do that then um do what put a weird seam on the arm I yeah I guess we'd have to okay yeah well it's the Zuck I mean the Steve had like a weird seam down the middle is this really like is he does he wear this shirt all the time right now I don't know if he does right now but I don't care I mean Steve Jobs doesn't wear that shirt right now cuz Zuckerberg has done a big like really he's gonna let me get
away with that one what did you say I said Steve Jobs doesn't wear that shirt right now oh my goodness um cuz Zuckerberg is he's he's like all trendy now and stuff he looks like this that's okay we're I know but we're not going to do that I'm and thist apparently he he he took some phrase that is like um you must be Caesar to rule or something in Latin I don't remember  Zuck uh let me let me try to find the information on it give me one sec Zak has gone full hello fellow kids
yeah a little bit make an Elon girle pulling it off though he's pulling it off an Elon girdle okay anyway um yeah patch the hole with an LTT logo yeah I I could be down make that part of the shirt you sell no I don't think we'd put a giant LTT logo on apparently there was a phrase I'm not going to be able to pronounce it correctly at all which is like a caesar aill which means either a Caesar or nothing or simply All or Nothing uh the saying is indicative of grand ambition and it was a personal
motto of Italian Renaissance Prince Caesar boria or whatever and shirt is the same thing but he replaced Caesar with Zuck and he made it himself and  shirt you've got that and you guys went the gray one yeah all right it's more iconic is it yeah he wor for a long time okay yeah the gray shirt is super iconic I don't pay attention to him yeah don't blame it oh it's this one there are a lot of photos of this okay wow he really does look like a he looks so much better now I'm so happy for him
yeah there was nowhere to go but up I don't know that he looks like he's he looks like Logan Paul like that's who he looks like he's trying to dress like he's going to make prime but it's like the number cuz he's like a computer guy or something this over this I think it's a win I think it's a win yeah that's cool yeah he's doing better yeah the haircut was really problematic before yeah it's like I want to can you accentuate my receding hairline yeah it's like that's what he told or
like my large forehead I guess it's not even receding it's just really really big forehead I think this has been good for Zuck and bad for the people because people have started liking him a lot and I oh yeah do people just like like Mark Zuckerberg now I think so interesting yeah so we're not going to eat him well he seems like he'd be chewy anyway lizard meat no we got to smoke him he's got those Smoked Meats smoke smoke with those meats or whatever I can't remember it was a long
time ago baby Ray barbecue sauce something like that sweet baby rays sweet baby rays oh chat says they're still going to eat him they just like him okay okay so they like him but they're going to eat shed a single tier yeah um okay that's interesting nice how many tears do I get do I get more tears enough to salt the meat I pour some internet on it it's got more than enough sodium yeah yeah yeah all right hi dwell uh do you think AMD no longer doing high-end gpus uh effect
exclusivity A Partners like XFX power color and Sapphire could we uh see them reaching out to Nvidia um no I doubt it powerc color and Sapphire have been all AMD through much worse times than we're in now oh yeah um and XFX they made the they made the move they essentially like pulled an EVGA except just instead of pulling out of the VGA Market entirely they were just like We're Not Gonna sell cards from the only chipset vendor that matters and we're going to go to AMD and like try to
survive like that and they're still I mean they're still kicking obviously but um amd's done this before the the for context the rumor is that amd's upcoming GPU family is not going to have like a highend like a 900 you know 80 900 XTX orever kind of suck they've done it before Polaris they didn't have a high-end product and partners apparently survived in fact I think they gained market share during that time so might be okay we'll see only time will tell that'll suck cuz Intel's not doing it
either yeah so if you want high end you're going to pay the Nvidia tax period sweet y getting get an even cooler kitchen sorry go for it it could have a second kitchen have you you've seen his kitchen right I've seen the kitchen everyone's seen the kitchen how can anyone ever get over that kitchen I don't know it's a nice kitchen what do  my goodness is that even that crazy of a kitchen look he's got a mural behind his stove yeah he's got a mantle yeah okay it's pretty crazy I

square ft why did it autofill kitchen why why is it asking me my location stop Combi oven is way more comi oven is comi oven allows you to control humidity and temperature and has convection steam injection I hate it when you're making things I look at for definition of mansion and it says a manor house it's like what does that mean yeah it doesn't have a firm definition that's why well okay actually the first definition is a large impressive house nice mansion Bro Look up MC
mansion that's just that's not even a real thing that's a real thing that's  thing it's the McDonald's version of a mansion they're uh they put up like  right why would you say that about your own home it's it's basic it's lacking architectural Integrity yeah well it's not it's not like does your house lack architectural Integrity bro old money would look at my house and be like does it even have any history like it's not it's just it's just a giant house it's it's a normal it's a normal
house except it's big like it's I linked one of my favorite like I don't know can we even say blogs anymore uh this this person basically goes through and explains why they suck uh and there's some insane houses just so badly thought through I don't even dude I don't even know a lot of the words on here inappropriate use of prairie mullions what is that so I did architecture for a while there's like so many weird weird turns can you zoom in a little bit uh piggy nose extremely steth oh what am
I it's like a tiny little port hole wheel uh window that they put there for some reason dude I saw some really weird houses when we were shopping there's a lot of um in in the in the kind of area is where I live there's a lot of houses that the owners clearly designed it and you ended up with just some super weird stuff face with sticks Chopsticks machine with stuff on it not going to say what this looks like I didn't even see that I like the hell yeah what is this is this mcmansion hell
is this a whole site yeah will there's hundreds of these they're  good my rich Grand in my rich friend in school had this dining set but they covered everything in plastic protection so this all seems strangely obscene to me it's like uh money does not buy taste right yeah no it really doesn't um how do you live in this I don't know I don't know I don't I'm I'm so anti clutter I don't like clutter I don't like stuff in my house that I don't use and I hate like uncomfortable furniture and stuff
like I just don't look how many look at the teered ceiling oh with all the pot yeah and then the tiny little anemic fan right the center they don't have uh carpets but the or they don't have like wall to- wall carpets but they have carpets everywhere so you're always on carpet anyway  Chic oh my God that's such a depressing room yeah this one seem this one's ni but all those plants are probably fake but there's only there's only one note on this room because it's actually kind of
nice yeah that looks actually I'd sit and eat breakfast there for sure both of you are  Dormers I mean I mean honestly most of what's funny about this is just the commentary like I don't think oh yeah no the commentary is great but these houses are also  okay is an nooy made a thing or is that just like well okay like big ships have  boss all right bigger than the house my apartment is in just the garage all right okay all right all right the loneliest table yeah dude that's a classic dude giant
houses that just have furniture that you're not using at all like I half the cost seems to be buying the house and the other half of the cost seems to be buying ostentatious Furniture to occupy it look how rich I am to afford this much nothing I'm like you take the Badminton Center and then just put like a one em chair in it ideal living room oh no more concrete though you you put walls it hit me down uh yo getting some new lids I loved the live demo from last week that's why I bought these uh
question for Mr lime what was the driving force for you to start at NC oh I just really hated school and I really hated the job um doing running the painting business and I just was so burnt out and uh down having a trash job is a really good motivator yeah well it was a it was a it paid well having a meting a job that you hate is a pretty good motivator to do something else and so I was just like I don't want to do this anymore I just want to do what I want to do which is talk to people about
technology and get paid for it uh what I really wanted to do was work in the tech room but they they wanted me in sales which probably was wise hey W.D I have a question for lonus do you see mura on the big screen Beyond did you see I did when I got mine and it was quite visible on mind so I ended up returning and going for the PSV R2 Mira I thought this was a thing but I think it seems like it's an issue with it miror effect I'm actually not familiar with the term MO yeah do you
mean yeah m o r i e like when I wear my it looks like a fine grainy mesh that covers the entire screen it stays static as the image moves behind it usually more obvious in dim scenes uh um I can't say that I observed that screen door effect I think it's the screen door but why would you more why would you not just call it screen door effect I don't know oh okay mirror just means screen door effect uh no I didn't find that it was bad on that particular one I mean anything looks bad compared to the
Vision Pro at this point but um the vision Pro's utility is so limited that it's I'm just kind of waiting for Apple's displays to make their way into into other headsets and then I can have the best of both worlds I can have an actual usable headset that has a really nice screen on it yeah I didn't know the screen door had a name that's pretty cool yeah I didn't know that either so now I know psvr2 for PC looks pretty sick though good choice Anonymous and last curate I've got for
you lonus I want to ask you as a question have you as someone who was born before the internet have you seen an increase in general hysteria to to technology changing parts of our lives so rapidly that is a measured and objective thing that has happened it's hard for me to observe it though because before the internet was widespread I was 10 I wasn't paying attention to hysteria fair enough um and we definitely like had hysteria I think you can map it on even stages of the internet like web 1.0
2.0 3.0 forward I think that has happened as well you know what else has happened the end of the show we will see you again next week same bad  wait oh hey thanks Ludy same bad Channel okay bye   well it's not ready yet not going up
