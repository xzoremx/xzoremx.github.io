$4.70 trillion that is how much companies are projected to spend to get your attention in 2025 with helpful messages like this thermal paste is good for AI and sports gambling makes you cool but marketing is more than just the ads that get served before your YouTube video and in the middle of your YouTube video and at the end of your YouTube video a considerable amount of that budget is spent every year on branding AMD for instance didn't come up with the name rise by pulling it
out of a hat it was a very clear statement that they were back and millions of dollars get spent to nail the tone of slogans logos sounds and so much more all with one purpose convincing you to pull out your wallet and buy I mean look at Apple's habit of stringing together superlatives like Ultra Pro and Max if they're doing it I promise you it's because a team of professionals found that these powerful words maximize the odds that you're going to think that Apple's just playing
the best which raises a question if they're all so smart why are all these names so dumb what is liquid retina xdr is that better than Ultra retina xdr how about the ryzen 8640 HS is that better than the ryzen 7736 U I don't know and what makes the CPU go from core to core Ultra as it turns out the confusing nature of this branding is almost certainly by Design it's not intended to inform and educate you but rather it's intended to appeal to your gut feelings and I've got a gut
feeling that we're going to talk a lot more about confusing branding after this confusing this segue confusing sponsor to our segue sponsor G skill embrace the Finer Things in life like yachting art collecting and of course Ram with G skills Trident Z5 Royal ddr5 featuring a mirror finish in either gold or silver and a crystalline light bar learn more at the link in the description picture this it's June 2024 and you just got a new laptop as a gr present and after a bit of research you find out boy howdy
is it ever a good one it's got a Cutting "Edge 7,000 series processor with ripping" fast Zen 4 cores from AMD except for one small problem it doesn't now my goal going into this wasn't to upset Fanboys by singling out AMD but their mobile product naming scheme is so incomprehensible that it requires its own Wikipedia section making it a prime example of how misleading product naming can hurt consumers to illustrate let me show you how it compares to the current desktop naming scheme this right here on
desktop is your all important architecture number this indicates if the chip is using the latest generation core technology or something older well this this goes um here now and then that first spot that first number well now that's the release year butuh I don't know let's put an eight there I guess which tells you what year it came out as long as you consult this handy rubric meaning wait that first number has no bearing on performance whatsoever anymore that's right its main purpose
seems to be to allow AMD to create a new "8,000 series or a uh a 9,000 Series CPU" without doing the engineering work to release a new architecture and we're not done yet that second number uh that's the market segment so you've got a ryzen 9 over here and then you can either have a nine or an eight wait isn't that kind of redundant cuz we've already got a segment over here yes yes it is oh wait I forgot forgot to put year on here I'm confusing even myself and don't forget
about the fourth number uh that can be zero this is a differentiate number it could be zero or if it's better but not better enough to change any other numbers it's five not three not just zero and five oh right and don't forget about the letter over here which indicates the power Target or if it's unlocked I don't know but Intel has letters to indicate the power Target so AMD has letters to indicate the power Target so not only are these letters not industry standard even within amd's own
lineup you can have instances where two chips can have the exact same numbers but markedly different performance characteristics at least they kept the meaning of the architecture number the same though right seven is the newest  now are you confused yet good that's what they want so you're not going to think about it too hard and you'll just trust that huh bigger numers better but here's a couple examples of how this can go very very wrong in February Nvidia launched a refreshed RTX 30506 gig why I
don't know and it doesn't matter what matters is that if Nvidia had followed amd's naming scheme that I just laid out it would have become the RTX 6530 can you IM imagine the outrage if the community got their hands on the shiny new 6530 only to find out that Nvidia arbitrarily doubled the model number I mean look Nvidia is no saint they have shamelessly adjusted the meaning of their model numbers many times to suit their needs we actually have a full video coming on their but this example shows how what
AMD has done here sets a completely new bar for this nonsense and ironically in a way that could actually hurt AMD in the the long term imagine this scenario oh popsicles they are fresh out of the 7640 U well I guess I'll go with the higher number 7735 U except for one small problem you just downgraded to an older processor so now you're going to go tell all your friends who bought modern chips from amd's competitors how bad amd's battery life and performance sucks way to go AMD
making matters more confusing they've added a gu investor bait to their upcoming generation which is fine except  now now remember how I said that I didn't just want to beat up on AMD that's because Intel is also terrible their new product naming is so confusing that they get it wrong on the very page that explains it on their own website they did get some stuff right this time around they finally removed the Superfluous I they kept the reasonably well-defined Market segment number and
they moved the word processor to the front wait a minute what was that last one that's not right you're saying that going forward an Intel Core i7 14700 K processor would have been called Intel core7 processor 14700 K I mean I know that rules are made to be broken but typically Intel we say our adjectives first like this look at this beautiful perfectly sized new black super soft poly blend graphic t-shirt from LTD store.com if I reversed it it would sound more like float.com signup content
behindth scenes bonus weekly twice4 if that sounds backward to you it's because it is and that's before we even tackle the suffixes HX means highest performance all skews unlocked HK means highest performance all skews unlocked h means highest performance p means performance optim this is like buying a car that has three positions for the gas pedal okay highest speed unlocked highest speed and optimized for Speed uh G indicates integrated Graphics but also F indicates no integrated Graphics so
what you're getting if there's neither of them who knows oh and they're getting rid of the Pentium branding again except they aren't again oh and finally Ultra indicates an AI capable chip well that one was just obvious now some companies do keep their naming cleaner for Apple's M series processors the new number every year simply indicates hey this is a new processor with Pro Max and Ultra suffixes that mean various degrees of better but with that said apple is also guilty of some serious naming
can I interest you in the latest 2023 MacBook Pro or would you prefer the old older crappier 2023 MacBook Pro so what can we do as consumers well you can complain to your country's Consumer Protection Agency but that's not going to do anything in the short term so uh you can encourage people in your life to try and educate themselves before they make purchases but that can be just as confusing as not bothering and it takes time that many people just don't have or don't want to invest into this and
truthfully I get it I mean it's literally my job to learn about and demystify these things but there are many areas of my life where I just don't feel like putting in the work either why do I buy the brand of dishwasher soap that I do it's not like I've performed thorough testing in a controlled environment all I know is that it's cheap at Costco and it tastes delicious Jokes Aside the point that I'm making here is that consumer behavior isn't going to change so what we really
need is a shift in Attitude for manufacturers and not just the ones I called out today guys I'm addressing you directly now branding doesn't need to be a bad thing it doesn't need to be deceptive in a perfect world it will guide your customer to the right product in your portfolio resulting in a positive experience that will Foster long-term brand loyalty and therefore future sales if you keep that mentality in mind you could even engage in controversial practices like rebadging a
last generation product to fill an entry-level Gap in your new lineup and it doesn't have to be such a terrible thing as long as you do all the necessary extra steps like making sure it continues to get driver support for a long enough period as though it was new the issue is I just don't see that happening I see hostility toward the customer everywhere I look in an effort to pursue short-sighted quarterly targets that look good to investors and I'm just f up with it so fed up that I
