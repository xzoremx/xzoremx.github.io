this flashlight claims to Output 1.3 million lumens and this this is my new  monitor jealous don't be this monitor only works for a few minutes at a time would likely damage your eyes if it worked any longer than that and because of its backlight here it carries a nonzero risk of burning your house down the things we do for science or not just for science you see the latest Trend in display manufacturing is towards brighter and brighter monitors and TVs but just like the previous fads like
making them thinner and pumping up the resolution there's a point where more is not necessarily better and what better way to demonstrate this than to reach that point and keep on sailing we started out with a regular old Gaming monitor and turned it into the brightest one the world has ever seen we expected to have a lot of fun and we did but what we didn't expect was the discoveries we made along the way so let's begin our journey to lumino City by very carefully tearing down an LCD
monitor right after this segue to our sponsor nexo their anniversary sale is on right now and you can bundle up the Aurora Pro projector plus a 100 in Fel "screen and save $1,000 we'll have a link" in the description where you can check  out W okay that's a joke it was already cut in half the point is that inside a modern LCD display there's a lot going on but for our purposes we only need to understand four main parts today starting with what sits closest to us the liquid crystals the LC's of our LCD
these sit sandwiched between two polarizing filters that are configured to prevent any light from passing through you can actually see the same principle at work with a variable ND filter like this one for a camera in this configuration we can see through it just fine and in this one it blocks pretty much all the light and turns black so wait if these are configured to keep light from passing through how does any get through well you need a third layer in between the two polarizers a
layer that can control polarization electronically that is your liquid crystals as voltage gets applied to them they rotate the polarization of light enabling an image to pass through things can quickly get more complicated with different types of LCD panels but the same principle applies from an original iphone all the way to a brand new 100in LED TV light passes through the display stack and is filtered by the LCD layer to create the final image but where does that light
come from well you've got options on older or cheaper LCDs there can be a material that is placed behind the liquid crystals that's designed to reflect ambient light back toward the user some of you might remember the struggle of trying to catch a street light while you played with your Game Boy in the back seat or you might not know what a Game Boy is and that's totally okay too I'm not the point is that more modern displays typically remove that reflective layer in favor of a light that is behind the
screen but not all backlights are created equal they've undergone a massive Evolution from the early days of using bulky power hungry fluorescent tubes to highly efficient LEDs to well this it's glorious you guys you've outdone yourselves and it's also really dumb and frankly a lot more primitive than modern TVs but it is built using similar principles as you can see here most modern backlights use LED lights which makes sense they're small they're energy efficient and they're cheap and
those LEDs are either distributed along the edges of the display like this one or more ideally along the entire surface behind the panel not only does that produce more even luminance but modern backlights can alter the brightness of indiv idual LEDs or at least groups of LEDs to selectively dim or brighten parts of the screen to achieve the best possible image now we're saving our deeper dive into dimming zones and backlight control for our next attempt next attempt at this oh
yeah apparently so for now we're going to move on to what LEDs we're using today we tested about 10 different varieties with the aim of finding something that balanced cost quality and size and we ended up going with the cre cxb3590 its compact square shape and high light output made the approximately $28 per unit price pretty attractive there are some compromises but look at it go my goodness how is it so flipping bright well I'll tell you a secret this isn't just one LED in fact if you look
much much closer you can see it's actually an array of over 150 LEDs cob LEDs like this one or chip on board LEDs simply means that multiple LEDs are mounted to one substrate and while that makes wiring them up dead simple each one still requires an arrays worth of power so that's right each one of our individual cobs here is going to draw sorry is this right more than five times the original power consumption of the monitor it could draw more if we wanted it each one of these yeah huh how many do we have
40 that's like 3500 Watts ah I see why there's so many power supplies rigged up to the chassis now and five different Breakers we could have bought a single expensive 3500 watt unit to power everything but we liked the flexibility not to mention the cost Savings of splitting the load between 10 350 W meanwell power supplies we'll have a link to these as well as everything else we used in the video description now it's time to talk about cooling although LEDs are significantly more power
efficient than incandescent lights they still waste about half of the power they draw as heat meaning that our new gaming monitor here is going to throw off "something like 1,700 wats of thermal" energy that is more than the limit for a residential electric space heater here in North America thankfully another advantage of cobs is that they're designed to be cooled from the backside fun fact by the way our original plan was to Thermal goop each of these to a CPU Cooler to keep our design time down
but then we realized we would need 40 CPU coolers so instead our resident maker extraordinaire Justin designed this absolutely gorgeous custom water block out of aluminum and acrylic that uses our industrial Chiller here to pump coolant at a chilly 16 degrees C now the flow path is not optimized but it does seem to be sufficient for moving heat away from the back of our cobs here what it doesn't do is overcome one gigantic design oversight see our cobs go back here right and then our display
goes at the front of our shroud here but "the thing is that other 1,700 watts of" light energy well it's going to hit something and turn into thermal energy and when you've got refle Ive myar glued all over the inside of your 3D printed shroud it's like a Hot Pocket and not the delicious kind I like to describe it as the Easy Bake Oven from hell that's why our next iteration added some server fans and venting at the cost of some light bleed but we found out that still wasn't cool enough which is
where this box fan came in yeah it's kind of Jank but remember guys this is just a proof of concept for now what are the doing here uh the box fan wasn't good enough and so we have these fans oh my God go to lmg Dogg float plane if you guys want to hear David and Justin talk a little bit more about what we learned that could help us execute on our original idea which was to build the world's brightest TV one idea they had was to modify the layers of diffusion next time rather
than just reusing the original ones like we did with this one but enough jibber jabber do I finally really get to see it yep it's time they've been working on this in secret like I'm only finding out about all this crap now do we have a fire extinguisher on hand we that's what we need okay good they made me do the entire shoot today without even being allowed to turn it on yet like they showed me the lights but that's why the intro doesn't have the actual monitor on it or anything because they're like oh
lonus isn't allowed to see it until the moment when you can see it oh yeah to put on this oh really yeah you need it you even for one when we were testing we made sure that we all had welding goggles cuz uh 1 second of exposure and you're seeing those lights for the next 20 minutes 20 minutes it's pretty bad is it dangerous I don't know if it's it's all fun in games till you get crab RVE burned into  eyes oh my God even the SE page around it  stick is seethrough oh I can see I can see it I don't it's so
hot it's getting hot in here do we have the Fleer can we check how hot they're getting we do have the Fleer this is flipping crazy you guys is the chiller even on though oh uh here we go oh my God okay so hold on they're at about 19 now okay oh okay they're going up 30 turn 35 50 oh my God I can't even see the display once uh the light is something is smoking we're going to have to turn it off really cuz they're not they're not hot Something's Cooking they're all under 50 every single one of
them huh are you sure it's not just flux I I'm going to grab some ISO and wipe it down sure but like none of the wires are getting hot yeah it's got to be flux you guys these are they're not hot okay I say we I say let's see how hot we can push it we go for gold you guys dare me to look into it they said I don't have any more Shoots for the rest of the day so like whatever it's like what I need to drive home or what 135° C oh is like the max dude dude we're good here we go here we go here we
go like my skin is at 38° like the light turns into thermal energy when it hits something right so things that it shines at are hot but the LEDs themselves they're still at about 60 on the hottest ones okay it's starting to smoke up real good now cut it okay okay are we going to put the Shroud on for you anything before we do that how about some speeds and feeds like how bright is our backlight before we put the LCD in front of it well each cxp "3590 puts out around 12,000 lumens which"
means we are sitting at just shy of half a million lumens total 3.42 six lumens is one nit meaning that our backl is rated at "14,15" nits for context the brightest TVs on "the market are around 10,000 nits of" course that's all theoretical we don't have a tool that can measure anything that bright so we're not even going to try to measure the brightness until we put our LCD on it and I think this goes this way huh the scaler and Power supply for the monitor you can see it's just
kind of like taped to the bottom of it can you give me something oh yeah it's outputting okay it's outputting we're good thank you for that I should legitimately not be sitting here whoa is the cart going to move oh my God the cart moves yeah that's why we have the commuter backpack here today is to hold it oh my God okay yeah fine I'll talk about it we put a sandbag in the long awaited LTT commuter backpack which is available now on LTT store.com we took the best features of our original LT
backpack and we put them in a smaller sleeker more stylish package it's got a reinforced dual layer bottom a convenient Tech compartment that folds out for quick access to your laptop and tablet and it's built with a durable waterresistant reprieve canvas that is made of recycled water bottles it's the backpack that's built to support your day every day and you can grab this fantastic 20 L bag for $149.99 at LTT store.com I was joking with the guys like this right here is
the difference between us and Mr who's the boss like his his like biggest iPhone in the world or whatever was so clean so Sleek man love the collab with DIY perks this is like like this peak LT okay here we go it's my first time getting to oh my God you guys it's actually kind of awesome yeah right I was expecting it to suck it's like direct sunlight is shining off of these rocks dude it's actually awesome did you know it was going to be awesome holy this isn't even HDR content
yet obviously the LCDs even in their black State cannot properly block all the light right like that so you don't  contrast but it's like the sun is the sun holy all right we got death oh God turn it up oh no it's dying did we kill it wait no it's kind it's healing again it'll be fine we just got to cut it off before before game it's too bad they'll come back it's good that blew my mind I mean I remember having this conversation this was with you Andrew at CES this year oh yeah remember when we
were on the bus oh yeah and we were talking about what is the Practical limit of like how many knits we need to have in a display for it to really match the real world and I remember us talking about it because we had actually just seen that high sense TV there and we "were like wow 10,000 HS that's wild but" then we were watching the light glinting off of one of the hotels in Vegas and we were like that is so much brighter than that TV that we just saw like how many nits do you think that was and we were
kind of having this conversation Andrew I think this is it I think this is the answer I think we actually need this level of brightness to really replicate what it feels like to look at the sun reflecting off of something TV manufacturers I was wrong we are nowhere near the end of the brightness War of the Practical benefits of more now we no no but we would never want to see the entire display at that level of brightness that would be painful but what we need is outstanding
backlight and filter layer control so that you can have just pin Pricks of that level of brightness to give you the Sparkle and Dazzle of light reflecting off of metal or off of the peaks of the waves on the water like I okay did you guys know that this was this awesome we knew it was awesome but we didn't expect this nice of a reaction dude this needs to be a thing I was completely wrong I thought it's I thought this was stupid oh oh dude we get to try a game we're gaming
yeah let's play some all oh my God see that's the thing is if you're in a dark room and there's a bright light source like that it will Dazzle you now our content would need to be mastered differently to account for this level of brightness being available to it like otherwise everything's just going to be blown out and too bright which is kind of what we're looking like in the game but with it done properly with the dark parts of the scene as dark as they're supposed to be light sources would be
dazzling and it wouldn't be like when the game artificially has you walk into a bright space and then you just like see your eyes adjust to it your actual eyes would adjust to the capabilities of the display and I got to say this level of brightness makes the lighting even though the lighting engine didn't change it makes it feel more natural and true to life because when you're close to something like that it is blinding and when it's farther away it's not till your eyes not to the
in-game camera that's the difference they're going to have to completely change the way they handle it because you can see when something is like too close and when you oh oh no it's dying again wait oh my God here's what we're going to do if we had a glass layer and then we ran water through it and then we had a glass layer and then we sealed it we could actually have a water tank behind the panel as long as the water is not creating ripples or anything it's just solid it shouldn't it shouldn't as
long as there's no bubbles so maybe we  way oh tilled there tilled there in the Box could work okay we got ideas boys world's brightest TV is going to happen oh my God look at it it's glorious it's like the difference between looking through a window and looking at a monitor like it shocked me when I watched crab ra for the first time like in that first little scene where they're coming out of the cave into the bright light and like it shocked me it's like wow it's like
you're looking out of a cave into direct sunlight crab Reeve has no right to look that good no not at all I've never tried Counter Strike with a controller so I have no idea oh you just want me to flashbang myself oh my God the sun okay here we go  oh wow this really is just like looking into direct sunlight it's too much I need sunglasses where's my there's a sunglass pouch in the commuter bag oh that's more like it oh no biggie it's just sunny today that's not a problem
with my setup that's just an equipment   biggie oh my God a oh it's so bright oh there she goes oh she's dying she's dying dude I'm adjusting this looks great oh really it looks so good we've talked about this in the past but one of the key elements of a display's color capabilities is is actually its luminance capabilities that's why we can have monitors today that have 100% coverage of whatever color gamut but they don't look like real life because they don't have enough luminance to
create the full threedimensional  see I unadjusted for a second there and that was pretty rough [Applause]  [Applause] all right let's do it let's find out how  "is sp 26,000 n we did" it we made the world's brightest gaming mod oh my God great job guys let's go let's go the power of the Sun in my arms in conclusion the brightest commercially available monitor that we could find was "about 5,000 nits and the brightest we've" ever measured on a display was an "outlier hotspot of 20,000 nits on the"
110in Ed from high sense we beat them all and I think we can do even better anyway enough of that for now though I'm going to go lie down in a dark room for a bit my eyes are dying and I'm dying to tell you about our sponsor a bonus your organization's it is likely the backbone of your whole operation so in order to keep things running smoothly making sure your data remains protected is Paramount with aonis cyber protect you'll get a combination of security backup and Recovery all bundled into one easytouse
