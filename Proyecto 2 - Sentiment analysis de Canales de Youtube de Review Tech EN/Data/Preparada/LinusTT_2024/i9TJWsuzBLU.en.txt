hey get over here on the count of three your Wi-Fi password is going to appear on this monitor ready one two got him pretty neat trick huh and sure maybe I didn't get it for all of you but a shocking number of people are still either using the default password that came with their device or their phone number or a loved one's phone number which you may already know is a huge security problem how easy is it to crack these passwords well with the cenator password steel Metron AKA this van I can
do it in seconds which would give me access to any shared resources on your network would allow me to use up your data limit and would even allow me to engage in illegal activities that would ultimately be traced back to you I'm going to show you how we built it and I'm going to give you guys the tools to stop people like me and today's video is brought to you by apost LT keycaps yes they're real and yes you can get them right now check them out at the link down below where you can get free us
shipping Wi-Fi security historically has been a bit lacking in  it and if you're thinking that was a dramatic reenactment surely it's not that bad you're right because it's worse than you think whether we get chased off or not doesn't even matter we can grab everything we need from a target's Network in the 30 seconds that it takes them to spot us outside their house and walk out to confront us so if they're using any kind of phone number password I should be able to break through  easily
and it's done that was  yep why let me shock you to learn how easy it was to crack that Network's password it might also shock you to know that for the majority of Wi-Fi's life it's kind of been this way we was the first generation of Wi-Fi password protection to find widespread adoption and at first it was good enough especially compared to the alternative of your data just raw dogging it through the air unencrypted but it took technology only a few years to advance to the point where we could be cracked
in under a minute the attack method was pretty straightforward every packet of data contained the password in some manner so if enough packets could be intercepted they could all be compared to find out what they had in common this was the reason for the switch to WPA 2 or Wi-Fi protected access which ditched the constant sending of the password simplifying the process down to a four-part handshake first the device tells the router it wants to connect then the router sends back a challenge
key the device then mixes the challenge key with the password and returns it to the router finally the router sends back a session key and that gets used for the remainder of the time the device is connected for an observer then this is kind of like having a picture of the lock and knowing that a standard looking key opens the lock but having no idea what the exact shape of that key needs to be now they could attempt to brute force it but it would take forever and they would risk detection because they
would need to be in range of the lock at all times this ended up being pretty effective for a while but wait a minute what if instead of just knowing what the lock looks like the hacker possessed a collection of exact replicas of the lock allowing them to try key after key after key without detection well that is exactly what we did by stealing the complete handshake packet we've obtained the challenge key and the result of mixing it with the password well at that point we can take that information to a
safe location brute force it with the power of our cenator and then return to do our Shady business making things even simpler for Nells encryption cracking plays real nice with multiple cores with each core of a processor hypothetically being able to try a different key in unison and this might not mean that much for CPUs that have only a handful of cores or at most what 128 192 well when it comes to gpus we are talking thousands of cores so while we obviously could put Hardware with this
kind of password cracking capability into a mobile hacking station like this we don't even need to all right let's finally properly meet the kamino grand RM now just so you remember the RTX 490 has "16,000 Cuda cores in it and this has six" of those I haven't seen one of these for about 2 years every time commo sends over a system they are so nice actually before I'm even in I can see something that is a huge improvement over the last one previously they were using sfx L
power supplies three of them which is not the best if you want to have a server this time we have proper server grade power supplies and there are four of them so I am kind of curious if it will just keep on running if you take one of them out maybe even two of them out I have never seen a 490 like this this is strange so we have our power connectors right here which are uh not connected to anything at all cuz Kino have put Power connectors on the back of these gpus I have seen some pcbs with
the pads for these power connectors but never anything actually installed like this it looks like Caminos made their own custom PCB for 12vt high power connectors right here you can see that we have a couple extra and if they wanted they could have heaps Absol abolute gobs and gobs of gpus in this thing I take it this computer's extraordinarily loud yes very that's loud these run much quieter yeah and they also can't run any AI workload worth a damn compared to this thing they're quiet in the past
Kino have had their servers set up so that you can kind of just put it in like your office and it would be fine we'd have like KN to a fans set up here that blow across the power supplies and the radiator at the same time this right here is clearly a lot more server grade with these absolutely chunk tastic cut your finger off fans right here what hasn't changed though is how impressive their water cooling is in here we have a great big water cooling manifold that's Distributing in parallel water to our
CPU and all of our gpus and then is taking all of that heat and dumping it into this great big radiator with those massive fand it looks like all of the water blocks are completely custom for Camino we've got these beautiful GPU ones that are just nice and small just look at how beautiful this vrm heat sink is over here it's just machined out of copper everything in here is just absolutely beautiful 32 GB I think the last one that we had all of them were 64 so not too much RAM 256 is still a lot
though so Tanner have you done everything that you need to do with this for the video yeah have you tested the power supply red  that all right let's see if these power supplies are redundant this is a very simple test the computer is on the computer is still on good job guys one thing that isn't very server likee with this is the io we have heaps of USB ports right here normally on a server board you only get like two we also have 2 10 gig and Intel ax200 Wi-Fi which will get you Wi-Fi 6E and wpa3 for
that good good high security Wi-Fi ah yes while hackers and crackers were working to defeat it WPA was doing some leveling up of its own and it's a pretty safe bet that any Wi-Fi 6 device will be using WPA 3 encryption what's changed well the new dragonfly handshake method aims to make it much more difficult to observe the handshake process and crack the password offline but along with a few smaller vulnerabilities does have one major flaw that still persists if your network contains any devices that
were made before WPA 3 or one of the few devices made after that that just doesn't support it like say for example an HP printer your router will fall back to WPA2 for that device unless it is explicitly told not to that is our entry point okay wow thanks lius yeah no  buddy let's hope things go a little better with victim number two about a week ago I gave them an HP printer and as long as they didn't get far enough in the setup process to realize HP requires them to have a subscription just to use
the ink in the box they're going to have that on their network doesn't that come with like a trial or something yeah but I kept that for myself what I'm going to pay for my own printer subscription I'm  are you done yeah I'm done okay got the handshake data let's let's go let's go okay this is not going so well and that's because even with our stolen lock the cracking difficulty of one Wi-Fi password compared to the next can be dramatically different a traditional lock in key might have only five or six
values that differ and five or six possible Heights for the teeth WPA passwords by contrast can use any of the printable asy characters and be up to 63 characters long that means that the total number of different passwords that could exist is very high or at least it would be if people weren't so gosh darn predictable when you are expected to share a password with others you are much less likely to select one that looks like this and you are much more likely to select one that looks like this so with
a dictionary attack or a list of words is used instead of random strings of characters hackers can drastically reduce the number of passwords that they need to attempt down from 20 Quadra gentian apparently yes that is a real number to only hundreds of millions which might still sound like a lot until you consider that a single RTX 490 can attempt over 2 million WPA2 passwords per second let's tackle a pretty typical 12 character password then with a number and a special character
and yeah armed with only a dictionary of a million common words combined with a mask of any non-letter asy character I can take down your super secure but still easy to say password in just seconds all right then lonus if full sentence passphrases don't work what do I do now well you might try creating a password with a string of random upper and lowercase letters with numbers and punctuation which is is actually great in theory but unfortunately once again people are predictable and they tend to
do things like use pneumonic phrases for easier memorization according to researchers at Carnegie melon these phrases often tend to be based on popular media like Shakespeare or more commonly apparently the Oscar Meer weener jingle making them susceptible to dictionary attacks all the same you could use a password generator to create a long string of truly random characters and then only share your Wi-Fi credentials through QR codes this has the benefits of being both secure and
easy to use in most scenarios but it can be a huge pain as soon as you need to connect a device that doesn't happen to have a camera or at least it would be a huge pain if you allowed those devices on your network at all as it turns out you don't really have to if you just make a new network for obnoxious devices that compromise your security if all they need is internet access a really great and fairly Noob friendly way to deal with this is to put them on your router's guest
SSID if they need more though then you might have to learn about vlans network security doesn't end at Wi-Fi security and Wi-Fi security doesn't end at a strong password many routers do include an option to limit networks to WPA 3 only and while this does break backwards compatibility with older or less secure devices having a second WPA 2 network using a different password and with much stricter network access rules is a great option if you're willing to put in the time to learn about it in fact at that
