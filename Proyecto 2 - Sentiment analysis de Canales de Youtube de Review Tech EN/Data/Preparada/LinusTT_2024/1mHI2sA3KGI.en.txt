I have seen some problem collectors very few of them want the help they so desperately need but David does as part of his move into his new place David is looking to uncollect years of accumulated Retro Gaming gear which means this is our last chance to shame I mean check out all of his cool goodies and there are some very cool goodies in here alongside some most puzzling choices this seems like a useful siiz TV if only there was some way to play these games in a browser for
nothing I have a lot more questions but before we get to them it's get help o' and by the end of this video I'm going to help David auction this entire collection so stay tuned for more details on how you can be the proud owner of some of this it's good just like you can be the proud owner of the segue to our sponsor War Thunder it'd be pretty cool to fly a jet or drive a tank and War Thunder's gameplay is about as close as you can get from the comfort of your own home so don't wait play for
free using our Link in the video description oh my goodness I kind of caught a glimpse of the corner over there and I was like oh that's not that bad and then I didn't realize that all of this is part of it too yes some of this stuff doesn't even make sense in television 2 is not your childhood neither is the Atari 78 oh my God it's the other side too you told me this side was other stuff but you meant only this I need help why do you have so many receivers well I okay it's only two I guess but you never
know what odd situation you'll get yourself into with retro video stuff and I want to be covered in every single base but you can only play one PlayStation 3 at a time I can't even play a single one they're all broken this shelf says works oh I moved stuff around oh my God this Shelf has its own issues with working or not working it's an insurance scam don't worry about it this wall is the stuff that I've chosen to get rid of but inside of these boxes are all the things that I'm actually
planning on keeping unless lonus can convince me otherwise what do you need all of this for well I mean like this is like a Super Nintendo box I want to get rid of box Super Nintendo games but you don't need it this is worth like $300 Canadian dollars for what emulation of this game is perfect yeah I also own like six other copies on different consoles but like it's a Super Nintendo box copy it's pretty cool you're never going to play NBA Jam again that's not true actually I might play NBA Jam
you're definitely not going to play Super Ghouls and ghosts it actually I prob no pilot Wings on the other hand though why would I play pilot Wings if I'm not going to play NBA Jam what means you have so much better than pilot Wings you kiding me pilot Wings is my childhood the most valuable game I I own is in this box there you go now you're getting it's just a little valuable is FIV they're all in the protective things I'm going to say King of Fighters 99 no that one is not it's g mark of the
Wolves this one is like 550 600 Canadian why Neo Geo stuff's really uncommon there's both the arcade stuff the mvs stuff and the home stuff and neither sold particularly well when you look at like collector numbers there's a huge Rarity to these and this is fatal Fury 4 essentially so it's part of a franchise that people love and it's like the best one and this is kind of the only way to play it got it do you have a I have a couple option one option two this is a Slicker all-in-one consolized version of
an arcade board that I made so you buy a kit and then you take a board out out of an arcade and convert it and then I have literally just the arcade board and a super gun that slides into the gamma slot and then you get uh video out and controller slots there is far too much stuff on the keep side I don't think so both of these are on the keep side uh okay so David how many Neo GEOS can one man play at a time two no well I I have friends okay how much of this stuff are you looking to get rid of I'm ready to
get rid of pretty much all of it then why is it that when I walked in earlier you had the garage divided down the middle between things that you are planning to get rid of and the much larger pile of things that you're planning to keep when I wrote the script I was planning on lying and hi hiding a bunch of stuff from you but uh I came around to my good senses and I need your help to get rid of it all why don't we start with everything that you had already resolved to get rid of let's go
over here like this for example is something that I could actually see you justifying to yourself This is a scope but for Sega yeah it's basically their light gun version for the Genesis it's like modular which is kind of cool for Nintendo Wii I actually got these uh one of my free pickups oh my God there's three of them the Wii ones are actually highly desirable for PC modding cuz you can play use them in Clone hero so they're actually very useful uh but I don't know if I have the
motivation anymore to mod them to clone here them so are these in the pile yeah those are all in the pile I I might keep one next up we could do something that I'm actually unsure about which is all my analog consoles so I am a big fan of these analog fpga consoles I have the Genesis the Super Nintendo one the turbo Graphics one and I also have the pocket and I love them and I love being able to put the cartridges in and use them and it's all super easy but if I'm going Mis you don't need them
bye okay no they're in the right place then don't take them back over there tell me about this one there's actually not much modding to that one it's been soft modded and I just replaced the shell like most of the stuff that I do when I mod it there's probably like a missing part I think there's missing uh something but it works how many we did you keep zero really I'm going full emulation with Wii we're going dolphin baby wow so do you have your weot working on PC and everything I tried I
got third party remotes from AliExpress that don't really play nice with PC so that's something I still need to figure out got it what you have all this stuff and you don't have any first party Wii remotes I have like one people don't give away Wii remotes they give away wi okay we've got a PSP 3DS Game Boy Color Game Boy Advance Game Boy SP uh Swan more Game Boy Advance I think there's like nine or 10 game boys maybe not quite and all of them are probably the worst way to experience the games for
these platforms I think this one has been modded it has the IPS screen and so that's actually a pretty sweet way to play Game Boy Advance games do you want to you want to lot turn it on sure what do you want to play oh David I'll play Rugrats okay oh don't do that why is it in the key pile this is not the key pile this is that actually is just I was going to get clear containers so it was  off I don't even know if this works David no I'm kidding I'm kidding I'm not going to do that I'm not going to do
that 1999 Viacom International Inc license by Nintendo backlit screen can't even see what's on this screen yeah this actually looks pretty darn good I never had a Game Boy Advance really yeah you want one nope really switch doesn't make the cut there's another switch in there somewhere that is making the cut this one's a V1 so it's modded and a modded V1 doesn't make the cut you'd rather have the OLED I'd rather have a PC capable of playing switch games so then why are you keeping a
switch it's not mine it's it's my kids you must have spent an absolute fortune on this if I look at my price charting collection just the Retro stuff is worth about 32 Grand Canadian and I'm pretty good at recording what I've spent and I've spent about 7 Grand so I did pretty good in terms of value to what I have but you have so much stuff if you're not realizing that value it's an unrealized game it's exactly it's nothing so this is stuff that I don't have any particular attachment to I have Xbox
games and lots of PS2 games that I'm keeping why do you even own this I bought a lot of stuff with the intent of making content about it I never got around to it I'm just not focused enough but I was going to be like let's find the worst games ever so I think there's a bunch of Pixar games somewhere uh and I was going to be like I'm going to do a Roundup of all the worst Pixar games there is so much here we can't hope to fit in the YouTube cut so if you want to see the extras lmg g/f flat plane we're
going to have it linked down below this I'm a little bit interested in you have a Japanese Final Fantasy Tactics this has got to be worth something yeah they're worth less than North American copies but they're still worth something really why is that RPGs were a lot more popular in Japan around this time and so like there's just more copies available this is such a good game though today play it go play it today genuinely good how how the bloody many copies of Dragon
Quest 7 do you have I would buy big lots of games from Japan so I'd get these boxes of like 100 games or whatever and I would kind of sort through them and and donate or sell the rest with the idea of getting games that I couldn't really afford North American copies like uh cloa door to the Phantom a it's like $150 $200 game and I want it but I don't want it that bad but in Japan it's like 15 bucks it looks weird on your shelf not having everything match so like I've got to get a whole Japanese shelf and so
that became a whole thing no that is not logic out of this is logic enough looking at the shelf of things he already recognizes that he needs to get rid of the point of helping someone is not to kick them while they're down the point of helping them is to help them and I think we need to go over to the other side of the things he thinks he's keeping so this is my PC stuff old Bluetooth a bit do stuff okay Genesis SN transparent 360 controller yeah and you've got to have at least one 360
controller is this the only one this the only one St I have to say I'm surprised you don't have more four Xbox One and Xbox series controllers though I don't have an Xbox console I haven't owned one since the 360 days but they're so great for PC it's just plug and play I like my AIT one okay this seems pretty reasonable this is a lot of PlayStation controllers I use those for PC2 dual shock 3 that's a PS1 controller dual shock 4 how many dual shock 4S do you have I used to hold on a second David
you're up to six brother seven eight I used to have multiple PS4s and multiple roommates and so we would like need all those nine also dual shock 4 is actually a great all-arounder controller you can connect it to your Mister you can connect it to your PC it's got a good d-pad and so this is like my go-to I can play anything controller David yeah you used to live with a bunch of Roommates you used to have a bunch of PlayStation 4s you used to have friends I demand you get rid of five of them I got get five
or four you can keep one spare I'm surprised at how easy that was you really have changed I'm ready to make a change in my life wait how many memory cards do you need though well not all some of those are just Wireless dongles for the the thingies look I I got to show you the bin of PlayStation controllers I'm getting rid of then you'll understand why this is such a success okay let's have a look good gravy brother I think there's like eight PS2 controllers in there like five or
six PS1 ones and like several PS3s it's ter we made a video about this you included it in a video about fixing your controllers and then you were like yeah sometimes it's not worth actually fixing it and this is a good good idea is this just PlayStation yeah oh yeah you want to see the Xbox uh Xbox one that's kind of nice yeah I resolved that I was not buying anything from him before I came I had to tell myself that before I even saw anything because it's probably wise
I think you know that I would be tempted like I'm so tempted right now like I have some drift issues with my wireless Xbox 360 controllers keep I'll keep it aside for later oh this one's so cool too  screw wle wle wle oh my God okay how much for a sest controller for you yeah I need one I don't know like 10 bucks well no no no no I'll pay a fair price feel like 10 bucks is fine I I have no idea what they're were I think they're like 20 bucks I'll take this one okay I like your LTT cable tie
definitely not stolen from work damn it I bought one thing just the dam is broken I lent Luke one of mine because he's finally playing Final Fantasy 3 I've been badgering him or six but three for SNES I've been badgering him for years to play it and I was like play it with a SNES controller so I lent him one of my SNES controllers and my USB adapter it's Luke so I'm probably never getting it back so so Luke me $10 yeah basically what do you think Super Nintendo multitap should I keep it no
there's like four games yeah but they're support yeah but you could play them on an emulator I mean that's part of this whole thing is you're trying to simplify everything down to the things that you actually need in order to enjoy the games that you're going to actually play that's true so hold on a second with that in mind are we not cutting deep enough wait how did this end up over here I have no idea David you want it no this goes back in the bin I feel like we haven't done
enough of this up until now this is like you're supposed to actually not just be recouping money for the new place you're right you're supposed to be saving space and making the new space one that can be enjoyed not just by you and sweaty weird retro nerds but also like by the kid and Theo and guests and stuff you know like adulting okay okay okay keep a PS2 okay Devil's Advocate you've seen what's happened with PS2 emulation in the last week it's basically perfect now why wouldn't you keep something that
actually has a practical purpose for when you need to play a game with perfect Fidelity you do not need this but emulation is so good that I don't need any of this okay great but I want it I want it so bad dude you have even more Dreamcast control you don't need to keep a bunch of Dreamcast controllers what are you talking about those are the ones that I'm like I have to keep how many four why power stone 2 when's the last time you played Power Stone 2 two years ago and when was the time before 
controllers two what about two original ones that are cool and two modern ones that are also great you don't need them can't you play Dreamcast games on an emulator with a different controller you can Dude the layout's not even like uniquely anything you could get any number of different controllers and experience this layout a dual shock 4 I need more bring them back you have enough dual shock fours are you keeping a Dreamcast I was planning on keeping one Dreamcast I think you should ditch
the Dreamcast what are you going to play with loading times no it has the SD card reader David that's two dream casts yeah but one has an optical drive so get rid  so it has a gdm so you can play games from an SD card it's awesome it's pretty awesome I think we should limit the amount of consoles I'm allowed to keep to five I have like 50 lonus okay that's 10% I'll tell you what five including your Mister says four fine four including the mister okay Dreamcast would be one of those okay and
the SD card one yeah yeah yeah yeah for sure pick three moreing kill me Sega Saturn emulation is actually pretty mid it's never been that popular and so no one's really bothered to go all the way out this one's also modded with an SD card this is a very good console and I actually use a fair bit can I make a suggestion yeah no more  two but I like them oh my God you're right I have to no I can't what are you going to do with an OG Xbox look at it nothing I don't know but I I won't be
able to do it if it's gone what are you going to do with a Panasonic 3dio interactive multiplayer real probably nothing yeah you're not going to play a 3DO game dude but I'll play PS2 yeah but you're going to play it on an fpga or on a PC you're not going to play it on that you're going to use upscaling and upgraded textures the experience is actually better you're right it's better but it hurts the PS2 is my favorite well then it can be one of your four just recognize you're not going to
use it I need the money okay it's gone it's gone actually very proud of him he's getting into the market he's worked very hard to save up well hey at Le you know what no no to his credit though he's been a relatively responsible collector buying low eventually selling high and my understanding is this is a big part of the down payment oh I've already the down payment is already separate this is for fixing the house so I bought a place that needs repairs and needs a lot of
work this money is going towards getting the house to aable but this was a part of enabling oh 100 1 million per. I would not have been able to do it without all of this then we need to dig deep so we can keep the Saturn because emulation is not in a good State everything else here emulation is fine remember it's about what it's about if you're a collector and the purpose is having a collection then that's one thing but if you're a gamer and and David's a gamer and the idea is to
play the games when you want to play them then we've got to keep the objective in mind which is get the house fixed up yes and game I we don't need these things for that however what I would say is that a game Corner could absolutely have some games especially ones that are very meaningful to you as part of the decor even if you fully understand the point is not to play them  dude that one I don't think has any games in it okay that one's just records I was going to say
this wait no no records there's not very many records oh God there is some stuff oh my God David it can go I genuinely don't know how that got in there that's not mine baby that's not my bag baby why do you need it is that you don't need it you know I'm right I don't know you know what sure I'll allow it this is a very cool Lion King statue yeah I just got it I wanted to try it I think if you can work this into the decor that's probably fine okay you'll notice I didn't tell them to get rid of all the
guitars for example there are video game experiences that are not easily replicated with a generic you know 8bit do controller but I expect to see that in the final setup as part of a tastefully decorated Corner man see I want I started out not wanting to be too bossy and stuff but I realized you can't intervention unless you get a little bit bossy how many consoles am I allowed to keep you've got two plus the mister uh you wanted to keep your Neo Geo right I want to keep this Neo Geo okay you're
keeping the PS2 he took the damn PS2 while I wasn't looking you don't need that but I want okay you know what you know what I'm putting here for now until I find something to replace it tasteful Decor yeah because you've kind of got a thing going on with your transparent modded consoles that's kind of the idea that's sort of what prioritized consoles I was keeping is if they look good okay fine that's four though you don't get any more you have to sub one out if you I think that's fair why is this PS3
buried in blankets get rid of it no no can't it's not even the cool fat backwards compatible one you're not wrong PS3 I could kind of see because PS3 emulation is still not perfect it's pretty good though it's pretty good I would keep this over the PS2 though that's for sure once you've set it on camera you're committ though you're right cuz this is going to be like what the lot is so you can't say oh yeah something's going to be available guys you are going to get a chance to
take a crack at this stuff David's going to be putting it up as soon as this video is up so you can't bamboozle them and when we come look at the finished corner you can't hide stuff the Integrity of the house cleaning we're doing has to be maintained P it out wow you swear on I swear I won't bamboozle or hide anything on Chrono Trigger that's a serious gamer pledge is this pretty much it for the games that you had planned to keep the  okay guys this is not haming it up for
the camera that is a look of actual concern consternation I think is probably the word I'm looking for I'll tell you what mhm for every modern console no questions asked keep whatever for every retro console I want you down to 10 games what if I say zero on some consoles can I take that 10 and move it to a different console no I don't think I can do it I don't think I can do it David the point of this is what can be Tastefully displayed on essentially a console unit or a shelf how about this
for every entire console you eliminate you can have five more games this is the worst day of my life it comes from a place of Love David probably keep Mario Strikers probably keep we should start with the not keep David 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 no but that's only 60 FPS version soulcaliber 2 bye bye-bye I did it really GameCube was easy there's only eight games to get rid of yeah PS3 is going to be a little bit harder there's so many games 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 you can trade
a whole console do you want to trade Away Genesis no okay okay okay okay I'm not counting anything as a console that you have less than five games for though if you have one game of something that does not count I said it was a two to one trade I'm letting you get away with one to one okay okay I don't need two copies of the Puppeteer what did you mean we're going to keep two two copies of it yeah how is this paring down one one is sealed and the other one I play no you can keep a
sealed one and play an emulated one I know you're right now now that I'm doing that that makes more sense oh my goodness this is really cool too because it really gives people some insight into what games are important to you and what games they're going to have a shot at in the auction all right I'm so sorry David this one's going to be hard Playstation One some easy ones that I know I have to keep like Symphony of the nights my one of my favorite games of all time oh my
god well I have seven that are like not negotiables that I have to keep I feel really bad he's not putting it on for the camera he's genuinely struggling with this right now but having gone through a big move recently and seeing how much better it is to declutter my life as part of that process I think it's the right thing and if this wasn't what he really wanted he didn't have to ask me to come here and make him make these hard choices but he did the video I pitched was very
different than this one so surprisingly didn't keep any final fantasies even though the PS1 has pretty pretty much everything up until n nine so good seven overrated didn't keep Final Fantasy Tactics the copy I have is like a half like the case isn't legit so I don't feel too bad about getting rid of it okay but the disc is real the disc is real you want it no maybe you know what how about this David to take some of the sting out of it I'm going to give up my vow but I will pay
you double market value for anything I buy price charting is Market value sure I'm going to buy tactics I'll buy that Nest controller so far I've played tactics so many times and confession time I've never owned a legit copy I've been meaning to have one because I played through it four times 20 bucks just just with the disc okay cuz the case isn't really worth much cuz it doesn't have the instruction manual so 40 oh yeah you're doing double oh yeah so anything you can sell me yeah oh okay
so 40 oh sheesh okay okay so I'm doubling that SN controller so I'm saying another 50 I'm adding that to the  this let's do an easy one Dreamcast easy well easy in terms of the sheer number that you're going to have to get rid of okay crazy pitch I sacrificed the the Dreamcast for five more of something else what you're going to sacrifice the Dreamcast I'm not going to play toy Commander Quake 3 it's kind of fun to play with the terrible control scheme Sonic Adventure there's way
better ways to play it uh this is just AO you really need Crazy Taxi like I like I do like these games I want to keep those but remember you kept a Dreamcast so you're going to have to take a bit of a position then on playing games you didn't keep physical copies for oh knowing of course that Sega is not going to make a dollar from any of this anyway well and they're re-releasing several of these games or REM making some of these games and I am going to buy those like the new Crazy
Taxi you can bet your ass I'm going to be buying that okay look I've never said that piracy is something you can't do what I've said is you need to find your own personal guiding star for it for now I'm not keeping any Dreamcast games okay so you've got five credits in the bank it's time to look at the Sega Saturn you break it and you buy it I guess that works out for you cuz it's double the price if I buy anything don't break SI Saturn stuff you won't like the double price on the S of Saturns some of
these are like just cases if I actually "had this game it' be like 1,500 bucks" so I don't have it Mr Bones is so cool it's time for a really hard one here comes PS2 PS2 is impossible have you seen how many PS2 games there are the stress  David how am I doing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 nine this is the last of the PS2 games where's the pile to be sorted still uh this has all been sorted don't forget you've given up Dreamcast so far you could use your extra five on PS2 it's weird once I've kind of like started
calling I realize that I don't need them most of them don't actually mean that much do they no PaRappa the Rapper 2 makes the cut Banger one of my favorite alltime games crack the egg into the bow crack crack crack the egg the bowl we're going to bake as a cake we never oh there's more there's more oh my god oh there we were about to do the aftershot and we found another pile of PS2 okay well here um um maybe Monster Rancher  swap the only question with Xbox and Xbox 360 is if you want to for gold them
completely no I can't that's uh Jennifer halil that signed that at 360 I'm keeping mostly so that I can emulate these cuz I want to like make my own little remaster of Lost Odyssey but I don't really need golden eye Sega Genesis Mega Drive there's more um um um 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 okay it's time for a really hard one I might use my 10 credits five credits I believe you have 10 keep keep keep keep keep keep keep I could get rid of this this is a Repro this is also a Repro 14
15 I actually saw five credits somewhere if I want to recover some how dare you disrespect pilot wings like that this is my childhood David how much did you want  it you did a good job on this that's cash money I can't look at it I don't think we're done yet what are left oh oh oh no do you have any credit left for SN I have five I have your Chrono Trigger here brother I have F that's obviously coming okay I'm I'm not even that's not negotiable okay yeah that's fine what else are we looking at
here so this is a drone gimbal yeah none this stuff super interesting there's a lot of cables here but I feel like that's something that you can go through in Purge once you're done setting up and you realize you don't need all of these cables and they can go we did pretty well today you you can say that I'm impressed both by how much you had decided on your own to get rid of before I got here and how much more you managed to add to the pile once we went through it together there's definitely some
stuff in here that's super cool and there are collectors out there that are going to be extremely lucky to get their hands on them like what are these PS2 are those Dev kits they're PSX so they're Japan only DVR ps2's they're very rare they're very sought after cuz they don't usually work these ones all turn on and the hard drives work the lasers are kind of going in all three of them but they're still very sought after especially the one that's in the Box super cool yeah so look forward to
