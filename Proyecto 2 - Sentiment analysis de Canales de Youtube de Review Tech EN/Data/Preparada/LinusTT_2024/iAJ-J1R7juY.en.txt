I've been put in a really difficult position here I love my Rog Ally it's my go-to handheld PC and after spending some time previewing the allyx it is so much better that what I want to do is the same thing I did last time and tell you guys run out and buy it right now but what if Asus does the same thing as last time what if there's a flaw in the hardware and they not only refuse to issue a recall but refuse to acknowledge it at all they've got some serious commun trust issues to address and my
hope is that by the time we release this video they will have taken decisive action that I can display on screen right now to help set their company on the right path because if they can do that the Alli X is sick I mean our Hardware isn't technically final but guys they have fixed everything chassis more comfortable thumb sticks better materials and replaceable with Hall effects from ghil kit expensive XG mobile expansion interface replaced with industry standard USB 4 and guys that's
just for starters now given that this is a preview Asus wouldn't authorize the publication of graphs but hey they did leave the device in our hands and we do have a testing lab so I might make some let's call them predictions about performance that are going to blow your mind even if you feel like you can't trust Aus right now speaking of companies you can't trust how about our sponsor dbrand those freaking guys I half expect something to pop out of it and like stick into my eye they recently
launched their kill switch case for the original Rog Ally and it's getting rave reviews over on Reddit it dramatically improves the digging in of the bottom corners and the grippiness is just outstanding check out dbrand.com Killswitch if you want to grab one for your ally or steam deck or hey if you don't want to buy anything and you just want to harass them to make one for the  let's begin with what the Alli X isn't it isn't the Alli 2 so there's no major Leap Forward for gaming performance in
order to achieve that Asus would have had to wait for amd's strix Point mobile chips which would have increased the devic's price dramatically it also isn't a major leap in screen quality in fact Asus says that they not only are aren't using an OLED display they're using the exact same panel as last time with that out of the way there are performance improvements and some of them are big we're getting more memory at faster speeds and a truly impressive doubling in the rated battery capacity and all of
this is somehow without tipping the scale it is heavier than both the old Ally and the steam deck OLED but it's within Striking Distance of the original steam deck and honestly guys to my hands it doesn't really feel that noticeable now we were very interested in how gaming battery life would be impacted by this changing capacity and here comes my first prediction I predict that the Lix will not last three times as long as the original but that it will last considerably more than twice as long
both in endurance and in full stress situations so I predict that you will no longer be stuck plugging in if you want a game at full performance for longer than about 45 minutes absolute game Cher and while we are still limited to amd's Z1 extreme Apu the additional 8 gigs of ddr5 for a total of 24 gigs running at 7500 megat transfers per second should result in a few more FPS in your favorite titles now not every game is going to see a big uplift for example I predict that grid Legends will test
basically the same on both devices but while the unit that I'm holding is still defaulting to 10 15 and 25 watts for each of the stock power profiles Asus has told us that the plan is to launch the new ally with each profile increased by 2 to three Watts since they've got all that extra battery headro now that should result in minor but measurable increases across pretty much every game let's play with it I got to say the color it's not as striking it definitely looks more generic almost like They're
copying the MSI claw now but white is not a good color for something that you're going to have your grimy meat hooks all over I want to do a blind test for weight okay okay blindfold me wait no I have a better idea I'm going to take this wonderful dip eye hoodie from LTT store.com and do this with it how many fingers am I holding up three no he's wrong all right he's blind I'm going to have to be careful not to touch the bottoms cuz it's more rounded on the new one I like that way better so I'm just
going to kind of grab them like a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle here's the first one okay so this is one okay okay you got that here's the other one oh man when I held that first one I was like oh that's definitely the new one but now I'm not sure number one feel like I'm at the option okay and two this is the original yeah okay you're right it's really close let's have a look at some of our other changes here I can't say that I particularly know notice the difference in material
on the joysticks but with that said plof you didn't mention the ring on the top I actually really like that how it kind of Cups the tip of your thumb a little bit better big fan of that oo and they're tighter so you can replace them with thumb sticks from ghilly kit but you may not want to at least not until they die ABX y button sit a little bit higher you know what I think I like that too I remember remember having this debate with the Ian Neo guys they switched over
to more of a a micro switch style button and I was like oh guys I really don't like that and they're like well we do and I was like okay cool I guess I'll daily an ally now this is even more better for from my perspective ooh triggers are bigger ooh yeah that's nice and these rear buttons are a lot smaller as someone who doesn't really use them honestly I consider that an improvement I'm going to hit them accidentally way less often you can actuate them from any direction oh oh interesting you can mash
them like that like that like that or like that or just press them yeah the old ones do not have that capability more venting cool cool I'll never say no to that standing in basically the same spot in Ghost of sushima running at 1080p medium without any frame gen or any kind of dynamic res ution scaling or anything like that I predict that we will see frame rates anywhere from about 5 to 10% better it's not a lot and it might not even be the kind of thing that you would notice day
today but it is measurable even if we couldn't measure it it's definitely heavy but so was the old Ally I think the deck might be a little stiffer not by much and this is technically pre-production but it's good I didn't know notice how much thicker it was for how little more it weighs of course ghost of sushima is not a game where we're going to be able to take advantage of the high refresh rate display unless we're running it very very low detail settings so let's close
this down and try something where we can all right that is smooth I suspect that this is going to be something of a controversial choice because hey the steam deck OLED it's OLED it's HDR you get none of that here but what you do get is 120 HTS and something that I think is maybe more important than any of those things on a handheld you get variable refresh rate and when you're going to be dealing with frame rates in the 20 to 40 range it's something that can make a very very noticeable difference in
animation smoothness how about this Asus two versions H allix allio it's emulation guys especially later consoles like the PS3 it's heavy cuz it not only hits the GPU hard it hits the CPU super hard as well so having that extra battery man makes it a much more viable use case here's Demon Souls running an rpcs 3 am I seeing a difference in performance no but am I seeing that PS3 emulation is totally a thing on these devices yes now guys the keite among you will have probably noticed that in addition to the
other changes we've talked about already we've now got two USBC ports on the top this left one is just USB 3.2 gen whatever uh but the one on the right is a full fat Thunderbolt compatible hopefully USB 4 port and there are a couple of reasons why this is freaking awesome the first is that with two ports you're a lot less dock dependent if you want to plug in PC peripherals or in my case on that long flight to Japan plug in an external USBC Monitor and charge at the same time the second is that the
ability to plug in an egpu via Thunderbolt will allow you to supercharge this thing for gaming on a bigger screen without being stuck paying desktop prices for laptop grade XG mobile gpus oh and while the battery may have doubled charging time hasn't thanks to 100 watts of power delivery Support over those USBC ports now unfortunately though the included charger didn't get leveled up at the same time so you'll need a third party one in order to take advantage of that boo now a second thing
that you Keen IR probably noticed is that the micro SD card slot has moved about that thanks to this article from hackaday that was published on May the 4th it looks like someone is finally shining a light on what the heck was going on with those Ally failures even if Asus refuses to do so if hackaday is correct which I predict that they are The Thermals were never the issue the issue is that they used a certain model of PTC fuse that is prone to failure now we're going to have the article Linked
In the description down below and what we're also hopefully going to have is a strong decisive statement from Asus that acknowledges the situation and lays out a path forward that takes care of their many Ally customers or as I'll be calling them allies in fairness to Asus they have covered the SD failures so far and they've increased the coverage for that issue from one year to two but that's not enough what I want to see from them here and going forward is better transparency we have no idea what
percentage of the original allies were or will be affected and Asus still hasn't formally acknowledged that it's a hardware flaw which I predict that it is and if it's a hardware flaw that sounds to me like the kind of thing that should either be recalled or proactively dealt with so until this gets cleared up and Asus manages to demonstrate that they can be trustworthy again it doesn't matter how much I might like the Ally X like okay have you guys ever heard someone say don't hate the developer
hate the studio I feel kind of the same way here the Alli EX Team should be so proud of this they should be so proud that they helped Asus finally find incredible but even if I might make the personal choice to buy one I'm not going to be able to recommend it even though I really want to I predict that The Thermals will improve by more than five but less than 10° thanks to larger heat pipes and more fan blades the board and Chassis have been redesigned so we can fit a double-sided 2280 SSD and here
guys you can put up to an 8 terabyte SSD in this thing and speaking of capacity it comes with one Tab out of the box now which is double the previous generation it's 100 bucks more for fundamentally the same cor specs but this is more than the sum of its parts which actually I wonder is it more serviceable why don't we take it apart find out oo wow that's a lot of battery look at it go I like this here's the daughter boards for the joysticks so replacing those is as simple as I mean what did I take out
six screws plus another three per daughter board and a little ribbon cable that flipping awesome these fans are tiny based on how much quieter it sounded to my ear that is not what I was expecting to see I mean how often is that ever happen you make a smaller fan make more or less noise like sure I guess so heat pipe sticker there's the big SSD slot that is so awesome I I was really irrationally so but really upset that the original Ally Only supported 2230 it's just like really you can't
make it just a little bit bigger so we can put a fullsize SSD in this thing and they're cheaper too right the 228s just because of the economies of scale they they make a lot more of them there's more competition in 2280 vrms have thermal scho there one thing I would like to know is if the Wi-Fi card is a separate card I doubt it I suspect it's soldered but I wouldn't mind knowing that uh Wi-Fi chip is soldered that's all I really needed to dig further to find out kind of a bummer we saw this
with the steam deck where the OLED came in like yeah we've got like way better download speeds now dude like yeah but if you had just had a mini PCI slot on the board in the first I understand I get it integration saves cost you know but I would like to see replaceable Wi-Fi modules on these in addition to replaceable storage the more I like this thing the more disappointing it is that Asus just can't get their reputation in line I guess the Silver Lining is that they've still got time the Alx doesn't
actually launch for about another month and I'd like for a moment to directly address Asus leadership here to say that I look forward to seeing a commitment to real lasting change and I also look forward to telling telling you about our sponsor dbrand they say their Rog Ali   not bad dbrand not bad check it out at the link in the video description thanks for watching if you guys enjoyed this video maybe take a look at our ion Neo coverage that we've done over the last couple of years they make neat little
handhelds just even more expensive
