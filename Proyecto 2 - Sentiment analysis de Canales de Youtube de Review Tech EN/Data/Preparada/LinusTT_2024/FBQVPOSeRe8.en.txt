and welcome to the W show we've got a lot of great topics today Ubisoft says gaming subscription success requires Gamers to be comfortable not owning games I mean I for what I'm comfortable not owning their games if that's their attitude about it means um in all seriousness though they're probably going to win this but U any I don't know about that it has been officially confirmed Now search engines are in fact getting course a recent study revealed that uh yeah it's not just Google it's
across the board pretty much what else we got today did I manage to steal your too you sure did uh and then I found a a a makeup one and I lost it Fujitsu agrees it is morally culpable in 700 plus wrongful convictions ooh which is a rough thing to agree to yeah also uh everyone's been raging at YouTube for for going after their computer performance uh and it was an ad blog bug whoops we'll talk about   that the show is brought to you today by deom ag1 and oh no I missed
it I I missed the last one uh odd pieces tremendous why don't we jump right into our headline topic today and that is that Ubisoft uh during an interview about the launch of the new Ubisoft Plus premium and classic subscription okay hold on actually we're going to get into this in a second shout out Ubisoft okay I don't think anyone puts more work into rebranding their than Ubisoft okay okay you got what how many names has their stupid launcher ever had come guys hit us in the chat okay I
think it was you play at the start you're the look on your face by the way amazing um Ubisoft connect is one of them uh no I don't so I think it's Ubisoft connect now I am bear goes it's not you play anymore no no no formerly Ubisoft game launcher yeah I think that's what it started as yeah okay okay yeah that's according to Tony B 486 in the float plane chat it's Ubisoft plus now it's not even Ubisoft connected anymore Ubisoft plus uh okay hold on I think the game launcher is still called Ubisoft connect
I don't think we can take everything float plan chat is saying is Gospel truth skate Ruben says was it origin at  EA yeah it's not it's not Ubisoft plus it's it's Ubisoft connect Ubisoft plus is their Subscription Service those are that we're talking about the launcher right now um the launcher was originally called Ubisoft game launcher and then up playay up playay was actually a good name in my opinion uh they had an online pass called you play passport okay uh this was back in like 2012 or 201 13 you
play plus a monthly subscription service that gave you access to over a 100 games in the Ubisoft catalog was introduced at E3 2019 cool uh and then hope you like Far Cry and Far Cry derivatives in October 2020 this is all from Wikipedia so take it for what it is probably fine in October 2020 apparently up playay and Ubisoft Club were merged into Ubisoft connect that makes sense and then as part of the Ubisoft Plus what um wow uh so anywh who let's get back to um the launch of the new Ubisoft Plus premium
and classic subscriptions what the these things are I don't know without looking them up I assume they are some kind of subscription service that may or may not have anything to do with their Launcher Cool their director of subscriptions oh my God they have a director of subscriptions because of course they do I've got it I've got the difference between class PR all right help me out so classic in Canadian dollars is 10 bucks a month and premium is 20 bucks a month in classic you get a
selection of 50 plus means hold on can you help me out with something really quick here sure how many games does Ubisoft actually launch every year that's why I said Far Cry and Far Cry derivatives one thing to note though is that they are a publish don't forget about Assassin's Creed and Assassin's Creed derivatives uh Assassin's Creed at this point is basically a far cry derivative hot this is coming from someone who likes Assassin's Creed okay that's but they all just follow the go to the tower
reveal the map continue forward model I see yeah anyways no I haven't forgotten about I haven't played the most recent one I haven't forgotten about ano that's actually just published by Ubisoft though so that's that's they are a publisher and they do publish a decent amount of games yes people like track Mania yeah but now hold on just a gosh darn second here because $20 a month last time I checked is over $200 a year yeah it's a lot of money actually so given that PC games only cost you know full
price if you are buying Nintendo games or you can't wait like two weeks um you could buy like most of the games that Ubisoft releases that year and just doing a premium subscription would cost me more than I spend on Ubisoft games a year and I buy the games that I want to play like I'm not I don't I don't cheap out on games so I guess what you're trying to say is that a a better value for people's money would be a float plane subscription yeah we finally did it guys we finally interviewed the new
CEO yeah he's 6 months into the job now it took a little bit new okay maybe not so much but definitely in the grand scheme of things grand scheme of things definitely new it's up on float plane it's over an hour long it ended up running a lot longer than we had sort of yeah than we sort of planned to uh we took questions from the community also came up with some on my own and we kind of like Rift a little bit yeah yeah it was fun it was good so that's up on float plane along with a whole bunch of
other great exclusives um so they're director of subscriptions I'm I'm trying a new thing I ah man I actually feel really bad because I told I told Riley and Jessica okay I want to help you guys make Clips better so I want to try and keep the topics stop stop with that face I'm going stop okay I'm going to off I'm going to try and make the topics uh as clean as I can without random digressions and tensions that's never going to happen you just have to cap it off well I think I have made it going to
work either uh 19 words into this topic and have already gone on two major digressions I'm very sorry um I will do better ubisoft's director of subscriptions Philip trumbl observed that in order for video game subscriptions to really take off a consumer shift needs to happen where Gamers get more comfortable not owning their games just like other consumers got comfortable not owning  now In fairness to Mr tromble that's a good point I am perfectly comfortable at this point not
owning a CD collection I do not need a c CD collection H what would I need it for so that I can have a bunch of random plastic in my house so that I can get up like a caveman when I want to listen to a different track on a different plastic disc do you Archive music that's important to you cuz you archive movies that are important to you I only archive movies on a central server that you're not so much of a music guy I mean I listen to music every day yeah for probably but
are you like that into it over an hour a day yeah I wouldn't describe myself as into it I spend far more time listening to music than I do watching movies yeah but I think that's much more casually for me um it's less about the casualness or not casualness or honestly even the time spent doing it and it's more about the uh the convenience if I could stream Blu-rays with the touch of my finger the way that that I can stream an MP3 then I wouldn't bother to have those on a server in my house either I wouldn't
care are you not concerned about any of it going away I think that's less of a risk with music it's more of a risk with movies I think that my immediate reaction and this is going to be probably a little unpopular with someone um is that if a streaming service and uh I Believe YouTube music I know Google play music had this where if you had something in your likes or in your playlist or whatever else and it was removed from the platform it would leave a ghost like it would leave a that it was there
so you would never lose that oh yeah that was a song I like to listen to that add some significance or whatever um and then what I would what I would do immediately if a song was pulled off of the service that I use cuz I'm not going to subscribe to more than one is I would just go pirate it upload it to the service which Google Play supported and I believe YouTube music may also support I can't remember I haven't had to do it in a long time I know YouTube music can do local play sure but I wouldn't bother
with that that would be too much work but but Google play music you could upload it to your own private Cloud I don't know if that works anymore remember so I had like two songs that weren't available on Google Play music one of which I actually bought on iTunes because it was the only place I could find it and the other one I think I I ended up finding a download for it on a pirate site because it wasn't available on any streaming service so I was just like well okay then this the only actual way
I can get it that's how it's well I could have bought the CD and I could have ripped I could have ripped the file but I was not going to buy a whole album for one song and I believe all of the I believe those songs are now on YouTube music and so I I no longer actively do that but I can tell you if something disappeared from my playlist that would be the first thing I would do because I'm just I'm not interested um as for as for movies I think I just I kind of recognize the data delivery challenges
with having an ond demand just like instant Blu-ray doing the same quality as a Blu-ray be very expensive and you know what really interesting is we've talked about this already on the show but I'm seeing that discourse start to gain traction people are putting the hats on dude like hey oh no I don't mean that oh I mean that I I mean I'm I'm seeing people start to recognize how crappy Netflix looks oh yeah and like as there was a whole thread I I I I saw recently of somebody who bought a
Blu-ray as like almost a joke and then they watched it at home and they were like uh I'm going back yeah yeah because it looks like garbage yeah well no it looks amazing no I mean Netflix looks like garbage by comparison and nothing against Netflix they are it's a technological Marvel honestly I mean that yeah but it's there's there's just limitations 4K is not 4K in all situations 1080p is not 1080p yeah there's more factors than that yeah and Blu-ray looks really really good especially
like 4K UHD Blu-rays man I watched alien for the first time uh I have did I talk about this on W show before I'm not sure I I finally watched it right before CES I had never seen alien before and I watched it on that TCL TV I watched a Blu-ray it was incredible it looked so good I I just I don't think I could watch I don't think I would even want to watch a movie like that streamed from Netflix like The the the ambience of it it it's gorgeous it's yeah it's amazing spectacularly I had managed to
avoid almost all spoilers for it too like I just I got to watch it with fresh eyes it was kind of fun I don't think this increases convenience at all though like this this isn't coming back to you this isn't Gamers going from discs to to streaming services this is completely different no and and hold on a second because there is more that Mr trumbl said he said part of that is Gamers feeling secure in the knowledge that they won't lose their progress that their files won't be deleted and that
they won't lose what they've built in the game and there's the problem they will yeah they do yeah uh here hold on from Ubisoft this has happened hold on servers sh let's okay here it is you Ubisoft shutting down uh hold on decommissioning of online services for all the games okay here here here here here here's a here's a  Ubisoft okay so Assassin's Creed 2 is no longer available let's find something okay ano 1404 wait hold on if you ulc hold on hold on hold on what am I looking at
online services for older yeah okay so online services are closed for these games an 14 1904 America's Army uh that was only on Xbox that one a bunch of Assassin's Creed games uh were retired between 2014 in 2022 Beyond Good and Evil um Far Cry 2 shut down man actually a lot of Far Cry Far Cry 3 the 2022 release so for 10 years for 10 years 10 years is a long time 10 years is long enough that you could be 16 when you play this game and you could be 26 by the time they shut it down but
here's the problem with that what if you're 26 27 and you're like oh yeah I want to like go experience that the way that I originally experienced it like that game might have aged kind of rough but lots of games don't to be honest yeah like what about when when did Civ 5 come out what about just Dan's three kids okay probably not a good example Civ 5 came out in 2010 so it's over a decade old yep I play it every once in a while still yep that's not not even Nostalgia glasses and you know what I mean when I
was talking about how I was comfortable with this whole uh Subscription Service thing for music yeah that is a big part of why I'm comfortable with it because over time the quality of the library has improved not gotten worse although I have a lot that I could say about the YouTube music appus Google Play music got a lot worse the app got YouTube music is spectacularly trash compared to Google Play music if they just brought back the Google Play Music app so much better and I would just I
would I used to be like Evangelical about it like people would talk about how Shopify was so great and I'd be like youif I think you mean Spotify Spotify sorry you have not heard of the Google Play music Let me show you the ways uh and did I mention it comes with YouTube premium yeah and then they trashed it and I was like well I'm never showing this off again because I'm happy it comes for free free with premium I will not pay for two just like you said yep but it's a lot worse than Spotify so it
is what it is um so yeah a big part of why I'm comfortable with it is that convenience and and trusting that the service is going to continue to exist and also that if it doesn't then I could just jump ship to Spotify yeah or I don't know like title title there's a few uh apple apple music I could just I could just jump to something else whereas with Ubisoft well okay these games are their own games on their own platform um so I if for whatever reason I don't like what they're doing
with the platform there is no competition that I could jump to whether it's you know price increases or or or cutting the library or whatever else it is and I don't trust that those things are going to be maintained there's no reason to trust that all of the precedent has been that they won't be so like like very extensive precedent from a huge multitude of companies has been that it won't be our discussion question is what would it take for you to trust a company that has this kind of power over your
gaming library and I think we both know  answer no oh okay well I know the answer I want a commitment in writing that if any online services are to be terminated that they will be either open- sourced or there will be a good faith effort to negotiate with the Gaming Community to hand over the tools to continue that service uninterrupted I just don't think it's ever going to happen well I look I didn't say it was realistic I just said yeah that is right though I do agree that's what it would take for me to
trust them to just be like yeah it's all subscription now you you own nothing with that said it's not like it's really any different if you buy it you're still  it not always must the online services are they can just shut them down at their discretion yeah but if they did sign that thing well then I'd be fine with that too but I just mean it's not an option in either case our options right now are to give them all our money up front or to give them our money over time to not give them all our money
ever is that today that's this month that's a month wow you know what I will you want to see  it's I really wow ooh wow I hold on can you go back to that for a sec this really bothers me so from here look at the y- AIS on this chart yeah yeah okay so that's good go to the one month one I hate that yeah there should be one is that we or zero should be zero yeah I um there's there's an app that I use for monitoring stock prices not because I  I I follow the tech industry and if I'm
not paying attention to you know  is remember that compy Tex video I made where I was like you should invest in AMD by the way this is not Financial advice or whatever anyone who invested in AMD at that point I think that it's like it's like a four bagger now or something like that anyway the point is I do pay attention to it and one of the things that I I I don't do this very often but I noticed that I didn't like about the app and I actually went out of my way to message the developer of the app and ask
you know hey I'm I don't happen to be a paying customer of yours because I don't need any of your premium features because I'm just a looky L but um I would love to be able to fix the bottom of the Y AIS at zero because otherwise it makes the swings in value look enormous when in some cases they aren't that large to to some investors they might want to see that view though CU they might be trading on that level so that's valuable sure fair enough but but on that level also need to be able to
see can still be distorted because the thing is that not all stocks uh have a price that is directly comparable like depending on how many times it's been split for example totally so you could have a stock that's priced at $600 and it could have fluctuated from $580 to 600 0 and it could look like this giant line and then you could have another stock that's priced at around $70 and went from 30 to 70 and it looks like that same line but that's actually a really big difference yeah and they
were like nah my big thing here okay is actually this what that's what I was looking atga 15.72% year to date yikes that's the that's the like oh all did anyone buy AMD when I made that video someone in flo plane chat said they made a killing on AMD and in Nvidia Eric rorc says it's more like 10 times when you made that video worksman O2 said my Nvidia stock "purchas is up 13,000 per oh 1300% he" corrected it that's crazy uh Bean 710 I did just checked Jonas yes mad powder I'm up over 100 %
bre I wanted to but like can't cuz work and stuff oh man but I was I was yeah oh man all right yeah I I I was look I I think I made it clear at the time and I've made it clear since then I am not a financial adviser I am not an analyst or whatever but I was looking at it back then going dang it's not so much that amd's road map looks great it does look great it's more that Intel's road map looks like abs absolute doggy yeah and it's a duopoly people are going to   man J 529 says which stock should I buy
right now brother I want I no no Financial advice no I'm not I'm not giving any Financial advice I I man I can't believe what's been going on with Nvidia lately it's crazy I mean I shouldn't say I can't believe it I I do believe it it makes sense because they are a money printing machine basically every wafer that they can possibly get from tsmc what what was it rumored Facebook was buying billions billions of gpus for their AI Endeavors if I remember correctly Google passed uh their salary expenditure on
Hardware really I I I remember let me  insane meanwhile twitch chat would you recommend I invest my money in CS2 weapon skins yeah I mean honestly maybe I don't know I don't know anything about that but yeah uh November 24th Google reportedly now spending more on computer power than people yeah expect that to be a trend that continues yeah it's kind of scary um oh man hold on I was I was going to  um shoot no yeah yeah I left it hey do you remember when we had that private
conversation where I was like I really like the direction Intel's going if I was a stock buying person I would buy Intel and I think it was I think it was with you you told me hey I know someone who knows something about something and they're like no no no no man until it's like way up since then when would this have been uh like over a year ago was a while back basically it was around the time that Pat Ginger took over I don't remember this at all yeah okay that's fine um yeah the point is
they are they are on a very different trajectory than they were um and I think the argument of that person was something something arm something something data center something something and I was like yeah but I don't think you've really understood his vision for the company his vision for the company is to to be Intel and also  tsmc um which is a pretty big deal which is kind of a big deal so in the last uh cuz like if Nvidia is making big fat stacks so is tsmc yep and then by
Intel's logic so should they to be clear I'm not saying to do that today I I have no idea you know if it will continue on the trajectory that it's on and that would be a much longer term play I think a lot of people um stock more like gambling like they're expecting a payoff in 6 months or 3 months or a month or a day there's this whole thing where like current generation uh sees effective forms of gambling as the only way to make it so like yeah that kind of checks out man I was I read this interesting
article about how there's pretty much a generation of people now for whom competing and winning in a Mr Beast challenge seems like a more realistic way to change their situation in life than hard work because hard work is just not effective and it's like this is why I said what I said um back when Jimmy was facing a bunch of backlash for something stupid I can't remember what it was where I was just like yeah he's young he's like he's going to make mistakes like I I told him
Beast Burger was a mistake flat out I was like dude no um and he figured it out eventually so good on him for that like he he he makes mistakes but I think I I said I think his heart's in the right place I think I think Jimmy Donaldson for president I think he no stop I think he cares about helping people and I think that I think that he's the kind of person who looks at a resource like money and goes well yeah but like couldn't we just use this really effectively to make people's lives
better and he's doing it on a really really small scale that you know you can you can talk all day about you know um uh image sanitization with philanthropy or like you know the uh the the the corruptness of donations and blah blah blah you can kind of you can kind of attack from any different I don't I don't know him at all I think he would struggle really hard with the overpowering amount of corruption that there is in governmental systems I won't even say American governmental systems
I'm just going to say governmental systems in general yeah I think that's very fair like let's use our money in this way yeah and then you have to go through the armies of people that are in between you and that actual spend that are going to try to take all their own cuts that are going to try to scam it and whatever various way like all these there's a lot more war right now than there has been over the last while in general just all around the world um and something that keeps cropping up every
time one of these countries gets into a warlike situation is like wow the generals for all these various companies were really scamming the whole country really hard this whole time um so the generals for the companies countries countries yeah like if I remember correctly it was like uh I don't actually want to get into details but like yeah it's this it's this whole billions and billions of dollars from multiple different countries not not just like it's it's yeah it's really bad yeah I I think
you're referring to a situation where there was some some country whose military on paper was a lot better than it ended up being based on how much money they were spending on it because there was a lot of misappropriation of funds but there's also multiple countries that this has happened to and it's like oh yeah turns out it's like pretty much all of them was it you who was telling me that like the the US military pays hundreds of dollars for garbage cans or something like that oh
no it was it was way more than hundreds of dollars um is it was it garbage cans it was a garbage can milary I thought it "was 30 grand 3,000 shut up trash can" "hold on no stop the pentagon's $52,000"  can okay here we go I'm going to your laptop uh sure yeah okay it's on Y combinator where ises this responsible statecraft hold on I think that was the top link yeah military spending record highs contract is heighted of the cost of relatively simple items I love that cute little dollar tank
oh man uh so in 2020 the Pentagon paid "Boeing over $200,000 for four trash cans" yeah okay yeah this is it when the 707 fell out of use in the United States the trash can was no longer a commercial item meaning Boeing was not obligated to keep its price at previous levels according to the weapons industry so the  640 each for 11 trash containers resulting in a total cost of more than  Grand and how much is a Band-Aid at a hospital yeah that stuff is rough too  out Jimmy Donaldson running mate the ghost of
Bernie Sanders cuz he'll probably be  Jimmy I was like what's happening no did that happen no no no not yet I just I I think the biggest like reform that could happen in a lot of countries right now is like getting scams like this out of government spending cuz you look around and you're like there's a lot of taxes all the time you know there just everything gets taxed a lot all the time what does that go into and it's like genuinely hard to figure out and then you read stuff like this and it's like 
cool I mean that Boeing executive has to wipe his ass with money somehow yeah yeah I guess right yeah me meanwhile twitch chats takeaway here is I'm hearing invest in Mr Beast never change twitch chat yeah yeah yeah love you guys um yeah so uh things are frustrating and stuff okay and you don't own games anymore L got them all right second topic you want to pick one uh it's yeah I I I I I I hate to bring them up actually I don't at all I love it but I'm going to do it anyways um bg3 has
spoken out against this um Boulders Gate 3 mean uh I I I I mean Larry in studios oh okay Sven himself specifically I hope I'm saying that right um I think sven's a pretty common nameen uh let me try to find the  manufacturing um okay oh it's doing that thing where it's serving me all the tweets out of order cuz I'm not logged in nice I'm logged in I think Ubisoft subscription not okay to its credit typing x.com legitimately is faster than typing twitter.com oh cool I'm never going to remember
that I can't find it I can't find find it I think I can find it through my  on is this Brian Adams and Taylor Swift no way yeah so Sven Sven said uh whatever the future of games looks like content will always be king it's going to be a lot harder to get good content if subscription becomes the dominant model and a select group gets to decide what goes to Market and what does not direct from developer to players is the way getting a board to okay a project fueled by idealism is almost impossible
and idealism needs room to exist even if it can lead to disaster subscription models will always end up being a cost benefit analysis exercise intended to maximize profit there's nothing wrong with that but it may not become a monopoly of subscription Services um we we are already all dependent on a select group of digital distribution platforms and discoverability is brutal should these platforms all switch to subscription it'll become Savage in such a world by definition the preference of the
subscription service will determine what games get made trust me you really don't want that tldr you won't find our games on a subscription service even if I respect that for many developers it presents an opportunity to make their game I don't have an issue with that I just want to make sure the other ecosystems don't die because it's valuable what a Chad move we will not do this this thing sucks we want to build our games in the idealized way that we want to build them
sick they just keep doing cool stuff man ah so cool I don't know I just wish they made games other than that yeah cuz I kind of couldn't get understand that but there're yeah I mean that's fair it's just not really your style of game which is fair but it's still a fantastic game I I'll take I'm going to take another run at it I'll take another run at it play it with yourself or like with me or something it's it's a huge time commitment it is huge and like it's a big deal and like if you
really want to enjoy it a lot of it's like okay even the game that shall not be named yeah the the amount of like places yeah and mechanics and the controls and stuff if you play a game for one hour and then like like I mean a new game like a modern game where it's not just like the tutorial is here's how to W ASD control for Crouch Mouse to look like play a modern a modern game that in a genre that you don't normally play okay play it for one hour you won't even probably be hard for some of these
nerds you won't probably even be through the tutorial go away don't touch it for two weeks yeah come back play another hour there can be some learning curve go away don't touch it for two weeks and come back and play another hour how do you it's so hard to get into it yeah yeah I I don't want them to to like weaken it though to be completely honest no I get it I get it it's it's a hardcore game for hardcore Gamers yeah 100% I get it's really really deep and they have a lot of
systems going on so there there's going to be some level of complexity I don't think it's too bad though and I'm I'm actually kind of like wondering what you got hung up on um cuz like there wasn't a large learning curve for original sin for me and or Divinity and you played Divinity and had no problems with it so like I well I I mean I was just kind of taging along with you like it was that was the that was the tutorial we were just talking to people and like I play Dragon
Age yeah I don't know I think a big part of it might have been because I was playing with um a non- gamer this is what I'm saying I no get I get it I get it I get it so on the one hand we were going extremely slow sometimes and on the other hand we were like blitzing through areas that are just like you know you you're like my gamer sense is tingling I should be doing this thing why to talk to these people uh wow this is a really non- methodical way of going through this settlement that is clearly
designed to be walked through this way you know like that yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that's part of it but also I I just I look at that game I see it in my library and it looks like I am going to spend at least 30% of this gaming session Googling controls trying to remember what was happening last time trying to figure out where the crap I am and honestly I'd rather just shoot some heads in Halo see like yeah I can't like tell you you're wrong but I feel like something's because of the power dynamic in our
relationship cuz that's that's what people will assume no because you're afraid to speak truth to power oh my God no it's just like you can't you can tell from his body language you can't tell someone who's like I'm having a hard time with this he  me just we spent like the entire video we were filming before this just  other H so yeah you you can't like tell someone who's like this is difficult for me that they're wrong but I do I'm wondering if there's like something in
particular that you're hitching on that I could just solve for you and then it would be over did they said to Blink if you need help oh my goodness um yeah it's nothing in particular I you know what okay all right all right all right all right all  right I'll play it you don't you don't like no look I I'm a man of my work I I watch Pirates of Silicon Valley I watched that other stupid crappy movie uh what was the third thing that I said I would do I played through the campaign
of Titanfall 2 I I committed I committed and I did them and I mean you know you don't seem to feel the same way about your commitments oh my goodness my computer cannot run the game stalling out I will I will play it soon sure I mean theoretically I'm getting that other one yeah that esper can save itself oh my goodness oh my goodness I actually really want to play it I have the you you let me that controller it's sitting right next to my mous pad cuz I like want to play it but
I just I can't I found out he was playing on a keyboard and I was like brother I got really good at the whatever yeah I got actually very good at the combo on keyboard like I emo asked me what I was doing one time cuz I was playing it I was like going so fast and she's like what's happening I was like I just memorized all the inputs don't tell them it's a lot easier on a keyboard it is way easier on a keyboard so it's time to actually have to deal with occasionally inputting a combo incorrectly which I
feel like it's actually correct because the reason why it's easier on a keyboard is because it's like broken and the reason he's so powerful is because there's a chance the com yeah and you're trying to go quickly because you have to get to the next action input like it's I want to play it properly like when I'm when you're doing it on keyboard it's like okay you go left and then angled left and then down you you actually just go left down down cuz there's no angled left so it I I don't know if it takes
left or down you can also just roll them or at least that was true in emulators I I my first time beating that game was not on my SN with my cartridge cuz I lost my Super Nintendo when I moved to my mom's house mhm I never I never got it back I have no idea whatever happened to that Super Nintendo so um as a kid I got stuck on the floating continent every time and I stop no this won't be a spoiler okay and I didn't know that you can cast magic outside of battle okay yeah yeah so
there's a particular dungeon that's rough at a particular stage in the game when potions are like little bit of Health little bit of health and you could only hold 99 of any particular item in your inventory so I would make get halfway through this stupid dungeon and run out of potions cuz I didn't know I could just cast cure outside of battle and uh or eventually had the older sibling of one of my friends like help me with it like can you pass this for me and my jaw just
about hit theor the second he cast out a battle the second they open you're like I could have obviously done this I haven't found it like partic the town I'm in right now is the hardest by a massive zo zoo a yeah everything else been honestly pretty easy um what are we talking about right now not a clue Boulders great gate three I oh because they 4 and slip Boulders great three it is yeah water only water can get through they they were looked at a little bit weird for not like joining Game Pass and
doing oh great oh my God that really good it took me took continue the topic I didn't like try to even bother understand what it was um they they were questioned a little bit as far as my understanding goes for not joining like Game Pass and stuff like that so I already knew they kind of had this stance but to reaffirm the stance in the light of this I think is very cool CU I  think in my opinion the quality of shows and TV and movies and stuff has maybe been dampened a little bit by the
subscription model um and I strongly agree with what he was saying about how that would happen to gaming because what's going to get funding is whatever can sell predictably yeah or whatever will will will be able to be played whatever going to for many hours retain subscribers on the subscription model yep so things like daily login rewards and stuff that keep people wanting to stay subscribed is going to be the things that get uh you know allowed to be made so that's not fun I don't like that
cool all right Dan did we ever do a second topic I think that was your second what was it uh that was Ubisoft says gaming subscriptions require Gamers to not own game no that was the first topic uh wasn't your second topic the bg3 one no that's not that's a top so no we never did a second top okay well let's talk about the SSD shortage that's expected this is not Financial advice but buy lots of ssds there's your next investment don't don't actually don't that's sell them on the street cor I I I 
nonvolatile where's my ding but don't do that uh prices of high capacity ssds are projected to spike by 15 to 20% due to a shortage of 4 and eight diand pack Pages while some of this price increase is already hitting retail it may be 2 to 3 months before the impact of these supply shortages hit consumers fully it is possible that this is a downline consequence of makers of 3D nand cutting production due to previously low demand notably 2023 was a no good very bad year for sales of
electronics however some OEM have significantly scaled up their purchases of ssds as of this quarter meaning that well well low supply high demand what happened to pricey he go up um our discussion questions how should users looking for an SSD deal with these kinds of shortages I would say that if you're on the fence um I would probably pick up an SSD now but understand that overall price for in general price goes down price for um price per capacity price for nand storage yeah generally
go down so I I would not actually recomm it as an investment yeah but if you're like I've been thinking about getting one and you feel like you probably will within the next X amount of months maybe do it sooner than later speaking of Investments it's time to find out how much I made on my Lego roller coaster what oh nothing what okay it's apparently still worth exactly what it was when uh when I bought it I don't understand what's happening well Lego retired sets can do really well oh okay
so you bought one right before it retired well I bought one of these like 3 years ago we only just finally finished building it because we lost a couple of pieces in the move well we lost a couple pieces before the move and then it was exacerbated by the move anyway we finally it's so cool this thing is so cool the cats love it like you just do things actually like Roll Along yeah it has a yeah it has a it has two trains or cars or whatever whatever they're called it goes do the cats just like watch it they
watch it sometimes they bad at it they brownie in particular freaking loves it you just you just sit there and it's so fun I'm watching him he's watching the coaster and I'm just turning the crank like moving the bringing the cars up to the top and he's just like like watch he's he's like so into it like sometimes he like goes at the mechanism for the for the track that drags the uh the trains I guess what the heck are they what's the word word for that carts trains whatever trains uh
drags the trains up the hill and then sometimes he like he goes and he like stops it on the track it's great I love it so much fun um I don't know maybe in another 10 years the vehicle is called the train all right good but yeah Lego Lego retired kits can be uh can be a very strong investment uh I think that just collecting hobbyist crap would be a really fun hobby SL investment do you think IP based ones would probably do better than like roller coaster it there was like a the office
set I feel like that might do pretty well I don't know man I don't know what I don't know if the office is going to be not the office maybe maybe there's some like I would say the kid ones are the stronger ones so kid today Nostalgia tomorrow yeah I don't think you're going to have the same kind of nostalgia for a Michael Scott Lego figurine necessar neily but then you never know because a big part of what makes something collectible is how many they sold and maybe the office set was not
particularly popular or maybe it was I actually just don't know uh but no I I would say the big ones are going to be the ones that are the hotness for kids "right now there was a $3,500 Pokemon" card for sale like it was insane uh if you think that's insane you should look up Pokemon cards for sale that doesn't even sound very high Z biggie you can't use it Linus that completely destroys the value all right well I'm over it I I I I am having my like $500 worth of fun with it for sure
my kids are my kids are enjoying it a ton I I am I am very anti collect it and put on a shelf and never look at it and make sure it doesn't have too much light and never touch it and never do anything with it I'm not I'm not into that I don't like it yeah all of Luke's Collectibles are digital he's big into  I was like huh remember nfts yeah good riddance to bad  okay when I found out how much the value of the like first tweet nft had gone down it was like a couple hundred a part of me was like yeah sure
you know like I like I the the idea of that it had been worth so much and that I bought it for so little was kind of amusing to me funny yeah and I was like I I would consider buying a couple of nfts for like $30 or whatever like at at this stage in the game I didn't end up buying any because it seemed like it's a lot of work dumb you're literally just like I could burn $100 or a couple hundred or whatever yeah there's no actual value I I you you've heard me give my Spiel to my kids
now right right multiple times yeah every single time we play Halo oh really no I don't think so uh okay fine then you should probably be able to recite it uh oh man I don't really pay attention remember we don't do that we don't if if you if you can't earn it whatever something see it clearly hasn't sunk in okay I'll have to do it more often you I don't need it it's always in the form of a question okay yeah okay do we spend money on things that we can't touch or even own no no okay and then we're is
that a smart thing to do no why not you know yeah like like it's a it's a whole it's a whole thing it's a it's a whole thing good I don't even I think it gets in my personal opinion I think it gets a little bit nuanced sometimes because I look at like how much value I got out of the thing sure like I think I've talked about this before but I bought some seasons passes for Rocket league and I think that was a good thing to do because I got the game on some insane sale for like five bucks and then I
played the heck out of that game so it like felt correct to contribute more to the thing yeah that's toally I didn't do it because I was like oh my God I want my skins for my car and then psionics got bought by epic games yeah yeah so I guess that worked out great for you well I mean pionic got more money or the valuation was potentially worth more whatever whatever like I'm still fine with it yeah now you can't buy rocket league on Steam so good job luk I still have it on Steam though it's entirely
your fault I didn't take it off of steam if you already had it well yeah but like okay my son wanted to get Rocket League he's like yo how do I get Rocket League I'm like well didn't you already have it yeah but he doesn't use my account anymore oh yeah he has his own account now and I was like okay we guess we could put epic gam store on the computers and then I like explained how I didn't really want to have like a bazillion launchers on these things and he was like oh yeah forget it then good kid yeah
yeah uh no you do not not have to have epic installed to play rocket league on Steam I think so not not the last time I did it it's been quite a while I haven't played rocket League you okay yeah no you don't um all right we're supposed to explain and do two merch messages but before we can do that I finally have done it what hold on I'm just heading to linest tech tips.com oh uh oh um hold on a second see if I can uh see if I can find something uh here we go here we go wait
L detectives.com here we go here we go here we go oh I see I have changed you  picture big change I know revisionist history what no that's not revisionist history I'm being erased would you like to know why I did such a thing yes thank you for playing along for a change you are such a butthead about this stuff sometimes I know the answer I know the answer I don't need the setup it's here ladies and gentlemen we have named this latest garment that you uh were noticing earlier on in the
show oh I've been like sweating in here wearing that stupid hoodie over top of this thing yeah we're calling it the Steve it looks pretty good of course it does it SS a t store what you talking about um it's not just any turtle neck okay the Steve is a mock neck with a seam up the middle like the iconic mock neck that the one and only Mr Steve Jobs famously wore oh yeah it's a whole thing some designer was like oh yeah that's really important to have that seam up the middle oh it has a little macad dress
logo yeah yeah I like that it's not like a crazy it's not like super tall yeah it's mock it's got a little bit oh I didn't know that but look at this I mean how cool it looks horse POS with the iMac oh I love it this is a great photo shoot oh no windows I enjoy that that's fun uh yeah so there it is very subtle but it's there this is great man everyone really got into the whole props thing with this shoot yeah Ariana from HR oh wow we got a lot of people  time that's the last one
nice anyway so I I have finally I have finally updated my profile picture uh Maria took this for me today during the shoot I think I probably could have gotten the facial expression a little bit better you know I think like I think I should have been down a little bit more I don't know but I it we we we did we did it pretty quick and realistically it looks better than the old one so I think that original picture that I took that was a still from an old episode of netlink which was the
news uh like Roundup that we did still are you sure NC Tech tips yeah it was it was a still from a video where I borrowed Billy from rma's glasses and I forget why I was doing like a Steve Jobs pose but it had something to do probably with the news that week and the video started zoomed in on me and then zoomed all the way out and I like break character completely you know what's funny is that picture has actually been a source of controversy over the years I have seen on not one not two but
many occasions people criticize me for having that like Steve Jobs pose profile picture because it illustrates that I have some kind of Messiah complex and believe that I am an innovator on the level of Mr jobs what the f are you talking about it's just a funny picture is meme is Is MeMe is okay yeah uh anyway we uh man I thought I took the picture but I guess it was just net linked so I was probably pressed record once yeah so we we put we put probably way too much work into this garment it's
been in development for over a year it's really nice it looks nice yeah it's like it's super it's a little on the heavier side you know like it's um isn't that usually what a shirt like that would be though that makes sense yeah but it's but it means it's a completely different garment like we couldn't we couldn't just use nope we couldn't use previous materials we couldn't use our previous p patterns cuz it has a very different neck uh so get getting stupid neck right
without it like punching up or whatever like God we went through so many samples um getting getting the look right so we what we discovered is that the fit of the original was very boxy not very  moderneditors it's a really cool shirt and uh as it turns out it's really hard to obtain if you want to get one of The Originals it was like some Japanese designer of some sort the the fashion team knows way more about it than I do and if you want one of these they're like hundreds of
dollars um so ours is I don't remember how much ours is yeah you can see it I had no idea there was that middle seam yeah here Luke laptop but it's it's hard to see in this phot it's probably not even going to open yeah it's there though you can you can technically see see it yeah that's a it's a fashion seam sure it keeps all the fashion in nice that's good it's very important so it's 25 bucks apparently oh okay that seems pretty reasonable we also have tall sizes really no way yah way apparently I'm
getting a mock neck yahe brother so that's another thing is we uh we finally did tall sizing I mean how are we going to have Mr Jonathan Horst promote this product being that makes sense 64 that makes sense unless we and we're not going to not make one that fits me dang it because I am an innovator on the same level as Mr jobs otherwise why would I pose like this in a silly profile picture because your profile picture on a forum is to be taken 100% seriously I don't think the size guide
has tall oh really oh um yeah it does where I don't know maybe  tall you good oh what is the oh the top category doesn't have a section title okay I understand cool see you later there's body length and the top one's width I guess anyway the point is that we are about to talk to you about merch messages all you got to do to interact with the show is send a merch message in the chat out there will be a little box whenever we're live you can send a merch message it'll go to producer Dan oh nice
sweater Dan it's not from LTD store though so I'm sorry I'm going to have to cut your feed um it'll go to producer Dan where he will either forward it to someone who can address it answer it himself or curate it for me and Luke to address later on the show to show you guys how that works he's going to give you a couple curated merch messages right now hit me Dan sure thing hi dll many of my peers are very pessimistic about the tech industry many layoffs too much AI Etc where do you think the tech
industry is going and how do you deal with pessimism in general layoffs and Ai and then AI leading to more layoffs and layoffs necessitating more AI okay no no hold on hold how do I deal with pessimism bad lonus bad um I mean we're still hiring yeah I mean a lot of places that are doing these layoffs still have job postings um a lot of the layoffs are not just in Dev yeah that's true pretty significant amount of the layoffs are not Dev they're from tech industry but tech
industry has a very high population of like sales and admin staff and marketing marketing and all this other stuff as well Community Management things that are not necessarily Tech even if they are necessary appendages uh of of a of an organization yeah yeah  still there was there was like this metric in a lot of like Fang and Silicon Valley companies for a while for a lot of managers where a a key performance indicator of that manager was how much they could swell their headcount um how
much they could hire effectively and as far as my understanding goes this is all just hearsay um so I have no idea but as far as my understanding goes that being a metric is not popular anymore uh because money is not as easily accessible anymore so there was kind of a strategy where if you increase your headcount that means it's going to be harder for other companies to get that Talent um however talented that Talent is um and the headcount strategy has stopped being a thing money's harder to
get all that type of stuff so they're trying to reduce headcount U but they're doing so by these like big cuts which you know are are not going to be able to be 100% accurate so um some great people are going to get cut out um some not great people are going to get cut out who knows when you're cutting a thousand people at once bad things are going to happen um so it sucks it's bad but it like the the jobs are easy to get and you will have a job at whatever enormous company forever era is probably kind of
over but it doesn't mean there is isn't a job market anymore um AI is helping developers sure it's also helping tons of other Industries uh and it's not replacing developers or at least it's not replacing like senior developers and they're going to need senior developers somehow so yeah Gregory H asked a similar question uh firsttime merch message I'm studying comp with all the layoffs do you think that the field is too inflated and I think you probably addressed that
um pretty well at this point I mean yeah there there's still jobs out there if you're good there's always a job um if you are willing to learn and cross train there's always a job for you it's not like these companies aren't still making a lot of money yeah oh yeah in some cases record profits yeah which is why I keep I keep bringing it back to this strategy thing um and a lot of them are still hiring handyman in philan chat said oh Amazon used to hire um SD in 2020 to 2021 with one 30 minute
interview which is like whoa interesting we're more thorough than  so it's just it's not going to be like that anymore um but I mean that's what a lot of Industries are like you know not one 30-minute interview whatever else um it's going to get more competitive it doesn't mean it's not there though you still get a job all right Dan howdy dll podcast listener here enjoyed the call out to computer Chronicles a few weeks back which of your videos do you want to serve as a resource for future generations of
techies oh I'd like to think that a lot of the archival content is going to unintentionally be a resource and in a in a what it was like back then kind of way I mean obviously we don't think about things that way when we're it's already like that when we're making these videos but uh we shot a video today uh reacting to our best builds as voted by the community and there was a ton of stuff that I forgot yeah a bunch of stuff that Luke and Jake had forgotten about um things I just kind of hadn't thought
about in a long time like what a great Benchmark the Tomb Raider Reb Bo games were dude they just they SC they scaled with everything you know add a better CPU FPS go up add a better GPU FPS go up at a second GPU FPS go up just like yeah sure I'm no no no n give me computer power but also running great yeah on you know pretty pedestrian gaming grade Hardware man great games fantastically scaling um I'd like to think that how to build a PC the last guide you'll ever is going to continue to be an
extremely strong point of entry for people into the PC Building and gaming PC gaming hobby it's uh it's at 10 million views now and going strong like every day it's on our top 10 viewed videos for that day even though it was released like a year two years ago or something like that and I have a plan we  it with like video replacement no cuz that you can't do that that that's too much of a change you can flow plane well yeah sure got him let's go yeah super relevant video platform there good
job hey man you're supposed to do the business model in marketing so that's on you yeah I just didn't have this mock neck yet oh there you go now I could do there you go there you go gives this gives me superpowers  "it there you go power level over 9,000"  everyone well he's got the belittling [Laughter] down okay now I just need a completely curable cancer and then I need to treat it with vegetables oh you could cure it with grape Welches if we could find any oh he got a few today separated the I did get
a few today um okay yeah too soon maybe uh anywh who uh what am I supposed to be talking about right oh yes so the plan we are going to reupload it oh right the video yes the how to build a PC the last gu you'll ever need because it was aspirational that title the last guide you'll ever need I mean things are going to change is computer industry I mean now we have motherboards with the connectors on The Flipping back I was going say yeah people are pushing for that yeah exactly
So the plan is to is to leave that one up because it still has very good residual traffic basically label it 2022 you know replaced or you know put a link to the new one in the description and then we're going to take that project with all that super high quality footage and all the incredible amount of work that the team did we're going to watch it through make notes okay here's what we need to here's what we need to update here's what probably might not be as relevant anymore so here's what we
can can here's what we can add because of the way we shot it which was not intentional at the time but is going to work out out great with multiple hosts on multiple sets we can just shoot new sections drop the old Boll on top of the new a roll get any new Boll we need and with comparatively speaking a relatively reasonable amount of work update it so that the last guide you'll ever need becomes an evolving piece of content I am yeah I'm super excited one thing that we need to more of though and
that I realize how to build a PC the last guide you'll ever need doesn't address is like the little picky parts and one of our other 10 million view videos is the POV build guide I need to just put a camera on my forehead again and do it again from time to time because that's a bit outdated now and there's a lot of things that are more easily understood from a firstperson perspective compared to um from a third person perspective oh all  brother do you want to jump into search 
worse he does but he needs a second do I I think so yeah like a passionate topic of yours okay uh refresh the page if you know you know cool all right um a recent study from researchers in Germany have found that search results are getting worse across all search engines the study followed product reviews and this is something that I have noticed a lot the quality of the results that I get when I'm trying to find information on a product has been atrocious but that's just anecdotal right it's sample size of
one it's not a controlled experiment in any way well this they controlled the experiment they followed product reviews on various search engines including Google Bing and duckduck go and found a consistent downward Trend in the number and the quality of relevant search results and they say this is due primarily to massive amounts of SEO spam what's funny is that I thought that the issue was just advertising and to be clear advertising is a barrier that sits in the way of finding the information
that you're actually trying to get but I didn't consider that the SEO game is still very much alive and well and if anything greatly empowered by AI oh yeah so attempts to address this problem by Google and others did have a measurable impact on the amount of spam and Google's tactics outperformed its competitors but that effect was both minor and temporary according to Lily Ray a senior executive at digital marketing agency MV digital we are currently experiencing some of the worst
results he's seen in his entire career in part because of an increased emphasis on user generated content and away from authoritative sources well that's because uh as as handyman and a couple other people have been saying in chat for a long time the best way to get results was to append readit um but and I don't know why SEO optimization took so long to figure this out to be honest it was kind of weird but they have since hijacked that as well or attempted to it still works pretty well but but this has
created a major opening for scammers and spammers yeah um our discussion question is is there a way to fix this yeah I don't think so because the only way to fix the quality of information in the the written web is for there to be any money in creating quality content for the written web yeah and there isn't no the money is in just crapping out AI generated listicles of just you should buy doing all the same amount of work that you would have to do for something like a video
potentially even more and making it written no there's no written article that is more work than a video form of the same written article strong disagree I don't don't agree this will be an interesting conversation yeah what I'm trying to get at is that sometimes written articles will go deeper there was actually a long period of time where to go deeper on a subject you would go to the linked written article okay so I should clarify I did specifically say then a video form of
the same thing if it's the exact same content sure yeah okay then we don't disagree then yeah yeah yeah very nice very good okay um yeah yeah no I'm I'm just saying that some I I find written articles will go further into things sure that yeah that's fair so the format differences do sometimes facilitate or do do sometimes enable a deeper dive sure yeah uh but you're you're never going to make the same amount of money um that you could with video because onpage ads just are worth like almost
nothing and to make it worth your time you have to like do really anti-consumer very annoying web things like refreshing the ads as you scroll and like inserting things and having things slide over the writing and all this crazy stuff which is going to drive people ultimately away from your site or to ad blocking everything so you're just going to make actually negative money because it costs you money for them to be on your site and you made nothing off the ads so it's
just like well I don't know some sites seem to be somewhat transitioning to a subscription model I've noticed a lot more pay walls and they wouldn't be popping up if they weren't working however um I think that there's only really room for a very small number of sites to succeed with a subscription model the donation model seems to be keeping Wikipedia AF flat but I think given the percentage of overall web traffic that is Wikipedia you can't just look at you know what's working for
Wikipedia and say oh okay well why doesn't somebody else just do that and I don't know if this is right or not but Wikipedia seems to be just kind of holding on not thriving I mean are they I don't think they report their financials unless they do I think they talk about like how much run rate they have left and stuff every once in a while when they ask for funding don't they uh they do report their financials full year financial statements audited by KPMG Wikimedia Foundation here we go boys uh it's a lot
of pages it's like 20 Pages let me see if I can just find the the bottom line  um they have $75 million in cash and cash equivalents so I think they're doing okay you don't know how much it costs um for a website that like basically everyone on the planet uses I mean it is just text but it's a financial not just their financial assets at the end of 2023 are $5 million greater than 2022 okay and that number is $196 million so I see they seem to be doing okay why do they ask for so much all the
time then well on Wikipedia they only  million but they do seem to have a fair bit of cash is that just profit or is that their revenue um that's I don't know if you call it Revenue be no this is liquidity and availability of financial assets so I'm not looking at revenue or profit or anything like that they spent is this right $69 million on salaries and benefits like am I reading this wrong help me out guys is that is that what I'm looking at salaries and benefits that is$ 69 million right like
I'm not I'm not developers do be expensive I mean yeah fair enough or W and grants uh donation processing expenses $6 million yeah that's what that's what a bunch of $3 donations will do for you yeah um travel and conferences they spent 800 Grand on that I don't know how many people work there though so it's possible these numbers aren't as outlandish as they might sound what traveling conferences well I mean travel to conferences right put like 800 Grand on that I me I wonder how many like how many people
many people yeah I have no idea truthfully for a site that I use as much as I do and for for a tech you know hold on they have 282 staff members and they're spending 70 million a year on salaries sounds like I should get a job at Comedia that's a wrong number in 2016 there was 280 employees in 2020 there was a approximately 450 okay so it's going up a fair  ago they hold conferences for their Community oh okay well that'll cost you yeah we know a thing or two about that yeah that's real expensive yep I'm 
much oh man check out handyman he's a good link he always has good links what is this fundraising fundraising statistics oh oh look at that okay so they're trying to stay out ahead of what their their costs will be black is their net assets green is their revenue red is their expenses so they do they do beat their expenses but it do be close sometimes it's pretty close yeah yeah so you can see they had a really good year in 2021 there's where that profit made its way into cash and cash equivalence so
they're basically like okay we got this war chest and we we're going to hold on to that but these years they like they didn't beat it by much no but this black number you want them to hold on to the war chest if you want Wikipedia to stay existing I mean who knows when it's coming yeah you know when someone tries to go after them um I I I fully support Wikipedia sitting on you know a couple hundred million just in case isn't it like Apple's trying to sue epic for $97 million for legal fees or something is
right like it's uh Apple Su Epic I know appic Apple's trying to uh $73 million trying to go hard after that um that medical device company that um is going after them and has an injunction on like Apple Apple watch sales or whatever like oh yeah they've spent a fortune taking it to Apple on that and other other smaller companies have come out and been like thank you you know someone finally having the resources and the stones to just go toe to- Toe with apple and say Hey you actually cannot fuing do this
this is not okay to just like set up an office down the street from someone you poach employees and not care about patents and IP um and I'm not allegedly allegedly allegedly and I'm not saying even that apple is alleged to have done that particular thing in this particular case but it's a common strategy that these giant tech companies do employ so that the people at that company don't even have to move you know they just go to the office of you know Google or Apple or Facebook or whoever
yeah yeah apple had required the lower court don't know what that means to order epic games to pay 90% of Apple's legal fees estimated at $73 million he spent $73 million in legal fees actually no that may kind of makes sense yeah it adds up really fast it turns out yeah not a fan yeah all right Dan hit me haha just kidding he's not there kidding Dan you're good uh do we have another topic we want to talk about oh how about the ad block bug that was blamed on you know I was ready to like go to war with
YouTube so over them thring the experience for I I basically I sent them an email before I was aware of the full context for this that was basically like look guys you know as a as a YouTube Creator I am as supportive as anyone when it comes to you know monetizing the platform effectively as long as you guys continue to share share with creators I mean I have some very different thoughts about the ads that they run on nonp Partner channels and then just keep 100% of the revenue from
because that whole thing doesn't make a ton of sense to me but when it comes to monetizing the platform and sharing Revenue with creators obviously I have a vested interest in that being successful however as I said as I laid out in my email this is clearly a step too far you can't interfere with the basic functionality of the platform for users who happen to have a particular extension installed in their browser like that is not it's not even just the platform are you talking about the
platform as the Computing device yeah it was increasing CPU usage well when loading YouTube videos yeah so they were like hitting the computer yeah sure fair enough so either way I was like look I plan to talk about this this week I hope oh sorry playing footsy I I hope you have a very compelling statement um and then shortly after that it came out that um well uhoops uh whoops last weekend users noticed an extreme slowdown for YouTube videos whenever ad block was enabled
oddly even YouTube premium users who happened to have ad block installed were also affected a test by PC Gamer found that CPU usage increased by 177% when loading YouTube videos with ad block while the Slowdown was initially blamed on Google so this is why I sent my original email it turned you did send it I did yeah I send it it turned out that users of other ad blocking Services weren't affected and the Slowdown was also noticeable when loading videos on other websites um ad
block has since confirmed that this buffering problem was caused by a bug in its most recent update our discussion questions are twofold one should we be slower to assume malice in these kinds of cases man I don't know I just don't think I don't think Google has earned the benefit of the doubt lately I mean there was the incognito mode thing there's the general war against ad block and how that's I do think in general though people jump on things too fast sure I just so I I think you're right
I think that is correct and I think that but I think the second I think that Luke's take is bad here and we should hate him yeah we should all hate him yeah go after me get them pitchforks I think sometimes people  evil that's their new Company motto just just don't make it too much just do a little bit evil um but yeah I think sometimes it's it's the problem you know people read a headline without reading the article and then now they're at War and they don't even know what they're at
War about um but they know they're supposed to hate somebody or something and it's just like oh my goodness um to be clear ad block is fixed now um so they they have since issued a patch but no the the issue was not in fact YouTube however I don't know it wouldn't surprise me if some of the ongoing develop I'm sure Adblock would be happy to you know update their extension once every 6 months what I suspect is that they are so frequently updating their extension because of mitigations that YouTube or
Google is attempting to put in place to prevent the service from working on the site so is it still Google's fault or is Google well within their rights to try to prevent the ad block extension from  I don't know and like you you can be mad about that you can Pitchfork that for sure you can do whatever you want but let's uh they're still allowed to do that I don't know by the way apparently um I I read the headline only today so I haven't looked at it yet I this is my
first time looking at it apparently they have updated this and other people who use this device won't see our activity however downloads bookmarks and reading list uh your activity might still be visible too okay no it still doesn't say us okay maybe you don't have the yeah maybe it hasn't been rolled out or maybe I don't have the latest update yeah um it's Pro it's probably it's probably a rolling thing but I I heard I heard that they are upda full sh said the canary warning replaces browse privately with
brows more privately oh hold on oh was that what that said let's try it again new incognit need a window hello no mine still says now you can browse oh is one of their builds called Canary is there Google Chrome Canary oh that makes sense yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah okay so that's um okay yeah so that like for about that yeah okay makes sense see I'm more familiar  so Archangel of death death points out that Firefox got slowed down on YouTube a popular fix was using an agent
switcher um that wasn't a bug in an ad blocker yeah fair enough um did we did we manage to prove that that was malicious I I I heard about that one but didn't dig into that this is my thing it if you prove that it is go after him I'm not saying don't go after I see I'm saying maybe maybe look for 3 seconds before before you do so um I don't know I just I think sometimes with with no actual real knowledge people will dive head first into hatred on something um never experienced
that um I don't know what you're talking about and I think I think there is plenty things that deserve the the full dive of hatred and you should go after them I think you've imagined this whole thing um but I just yeah I don't know I think people should be a little bit more  about I don't even know how to respond to this oh man Fujitsu oh wait we should probably do our sponsors uh Dan are we uh is it sponsor time is that what we're supposed to do yeah there's a little

Facebook or whatever else but now that it's not on my phone it's so much so much better going and touching grass is unironically an extremely good idea and  it sounds fake but okay it's not we man we we need to do a Chia Pet we talked about this on our previous W show we need to do the touch grass gen think it would be cool just like a little square you can have on your desk yeah that would actually be great I would that yeah yeah yeah we could make it like kind of like you know techy like it
could have Orbeez in it so you only have to water it like once in a while you know water retention and release just like you know like like super low M gamer grass gamer grass wow yeah that really does that probably already exists and  product Oh man yeah I was wondering what Linus's favorite to or top motorcycling tech gadgets or mods are besides the backpack I've been looking uh for cool things to bring along with me while I'm out riding during the summer I am the basic um I uh my bike barely even has a
digital speedometer on it it's a 2003 um I I do have an old Pebble a pebble th that I that that I hot glued a magnet onto the back of and then I have a magnet that I um that I also hot glued on to my motorbike so I can put it on there and then I have tactile buttons for changing uh changing media tracks and then I have speakers embedded in my headphones with just like a wire coming out and then I use my old note 9 or at least I used to I mangled my headphone jack oh no yeah I mean I'm sure I can
like fix it or whatever but that would suck it that phone has taken a serious beating yeah I like man like 3 weeks ago after I switched back to it after oh no in between fairphone and Wing I switched back to it temporarily and I was like man I haven't listened to real headphones in a while I grabbed my ie600 that I still keep in my backpack just in case plug them in was like I forgot what headphones are supposed to sound like right right airpods Pro they're good for wireless crappy headphones but they they
sound like sh right um immediately like got it snagged on something cuz I'm just not used to it anymore like yeah one one side work works and it's it's not the headphones it's the it's the Jack anyway where was I going with this right the point is um I'm going to have to find I'm going to have to grab another old phone or a new phone that has a headphone jack or something and then that goes in my in my pocket and I just run it up through my thing I got my speakers not in ears speakers and that's
it that's that's all my motorcycle Tech just so I can get my turn by turn and my music and so that I can change tracks and adjust volume so uh gamer grass or Gamers grass um this is not an endorsement I don't know anything about this company um we sort of Love hugged their website without me even talking about it um it also it almost like completely stopped functioning but it seems to be working for you now this actually looks super cool so if you're into like Miniatures
for that kind of gaming yeah if you're into Miniatures and stuff or or I could I could absolutely see D and D groups even two mm Tufts oh 2 mm tall yeah that makes way more sense I thought it was 2 mm Square I'm supposed to like assemble like you can also get bases so you're you're currently shopping for toughs so if you if you clicked on bases I'm a tough Enthusiast you  tough oh my goodness uh anyways I think this is actually super cool so no we probably can't call it Gamers grass
um but yeah apparently there's other brands and stuff yeah sure I don't know what's a laser plant a laser plant I don't know man their s their sight's real slow right now yeah we've got a lot of people on here right now I think all right cool it is not loading but yeah apparently that's already a thing all right I'm sure plof knows about it probably he's gotten super into Miniatures what Dan it's good for 40K as well yeah yeah you have Miniatures in 40K yeah what do you think I was talking
about yeah Dan yeah Dan what the heck Dan Dan why are you not even in the   boy all right all right hit me d uh sure not physically you're too far away I'm not feeling it tonight come over here and I'll beat you uh hey have you seen that a couple of a small companies are making a 500 watt ATX Gan I think that I can't remember what that stands for some sort of nitride n gallan nitride when do you think we will see a g PSU in mainstream do-it-yourself builds uh hold on 500 watt Gan power supply
why oh for for ITX builds uh B light Ino chat said get off the gamerg grass website mom said it's my  look hdplex these guys are awesome their products are super cool it makes a ton of sense that they would be using Gan um Gan basically allows you to shrink um your power supply and it's super efficiency it's oh my God what am I talking about it makes it so you can build smaller more efficient power supplies thank you um I I have not personally looked into the electronics
engineering reasons that that's possible but I do know that it's a um super cool Tech and allows you to make super compact um very efficient power supplies so yeah this is a tiny 500 wat power supply look how small this is that's ridiculous um what it's not an AC power supply this is a DC to to DC power supply is my understand oh wait no way  uh-huh that's pretty wild wow there more connectors this plug if you keep scrolling there should be some yeah there you go no way shut up there you go
that is bananes okay that's super cool um yeah hdplex super cool company they make super cool really compact silent sometimes power supplies they they've done some DC todc designs in the past which is what led me to believe that this was a DC todc no this is a 500 wat AC todc power supply that is bananes uh anywh who the point is that I don't think we're going to see Gan in a full-sized ATX power supply anytime soon because they can already build a full-sized ATX power supply that can do
"1,600 watts in North America which is" the maximum that we can draw off of a single circuit and they can already do a full-size ATX power "supply that had that that'll do 2,000" Watts on 240 volt which is the maximum no that's actually not the maximum you can do in Europe but it's the maximum that you could reasonably build a computer with um anytime in the near future never is a strong word as the prices come down you know maybe it'll actually be more efficient and more
cost- effective to build a gan power supply but for now it's a premium technology and not something that we're going to see anytime soon just because we don't really need it stop trying to make bananes happen I will not I will not stop Dan hit me sure any updates on the laptop or shoulder back would really like it for school as the backpack which is awesome   check uh this Gamer's CFT stuff is really cool it took me about seven minutes to load the laser plants P have you ever seen a static flocking
machine what you you put it in this charged chamber and it charges the base and you put your glue on it and then you basically like explode uh like the grass flock and then it all sticks in and points in One Direction so it actually looks like grass instead of just like dabbing it on it it's like powder coating but for fake grass but for fake grass wow no I have not that's cool I just Googled it it looks like something else I used to uh I used to do 40K expensive hobby unbelievably unless
you go to England it was I bought some stuff when I was in England and it was like wow this is extremely affordable it's almost cheaper to fly to England buy your models and then fly back why is it so much cheaper cuz they're made in England they're made there I believe so at least they used to be oh wow I don't have an update on the notebook bag but I do have an update on carabina Replacements I was going to ask that too we're going to have 500 kits sent out within the next couple of weeks oh let's
go we're doing it we have more um no I'm just happy things are starting the first order is going to have more but the reason we're doing 500 first is to mixure yeah so it's a rolling thing cool um we got an update on some YKK polls those were pending for a couple weeks stuff stuff's happening um magnetic cable management is pending a launch late this month apparently um we have some packs also very cool feeling good for go live uh there's no update in my in my CW update
for the Gen 7th week which is the most recent one that I think I have for Notebook bag and I'll check the previous one that I also hadn't read yet no I don't see anything about it in there either so hopefully I'll get an update on that fairly soon and then I can um get you guys up to speed uh as you might imagine our relationship with our backpack who is also our notebook bag supplier has been a little bit more complicated lately with the whole double layer thing thing so you sure want to make it I hope the
ord's in I'm actually not sure though I'm sorry mhm um did you mention the mag magnetic Cable Management I can't remember I did okay good hopefully launching this month so if you were looking for if you are one of the people who got a $25 credit for your backpack and you're looking for something to uh  out that's going to be a big W show you guys Dan how your fingers feeling damn ready nice uh all right what are we supposed to do topics you got it Fujitsu agrees that it is morally
culpable don't know exactly what that means how does that translate to dollars I guess um that remains to we'll see morally culpable in 700 plus wrongful convictions Paul Patterson European head of Fujitsu has publicly acknowledged that the company has a moral obligation to help financially compensate hundreds of UK postal workers who were wrongfully charged and convicted of theft and fraud between 1999 and 2015 Fujitsu supported the post office in the prosecution of hundreds of innocent sub postmasters
based on discrepancies found in fujitsu's Horizon accounting soft I didn't even know if Fujitsu made accounting soft one of those companies that just make all the things the company now admits that they knew the software was flawed even at the time and they took part in an appalling miscarriage of Justice however Patterson says that Fujitsu will wait for a judge to determine the company's share of the settlement okay you know would I be trying to come up with something hoping
that if it was like in good faith decent that maybe I would get better like maybe I'd be looked at more favorably in a situation like this or would I just be like but I'll just I'm going let you I'm going wait and see like what what would be the play what would be your play I mean obviously we're not lawyers we don't know the right way to do this but we can kind of this is we're talking moral we're talking moral culpability right now I think you'd have to try to do something I think I would
i' I'd want to try to do something even if it's small even if it's just like you know hey how about like uh like uh I don't know groceries stippen from now until this is all resolved and with the with the understanding that it'll come out of the total payout or something you know like just make their lives a little easier for a bit or something like I don't know I have no idea what exactly but I'll try to spitballing Luke I'm spitballing you know obviously not like you know a Tim Horton's gift card but
something something meaningful that makes their makes their lives a little better for a bit instead of way worse for a long period of time you 700 plus people their jobs what wage subsidy people went to jail this is bad so at least wage subsidy um the sub postmasters who are self-employed contractors started reporting errors in the Horizon software only a few weeks after it had been installed the post office responded by denying there was any flaw in the system and forcing individual workers to pay
out of pocket to make up the difference there's never been any bugs in flow plan the post you're wrong the post office privately investigated over 900 contractors then used Horizon as evidence against them in Criminal Court leading to imprisonment bankruptcy and four suicides even after a 2012 independent forensic audit found that Horizon had serious flaws that could explain these discrepancies the post office stood by the software's reliability in 2019 the post office lost a class action lawsuit
brought by over 500 sub postmasters leading to public inquiry or leading to a public inquiry the BBC recently aired a dramatization of the affair which has drawn public outcry again in response last week the British prime minister announced legislation to exonerate the affected sub postmasters I'm wondering why this took so long yeah like that's just criminal I mean there's no word for it other than  um yeah I haven't watched the BBC the program on this but people are adding additional details in the chat
apparently it's amazing um people are adding details in the chat that are just appalling like like this is up man yeah this this is this is this is like so one one thing that I'm I'm getting a little bit lost here though was it the post office that said there was no bugs or was it Fujitsu um the post office said there was no bugs but we don't I don't think we know um what fujitsu's role is because we haven't watched the thing yet right but like yeah I mean is that is that not at the very least
manslaughter like for the people responsible for like can technically I yeah I don't think you can be charged for someone else's no you can be charged for someone else's suicide if you bully or go them into it yeah into legal stuff that we don't understand in a country that we're not in but like it's going to be wild whoa  absolutely anyway um so uh I am not a financial adviser but maybe don't invest  Fujitsu if you've been watching the  sense oh wild what's up I guess it's a small amount but like
I I would assume would have assumed this would have done something huh lunch break nice well this is the one day no just mean this this is this like the uh the jaanese stock market or something springing back over the last one day I  though cuz people buy the dip right yeah any who um but this is like I wonder when this news broke cuz they've been going down since what happened here stocks are weird anyways that's horrible people are like yeah this won't matter to uh their
stock because they're like as big as General Electric speaking of General Electric they make like everything General Electric appliances threatens legal action against open- Source Dev and of of course this was going to end up on the W show appliance manufacturer hire who owns both General Electric appliances and Hoover has issued a takedown order against Andre BOS I'm so sorry I butchered your name I'm sure a developer who maintains the op Source home assistant integration
plugins for hires h on Han I don't know whatever this is their smart control app I think it's like home on but shortened according to hire's notice the plugins use their services in an unauthorized manner which is causing significant economic harm to their company the are you talking about H what what economic har people buy your product I wouldn't even begin to consider an appliance wait do they have service I wouldn't even begin to consider buying your Appliance if it
didn't have a plug-in for home assistant and if I wasn't a home assistant user then I would have no idea what home assistant is so what the are you talking about okay I'm ready to listen oh I I need to look into this more but uh Mario p and full playe chat said the post office said there was no bugs Fujitsu staff witness statements were edited by the post office to remove references to their being we don't know enough about that but we need to look more into this right now um I'm
wondering if there is a software solution that General Electric has that they're trying to sell that people are using um home assistant for instead wonder if that's what they're saying because I agree you're buying the appliance thing whatever I suspect people are buying this because it works with home assistant more than anything else um probably not the home assistant Community is pretty small is it oh yeah it's just my circles I guess yeah yeah it seems like a big idea everyone I talk
to about home automation just talks about home assistant so either way either way this is this is crap um I don't want a billion different stupid apps with a billion different subscription services so H tweeted out saying the higher brand in the US is independent of higher Europe and operates separately Han or h on or whatever is the connected iot platform for ire Europe in the US customers can use our open iot platform smart HQ smart HQ does not prevent Integrations with
home assistant okay so shout out higher us yeah for doing things right at least is and for saying this publicly today yeah and for coming out and condemning their their cousin company over in Europe um it's time for their cousin company over in Europe to uh figure this out cuz this is not cool this is not how it works um oh IM gimle says higher us actually has an API that anyone can use to interact with their gear that's super cool Cody 4K says go go European commission yeah really yeah I mean hey
we've talked about it a fair bit like the EU being pretty cool and stuff this is something that needs to happen we cannot allow Appliance companies like you're you're stuck with this sh for like 20 years right like these are not this is not even a phone where it's like optimistically you're going to use it for five I think Samsung just committed to seven years with the Galaxy s24 that's kind of a big deal have in the dock I totally forgot to is cool talk about that this week but um you know
optimistically you're going to use this phone for you know seven years or whatever we're talking stuff that you are maybe going to use for 20 30 years like no you you don't get to just sell me something with the with the understanding that I can you know access it through this Plugin or whatever and then just go no forget it now you need to pay our subscription fee for for like the the the the the the lifespan of I don't know what kind of animal lives for a horse how long do horses live I think 
long 25 to 30 years nailed  any uh it is unclear at this time whether the plugins actually contain any proprietary code but BOS has announced that he will be pulling the plugins in the next few days due to fear of legal reprisal yeah under certain circumstances I would I would love to be like yeah I'm going to get together a coalition of creators and we're going to like fund your defense or whatever but like um this is General Electric we just talked on the show about how you know
lawsuits can run like I I I actually don't have the money Apple trying to suit for 73 million if they if they decide to like go ham at this um and and it sucks that the best advice I can give is that yeah you probably should just pull the plugin I I think you should pull the plugin and immediately uh send I don't know how you do this contact some form of representative in the European commission and try to get some stuff moving they seem to be aggressive about this stuff this might
legitimately be something that they want to jump on and it might not be this specifically they might not have go after like General Electric speciic specifically but they might solve this problem for the industry as a whole which is way better anyways and then you can release your plugin back again I think that's the way to go not that they're watching or care but yeah um open AI made two notable changes to their terms of service this week first the company announced that they're
adding new rules prohibiting the use of their llm tools to create political misinformation or to impersonate a political candidate or official that's going to help a lot because it's not like there are any other similar tools that could be used to do these things zero I mean in all seriousness though we should be supportive yeah it is a good thing what's less good is that open AI quietly dropped language Banning the military use of their tools what a company owned by Microsoft huh what do
you mean what do you mean what do you mean yeah all right cool so um according to leaked internal documents one thing I'll say oh sure is if you didn't think other countries are doing this you're nuts according to leaked internal documents Amazon is preparing to launch a paid subscription for an upgraded version of Alexa later this year tentatively named Alexa plus can you imagine yourself paying for Alexa no I don't have any Alexa enabled devices at all so definitely not the new Alexa has llm chat botlike
features I mean it'll cost a lot for them to run so there's that intended to improve reason Anders abilities including the ability to disu between when a useres talking when they briefly wow progress however it's apparently prone to rambling factual errors and hallucination the documents also reveal a degree of internal conflict within Amazon because some employees felt the company shouldn't charge for the new features how are they going to pay for it yeah that's that that sounds like people who really cool
idea would rather be off than deal with having a balance sheet that is positive like I I love ideas but that's ultimately you want a raise at the end of the year and everybody needs to eat so if there's some massive new expense someone has to pay for it yeah is it going to be you with your salary or is it going to be the customer yeah I don't know BOS isn't going to take less kind of silly um oh right sorry I keep saying Alexa sorry sorry guys I forgot um maybe soon you'll have Al play
despacito oh stop stop Luke you're going to make the two people that use Alexa  I hope I got somebody you probably got both of them you almost   [Laughter]   out that was the song everyone used to do right yes yeah I thought so um The Vision Pro has apparently no hot apps pre-orders have started as of yesterday we've got our order in I think it's delivery is scheduled for late March or April or something like that so that either means they're getting a lot of orders or it means they're not producing
a lot of them uh demand is reportedly high enough that it has exceeded available stock in several US cities strangely attempting to pre-ordered online seems to require an iPhone or an iPad with face ID really huh you know it doesn't surprise me that much I have a whole thing that I want to do on how impossible it is to uh cancel Apple arcade from an Apple TV if I didn't don't own an iPad or an iPhone the only way to cancel a subscript you cannot do it on the Apple TV there is no button
got to be illegal it should be illegal that's got to be illegal already you cannot that that like has to be illegal uh also this is a fun one um I could not find any way to remove my payment information they scan your face for the cushion people are saying because I am the family plan owner so as a family plan owner I must have a valid credit card unless it like expires I actually do not see how that could possibly be legal either they might be able to update your credit card
if you get a new one if it expires as well Google can do that I'm pretty sure Apple can do that no I just mean I couldn't remove it no but what I'm saying is even if the card expires if you get issued a new one they might be able to get that number from your bank Google can do that really yeah like uh Google pay I'm fairly certain Apple pay can do this as well okay well Apple didn't win my uh card lapsed before so do you have Apple pay like tap with your phone and pay no okay yeah I'm pretty
sure that system can yeah no just my Apple arcade subscription lapsed because my card expired and it did not automatically has done that for me yeah so Apple pay and Google pay will both update your card with information from your bank but like they'll have your new card's information in your phone before you even receive your new card in the mail chat like use privacy one of your previous sponsors I want to it's not in Canada it's not in Canada I really wish it was yeah me too it's a super cool
service I will shill for privacy anytime they're not even like have they even sponsored in a while not in a while yeah still super cool yeah they just wish they were in Canada anyway yeah so I I want to do a whole thing on it where I like live I go through and I show you guys hey how hard it was to subscribe to it in the first place just on my Android phone through a browser it was like almost impossible and then unsubscribing was literally impossible it could not be done on the
Apple TV could not be done on my phone in a browser could not be done on my computer and a browser I had to download the desktop iTunes application if for whatever reason I did not own a desktop PC if my only Computing device was an Apple TV it would be completely impossible to cancel my subscription or because I'm a family manager remove my credit card because I was like okay screw it I'll just remove my credit card I don't need to buy anything else from Apple and it wouldn't allow me to do it
you actually cannot keep my credit card information against my will that cannot possibly be legal anywh who the reason for them requiring an iPhone an iPad with face ID is that they scan your face to make sure the cushion fits better apparently uh despite Apple's claim that most iPad apps can play on The Vision Pro without any changes it seems the device won't have access to most top apps from the App Store at launch including and this is uh these are some Heavy Hitters Amazon
Netflix YouTube Instagram Facebook and Tik Tok according to Mac stories none of the top 46 apps on the App Store will be available as a native app and just above a third of them will be available in compatibility mode meaning that nearly 2third of developers explicitly opted out of making their iPad app compatible with the headset YouTube confirmed that it was not allowing its app to be used in compatibility mode did not clarify why and instead suggested that Vision Pro users should access the site through
a browser so discussion question for you what is the most likely reason that so many companies would actively avoid allowing their apps to be used on a hot new Prestige product I honestly don't know like would you allow float plane in compatibility mode if people are like yeah I want to try it or would you be worried about a whole bunch of support calls if it doesn't work right yeah we are a statistically extremely small team for what we do though um I feel like a a team like Netflix would be able to
handle that what if they just didn't give a about the 63 people that are going to be watching Netflix that's possible yeah maybe the um I I I'm surprised they wouldn't try to buddy with apple more and just do it to make apple happy uh I don't think anything makes Apple Happy other than money I don't I don't I I'm I'm not convinced that that's like really a thing okay I I don't know have you seen any evidence of it no I have no idea it seems like their their relationship with app developers
is pretty adversarial for the most part I just I find that like a lot of these companies will have apps for like everything you could imagine because they just have like these monstrous Dev teams and they're just like yeah we're going to support every freaking TV and every way and all this other type of stuff I don't know maybe we should try it when we get ours try what Flo plane app oh wait we don't have an iPad out okay then forget it yeah there you go all right see you later hey we could
maybe get oh he's like far away now and stuff but there know I'm not even going to talk about it because I I learned my lesson of of telling people what we're working on for floow plane cuz then they want it like tomorrow oh what is it I don't know I don't even think you know no you have to tell me nope I'll call  shift I've been working for 12 hours today come at me  [Laughter]  right Google more layoffs um Google has laid off over a thousand staff across their business in the last nine days I
made sure our YouTube rep was okay hey shout out glad you're good um nice according to an internal Memo from CEO CER Pai these layoffs will not be as severe oh there's more coming they say oh wow okay um yeah there's more well that man that sucks uh in other news amd's Phoenix 1 and Phoenix 2 apus are not twin cores this is this is a cute headline from presumably Jessica for some time we've known that AMD would be using two different chips in its ryzen 8000g apus Phoenix 1 and Phoenix 2 cool names with
the biggest difference we were aware of being that Phoenix 2 uses some zen4 C cores so these are these compact ones that um on the server side of things anyway allow greater core density at the expense of higher clock speeds um and I believe they also have less cash but I'm not sure if that's anything to do with the cores themselves or if it's um the uh the bigger caches uh so don't quote me on that but full specs posted by gigabyte show that Phoenix 2 apus not only use z4c cores but they have fewer
pcie Lanes which will cap them to two pcie Gen 4 lanes for the secondary nvme slot further while Phenix 1 has eight pcie 4.0 lanes for adding gpus Phoenix 2 has only four currently the ryzen 5 8500g is the only retail design using Phoenix 2 and I will be very interested to see if AMD even seeds these Phoenix 2 chips to reviewers or if they are going to pull a quiet H well here's the SK you should review and these ones will also be like on New Egg and maybe people will just like buy
those ones cuz they're less expensive and they'll assume it's that but cheaper I am I'm not liking this um that few pcie lanes could be a major disadvantage for this chip especially as it ages yeah four lanes for a GPU do you find it misleading that the two is worse um it's a code name so I don't worry about that as much got it okay the fact that they're all "8,000g just with like one number" different to me indicates that they are feature similar and I am not pleased with this yeah I think that's it for
topics this week Dan I think it's time for after dark okay is that it I thought there was something you were supposed to talk about that wasn't in the list oh radon challenge update that can be that  okay oh oh after dark is brought to you by dbrand again because the sales team apparently um has found that only dbrand is interested in sponsoring after dark hey dbrand if you're watching this which I know you almost certainly are uh oh wow got him um dbrand if you're watching
this uh you can probably negotiate with the uh Biz team because I don't think they have any other offers for wano after dark so what but what are you doing why am I helping them yeah well I just in good faith I'm offering them more why are you why are nerfing the business no I'm offering them I'm offering them good advice yeah but they've got Target so that so that dbrand will feel indebted to us and offer to pay more oh it's it's 4D chess I don't think it's going to work yes
like next level emotional manipulation I  queen he just lost your queen in the fourth dimension now it's time for the W show after dark brought to you by dbrand check out their new grip case now available for the Samsung s24 okay there's a whole thing hold on hold on a second uh oh my God okay hold on we're going to get to this in a second okay oh man my phone's been blowing up I haven't been actually looking at any of this okay uh Nick says hoping for summer for the laptop bag uh waiting on a reply from
our new CEO before we can move forward we'll follow up next week that's cool okay got it and even  but what has forwarded our first samples for our touch grass product what yeah apparently we're already working on it so it's just a cute little looks great it's a cute little um that's so cool it's a cute little bread themed dinosaur standing yeah I don't know you guys can't really see it but there's a little bread brontosaurus uh standing on a little pad of grass and and there's a
little cute little frame so I I need create a warehouse to like turn into like one of the Samsungs of the world where they just make everything yeah yeah creat a warehouse Insurance yeah uh why not yeah why not yeah okay I think I also had a message from uh dbrand about the whole s24 like stylus something yeah okay here we go so they posted this on Reddit um they have not found any difference between the performance of an s23 ultra S Pen versus an S2 four Ultra S pen while a MAG safe case is
attached uh Samsung has acknowledged the interference between magnets and the S Pen going back as far as the Galaxy Note 8 they advise those who encounter magnetic interference to use the Spen with more force of course A lot has changed since then what can you expect when using a MAG safe enabled case on your Galaxy Ultra this effect differs from accessory to accessory nevertheless logical conclusion okay okay okay sometimes they write a lot um here's how the roll out will
work oh they're going to have a nonm saafe variant for all their ultramodel Galaxy cases Okay cool so if you if you're worried about it then you can just get one that doesn't have mag safe and doesn't have magnets in it okay or you can get one that does I guess maybe I'm not sure uh check it out on Reddit the point is uh check out their new grip case now available for the Samsung s24 Series linked down below Dan yeah how you doing over there I'm okay how about you you had a nice day I
I've had I've had an okay day it sure looks nice tiring would you like a merch message um I mean I guess it's an option okay if we ever want to get out of here what do you guys do with teams I've never been logged out across four different employers and multiple computers do you use funky Windows login configurations yeah Luke we don't have yeah Dan can you guys fix this no eventually oh you want to make it a you want to make it a a quarterly priority I mean I don't set
them anymore but I would yes I find it really annoying I'm pretty sure we can fix it if we get um I always forget the name of it a ad Jake told oh active directory yeah okay cuz Jake told me like a thousand years ago that there wasn't a way to configure it but that was literally a thousand years ago so there is there is I I I through some very light Googling I think we might need a um entra now okay yeah I don't know there is ways to to deal with it ENT TR not looking forward to that
fine Hi D can you is this really going to be that annoying the whole time I do not know that was not in my instruction okay never mind I take it back dbr needs to pay extra if they're going to have this down here it's also like the opposite of dark everything else is dark we have this like very bright daytime scene rip o users yeah noik we know there's like a lot of things that can be better I was delivered a thing that was on fire we're working on it it's not as on fire anymore it's getting better okay you
brought me into the fire I blame you as well that's fair hold on I can I can uh ruin some of D Brand's money there we go okay that's a little better oh no it breaks the whole thing though dang it I'll just white stretch it I just leave it oh now we can black stretch it there we go okay that helps maybe a little that's a little better thanks Dan damn it okay uh Hi D can you talk about the early days of the Forum and how you ensured a positive and Safe Community looking to start something
similar to catalog and compile historical info about a specific Place well our mod team was and is awesome and uh part of it is that we just kind of have a pretty positive community so for the most part I mean I mean part of it was the you know vision for the Forum was to not want to be like a toxic uh place where where put Downs are considered to be acceptable between members um there there's obviously exceptions it's any any where you put two people someone's likely to disagree with somebody about
something and get heated but um there was also a a way back there was a a mountain of work from the venerable Mr Wizard and these days mortise speaking of speaking of um these are our rules ensure a friendly atmosphere to our visitors and Forum members ensure the freedom of expression and exchange of information in a mature and responsible manner don't be a dick will Weeden be excellent to each other Bill and Ted remember your audience both present and future that's it yeah pretty
much I mean we get more specific and all that but yeah but honestly that top bit is should be all you really need it really should and yet it isn't correct um yeah the mods the mods hold it together yeah I mean it basically operates as a completely independent thing these days we we've taken more of the the ad Mini Server management stuff in house to try to free up mortise as much as possible um so Jonathan and Tyler from the FIP plan team are have been on top of that but that's not the
community fostering the community fostering has been all the the mods in the community itself yeah it's actually kind of hilarious how very independent from LTT it is these days like as far as I can tell it's a hot bed for LTT haters at this point yeah how ironic there's a bunch of that too which we always committed to not clamping down on and we stay committed to we are for for all the for all the criticism it's all still there one one of the spoken but not written written
original news uh wow that was a really difficult sentence for me I'm not sure why one of the spoken but not written original rules of the site was that in regards to going after people you could go after us and nobody else was fair game that was kind of how it was supposed to be they really took that and  yeah yeah hello LDL with the snowy Canadian Winters how do the line of socks and sandals combo work I'm actually wearing shoes today he is yeah there's like slush puddles that are this
deep the slush puddles are rough the snow you can do but the slush puddles it's just it's a puddle I have a whole technique for snow you like lift straight up and go straight down yeah and you can kind of make your way through it a little bit Yeah but no I got I got shoes on today hi w. dll have you done any more research into automated cleaning Bots like the one Walmart has thinking of the Badminton Center no not yet I mean we're so far away from completion on that um I
thought we were supposed to be done in March yeah it's already been pushed remember how I said I had yeah you should probably tell I was not informed the people that are going to be building a bunch of stuff in the building I was not informed either sir oh okay I I was unequivalently told March and then I said bet and then you were like no absolutely March what that there shut up that's not what happened I that is on the WAN show you can find that clip wait what database he'll find it please there's no
way I always say that construction is always delayed I I specifically remember somebody telling me unequivocally that it was absolutely going to be March was I being verbally ironic probably did we ever figure out what sardonic meant I I do not fully understand what sardonic means no no I think it's like a like a light light-hearted kind of um like insincerity of some sort but it's not or cynical okay sure yeah so then I clearly did not know cic okay well not being marched makes things a little bit easier
I don't have to lay awake at night stressing about it anymore um yeah great there is absolutely I mean come on yeah okay yeah w w database I'd love to I I'd love to know if I said that I find man I find very hard to believe maybe I'm crazy I'll try to get that phone next week not look the reality of it is I do they're on it they're on it it's going to probably take till next week but they're on it Arthur's on it okay all right hilarious I'm going to get lambasted if I'm wrong
yeah I'm so Al lie I I have a feeling dug in pretty hard here I have a feeling what might have been said is that that's the date we currently have so we should be at a full preparedness level for that date I doubt said anything that planning for that date maybe that's what I said that sounds like something you would say I would say I think I would say something more along the lines  of we'll figure it out well Arthur will figure it out nice thanks Arthur cool hey dll thinking about the oh do you
want to know the new ETA that would be   march where's my ding I'm going home   you uh hey D think about the potential of future Tech or mechanical augments humans May potentially be able to make their bodies in the near future how far would each of you be willing to go uh um I think it would depend on how my body decayed yeah like when I'm when I'm when I'm young and functioning well when I'm like yeah whatever but if you told me like hey you can have glasses hanging off your face for the rest of
your life or you can have like this bionic thing that we like drill into the back of your eye and put in there and then you like never need glasses anymore and your eyes are like better than they ever were I'm like okay as long as the success rate is pretty high I I think the thing that I have would have to be in a very bad spot and then if that's the case yeah I'm down like if I'm like mostly blind yeah yeah let's go but right now do I want something drilled into the back of my eye not really yeah
yeah cuz like they're still all right they're not great but they're all right yeah they're not great you should really wear your glasses yeah okay cool I forgot them for the curling tournament again yeah yeah oh yeah how' youy you never told me how the last day went they they made the they made the uh the the finals of the consolation bracket that's a really nice way of saying the losers bracket no it's a constellation bracket is it actually yeah Oh I thought it was legitimately called that's standard
terminology they call it Group B yeah sure Group B constellation yeah so I had a curling tournament as I said on the show and then someone tried to correct me and they're right it's called a bond Spiel but if I say Bond Spiel no one's going to know what the heck I mean um so it's a tournament whatever uh traditionally we were in the tournament um but we won like a bunch of times so I think that got annoying uh so they they decided to give my my uncle my brother and I who have never played a season of
curling they gave each one of us a year of experience on paper um because we were at zero years of experience because we had no years of experience but because we had played in the novice tournament a decent amount of times they said that we had a year of experience which isn't equivalent but whatever um and then my dad's accumulated actually large amount of user experience cuz he's like he like coaches the intermediate level or whatever all this crazy stuff that combined made it so
that we had too many years of experience collectively on the team of my dad my brother my uncle and I um to play in the novice tournament anymore or the novice bnv um so we had to play in the like proper tournament yeah against real teams that really play yeah and if I remember correctly the year cap for the novice tournament is like 15 or something ah yeah so the novice tournament had good players in it right yeah and the real tournament has really good players everyone on that team has
to have been playing for at least almost four years yeah like on average and a lot of people that go play at that club play like a lot right so cuz it's a curling club nothing else happens there which probably has some stupid name like a farn derf or something like a tournament's called a bond Spiel I love the creativity behind that name um but yeah we we were often like you know the team to beat at the novice tournament um and then we we definitely got beaten this time
um we beat one team did your rocks get socked they they got bopped at the very least okay Luc is a farn derfer confirmed um but yeah the the one thing for me is I try really hard to be useful so um I I'm trying to play really well with my shots but when we go to sweep I can generate a decent amount of power so I'm going for it but I'm going for it hard every time so the next day I'm really sore oh I see my problem with that is yeah you have a bit of like Sprint and collapse sort of mindset yeah
in life yep it's um interesting we'll call it that sure um I was going to go with flaw but sure it works fine if you just never collapse yeah see but that's the thing wrong why don't you just continue um so the next day the soreness kind of threw my shots off a little bit right okay and your shoulder's been not perfect over the last couple years held together for the tournament oh well okay everything physically was fine just the S like it's a lot of fine movements and stuff so
when you're when certain muscles are tight you're stiff the fine movement is going to change slightly so when there's no like practice shots and I haven't been doing this for a year I had it pretty dialed on the first day but because of how we placed we didn't we we could have played all of our games on that one day and if we did it would have been fine but we played the next game the next morning or midday really yeah um and that meant that I I was just a little bit thrown off so I didn't play
that well I didn't play the worst on the team I think I would say um but I didn't play that well in the next day um and I was doing pretty good the day before and then didn't you mention that uh one of your family members had to go like save lives or something so yeah yeah my brother kind of does that all the time so he wasn't able to show up so like it just yeah we didn't end up doing is your brother's career a secret no he's fir fighter okay yeah yeah so that's what we mean
um yeah so it as the team that like tends to win these all the time it's taken a long time for you to arrive at you lost yeah but we were still in the money really yeah oh so you won more than you paid to enter the tournament is that what you mean I don't know if that ended up being true we got money back we were in a money placement but due to the like part of your entry you get like meals and stuff okay so I don't know if it actually ended up like making it positive we did get money back heck yeah
hey shout out good job but so you so you came in second in the consolation bracket yes that's a pretty respectable result it was better than I thought yeah yeah I didn't think we'd end up in the finals yeah I was pretty happy we did that that was a really long story when he could have just said yeah we lost it's a lot of excuse Mak I mean I already told you we lost I forgot you knew what position we were came in yeah yeah I forgot though okay I I knew after the first day I remembered that part and
then I didn't remember until halfway through your very long story that you had told me about rich not being able to be there and stuff I thought you wanted more information no no got it second place equals first loser yeah I mean I don't know but didn't you come in second place in the loser bracket yeah so like so he's like the second loser or like yeah a lot a lot further loser's cousin yeah yeah hi lldd you all seem good at researching products to make sure they are high
quality any tips on how to effectively research products before buying them to ensure it's a quality product worth buying customer reviews try to find customer reviews that look like they're written by real people statistics um statistics five five star "reviews is not as good as a, 4.3 star" reviews yeah yeah yeah for sure that's a good one um you you probably want a decent amount of reviews but not everything's going to have it depending on what you're shopping for I always want to see a combination of
professional reviewers who have spent realistically a limited amount of time with it but know what to look for and real users who realistically aren't as sure what to look for but sh shot know what's annoying uh I need both no I actually do think he cares his memory is just I care about what it's a thing what are you talking about people are saying you didn't care about the curling tournament stuff what curling tournament  curling what more do you want Luke come on Dan you didn't even win no he could
have just like God asked he's just not necessarily can remember stuff like that that's okay yeah and I I I did remember  while that's why I prompted him for his brother not being there notice he didn't  mhm uh maybe I just I you know the part I didn't remember was just that you lost actually I remembered the rest of the  long with all of his EXC exuses that he never made it to that part it might be true that's yeah um game might have started or something yeah the last big
tip is actually a really good one is make sure you also read the onear reviews M cuz if the onear review is just like my shipment got lost it it got here late which is just like both of those are probably outside of the company's hands that has nothing to do with the the quality of the product so what are you even talking about like um so you got to make sure that you're pinching whatever salt is necessary on the the pieces of information that might not be fully representative yeah you
should jump around you should read the high ones read the low ones also read the middle ones cuz sometimes I find the middle ones will also have alternative product suggestions where they'll be like oh this was pretty good but I prefer this other one it's like oh maybe you not necessarily you should just go buy that other one immediately but maybe  that um wrong tab hi like have you considered making a public road map for float plane would love to know if an Android TV app is on
the horizon uh I archived it okay hi LT I work at the Wikipedia Foundation as a fast developer on Wikipedia are there  had I could try I can answer them slightly Luke don't no I can answer them slightly I don't I don't really want to do a road map my reason for that is the team is extremely small so if if we want someone to work on something new they have to stop working on something else so sometimes things get shelved for a certain period of time we also are very small so if
someone say gets sick that thing will just Bey on pause until they're back there often isn't another person to work on it um so people will get raged when something gets delayed when sometimes it's just cuz like we're trying to not be mean to the people that work with us um and honestly one of the best solutions to that is just not really tell you guys what's coming until it's like in beta and you can play with it um so that's been a somewhat of a new strategy and with everything that I just
said in mind I will not comment on the Android TV apps I work at Wikipedia found Wikimedia Foundation as a fost developer on Wikipedia are there any features that you wish Wikipedia had um Wikipedia's pretty good I yeah it does what I want no notes yeah I don't know it's kind of great like I actually found you know that the the eBay stocking Scandal thing we covered I think it was last week I found the best coverage for that was just the Wikipedia page on it yeah cool like wow pretty good um chat has some
thoughts dark mod I mean is such a simple site though you could just use a dark reader or something right I'm I am certain there are third party add-ons to make Wikipedia Dark mode I'm surprised they don't have a dark mode but um solidarity let's go all right hit me down why can't you emulate Cuda on other gpus I know it's a dedicated Hardware but emulators for consoles exist I'm not expecting 100%'s performance but 1% is still better than 0% you forgot the last part of that message
thanks for the butt cleaner I was pausing for dramatic effect wait what um the point of Cuda is performance day uh so forgot we have this I can't think of any compelling reason to emulate Cuda on other Hardware I guess would be the main thing um I'm sure that there's I'm sure that there are developers who might have more thoughts on this than I do but no I'm I'm not I'm  um yeah I just I just can't think of a good reason to do it um why would anyone  emulator the hardware is readily
available um so you can you can get a cheap consumer card and use that for testing um yeah I just I just can't think of a good reason to do it you can even throw uh you can even throw an Nvidia card in a system that doesn't that already has another GPU and just use it as a Cuda accelerator like it's uh yeah someone in Philipine chat said I I lost it so I can't say their name but uh Wikipedia needs video content um oh aodb there it is no yeah no you want to completely destroy their cost yeah add
video and honestly I can't think of very many articles that would need it no n none of them reading yeah read it's a trip yep sounds hard um it can be yeah yeah there apparently are Cuda translation engines uh Quantum Jank says I was reading about one the other day um yeah but that would be that's not an that's not emulation though is my understanding my my understanding is that would be tools to allow you to recompile um but yeah guys for for real I am not a developer so take that for what it
is um last one of the curated that I have when you do decide to change for the sake of change if you decide that at all what would it take for a new WoW intro or set a new WoW intro would require me to remember to remind Ed to and it would require him to have time to do it h problem so that's that uh as for the wow set um we would have to want to spend money on the wow set which I'm not feeling especially motivated to do right now yeah 2023 has been a challenging year and I don't see 2024 not being a
challenging year yeah I I feel like unless it moves I wouldn't yeah and even if it moves maybe you can just seems fine yeah it's in a state of flux you know what we could do is we could like um we could just rotate the whole thing 90 degrees we could have that in the back like we hold on here this is interesting what that that the coolest wall of the set never gets shown what why don't we just use that one what's going on  whoa there's something else on the W set  illegal how could this possibly be 
hey that's a relic and slay the Spire that gives you potions after every battle now that's a  whatever obviously well you've played I guess I don't know and are you going to go all the way over to the other wall oh he's continuing I like this this is cool there's something stopping up it's    yeah oh Cam  who speed pan we're back you need to adjust what is that letter on the Shelf I think we can't tell you if I remember correctly what that is we that's supposed to be private right I 
so I think it I think there's a request in it to like not read it in a video or something I don't remember if that's that one or not sometimes people send mail that they like don't you know this is not supposed to be a tweet   um it's fan mail for the they just movies podcast oh never mind I thought it was something else no ah well I guess it'll keep Liv  me hi w. DL need a home security system ubiquity is awesome but price is prohibitive unraid falls down on the GF approval Factor needing VPN to local
network suggestions on Alternatives this is a really really good question and I think will require more investigation and research than what I have available to me right here right now on the show uh maybe chat  thoughts yeah that might be a forum one yeah Forum post good suggestion yeah there are some good suggestions for how to deal with the VPN um situation like tail scale uh that's a very complicated situation yeah and if ubiquity is price prohibitive then 100% this is a forum
post and like a community has to figure out what it works exactly for your needs yeah because obviously just about ubiquity is great you're done uh okay up next hey J Phil and Nick today I proved that the RGB sweater works with the Boss suit the Jus sense podcast t T of compliments on the look if Nvidia ever manages to buy arm do you think they could topple Intel and AMD uh I don't I don't think that arm is the the the threat to Intel and AMD right now um okay I shouldn't say that okay hold
on okay the latest Snapdragon processors are making windows on arm kind of look viable that's pretty cool um however for a long time you know the the the conversation around uh you know the big threat to Intel and AMD has been the data center and the inroads that arm is making there but um until and AMD are still kind of kind of doing okay there and risk 5 is coming so fast like I  system that's actually kind of nuts yeah with with 3D acceleration dude like it ran like crap but it ran the fact that
it did anything is crazy yeah um risk is good yeah I I I I ever manages to buy arm I don't think they would want to I mean Nvidia their their CEO has said publicly that anytime Intel is headed into a business they they would rather just not go  I I also don't see how they need to buy arm in order to threaten until an amd's data center CPU business anyway like we've already got their super chip and stuff like that like I just I could they topple into no yeah no I don't think it's a I don't think it's a 
option when do you decide uh sorry no that's it that's all I've got for um the curated there we go hey dll what's your opinion on the community porting Spider-Man 2 to PC I know Linus's opinion on sailing the high seas but that's a different topic entirely um I did not know about this to be perfectly honest with you so I'm going to have to I'm going to have to  up Luke had you heard of this seen this what oh the Spider-Man 2 thing yeah yeah I curated that cuz I was like schwat uh
I think that's a current gen console only game is that right yes it's PS5 an unofficial oh it is not this is according to gam rant uh it is not expected to be released after many of the people involved have withdrawn from the project an unofficial Marvel Spider-Man 2 PC Port was derived from materials leaked in the recent Insomniac data breach and it has been scrapped ah yes um I think that I don't think that's different in the case of the Nintendo um breaches and all the kind of
historical you know artwork and assets and uh developmental history that was une earthed I was I was pretty supportive because these were products that had already made their money in the case of a game that is going to come to PC probably at some point I'm not sure if they've officially announced it or not but like is probably going to come to PC at some point but hasn't yet because of their relationship with Sony and you know they're they're still very much actively monetizing this
intellectual property I yeah I'm I I don't know what to say other than that no um that's not really very cool you didn't you didn't make that game um it's  also like Insomniac aren't they kind of cool like should thought so shouldn't we  them love the show has there been any progress with the waterresistant ball cap I haven't seen or heard anything about it for a while me neither uh Dan do you want to just forward this one internally and maybe uh they can get an answer sure I will send that to Nick
hello D Luke have you heard of spt it has to do with tarov yeah uh I I think  um yeah I I not really my thing if I'm going to want to play tarov I'm probably going to want to play it with someone else uh unless it if it supported Co-op and the AI was good it could be a fun game uh but without Co-op it doesn't really mean much to me um there's so many cheaters in standard tarov that it's actually insane so like it would be kind of nice to get away from that um and they have a they have a
bug right now where if you crouch walk at minimum speed you actually just make zero sound uh which in a game like tarov is like kind of a problem um but there's always going to be problems with tarov so just kind of is what it is I don't know I would enjoy a uh like Co-op tarov I think that would be really cool but single player tarov is not really my flavor but I can understand how it would  people um any more in curated or should I just start going through the um potentials I'm looking at the potentials
uh yeah I was replying to potentials so Luke if you want to pick some potentials for us to do out loud I'll go and I got a response back from Nick light about the ball caps well that's  in uh there's another one it's a quick and easy one yeah the uh the order is on its way to us it is currently in shipping thank you Nick uh next question when will computer pet bed coming out oh soon yeah I think we just sorted out a packaging issue where the box was the wrong size it was too small and it was
like crumpling it too much so we're going to have a bigger box for it but yeah I think we're placing our order so so soon soonish like like on the order of weeks but not three like like more than a month worth of weeks but not like many many months right um this is a this is a weird one what are your thoughts on algorithmically managed Network switches like what Nile is doing have you ever heard of these no we did uh we actually participated in a campaign that Cisco was doing um do
you remember man do you guys remember  on here we go oh yeah here we go here we go sounds dangerous okay do you guys remember this campaign from Cisco with Peter Dinklage Peter Dinklage no he basically walks around what is this like London or something I don't know he walks around some City for three minutes positing what if questions about you know a network that self- manages and then I remember working with the agency and being like hey okay so what exactly is it that you're promoting and they were like
we're not sure we assumed you would know let me get back to you so I find so I yeah I ended up having to talk to engineers at Cisco to explain like what the exactly it was that they were promoting but it was basically that what you're talking about like algorithmic monitoring and reacting to uh changes in uh Network load or user Behavior or whatever else um I mean theoretically it sounds super cool but I would need to hear from people who actually admin these networks before I
was going to try to say anything intelligent about it on W show sounds kind of like there was an onion article ages ago when the cloud was a thing HP has the cloud we definitely do and you can do all the cloud things on it we have it yeah pretty much and all of their marketing stuff was that they had no idea it was great uh onion HP didn't actually like think that uh of course let's see let's uncover that one um question for Luke I'm a mechanical engineer but a lot of my job has turned
into software development I enjoy it and I'm apparently good at it but I feel like I don't know what I'm doing advice no one does stay curious enjoy your stay that's about it hello werin that's a new one that is a new one I like I like this a lot have you ever felt external validation of your career choice from an unexpected person or event like some random person who thank you for a specific video I don't know if my mom ever told me she thought it was  unexpected it's funny because uh she's
the one who got me into Tech in a big way or in in at least some ways um like we we were the first people I knew with internet yeah like 144k baby um but then like at some point she just completely lost interest in it or something I don't whatever um yeah shoot um there's always really random stuff you get recognized in in like you've mentioned this before but if you go into like a Best Buy it's like yeah okay yeah but you expected that yeah so that's an easy answer no no no that's not what I'm
saying um like those ones are easy  there there's been for me it's always like people that do stuff that I think is like like like when when when we figured out that like people from NASA watch our show I was just like yeah that's pretty cool what I don't know like you're way smarter than yeah like what what's going on how can like anything I say be beneficial or interesting to you but yeah I don't know um it's cool hey D lonus you often refer to Final Fantasy 6 as your favorite games
uh one of your favorite games if Essie you were to remake it would you prefer to have it done in AAA fashion I.E 7R or with 2.5d visuals more akin to octopath traveler I think having played six so many times I would actually be pretty open to a reimagining of the story more like seven remake I would be unhappy with how long that would take like looking at how long all the parts of seven remake are taking to come out like i' I'd be old and gray by the time I could play it um at this
point especially because Final Fantasy 6 does not get enough love like what they're going to remake SE like what what Would You remake next after seven probably not six not no one's going to remake eight nobody cares about eight except you you're the one person and I don't even have to say anything no you don't count the one other the one other person that was going to say yeah I could see them doing it would probably be 10 I was going to say 10 yeah but with worse voice acting I don't think that would be
possible us the ones that I hear spoken about the most in order is seven then six than 10 and I I'm not even including you um yeah but the six Community is really loud the 10 Community is much bigger got it I mean it's frustrating for me because nine is if I'm being honest probably better than any of them nine is i' like never talk about n nine is so good it's glorious it's it's a masterpiece um people are saying yeah krono trigger would probably get a remake before Final Fantasy 6 100% uh I
accidentally just archived one where someone was asking me if I've made a bur burrito with my birds and I don't know what that means you wrap it up in a little in in a in a and eat them no um no never well never done that except for when you need to handle them and feed them medicine and stuff but I've never done it for like fun they hate it um some larger birds are more comfortable with it but they not a fan lus says somebody who has successfully built and managed a tech focused business common
misconception it is a media focused business but carry on it's less Media Group that's right what advice do you have for individuals looking to start their own business in 2024 oh good luck I know the news says economic recovery coming that means it's not going to happen right it's kind of tough times right now I um I I I I'm trying to figure out and you know what maybe there are places where you know things are different but I'm kind of trying to figure out what they're talking
about I mean economists right they're experts they you know know or something maybe but there's a big difference between the stock market you know doing really good and what's happening to like real people and the earnings the stock market doesn't reflect at all what happens to real people it doesn't care in the slightest yeah uh people are saying interest rates are coming down yeah but that's that's rumored yeah interest rates are supposed to be coming down that that will only help in certain
ways it won't hurt in you know in  um um you know go hard but play it safe you know make sure you've got something that has a has a has a clear value you know regardless of of what kind of Economic Times we're heading  yeah lld but mostly Linus here in the year of Our Lord tet is it TSH T I don't I don't do the I don't do the foreign words very well I only I only read I've never heard it said out loud so I'm not not going to be able to help you really yeah okay uh uh are you watching Canucks
games now that they're competitive or is it badminton hours till the end no um I I I'm Googling it I I stopped watching competive I stopped watching NHL hockey after I think either the last lockout or the one before the lockout I was I've talked about this before but I was just kind of tired of um I got sort of disenchanted with the whole thing I stopped seeing teams as you know teams representing my city and I started seeing them for what honestly sorry to Red Pill you here but for what they are
businesses they're businesses they build Brands they extract money from customers you're not a fan you're a customer and they're not a team they're a business um and so I just it just it made it really hard for me to cheer and since I don't bet all of a sudden the stakes were really low for me and it just kind of drained the fun out of it I still love hockey i' still love to watch hockey I would play hockey if I had the physique for it um it's it's just it's such an amazing sport it's
it's great uh but I just I I also just don't have the kind of time that I used to back when I really followed it and watched every game uh with that said I read um I do know how things are going and I I pay attention to the cast of characters um they're having a heck of a season I mean I guess maybe this is maybe this is it we're due to uh to losing game seven in the finals it's been a while for those wondering it's happened three times we've never actually brought home a Stanley Cup but three connect
teams 82 94 and 204 2006 some sometime sometime around there um all three times to I think it was the Islanders the Rangers and then the Bruins uh they went to seven games and couldn't get her done so yeah was it 2011 thanks guys  uh yeah it's uh it's it's it's I play badminton I don't play hockey and I I I don't have time to watch games but I'm like I'll I'll just end up like slack J staring at the TV if there's a hockey game on in like a restaurant or something like that I don't have cable
happens to me too so I don't have an easy way to watch uh the one time I subscribed for cable I got a free trial right as the playoff started so that I could watch the playoffs and then I canceled it after so yeah I do like hockey just no but yeah the the boys boys are doing a bang up job this year yeah lineups you have built out your home network L I guess as as you've already finished your home network are there any updates or changes you would have done I'm about to finish construction on a
new home looking to upgrade my current 60 Wi-Fi to 7 oh Wii 7's amazing uh the good news is that nothing will prevent me from just swapping out 60 access point for seven uh when the time comes I'm not going to bother until I have any seven devices in the house um more cond do it I hey I replaced the display port cable to My Lan PC it was damaged I I'm I'm pretty sure 100% now that it was damaged because now that I have a new cable in it's working perfectly but I was getting blanking
issues and it took about 3 hours to go from the mechanical room room through the theater over to the land Center and then from the pole station in the land Center over to pc1 and we actually buried two extras in the wall but they were both just short of long enough for pc1 like it would have been fine for Station 2 3 four or five um but the conduit was a lifesaver I mean it would have taken me forever it would have taken me tens of hours of ripping out drywall and putting it back on and
mudding and painting it like like it just if I wanted it embedded in the wall yeah more conduit is more better how this should just have conduit it I  fiber fiber's cool mhm it's not necessary not for home but it's really cool I didn't know it was going to be like land parties at my house though you know like 50 users you know we're doing another one right yeah yeah can be good I don't know Chase is going to work March March oh do we have a date no  pushed we still don't know who's in the
right on that one yeah I don't care it doesn't matter we were going to get it done no matter what yeah all right the time the time a little bit worried about the certain things because of that now but you know yeah uh let's see let's see as someone who's gearing up to start a company why are ethically run companies so rare nowadays how do you instill company  hires I think we need to do a better job of integrating new hires we've grown really fast over the last couple of
years and I think that culturally we've struggled a little bit that's totally not at all with the question was asking but yeah like oh oh oh yeah I guess they were asking about ethics not culture I consider ethics like a pretty key part of your culture though no he was asking how you do it and you said I said we haven't done a great job but we have at points okay I mean I guess I mean well do you not at all know how to do it well you just have to you have to just be a good example  ethics
I I um I unarchived it well and it's not just that right like you also have to be willing to listen yeah like we've we've had we've had times when there's a lot of times from your perspective you won't see it whatever it is and so and a lot of times I still won't see it the first time someone brings it up I mean people's minds are hard to change right  and I'm not perfect I won't be  lot and I hate to be this guy but uh a lot of non-ethical practices lead to successful businesses so that's probably
why you see less of them yeah we've definitely created trouble for ourselves that we could have avoided by just lying cheating or stealing Y and one one negative thing and I've brought this up a bunch the example that I almost always use is the uh developers speaking on stage at blizzard thing but it extrapolates to like everything um but when a company does do something good uh by like admitting something or doing whatever else like anything on those Realms and then the community just
assumes it's the tip of the iceberg spearheads them for it yeah that can Crush companies that are trying to do good things and just because the silent ones that are doing bad stuff you don't hear about because no one's bothering to investigate or do anything like that um those companies end up living and it's like it's a problem I've brought this up a bunch of times on the show but I think sometimes uh certain communities don't understand um like I see this in Pokémon
go a lot I've started playing because it gets me out walking and people scream so much in that game all the communities like I was all excited I was like this is really fun there's like events every weekend like this weekend I'm planning on going out it's going to be snowy whatever I'll chge through it because there's some event do I really care about the Pokémon no but it's some gamified thing that makes my brain want to go for a walk so I'm I'm diving in um but the community is just so mad all the
time like I'm I'm All happily playing this game and I look into like what's going on on Reddit or whatever else and the whole thing's just a dumpster fire and it's like oh wow okay you don't don't have to be so mad about everything all the time and I think sometimes people don't necessarily understand they like really like this thing so they're really passionate about it then something about it bothers them so they just scream to the mountains and they don't necessarily understand that
newcomers to this thing also known as the thing that's going to help keep the thing that you like alive are going to be scared off by the amount of hate that's being spread all the time so like you kind of need to do the the compliment sandwich thing more often and  like if you only ever point out the bad you never point out the good then adoption is going to fall and then this thing that you like clearly considering you're still playing or enjoying it or doing engaging with it or whatever it is
um is going to just completely die and you won't have it anymore so try to remember that that applies to companies that applies to video games that applies to whatever all right I think we've just got one or two more uh we had someone asking about oh did that get archived or answered or something all right see you later oh yeah no here it is Michael asks what game do you think was most overhyped than underperforming versus the most unanticipated success so so underhyped and overperforming this
year also this was the one I was more interested in what game do you think killed a studio the hardest this year cuz there was that um the gollem didn't kill the studio no but that was that was a big blow that was that was probably the overhyped underperforming one yeah um what was that one that that recent one where they launched the game and it like was completely not what they said it was that was just a scam though I think that studio was dead no matter what Okay it definitely got killed
really hard that's true I don't remember the name of it um oh pal world looking hot yeah that's that Pokemon with guns thing I kind of want to try [Laughter] it um yeah I don't remember the name of this game yeah the day after yeah I don't remember what it was something kind of like that oh shoot I just  right I don't remember what it's called but yeah it was basically a scam and then it got pulled because it was basically a scam something like that I think that is pretty much it yeah
uh we will enjoy all of your the Steve mock necks um it's been pretty popular nice um yeah we're still working on Long t-shirt formats don't worry it it's happening uh and we'll see you again
