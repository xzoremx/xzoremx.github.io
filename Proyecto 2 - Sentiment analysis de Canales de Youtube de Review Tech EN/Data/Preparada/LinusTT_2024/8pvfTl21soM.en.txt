we've got a great show for you guys today did you know that your car is a snitch that's right mine's not these snitches going to get some well you know um repairs more expensive Bondo monthly Insurance also where is Kate I forgot her name I was going to say see what are all the Kates I know Winslet Kate Middleton where is Kate Middleton that's right we're going to be talking about the big Scandal that's rocking the Royal world that's our headline topic not because either of us
gives two flying sh about what goes on with the Royals nope but I didn't know who this was but because of the technology that seems to be at the core of what's going on what else we got today yeah speaking of Technology EU AI regulations uh or regulations good do we not want them do we want them heated debate we'll talk why do you pick such bad topics okay it's like you prepare yourself for me to take all the good ones and you just work your way from the bottom AMD UPS the hurts is
like all right AMD UPS the what the HS would you pick that one you could take that one why would you pick that one why why would no I I'm not picking that yeah pick why would you pick that weird notebook check article about our video would you pick that one no no okay uh what do we have left there's only two articles left would you pick FCC quadruples minimum internet speed required for Broadband label no I would take Airbnb bands cameras in airbnbs it's it's in the main talk scroll past
that I thought you took all the main     the show is brought to you by the ridge Squarespace and vessie all right why don't we jump right into our headline topic now I know that you're an avid Royal Watcher so none of this is going to be news to you but Kate Middleton the Princess of Wales sure what does that mean um I think it means that she's not princess of the Fire Kingdom okay or lumpy space But Water um because yeah I I'm not look the rules seem really complicated because the elements are
like lumps fire candy I don't really get it the point is there's a Princess of Wales and she's been the subject of intense news coverage and online speculation over the past few days after a Mother's Day image of her sent to various wire Services turned out to have been significantly do Services before well remember like news wire okay yeah like that kind that kind of that kind of wire service not like money wiring so Luke let's have a look at this and see if there's anything that raises you
haven't read through the notes yet right good good good good good okay so we're going to bring it up on here is there anything about this picture that raises the alarm bells to you without without looking at anything else no no no stop stop I was just trying to zoom my eyes are bad I'm immediately looking at hands okay um how are those how are those hands looking for you the hands seem fine so her left hand so right for us um that like this thing that I'm doing where it's just like they're all very
straight and it's kind of a pan y y actually I'm seeing it on the other side a little bit too that's fairly common for once once AI imagery got good at fingers they started just making them like here's a a board of fingers but it's not quite happening her one finger there is a little bit separated so no I think the hands are fine y I mean I couldn't help noticing that this is sharp and this hand is extremely blurry very blurry yeah um also that appears to be in the same plane as this hand which
is not especially blurry yeah um it it looks like it's been touched up and and doctored to a certain degree but that would happen no matter what any picture of Royals is going to be touched up is there anything here that jumps out to you as potentially problematic yeah wait what's going on oh there's a sniper there's a sniper duck Kate the hair on the the right side of her head is like super fuzzy and I don't mean oh man I can't use that term it's very like blurred and
also yeah like where's her shirt mhm mhm it just looks like a shadowed version of okay yeah I mean that could be a thing yeah there there could be some there could be some Biz there has been some surprisingly serious and poorly done question mark doctoring to her hair on the one side I don't know what's up with that okay her whole head looks like it might so not originate from this photo yeah so here's the thing oh oh oh okay let's look really closely at the the non squared one on the left
looks really closely on the right one her cheek dimples are those exactly the same it looks like maybe no uh sir it looks like maybe Le yes look at how in well oh yeah but she's going to have cheek dimples no matter what so like look at how deep they are like how wide or smile is by how deep they are now scroll up and look in the other one okay yeah let's this is overl like we can't really look look at we'll a look at the dimples okay it's really blurry it's very blurry it's blurry why is it so
blurry the kids aren't very blurry no the kids are the kids are not blurry the kids are pretty well defined so basically let's let's let's run through this let's run through this Middleton's last public appearance was on Christmas day which for those who math is if I didn't work here my last public appearance would have been a long time ago okay all right the point is her job is literally to make public appearances so so that's what okay all right oh so her last public appearance was on
Christmas Day on January 17th the royal family announced she would be undergoing scheduled abdominal surgery and would return to the public eye around Easter which In fairness uh is not until a couple of weeks from now most people accepted this explanation but there was some question as to why she would need to cancel weeks of upcoming events if this surgery was truly expected and planned uh yes that's a good point while nothing truly suspicious had happened yet people were being extremely conspiratorial
about all of this on some segments of social media by about late February and this is pretty typical of Royal Watchers you know whether it's whether it's um H help me out the actress Megan Markle and Prince Harry uh or whether it's Kon williiam people are always Megan Markle that's her name right she was an actress she's on suits I never seen that okay it doesn't matter the the point is that okay the point is that that that people follow the Royals extremely closely and anything even
remotely resembling a scandal seems to blow up pretty spectacularly unless it's prince Andrew in which case we cool with it we yeah he went to what island huh  umw oh my goodness um okay this Mother's Day photo received initial scrutiny because it had a few obvious inconsistencies like and Luke didn't even notice this even though he is a self-professed expert on the Royals Kate was not wearing a wedding ring wait and no I looked for that what hand do you wear wedding ring on
tell is it your right tell me tell me tell oh man could could you be could you be less you know into the whole matrimony thing it's it goes on your left hand then we should be able to see it uh yes we should definitely be able to see I thought it might have been under the kids arm but not only that but there was a fully unfurled or there's a tree with fully unfurled green leaves in the background despite it being supposedly early March observers then noted clear sign wait when is Mother's I
thought Mother's Day is in May Mother's Day is like coming up yeah but this is I don't know it's a Mother's Day photo I don't know don't worry about it so they took it like way ahead of Mother's Day I don't know when you Mother's day is okay what are y'all doing over there huh the point is observers then noted clear signs of editing including heavy use of a bluring tool and inconsistencies in the family's hair and clothing uh wire Services generally only allow small cosmetic edits like cropping and red eye
removal leading them to retract the picture only a a few hours later a tweet attributed to Kate Middleton claimed fault for the bad Photoshop job but that has not stopped posts insisting that the photo was entirely AI generated or that the princess's face was photoshopped into the photo over that of another woman however according to Tom Warren of The Verge the photo metadata indicates that it was shot on a Canon 5D markv and edited using a 2022 version of Photoshop from before AI features were added some
online sleuths have insisted that Middleton's face in the photo matches and was taken from her cover on Vogue while detractors say that it simply looks similar because it is a picture of the same woman with the same face I mean the lighting is different her bottom teeth are slightly showing in the Mother's Day photo Etc ET yeah like to be completely honest if you look at a bunch of pictures of lonus at like various conventions posing with people the like I am taking a photo face yeah it's pretty similar
so is it necessarily the exact same face um I don't 100% think so I don't 100% think so but I also do not know for sure that it isn't yeah I see what they're getting at they they are they are very similar but you said this is a person whose job is to make public appearan is they're going to have taking a photo face I'm I'm taking a photo smile so our question here because realistically I don't think any not either of us is other than a general concern for anyone one who has
been disappeared uh I don't think either of us is particularly into the whole Royals thing so if there's any Intrigue in like you know oh is this how they're you know going to soft announce a divorce or you know whatever CU there was some speculation that um not Harry not Andrew the other one William Jeff uh that's not a royal name Luke King  real I think it was Joffrey anyway wasn't it I don't know I don't know I don't know I only read the first book I I have a I have a whole thing where I
won't consume content until it's all produced so I'm waiting for him to finish all the books oh yeah I know that might be a problem he's actually going to die before I get to read Game of Thrones if you Google King Jeff it's just really ripped dudes I don't know how that happened I mean maybe she was the one cheating with King Jeff maybe I wouldn't blame her dude King Jeff is Ja I don't know how much of his testicles are left at that point none but he's rifted who cares at that point oh man
don't do steroids um um what are we even talking about who knows yeah okay the point is the point is we're we're not Royal Watchers but this is really  because this is interesting because yeah it raises a really interesting question with the way that this is being covered by the mainstream media and with the way that uh topics like Photoshop over the years and more recently AI are making their way into the public Consciousness this feels like a really significant moment because you and I on the WAN show
and you guys who watch the WAN show you're dialed into this stuff you know what the capabilities of large language models are I mean you watched us reacting live to the launch of chat GPT and interacting with the thing right you're uh whether it's you know mid Journey or Dolly you know you're you're looking at the ever evolving capabilities uh of these uh of these AI image generators and stuff like that so you guys are dialed into it but this right here is spk a conversation with
the normies you know with the aunts and uncles and nieces and the extended family all your cousins are talking about this and they're asking the question is anything that I am looking at real real anymore and with the amount of bots on things like x.com and other various websites it's like speaking of we're streaming on x.com for the first time today yeah we're live we're live on X or are we I hope so they have video What If you just combined that and audio whatever Luke let me push back on one of your
hypotheses okay my hypothesis one of your hypothesis okay so you you had said it's it's quite it's quite probable that she has a photo taking face yeah okay so what if yeah this is slightly different what if it's slightly different though because an AI was trained on this photo and a handful of other photos what if it looks so similar because kind of like we've seen very famous works of art basically spat out with slight Alterations by AI image generators you see where I'm going with
this right I get it and I think the point is like that that everything that exists will have Doubt cast on it moving forward and this is kind of the sign of that and I do agree yeah whether this is real or not the fact that so many eyes are on it and there is such a you know a lot of people that are saying one thing or the other are saying it with a certain amount of uncertainty just shows that you you can't really be certain about much these days remember when we were looking at Sora when they announced
that that big upgrade and we were watching that car racing along a track in all these different environments right okay it's it's autumnn now it's underwater now it's a sunny day it's raining there is absolutely no reason why I couldn't take that Vogue cover shoot that Vogue cover photo and be like okay it's overcast today can you adjust my lighting based on that that is well within the capabilities of AI image alteration tools that we have today and just because they're using an older version
of Photoshop for something on this image  necessarily man see here I'm I'm like I'm falling in I'm falling into the Trap metadata for a file to my knowledge can be altered yeah so okay was it shot on a five 5D whatever Mark whatever my okay my push back on that is if they would go that far I feel like they would have done a better job touching up things like her hair and other various it is confusing isn't it it it it's it's honestly like a poorly done Photoshop job it raises it raises a whole other
layer of questions because here's my first question right so we talked about already that this is someone who is a public figure and is accustomed to public appearances yeah why in God's name would you pick the cover of a Vogue magazine as your picture as your as your choice for the Mother's Day picture oh yeah like out of the out of the out of the mountain I don't think that that's necessarily it though because like you said they might have used a variety of other images as well
that's just that's just her I'm taking a photo face um like let's see what's her name Kate Middleton Kate uh midleton images okay so you're basically looking to see oh man he's going into slof mode do you have a photo taking face a lot of these are candid yeah which means no um I don't know how old this photo is down and right is not candid you you went I me it just me down and right from where your mouse was no left oh my God this one down this one down this one yes oh that's not candid
that looks quite old though it's very similar too it's similarish I wouldn't say it's nearly as similar as the the similar ones aged I saw I saw another one when I was uh when I was poking around in this conspiracy theory where they're like oh yeah uh there's this picture of her and the prince in a car and this picture is also ripped off of somewhere else that didn't make it into our notes I'm not sure if that one's been debunked already or something like that I mean like this is
at a completely hello I got you did I get locked out I don't know did I lose permissions I don't know uh this one's like an action shot and down on a weird angle she's making the exact same smile yeah that's fair that's fair I I I think this is a thing yeah it could be a thing but it could I think more realistically it could be like an AI generated thing you can go in and edit even that so why would you even bother like this is the like world's most simple AI or uh Photoshop job I don't why would you
bother with AI generation I don't know what's the point Luke like why there's an entire generation of people who are you know adjusting their boobs and curving the stuff behind them and adjusting their weight adjusting their adjusting their pecs and adjusting their facial hair and I think this is everyone I I I don't I don't think this is a single generation okay multiple Generations okay I I don't think Gen X  Zoomers you don't see you don't see as much of that you see some all right you
see some so so we've got generations of people who are making what I think you would judge to be unnecessary changes to their pictures okay all right yeah yeah so you're asking why are they doing this no no no no no no no no I'm saying why would they use AI instead of someone just photoshopping it because yeah that's fair if if the job cuz like honestly the the thing that looks to me like what might have happened is a head replacement right yeah what do you mean people were doing
that convincingly when I was in high school like yeah this this is not like super Advanced you don't need AI tools to do that why would you even bother and then when it comes out and you see these massive blurry portions why wouldn't you go like well let's go let's go one layer deeper into the conspiracy Warr in here sure they did it to make us talk about it see that's sick I like that a lot I don't think so I don't think I don't think so I think my favorite comment about that that I
saw from someone I forget who was like yeah maybe if the queen was still in charge but realistically the rest of these guys are a bunch of bumbling idiots there's no way they had that much game sense that honestly sounds very real yeah I don't know see that's the thing is I I I legitimately don't pay that much attention I just saw this trending and I was like okay this is very interesting and I think it's a it's a really fascinating topic of conversation um have you gotten any King cash yet
King cash yeah what's King cash Canadian dollars with the King on them oh God unless it's Mufasa I'm not interested I haven't gotten any King cash yet are we printing King cash yeah oh man I guess we would have had to eventually I I kind of thought maybe we could stall until he dies and something that's interesting too is your passport says from the queen oh yeah right yeah oh no I have to get a new one I don't know I guess it's going to be maybe do they all expire now like what happens I
don't know I I like I was I I was like I swear it says from the queen and I checked my own passport and was like yep my passport is authorized by someone who isn't alive anymore how does that work I have no idea like Canadian passports uh effectively say um the queen says this person can travel please allow them to travel that's like effectively you know it's much longer than that and written cool but like man what does that mean now dude I got to say with the with the the Gap in both time and societal and
technological advancement between Queen Elizabeth II's coronation and um uh King  coronation I I dipped in for about 30 seconds of just highlight clips of the whole thing and I was just kind of like Robin Williams Jumanji what year is it you like it just it felt so bizarre and out of place it felt like fiction it felt like a scene in a in a movie about a time long past and a kingdom long ago like the whole thing felt so silly the I the idea of you know God ordaining a monarch that
whatever it's like yeah we we moved past that so long ago like she rained for like 70 years or something like that and so much has changed in that time that it just the whole thing felt so silly like my entire life I just kind of accepted yeah like Queen Elizabeth or whatever she lives in a in a castle somewhere and she's on our money and you know I mean honestly when she was younger she's kind of hot so like whatever I'm kidding I'm kidding I'm just trying to get I'm just trying to
get a r it took a second from him to process that well cuz I was reading apparently Canada unveils a new passport with more security features and a nod to King Charles okay so we'll have a look at that in a second the point is just like it never it never really occurred to me it was just a normal thing that I didn't think about yeah like yeah the Queen's on the money who cares but then now that it's changing I'm sitting here going why don't you wa wait wait wait wait wait wa why don't you put Terry Fox
on the money please what please please what put Terry Fox on yeah put Terry Fox on the money yeah that'd be wake speaking of which like the most based Canadian thing ever okay do you know about this I don't know where whether they were watching W show or not Terry Fox Foundation reached out no way yeah that's pretty sick so we're okay no promises in terms of the depth of the collaboration um but don't don't worry about that don't speculate anything I don't want people to get the wrong idea
but at the very least you and I are going to wear Terry Fox Foundation shirts for a w show sick so that we've got locked in as part of part of a campaign that they're doing in collaboration with Ryan Reynolds they basically want awes any Canadian that has any kind of audience to where our Terry Fox Foundation shirt we're going some shirs and then if we can do anything a little bit deeper then we will we'd be very excited to do something like that but yeah I was I was like I got like two emails in a row one
was from some AI company that I've wanted to collaborate with and that was and then five minutes later I heard from the Terry Fox Foundation I'm like this is a good day this is a pretty good day my phone's blowing up for all the right reasons those are good days yeah I'm really excited yeah um no we'll we'll tell we'll tell you we'll tell you the story of Terry Fox man it feels like it almost feels like you can tell that story as many times as as you want right it's like it's it's a bedtime story dad
you tell me the story of Terry Fox yeah okay for sure we'll tell you the story of Terry Fox again but we're going to wait until we've got the shirts and we can tell you a little bit about what the foundation is doing these days I'm very excited um anyway okay let's have a look at the new passport you want to show me the new passport sure all right yeah there's a front okay there's the inside okay cool there's some corn that looks like is it actually be colored like that
I don't know I honestly I'm kind into it how do you put the stamps there though I don't know oh maybe there's like alterntive  yeah H there's a surprising lack of like  imagery I think that's Canadian native imagery is it I think so these just look like school kids in like rubber boots um I doubt it all right okay anyway um wow this seems so unnecessary other than I guess that it says the queen in our passport Y Cool should we jump into our next topic sure cars spying on us yeah okay do you know
about this I didn't until I read okay let's let's hear about it some car manufacturers including Acura except it won't affect my car uh GM Honda Hy Acura and Honda interesting okay I mean that's the same company but sounds good um hondai and Mitsubishi have optional gamified features in their connected car apps to track the rate the users driving track and rate track and rate okay I was like what uh track and rate the user's driving these are often framed as coaching apps to improve driving safety
and award users with points for good driving which is actually kind of neat CU driving's kind of boring so if you can try to do that that's cool I like ways for that like I I like reporting things and I get points for it and stuff it doesn't matter but oh yeah yeah yeah I like it driving so boring it also tells me when there are cops nice um according to a report from The New York Times these car companies sell information from these apps to data Brokers which then sell it to insurers
who use that in their determination of a driver's premium wamp wamp it's like selling your medical data uh according to a word to according to workers at GM the revenue from the OnStar smart driver app is in the low millions of dollars further some GM drivers were uh were tracked despite never having enabled any of those tracking features one Cadillac owner who said he was not aware of OnStar smart driver found himself denied insurance by seven different insurance companies before learning that his
vehicle had been sending data that he was often breaking or accelerating hard as well as engaging in some speeding heaven forbid they see my driving I was just going to say neither of us would ever get insurance again which would be a problem uh I would definitely get insurance and I would never and I would never drive with hard breaking I would never get insurance again because Myer my my discount would bring me to 0 cuzz I drive perfectly Y and there would be it would break the system yes it would
break the system and there' be no there'd be no way for him to get insurance such a such a shame Scouts Honor I just drive too well yeah me too I'd have to go out there and unfortunately intentionally speed in like an abandoned parking lot or something just to be able to get in yeah just to seem human yeah unfortunately agreed according to GM it shares select insights with data Brokers but customers agree to share their data when they sign the user agreement other manufacturers
such as Kia say they require additional explicit consent from owners before sh sharing such information meanwhile The Finnish transport and Communications agency has detected oh this is a separate topic talk say what uh so let's talk about this yeah remember when I was talking about how this whole 23 and me data breach thing and I went off on this thing about how anything to do with your DNA is going to impact your insurance at some point if you're American and you should basically
be caring about this a lot and people were like yeah but the laws and it's like a not insignificant number of people were treating me like I was some kind of tinfoil hat conspiracy nut or something like that guys do you think the law matters to the people who are excuse me handling your data do you think they care about the law what punishment is there for this no one's even talking about that as far as I can tell there isn't any there's no consequences and even if there is it'll be a tiny slap on the
wrist exactly and you've got to understand like these are things that this didn't this isn't like oh one car manufacturer was talking about this and a whistleblower was like oh let's make sure this never happens we got to inform the multiple car manufacturers a lot of the biggest ones are running these programs and making millions of dollars  data yeah and like I my brain goes to like okay maybe if they were only allowed to offer discounts based on good driving maybe they weren't allowed to do
anything else but then they just shift the prices up no no then what they do is they use an AI learning model and they basically tell it determine the appropriate premium for everyone and when The Regulators come knocking they go well I don't know how it works it's a black box and it goes oh speaking of which couldn't help noticing that you deny Insurance to anyone with a certain skin color well I mean we have no way of knowing how like that's the that's going to be the
defense 100 times out of a 100 they're just going to hide behind I just left the Train on the tracks EXA ex L yeah yeah yeah yeah I mean we don't we I me there is no good way keep old dumb cars let go you know what and you got to understand how powerful insurance companies are now like all they have to do is say well the alternative is we're just going to not cover anyone in your state and they walk away yeah which is happening and don't imagine they won't it's happening right now people trying
to get home insurance and freaking Florida it's a struggle it's a huge struggle and so so you know you look at this and you go oh yeah well here's the here's the safeguards we could put no as soon as this data exists it will be exploited like honestly I'm on the one hand I was happy to not see Volkswagen on the list because I drive a fancy Volkswagen essentially they own a bunch of cars or bunch of car companies and if I had to if there was you know a a short list of brands that I would think are
just going to be like yeah no and just be all Driving Experience all the time and we'll just charge more for the cars to keep ourselves profitable Porsche would probably be on that list Dodge but on the other hand I don't really trust anybody no at all not when there's not when there's millions of dollars that play like is this even conclusive do they know this is all the companies or is this the ones that they know about that I don't know a scathing report from The New York
Times so like it's possible that some   maybe yeah yeah I wonder what gdpr thinks about this I don't know I mean it's possible they're not collecting the data there it's also possible they're just collecting it surreptitiously and doing nothing with it while they while they B their time like that's that's the thing is the the number of okay you know what I'd love to hear your thoughts on this if there was a data collection program like this how many people like with with beating hearts and functioning
lungs like how many human beings would have to know about it you get what I mean right so everyone could know about the gamified thing but how many people would have to know about this database not very many because you could collect it all and not tell the people that are collecting it that you're selling it mhm so yeah not for a minute very few give me a number obviously at the at the CEO level we're getting we're getting into company scales that I'm not used to operating in
you'd have your top sales execs they would know your top it execs would know so you've got at least a half a dozen right there and then probably a couple not you know top exx but trusted it people so I I don't know you're probably dealing with 20 or less but again we're we're dealing with company scales that I have I have no real understanding of so I'm not really sure I don't the fact that they're able to tie this to an individual person is mindblowing to me one one of my sorry
like if it was aggregate if it was aggregate then I'm kind of looking at it going yeah what do you expect was going to happen but the fact that this can be tied to an individual operator of the vehicle absolutely blows me away right now like this is a Next Level betrayal and a fun little pass time I've been doing recently is looking at surprising employee counts at various companies and this is part of my like I don't really know dude cuz I'll I'll look at like some company that has
basically they have like one software function that they make and they sell I usually find this is in B2B but they sell it for whatever they make effectively one thing it like pretty much hasn't changed over the course of like five years and then you're like I don't know this probably runs on like 5 "to 50 employees and then it's like 1,500" and you're like what like what what do you all do like is is this "like 20 Engineers and, 1480 salespeople" or like how does this work the Wy says
it sounds like they're tying it to the VIN not to a person and that's fair enough but the number of people driving a particular Vin is generally going to be is going to be in the air in the range of one to three yeah you know I'm talking like you know two heads of household and you know one kid maybe you know maybe four or maybe a roommate or whatever else it's you can count them on one hand and because you're tracking all you're tracking the car's driving characteristics you can probably
fingerprint them to a degree honestly yeah without much effort cuz you probably got geolocation information as well so okay these data Brokers a lot of what they do is oh all this information is you know not identifiable except it's extremely fingerprintable and we buy it from all of the different services so we can tie it all together and build a nice little stack and it's it might not be like you know we know this person's exact name although a lot of cases they would um but it it might be like this is
you know this is information we have on this type of a person yeah and then this is the type of person this is so rather than being individuals you sort them into buckets so that's a way to kind of and those buckets can get ever narrower and narrower and narrower so but as long as they don't make it all the way to one person well then you're compliant yeah we don't know what the box does yuck um Rob the tank says Insurance analyst here our models are getting really good so
this data matters uh what's scary is the next step for the big companies is tying  databases what would that mean charging based on your like income that's kind of a scary one is that what that would mean why I could see it so I could see that going a number of different ways um I could see that going to um it what what it sounded like to me was that he was saying that shoot where was I going with this crap crap crap crap crap you make money Elijah shush um crap crap crap Financial databases n whatever
there was there there there was somewhere that I was going with that but I forget oh yeah okay yeah mcxl says okay so they could already charge more or less based on your credit score oh my God why does your credit score affect your insurance rates it's like an abstracted thing I actually I I can't really understand that me neither that doesn't make any sense I don't think I've ever been credit scored for my insurance is that an American thing it could be I know Americans like are more
on the whole credit score thing than we are so maybe uh it's Hurley time says insurance underwriter here models are getting really good but the industry has been losing money on auto for more than the last 10 years at least in the US which doesn't surprise me at all actually and that's that's where we got to that point that I was making about how if you try to clamp down on this Behavior they're basically going to come back and say okay well then we're not insuring a single vehicle in your entire
State we're going to just walk away and you're going to kind of go oh uh uh we kind of need that cuz it's it will be pandemonium especially in a place where healthc care is covered by Insurance not by Universal healthare right it would it it would be like the destruction people would be afraid to drive if they knew that not only like if if you couldn't if you couldn't get insurance and if you didn't know for sure if the other drivers had Insurance like I I saw some people in chat earlier complaining about
how auto insurance is mandatory at all it's like it's not for you brother yeah it's for the person you hit I really want you to have auto insurance yeah like I'm sorry but I actually don't care about your feelings here and that's a fact you need Automotive Insurance because you need it it's it's not for you and it may benefit you but it's not really for you yeah it's to cover your butt Y when you whack into someone else's car H electrobot says nationalize socialize insurance
so also no to be honest as a place where um we kind of have this weird public private partnership Insurance Monopoly for automotive insurance it's not perfect yeah I would even go as far as to say there have been times when it's been pretty catastrophically bad so yeah no yeah is it Insurance attacks right off no but well it can be I know it can be but but what's always attacks right off is our special merch item for the week okay wait what so Luke I don't understand was trying to understand this
before the show why don't we we're going to jump on LTT store.com we're going to jump on LTT store.com okay not not only do I not understand it I I don't understand it in multiple ways this is the tax right off shirt yeah this shirt is a tax write off it actually contains the Full text of the tax write off rant um which that's sick I like that yep it's not it's not an infinite money glitch okay guys this is how it works okay we've got a we've got a ripped up $100 LT bill with um a dead Queen on it
or sorry wait no they no they American bill they keep the same people on their money I know it's an American bill it's Benjamin Franklin doesn't matter the point is that we have the tax WR off shirt so Luke you you had some questions about the tax right off shirt yeah okay let's start with the uh the like less related ones and the less important ones absolutely why pink and Periwinkle well it's a write off okay yeah the corporations they're writing it off so it's because we have extra of
those colors of shirts it's because we we we're going to write them off okay so here's my here's where the root of it comes at yeah we already sell this isn't I'm not even trying to pump us up we sell relatively cheap shirts like if you look at other Creator merch I think our shirts are generally Superior and also cheaper yes why are we selling one that's 50% of that so that we can write it off how does that what is this actually a strategy it's a Roff are we we're so we're actually doing that we're
we're we're just setting a really bad price and then writing off the like losses on it I mean that's how writeoffs work it's not a way of making money Luke it's right on the shirt right at the very bottom of the shirt look do I need to remind you the entire rant is here but why why did we decide to not make money it's not a way of making more money why we actively decide and okay because that's not how that works okay so here's the here's the the thing that really grinds my gears
right you want you want to do tell me remember the story that we talked about about I think it was last week like why  mhm yeah for what I I don't I don't know what you're talking about because of like business decisions that don't make the company money right made by you but we're going to write it off and then Nick runs create a warehouse yeah this isn't going to make money no but we're going to write it off what's going on  Luke imagine we had a single NBA that worked here I think they just freak out
I think they just run out screaming it's like what are you guys doing what's wrong with you why do we do this stuff like do you  questions Dan do you have any questions um how long until they're going to ship oh uh usually it you get a bulk discount on all the external auditing that's going to Happ happen to you uh it'll be available until yeah that too are we just asking for it uh they should be shipped by April 12th not raise any flags that we sold a shirt for less than $10 when like no one does
that and then wrote it off like are they not going to be like hey um actually you have a history of selling T-shirts for 20 bucks a very long and fairly unbroken history of selling T-shirts for $20 why did you price it like this uh so that we could write it off oh you going to tell the government that yeah isn't that bad no it's completely above board yes we're going to write it off okay do you have any other questions I think you were wondering about the colors before why why how can
I achieve escape velocity can you help me with this pink and pink and perrywinkle uh what you had questions about that what's the fastest and easiest way to achieve escape velocity escape velocity yeah on what the planet the planet oh oh I see no no no no I I'd like to address your question about the all right yeah well it's so that we can write them off were they more expensive than like normal colors no no but they're great for writing off I think cuz we have too many of them Dan I
think no but that would that would be that would be an astute business decision and it doesn't seem like that happens here anymore um so I'm going to go through our notes in the dock here on the tax write off sale uh you've seen the memes and now you can buy the memes for yourselves the shirt is $10 in the words in the words of lus Sebastian a tax write off is not a way of making moreing money and neither is this sale because we are losing money on it the shirt the shirt is a tax write off do
you know how much it costs to get a shirt printed at our printer it's $10 isn't it it's it no but it's multiple dollars it's it's multiple dollar also shipping and handling they got to pick it every time they pick it I'm just trying to feel out how much we're going to lose on this enough to write off not only is the shirt only $10 but we have decided to fire sale our remaining 30x30 CPU pillows and color block hoodies for just $4.99 now go ahead hoodies are $49 go ahead luk and ask
me what's up with the pricing of the of the color block hoodie was that was $70 go back up to the oh my God here we go so the the link color block hoodie go ahead and ask me about this price why did we choose this price why why did we choose that price so that we could write it off they're taking up too much warehouse  sale oh there's even more merch messages now we are not going to be able to get to the mall today but enjoy your enjoy your tax write off shirt hoodie and CPU pillow the merch messages per
wow the rate at which we're losing money is actually sort of incredible no we're not losing money I'm dying it's funny because like my dashboard Taran Taran goes on vacation for one week and this happens Luke's still G to get did you do this while Taran was gone is Taran gone well he's not here no I think I think I just made that up okay I was like he flew somewhere yesterday think yeah but I had a call get a new job cuz his company's going down I call with him I had lunch
with him this week I like how did he how's he I'm sorry L I'm sorry Luke uh s004 AWS says also don't forget that retro screwdriver still gets you free  order yeah that code's still active why so that we can write it off Luke oh my go are you thick how long how long is this I'm not sure until we can write it off okay okay so in all seriousness to explain you know what why we're writing these off okay it's to make a point I wanted to demonstrate how a write off Works a write off is not a way
of making money so we addressed when I buy something right and I and I write off the cost of that I didn't I didn't make money magically I personally actually make less money I have an asset that the business own owns but I actually make less money so you can write off a purchase right so that's really it's more of like a tax deduction okay it's tax deductible purchases okay so this is more of a of a tax write off okay so you take something let's say this water bottle that you paid let's
say $10 for okay you sell it for $5 that is at least a loss of $5 and depending on how you do the math there could actually be greater losses associated with it in the handling the storage of the item um in the yeah I mean mostly mostly that I guess handling and storage of the item um so you could have a greater than you know $5 loss on this on this $10 item that you sold for $5 um that money that you lost be it $5 or be it you know six or seven or whatever it whatever it adds up to gets
deducted from your net income for the year so if let's say hypothetically our entire company made $100 for the year normally we would pay about I'm rounding here but we'd pay about a quarter of that in corporate income tax okay but if instead of making $100 we took that $5 that we didn't make on that one item we sold and we deducted that from our net income well now we made only $95 and we'll owe about a quarter of that in corporate income  off why would why would you why would
you go out of your way like to prove a why why do you have to spend so much money to prove points this is now a personal question um because this is not the this is not this is not only the first time this is this is one of many hold on a second I'm not quite done so so if you look at that that that write off right all we've saved is the taxes we would have owed on $5 so we've saved $2.50 on our taxes but we lost $5 plus so I'm trying to illustrate that when you lose money selling a product when
you write it off you still lose money you lose money on the sale you lose money on your total net income for the year it's like a shock absorber yes essentially because you're not paying you're still getting shocked you you you pay taxes on profit relax you pay taxes on profit so if you didn't make the money you don't pay income tax on it that's in a nutshell and it's way more complicated and but in a nutshell that's how it's fundamentally supposed to work when something is is tax
deductible or is a tax write off um so why do I need to spend so much money in order to make points yes and when when  trility like this negativ reflect his performance when you need to prove a point um well if it does then he should  off okay so the reason that we have to spend so much money when we want to prove a point is because we want to make a splash we want people to remember the point if we lost $100 to prove our point about tax writeoffs if that had been a real $100 bill that I had destroyed
nobody would have remembered that so at least but if we sold hypothetically 353 tax write off shirts while we were sitting here just now that's that's only the ones that have gone through the merch message dashboard not the ones that have sold entirely and that's already up to 360 now that's a point that people would remember forever now our entire audience has been educ and Luke is there any reason that we do this other than so people can learn education so we're consider this the investment in
public education that your government won't make can you get a and we're going to write it off can you get a charity receipt for your tax write off no I can't how many shirts now what do we have I'm curious I'm pulling up the real dashboard I'm pulling up the dashboard  tax write off shirts oh okay that number is much lower we're up to about 600 so far yeah cuz again these are only the ones that people actually attach a merch message to yeah people are working on the color
blog hoodies too we got a we yeah we got a couple hundred of those I'm seeing the Arches championing the pack right now uh The Arches The Arches we make money on hey hey if you're buying a tax right off item now's a great we appreciate it now is a great time to to check out some of the Arches which by the way are not as profitable as some people seem to think they are oh hey we should probably I'm just going to message this I saw some I saw some very interesting speculation about um our arches and our cable
management arches and the pricing on them and how they're they're probably only you know 15 cents of plastic and and magnets or whatever else and uh I did kind of want to talk about that a little bit on the show um something a lot of folks might not realize is that one of our whole things is that we kind of overbuild stuff yeah um that'd be a little difficult to not realize but I could see it true yeah well I mean it's one of those things where some people just you know willfully don't pay attention and
there's nothing I can really do about that uh those kinds of people are a write-off but for everyone else for everyone who's willing to pay attention and willing to listen let's talk a little bit about why our magnetic Cable Management arches are so expensive and why no you are not in fact going to find a cheap alternative on some other Marketplace that is exactly the same for a much lower price so um are you strong can you rip one of those magnets that are there for me um this is an early
prototype of our of our extra-large cable Arch how do I get my finger in there I don't know what Luke's experiencing right now is the engineering work that was put into these arches to ensure that the magnets don't come out it sure doesn't want to I it was actually a very difficult problem to solve this this is a prototype one as well yeah and not only did we solve that problem ensuring that the magnets will not accidentally come out of these which is really important for safety I genuinely think
my yeah I'm bending it pretty hard would come off before this I have a pry tool um not only did we solve that problem making these safer and more and and more durable but uh we actually did it in a way that enhances is your pry tool just your keys don't worry about it I have a pride tool I was expecting like oh wow they like made something for this it's just but we did it in a way that actually enhances their magnetic pull strength oh cool so uh Jacob who was was one of our engineers at Creator
warehouse and who did a lot of the groundw work on the magnetic cable arches um um did a freaking like entire course load worth of work on magnetism and how to optimize not just the strength of the magnets but also the properties of their magnetic field so they're especially strong especially close and they're Amplified in that way but as they come off that was less of a concern for him etc etc so the U the slug that the slug that holds the magnet in place is actually um hold on a second
let me check a real one real quick that might have been something that yeah cuz these are these are like 3D printed actually quite early at this point uh samples as far as my understanding goes but we have a bin of real ones here good good good yes so the slug looks sharp the slug is made of a material that actually enhances the magnetism of the magnet and heads exactly the way that we want them TOS okay so not a right off this right here I'm just going to zoom in on Linus
real quick here this right here is the magnet from the extra-large Cable Management Arch um I had some people talking about how serious business magnet how these are these are these are crappy and they're not even going to last cuz magnets don't even last forever it's like these are neodymium magnets by the way they will last for as long as you will um we've got in each of our manag Ares life is fleeting yeah the he death of the universe is coming have to get so one sec entropy is
inevitable got to absolutely mangle these things Okay so we've got two of those I'm just going to zero this scale real Qui oh hold on I'm just going to zero this scale real quick here hum be squishy I like that one too that one's good okay there we go so I've zeroed my scale I'm putting my magnets on it um so for the folks who think that you're just going to find this this Arch and yeah it's expensive I've I've never denied that our products are costly but they're costly to us which is
why they're costly to other people not because we're just you know gougers and evil people there's profit margins we're a company we have to pay people but we'll get to that in a second first uh can you tell me um what that reads 28 28 gr so if you look up the cost of neodymium it's about uh here hold on neodymium price here we can we can do this together that I like that price per kilogram here we go I like doing things about $95 per Kil which means it's about $9.50 per 100 G which means you are
looking at about $3 worth of magnet just raw magnet just raw neodymium material that would that so how in what way do you buy like bulk neodymium so not only is that about $3 of raw actual material yeah but we customized the exact shape of our magnets in order to optimize them for our cable management arches so that's the diameter that's the size of the donut hole and that's the thickness so would you buy would you buy that shaped from a company or did we have to okay so from a from a magnet so there's
probably a premium on top of the bulk price there would be premium on top of the raw material price for anything that involves any kind of processing yeah okay so then there's Logistics um something people may not realize about magnets is that they're heavy yeah you have to ship them so you have to ship them once to where they get to be integrated with your uh with your plastic arches then they get to be shipped again to our warehouse where they need to be handled and they need to be stored
um there's also the engineering time there's the re there's all the work that went into making sure that our cable management holders are going to freaking hold things that's that has to be paid for someone told me at some point that that's important yeah yeah that that that that that matters um and yeah the company has to make money we have to account for breakage we have to account for um you know the potential for people to want us to process returns you know we have to pay customer service people
um basically in a nutshell if you find something that claims to be our magnetic Cable Management arches but at a small fraction of the price then what you know because you are the kind of person who is not a write off and who can observe things yeah and and is and is open to new ideas uh you will know that it is not in fact the same thing it is actually a different thing and you know what that different thing might be fine for you we knew that we were making an extremely premium product that was not
going to make sense for everybody we knew that but we also knew that what we wanted was the cable management solution that I wanted to use and unfortunately it involves a crap ton of magnetic material so yeah I'm sorry they're expensive also fortunately cuz it's really cool to use it's a sweet system yeah I'm happy they did the gift thing the big one is freaking ridiculous yeah hey Luke do you want to I mean it really actually would be helpful because there is margin in them we we do make money on
we got oh okay there we go but it would be really helpful oh it's a mess oh it's so clean oh my good oh it's a mess oh no oh it's so clean I guess now is a good time to kind of run through the product line so uh the the big one the one that came to me in a dream in the middle of the night was the power bar one and man the amount of work that went into getting the geometry and the manufacturing just right for the little like Keyhole one we had to buy dozens of Power Bars Power Bars uh routers Network
switches anything with that Keyhole shaped mounting thing uh here I'm just going to hop over to the store on uh my computer for a second here home magnetic Cable Management here we go Linus laptop uh anchor power bar keys yeah basically anything with that little um with that little uh key shaped hole on the back of it cool I like the gifts the gifts are good the if I had done this one I might have done it vertically um and it would involve plugging in and unplugging something into the outlet take it off
plug it in and put it back because this was a major oh that's pretty sick this was a major product design consideration for me oh dude if it's blindly under your desk and I could just reach and grab it and plug something in and just put it back not only that but the magnet is so strong that you don't have to pull it off you can unplug something from it unless you have the world's tightest Outlet holes which you probably don't you can unplug something from it without pulling the Whole Thing Off the Wall so
that was a major major design consideration for me and is one of the reasons that this one has so much bloody metal in it oh my was because we wanted the hold strength to be great enough that makes sense I my use case was like I could pull it off and then look at it and like decide where I want to plug it in but I see what you're talking about this one is my personal favorite one and it's selling really well because it solves a problem that unlike some of the other ones there is not a current
solution for um no I'm not talking like there isn't a better solution there just isn't a current solution for it and it's really elegant the way that it installs stays on there it stays on really good and then just sticks onto stuff I absolutely love this product um but then you know the the dream didn't end there the next big one was this one the power brick holders yeah same thing we wanted to be able to accommodate even gigantic chunky like laptop or dock power bricks that can do you 250 Watts
or whatever else and then we didn't want to make it huge because we wanted to be able to accommodate much smaller ones but this one is designed to be finally a way to keep your stupid power bricks organized in a way that is not horrible um I don't want to see another power brick on the floor in our office basically anymore so we show it can you show us how this works because someone was in one of the product photos yeah it shows that uh where the strap goes looks like it's a very
small a small little hole oh here we go oh yeah sure I'd be happy to show how Okay do I have any uh ZIP cable ties IIT I do I have I have I have I have I have okay yeah here so I can show you guys how this works um man so are these cable ties specific to this thing nope yeah they're longer oh these go with a different thing don't worry about it got it okay so basically we've got H do I have any oh yeah there you go you can kind of see it so there's kind of like a keyhole shaped thing so it it has
overhangs know I see how it works now in mold design are a little tricky but hey we got good Engineers um so what you do is you take the cable tie hole and yeah that's pretty cool it's a little bit of a pain the first time in particular but you make sure it gets under that spot there you kind of want it to be cuz then it's going to be you know it's going to be snug and then it's on there yeah right so then you put your thing you know whatever it is note 9 you  and you get it on there then you do the
other one and it's ready to go sweet okay that makes sense yep cuz some people were looking at the the little hole and thinking like is this for zap straps not cable ties but no it's just it's on the other side that makes sense y I promise you whatever you see about them way more thought was put into it then should no well that's why I wanted you to to show me cuz I was like I'm sure there's there's something going on I just I know um so yeah lus laptop so this one I absolutely love and then the
cable tie holders actually I think these are the top seller so far no no they're not no they're not these are moving really well as well though um but what's cool about these ones is we realized okay yeah arches are cool but you don't always have a ton of room so these run parallel to the cables oh so they hide really nice um they're think about that they're less convenient no right because you're still essentially using cable ties right but you're using cable ties that can be anchored and can be really
really um stealthily run and you can kind of put a cable tie anywhere now well yeah and like one of the issues with cable ties is you'll have like sag in the route or whatever or it has to go around something that often can't happen yada y y so you can keep it nice and so the geometry here is cool because we've got a really nice high-profile run under here looks like a SciFi Bridge so if you have a very small Cable Bundle or a longer cable tie you just wrap more times and there will still be enough
clearance for the uh for the magnets to grab yeah so this one's great and then of course I think the Arches are the are the top C the bread and butter the bread and butter the meat and potatoes man the big one is cray cray if you want to see these things in action really well um the there's a there's a clip from the building the the the land gaming machines at my house where I cable manage the back of my server rack my whole setup at home has been waiting for this and I've got freaking like bundles
of wires that like like taking the big one and like getting it down on the one side and like stuffing them in there like and then it's just there's some grabs dude it I'm not going to call out the brand too much but there's some funky cables in the server room over at the lab and these Mondo arches kind of saved the cable management of those cables cuz they were they're very big and uh kind of unwieldly and there's nothing we could really do with them and then we were just like what if we just magged
them all to the wall and it was like yeah okay that worked you could like we couldn't really tie them down very well like there was a lot of issues and then we're just like yep we can force it that'll be fine so basically yeah really exciting launch it's going really well the power bar is key quarter 20th thread for hack ability what oh yeah that's right so okay yes yes yes how hold on hold on hold on you mad man what are you talking about I can't believe you did that that's sick do I have one of these do
you understand yeah yeah like 10 out of 10 good choice I love you uh here it is oh here it is here it is okay I got to see be oh what okay so these are the power bar keys oh okay yeah yeah yeah this makes a lot more sense not only is the I thought power brick not power bar I was very exed hold on hold on hold on hold not only is the geometry uh perfect for running your um uh sorry for going into one of your you know power bars or network switches or whatever else and it really was a very
very significant engineering challenge to get that I'm sorry I don't have enough Zoom guys one of these days we're just going to go full QVC and we're going to have like you know hand hand cam don't worry Dan no don't Dan Dan don't don't worry don't for real um but as a meme one day you should hire like a hand model for wo but what's cool I'm sitting right here is that it's quarter 20 threaded down the middle of the of the magnetic strength enhancing insert so if you wanted to
hack something else some other shaft into this thing and mount fliping anything you wanted with a magnet then you could like camera gear well especially camera gear so it was the camera crew that was like hey uh could you guys make this yeah cuz they use it for everything yeah that's wild oh man it's going to be uh interesting would a hand model for the wo be a tax rate off that's a good question yes if if we PID them which we would have to because they'd be a person who needs to be paid
yeah so yes they'd be that would be a right that' be a tax right off good to know that's good to know so yeah it's it was man this has been such a long time coming um there's a couple of notes here that I'm supposed to read from the team uh available in four Arch sizes yeah we talked through all the different solutions each pack of arches or accessories comes with matching standard steel plates and screws okay had a lot of people questioning why it cost so much to upgrade to VHB when VHB is cheap
that's so great that VHB is cheap go buy some and put it on the standard steel plates it'll work great so that's why because we didn't want to charge everyone for VHB which was a significant Adder compared to using the more temporary adhesive and wasn't necessarily useful for everybody not everyone wants to put something onto their onto their wall or onto their desk with what is essentially a permanent adhesive about as permanent as a double-sided tape gets it's either permanent or it's very likely to cause
damage so we wanted the standard load out to have a much lighter adhesive nothing prevents you from putting your own adhesive on those standard plates and sticking them with whatever you want to whatever you want and the only cost to you is a roll of VHB now what we also knew is not everybody's going to want to do that some people are just going to be like eh can't be arsed and they would rather buy VHB plates from us that's where the VHB plates came from and you know what the handling costs of like
sleeves of of of taped things yeah it adds to it adds to the price of it there's a lot of overhead in uh in the actual production of the stupid things and the packaging and the shipping and the handling so yeah it's not as cheap but hey you can buy a roll of VHB tape and it comes with the steel plates that you need so you're good to go as for the silicone grips um people were questioning what they're for yeah this is cool though okay so for maximum magnetic holding strength along this
axis okay you want the magnet directly on the metal surface anything in between you're going to compromise some of that holding strength remember I did say that the magnetic fields are optimized right right right next to the magnets and that's true of pretty much any magnet because it's like a whatever inverse square or whatever but the point is that magnetic field strength Falls away like exponentially essentially so any magnet the closer you are the better so we made
the design decision very early on to not recess the magnets into the plastic whoops there uh not recess the magnets under the plastic because that would have reduce the risk of scratching but it would have hurt the hold strength which for me was the top priority as concerned about the metal thing that you're sticking these arches onto um getting scratched by you know potentially having it shift slightly then what you want is the silicone stickers which you can put onto your
server Rack or put onto your desk that will sit in between the magnet and your and your nice you know not wanting to be scratched surface and yeah you lose a little bit of hold strength however what you gain and this is not the right one for this don't worry we have them in all the rate sizes uh what you will gain is much better strength on the Y AIS that makes sense yeah so it won't shift around as much and it won't scratch yeah um but you lose a little bit of strength and they're very strong so that's
probably okay yeah it's totally fine yeah um so we have we have some bundles if you're not sure where to start the essential the home and server bundles and you can get them all at LTD store.com MCM I want to eventually have uh um Conrad and potentially others involved make a cable management configurator you know how we have the deskpad configurator there are a lot of pitfalls I know there's a lot of variations also we're now working in 3D space and you have to deal with
different cables and different sizes of cabl oh my God you want people to be able to put them on their desk I thought you just meant like a a configurator so you can like order all the things no I want people to be able to design their desk I think it would be sweet let's not put R&amp;D into that yet we haven't because of exactly the reasons that you're thinking um but it would be cool if you're curious about if you want to learn a little bit more about some of the work that went into making these a
reality we're going to have a newsletter out so sign up for the newsletter on LTT store.com good one um and we'll have that out to you guys hopefully in the next you know week or two but hey you know things take as long as they take until they're good uh so here's where to sign up for the newsletter you can also see an archive of past news newsletters here if you want to learn a little bit more about the Precision screwdriver that backpack that was uh that survived a mine um lasers
Etc all right people are saying that the configurator could be a tax rateof oh my God which is interesting maybe a path to consider Luke I think I've got enough tax write off for today um let's see let's see how much I think you've got more than enough sir I think you have significantly more than enough ridiculous let's see how our tax Roff shirt is doing I knew you guys would love this tax Rite off shirt good Lord almost a thousand yeah I mean it's a $10 t-shirt it's a really nice t-shirt
yeah it's the same quality as all the other t-shirts yep and in a great color taxs right off Perry Winkle and tax right off pink oh man oh man all right uh what are we supposed to do oh we're supposed to oh what Perry Winkle is sold out already yeah every size holy crap um huh well this is maybe oh is pink sold out as well no pink is sold out in most sizes this is really going to hurt our ability to write off um extra extra large and triple extra large hold on a second wait yeah there's only large and extra
large left in pink that's it okay this might be a problem yeah maybe it was price too  uh Mr Nick light you you're live on the WAN show hi um we have a significant problem with the tax write off shirt yeah we're not able to write off any more taxes because we've run out of  do uh that seems like a a question that answers itself right off budget is full okay you should you should pull a ninja move and change it to $99 um I'm just I'm I'm worried Nick I'm worried Nick that we won't be able to
write off enough for our taxes this year okay well let me uh I guess let me look into that okay see if anything can be done that I guess all right can you can you let me know in the next little bit here if there's anything else we can write off I'll I'll do my best okay don't worry they're buying lots of cable management I I sure hope they are okay all right okay we're going to work on it goodbye okay all right thanks Nick okay all right he's working on it we got to optimize our writeoffs here uh in the
meantime do you want to explain to the people how merch messages work I'm dying that's that's a you thing you do that all right I'll explain how merch messages work the way to interact with the show is not with twitch bits not with super chats it's with merch messages a tool that was built by our very own float plane te team and is freaking awesome sorry let's go let's go basically all you got to do is head to LTT store.com pick up something put it in your cart and in your cart you will
see a box for Merch messages that message will go to producer Dan how are you doing by the way uh who will um do his best to forward your message to the appropriate Department reply to you uh throw your message up onto the screen for everybody to see you know if you have a shout out to your mom or to your friend's mom if you know what I'm saying it'll it'll go up there you're not even paying attention are you I'm actually trying to help Dan that's that's cool um it's fine it's fine or it will get
curated for me and Luke uh and we will uh we will address your question here on the show sometimes for like ever yeah for a very long time today it's not going to go forever we got to play Super checks for the yeah there's got to be a super super checks after party so it's going to be it's going to be great if you're on float plane we've got the archive from it last one was fun people seem to like it oh people seem to be super into it um yeah I think people were surprised at
how fun it was actually yeah super check is the comments were like wow this is actually pretty fun to watch it's like yeah yeah we we uploaded that as an extra exclusive last week yeah oh speaking of flow plane exclusives yeah uh okay so hold on here's the here's the live stream VOD from super checks yeah the uh the reviews are in yeah zero dislikes let's go super checks Afterparty very popular um anyway here's here's some gameplay look at that save dude look at that less of a save well R
that's a goal for lonus anyway the point is always read color balance is wrong I need to fix that super checks lots of fun uh this is great uh the float plane team asked me to do a little sneak peek of this so this is this is from the team liked it this is from the oh that's hilarious the upcoming collab with the one the only Ludwig so we built the PC that punishes the user um it's got a variety of uh of servos and relays on it uh it's got an integration with Minecraft courtesy of
signal RGB and basically every time he goes in the water and we put him on this wipe out course every time he goes in the water his Beday go off and spray him uh if he dies there's a variety of effects that will hit him with everything including these little uh gel ball blast this little gel ball Blaster here to a fart Cannon which like left well oh yeah it really hurt um the point is it's going to be an absolutely awesome movie movie it's going to be an absolutely awesome video and yeah thanks
it's going to be an awesome video and we're going to have some exclusives on float plane including the sneak peek and maybe we'll maybe we'll do an uncut this time uh and this is why we need to fight we need to fight yeah I warned him in the in the uh in the what do you call it pre-show I warned him in the pre-stream pre-show that we have on Flo plan and also technically twitch uh that we were going to fight this stream I prepped it but I didn't tell him why this is the
topic are you salty that I didn't tell you lewig was coming and you didn't get to hang out so yes but also I'm very sorry it actually did not occur to me I was very flustered that day there's multiple other things oh okay apparently we're fighting about a lot of things so that's that's one of them hang out with lewick would have been cool but you even mentioned with the the the like the entire Badminton Center screen thing you're like oh I should have brought you over what do you think would have been
the most entertaining thing for me to be engaged with probably in the last multiple years that we've done probably the punishment PC yeah I okay okay f um that looked insanely fun it still like works right I don't know oh man we should do like an extras thing of just like random people in the company trying to do it I would love to do that you want to try the so much fun I I like had work to do but I like just sitting there watching it happen was like fantastic okay I'll tell you
what I'll tell you what it looked so good I promise you it's been broken down hold on hold on I promise you TI ends down I promise you if and this is actually some very bad news oh boy we got some news from the city of su that we may not be allowed to do land events at the Badminton Center we're going to work with them I'm I I am confident my team is Sag cuz that was this was a lot of I know I understand other people also put a lot of work in but I hold on I am confident that we can we can find a
solution together at this time I'm still confident okay cool um they they have expressed a variety of concerns that I think we can address if if as long as everyone is is moving forward together in good faith yeah that I think we can address cool okay as long as it goes forward as long as it goes forward I promise you at one of those whand events at least we will Resurrect The Punishment PC that's amazing okay because the code is done and that was the hard part yeah was the esp32 based
server and the integration with signal RGB and you want to be involved you need to bring a change of clothes in a towel you you should bring two changes of clothes in two towels yeah uh we we had to redress him multiple times that's amazing the last the last the last part this is a the triple part thing um I think you cheated on me I cheated on you yeah sorry what yeah yeah I would never play Super checks with anyone else no the shot callers the shot callers it didn't technically happen but
you had intention and I don't think electroboom counts because my reasoning for this if you are in a European country that does cheat kisses you do cheat kisses that is not cheating even though it's kisses if you're hanging out with elra booom you're going to get shocked this is fine okay okay this is fine but there was a plan for shot colors and I was not involved I see okay so so  BDSM is that what you're saying that was really close I think it went back into the bortle uh yes I guess I
guess I guess so I see okay I'll keep it in mind I didn't really fully put that together until now but yeah yeah yeah anyways I'll keep it in mind I'm just messing around but that I watched I didn't watch the whole thing lus do you say to Luke  I'm sorry I'm not I'm I'm not but I'm sorry oh my goodness all righty then usually the show doesn't get this unhinged until much later I watched part of the exclusive footage it's awesome that's going to be a fantastic lwigs an A+ Talent s tier world class Talent um
he is he has the same level of get it done at any cost I could I was only there for like a couple minutes and I could tell which is just that's cool the guy's Next Level to say that he was a good sport about everything that happened to him while he was here would be a gross understatement um let me put it this way at one point he had to sit on a toilet that had a GoPro in the bowl barely even phased him that sounds about right yeah my um yeah I don't even know if I want to 
not my favorite YouTube video of of potentially all time is I've sent it to you even I don't even send last that many videos you know what I'm talking about yes I know one you're talking about it's one of lwigs no technically not it's one of slimes yes top salty ice clg's in it a lot yeah yeah it's good it's it's like actual top to your content yeah um anyways all right cool so anyway yeah that's going to be a fantastic video um yeah absolute absolute mad lad check full plan
exclusive check out the full video when it releases had a ton of fun with them uh Dan do you want to show us how merch messages work or do you want Luke to just pick a couple n it's fine it's fine we can pick a couple the dashboard is broken look at this I can't even scroll in the dashboard it just stops after a bit mine is working perfectly uh you're you're limited to 125 merch messages uh no no I I can see I they'll load in it just it just breaks the you can you can limit it more if you
want you want more speed kind of got a bit more resources than you guys do you want more load bearing or do you want more speed I got this I I want Nick to call me back and tell me how we're going to write off more taxes I think I like Luke's Ider just starts selling them for $100 um so so you know you lose money on almost all of them and then a few random people are going to buy a pink shirt for $100 yeah you know how marketing works okay uh this is a good merch message
question thing uh on this topic do you see a future where lmg runs entirely on sales through LTT store.com making external ads a thing of the past what  company that's a really big brain question question I think that would be oversaturation well it depends what LTT store.com is true fair yeah what if LTT store.com didn't only sell LTT merch we already don't technically we already don't so we could we already sell Jerry rig everything knives we already sell we already sell Swip bed which might have been the
reason that lwig was up here collabing also just cuz he's a bro but like that might make sense why he was sitting on a toilet and why his bedet were spraying him he was up here he was up here uh talking about his bedet and helping us out helping us promote the product good product we might carry uh PTM 7950 was going to say I don't know if that 100% counts but I think it does oh that counts an extra lot yeah it's just it has LT branding on it but yeah but we're very clear we're very UPF front this is
a something we made this is a Honeywell product developed by Honeywell it's a it's a very excellent phase change thermal interface material extremely good longevity extremely good um extremely low thermal resistance um really great product so like there's the very Beginnings there's the very beginnings of a trajectory and I think what our big brained viewer has figured out and if our big brain viewer was Galaxy brain enough they might also figure out that one of the things that
we've done for example with ptmc 7950 was used our internal testing resources to make sure that that thing  good if they were quality validated colossal Galaxy Mondo brain they might have identified that there is a serious in ification that's going on in online retail right now and not just in your swipe P day equipped toilets mhm um making it really hard to find trustworthy sources for just like stuff you want to buy um so what if there was a media organization that aspired to having a trusted
store I don't know it'd be weird it'd be weird that would be very yeah that' be odd beird not useful at all I prefer Googling what the best product is and getting 17 different lisal websites and then going oh I'll just look up Reddit and then having the Reddit post be hijacked by an SEO team that's what I  experience but I'm not that big brain realistically LTT store is one big tax right off what if what if LTT store becomes trustme bro.com H it probably exists already and if it didn't already
exist it's going to get bought before you can get a chance to acquire it so it's done it's out I'm wondering if it already redirects no it doesn't it redirects somewhere else oh well it's gone now domains for sale all right 25 Grand by the way USD yeah I don't think that's happening so never  um okay um okay Perfection uh Nick's working on something we don't need more stuff um Sarah's Sarah's busy but uh here hold on oh no here can you just uh who can you go to my cam for a second here or no go
to your cam go to your cam for a second   what so we're generating more  the you're  no no Sarah's Sarah's busy so Nick is making a gray product photo oh okay that's great Nick I saw the gray I saw the gray shirt mockup that's fantastic you've done a terrific job we don't mean need more though oh did you show the people yeah I showed the people I just showed the people right now so we're going to have some gray uh tax write off shirts yeah yeah yeah just uh let them know that you ran out of
graphic design budget like four hours ago for this project so that's my handiwork okay good job excellent work I did like it a lot I will say all right cool and if you uh if you find any more inventory of anything else we've got to write we've got to write them off Nick yeah I'm waiting uh I'm waiting to hear back on that I I I I just need to confirm I don't want you know a bunch of people to expect they're getting a write off t-shirt and then to get a you know a write off email saying that we don't
have that t-shirt so sure I mean do you want to just put mystery color in there and then uh it is a $10 shirt sure all right cool yeah that's great all right talk to you  bye they're writing it off Jerry why are we why are we resupplying it Luke Luke resupply some tall sizes we are making a point we're still working on the tall size chill but now they're not going to be able to afford to continue development on them no no no we'll write it off we'll write off the development oh I'm starting to get this
now I'm starting to get it oh the the the XL in pink is sold out so there's only larges in pink left yeah don't forget about the gray special order don't forget about gray oh gray is on the site now it just says gray it's not a color block it just says no no go scroll down look look look oh oh that's amazing this is a gray t-shirt is oh that in just text is so cool oh my God actually love this genius this is great oh oh man don't even try to message support asking to change your color
shirt or or add it to your existing order if you want to get this thing you place a new order I'm so sorry you better print them like that and I want one no no no no no no they will not that is a gray shirt it will not be printed like that you can do it yourself though yeah you could use a marker and you could do that with the pink ones already sold out no no no no no no no it will be a gray shirt no Dan you get you get the pink en llarge and then modify it you could you could do this yourself for all
right all right I'm just I'm just going to download the vector from the server and Sebastian Sebastian said this is great it nice it all right uh want to hit us with another merch message sure I love that that photo is on the store that's amazing good job Nick yeah hey guys I appreciate your quality scripts I'm curious if you did well in your school writing classes or if that skill came later also when and why did you decide to hire your first staff writer huh first staff writer I mean
real realistically Luke was kind of supposed to be like a writer SL episode prepper from not not at NC but oh yeah from day Zero of lonus Media Group yeah and then the next one after that was John Martin yes and that wasn't until right before we moved out of the Langley house yep we tried to hire like a helper benchmarker for Luke before that yeah that didn't work out it did not work out um whether it was because we didn't know exactly what position we needed or whether we really have the have the
hiring practices nailed down yet that might have been a problem that could have been an issue um that was I think that was I think the first person Luke ever fired yes um I wasn't even in town I think I was first person to get fired from the company and it was the first person that I fired yeah l this was like on vacation or something and I had to call him and be like yeah so by the way this is happening which is an interesting one for sure um please tell the story I I think we're good no no I mean we we're
not looking to identify or shame anyone it just it involved falling asleep at work multiple times yeah I'll say that much and that should be all you really need to know yeah yeah and well also paired with other thing that actually wasn't the only problem no but it was  anyways uh oh oh crap um oh my goodness okay I will deal with this later it's fine it's fine just my wife um okay so do you want to hit us with another merch message with Intel's upcoming move to Arrow Lake what do you
think the impact of removing hyperth threading will be for performance honestly with how many cores we have in desktop processors now not convinced that there's going to be a significant impact um like Intel I I think don't quote me on this because everything's everything's still rumors at this point but I think the plan is to keep core counts pretty constant if they make the kind of expected improvements um to their efficiency course uh like if those get significantly faster honestly I
would rather use the power budget not to mention the the die budget the area budget um I'd rather they use it to juice up the efficiency cores and give me more multi-threaded performance that way compared to giving me a secondary thread on my performance cores that realistically is not contributing to overall system responsiveness and system performance the way that it used to when intel was going up against AMD or and AMD had single core processors with no smt um simultaneous multi-threading
hyper threading um the difference like as an AMD Fanboy who like kind of willfully was like La La La at the time okay I I I hadn't figured out how stupid fanboyism was yet I was legitimately kind of upset when I got my first Intel that era system um and it was like just a screw around with system it was like an older P4 Northwood that I was like oh I'm going to overclock this KN out of this thing it'll be funny I'll hits like a super high frequency but I was rocking aflon 64 at the time aflon 64 was so
sick and I got this thing running I went holy hyperthreading is night and day yeah in Windows XP when we only had one core the difference in responsiveness it was noticeable and I was like oh man and that was one of the things that made me so certain that dual core was something that I needed in my life cuz if that what just a little bit of extra efficiency on my one core is going to do for me man two cores let's go but we're at a point now where it's not like that anymore every processor for sale today
pretty much has more than one processing core and so you're not getting that that night and day difference you're getting a marginal difference in certain workloads and it's coming at a cost of complexity and power um I'm honestly a little surprised that AMD chased them to smt and as far as I know AMD doesn't have any plans to get rid of it but not every implementation is built equal and AMD is certainly not as uh constrained in their power budgets these days as Intel is so the only answer that I can
give that I'm certain about is that we will see and that I'm excited to see how it turns out Nick just live editing the store is like one of my favorite things now oh my God it's just mystery and then a bunch of question marks and then the the  it oh man this so good the hilarious thing is like t-shirts are not even something that are problematic like we don't as you can tell we only had like a few hundred of these shirts so like whatever there was really no point especially
once you started adding gray there's just no way Luke it's a write off though Luke it's a write off oh if Nick can think of if Nick watching it was so funny until there was actually Financial consequences and then it was so not funny for me anymore if Nick's watching right now if there's anything else you want to write off that's not a t-shirt just let me know just let me know let me know maybe maybe maybe just one day one day oh my God these hoodies though short circuit color blocks sold out TechLink
color blocks sold out LTT color blocks sold out yeah I wonder why well I just I don't know thought we had I thought we had more of these the tech quick still $ hoodie well yeah it's a great hoodie it's a quality hoodie Luke we gave one to lwig and he was like this a nice hoodie yeah yeah that makes sense yeah it's quality hoodie a nice hoodie yeah if you can by all Nick if if you can find any more hoodies uh make sure that they're sufficiently written off let's get them
written off because the the vaud people they're not going to get anything they're going to get no write off watch live okay uh let's do another topic what do you want to talk about you live in like Europe or something just wake up at like 4 in the morning yeah exactly and watch the way show your sleep schedule oh we need to get sponsors done wake up for like a 4-Hour Block in the middle of your night and then go back to sleep how about this mhm let's make some money the show is brought to you today by Ridge

end of the show I know Christa on level one text does it as well did one of you  both I have a feeling this is one of those situations you know when like certain Technologies get simultaneously invented algebra yeah or calculus I feel this is like one of those I think we're just both awesome yeah I mean it's one of those things where almost almost nothing you see on the internet is original yeah like I I had a I had a bunch of people it's literally the word like I had a bunch of people speculating
that I wore that um that brown coat yeah because of because of Technology connection and it's like you know what I love technology connections great Channel he's super cool from what I can tell uh we've only corresponded by email like once and I don't know I don't I don't know a ton about him but I know his content's great but no I've had that jacket for almost 10 years the first time I wore it um I can't I can't I couldn't find it I went looking for it that's why I sent you that weird um that
weird picture of you as funkman we used to do these commercials for the gaming brand Funk and um at some point was it for a funk video that I wore the suit yeah I think it was one of the mous ones I that's what I thought too but I couldn't find it I didn't I didn't realize he oh he does have that jacket okay yeah it it seems to be basically exactly the same jacket um but the first time I wore it was like it was somewhere between 9 and 10 years ago I got it at Value Village for like $8 because I
needed sort of a a Salesman looking jacket but I'm kind of down on my luck um and it was sort of based on The Simpsons character Gil and it's like it it it doesn't it doesn't matter I'm not in a it's it's not like a a competition for who thought of it first because neither of us thought of it first yeah the idea of wearing a costume of wearing a jacket that sort of says Professor who doesn't spend any money on clothing is not one that either of us invented it's just it's just a thing that we have both
done on occasion um love his channel and any resemblance I guess is a happy accident but yeah no it's definitely definitely an accident I'm trying to find it right now I uh I've so far been unsuccessful but yeah I'm trying to find it yeah I I wasn't able to find it okay yeah I wasn't sure how how extensively you looked I I looked okay I'm not even  then here we go this is the video that I sent Luke though um I think this is the one oh my God St so this is a behind the scenes of the
production um blah blah blah this is not the one you sent me this a different one okay I thought the KB 460 was the one that had uh the one you sent me we were  place I didn't remember this I just remembered my like pretending that my hand was burning on the mous I didn't remember being in a no that was this is for a keyboard Luke oh right yeah so I I couldn't remember a ton of this stuff dude what when was  anyway um so I came across a bunch of the old Funk stuff when I was looking
for this uh oh hey here's oh hey yeah here's the actual um ad someone uh reuploaded  at it had kind oh wait oh here it is hey yeah so this was shot nine years ago yeah and that's the first appearance of of the jacket am I picking my nose and  yeah I uh I don't remember any of the context for for that oh I was pitching a campaign yeah I think it's like different varieties of like features that the product could have or something and anyway um yeah sweet we've done some weird
stuff over the years now sure have done some really weird over the years when you sent me me dressed as Funk man all of that came back real quick yeah why we went in the pool didn't we I don't remember why but you did like a you did like a coming out of the pool and then like the glue that we used to glue all the fake chest hair onto you like started coming off a whole oh I think we got one shot at that shot oh this is so cool okay this is a teaser For an upcoming video um Jake is working
on an AI tool for processing our entire back catalog of footage into its searchable database so you can be like Luke holding a keyboard and it'll bring up every clip of Luke holding a keyboard this is crazy cool there are tools for this out there already I know no no we we like that we have like messing with one he's not making one no okay okay no no no no no yeah no we we have a video coming it's oh so cool and combined with the ultra fast storage video do you feel like incredibly Vindicated now for
keeping everything no no even now we're not going to use it like most of the time yeah but if we're ever looking for Alex in a workshop wow yeah but it narrows it down a lot compared to mvi 0078 yeah it's it's a totally totally different ball game very excited no we're not going to upload every video clip to Google photos that's not how that works oh my goodness I'd have to buy pedabytes of storage on Google photos um  um okay okay he's adding more he found some more pink and perrywinkle and he's
adding some more are crazy we're  off don't even think about asking to have an order edited because everything will be gone before you even get a chance just if you want an order for any  um oh man it's the right off sale dude why it's the right off sale um okay another merch message a new topic I'm kind of thinking about making this an annual event it's around tax time around tax time the pre-tax time write off event why wouldn't you do post tax time because then people get their
their tax returns because I I'm concerned about my tax returns I got to write it off us Luke yeah it's not about them yeah I've got stuff to write off okay um what's the what's the next topic how do I get out of here how do I get us to write off less things the door's over there yeah Dan said we need merch messages so just could do whatever I need a break technically the card says  messages all right now it says two to three dos says move on Luke get over it okay uh Airbnb bans snooping Airbnb will
be banning indoor security cameras and other recording devices from rental listings beginning April 30th they will also now require host to disclose the presid of deciel monitors yeah so many hosts have policies for their airbnbs that you can't have a party or you can't have too many people over so you can set up a decibel monitor to notify you if the noise level goes above a certain amount or if they're going real hard yeah like there could be a variety of things that could or or if they have a
pet so a barking dog would trigger it as well so there's a variety of reasons that hosts might include decel meters in their Suites anyway carry on okay yeah yeah yeah um airbnb's previous policy was to merely limit the use of cameras to common areas and require that they are not uh require that they are not hidden uh but it didn't require that the host disclosed their location or whether or not they were inside or outside there was likewise an ambiguity over spaces that weren't bedrooms but nonetheless
certain uh nonetheless sorry contain a couch or futon sufficient for sleeping this ambiguity has led to problems like cameras being placed inappropriately close to the entrance of bathrooms uh Airbnb likewise has a spotty track record of responding to complaints about surveillance as exemplified by a 2019 report of a family finding a hidden camera disguised as a smoke detector where the host was initially exonerated then later banned and the family refunded I'm pretty sure that was after
they like blew it up on Twitter or something yeah um it just I don't believe this happened naturally discussion question is a man not entitled to the sweat of his brow and the footage from surveillance cameras inside of his rental property no it's obviously BS honestly well I mean for me I just don't feel like this um is going to do anything no If people really wanted like the the like dirty cameras they were trying to hide them anyways um and so I just don't really I don't really
understand the point of of this policy change I mean yeah I guess having a policy yeah they can ban people more easily but I think it's I think it's more about plausible deniability for Airbnb and covering their own legal liability than it is about actually protecting the users because the hidden cameras are the users like what I want to know see is what is what what is what is the enforcement of this look like because hidden cameras are already banned but as far as I can tell it's the hidden
cameras the actual problem you you sold me on this I was like no this this makes sense this will help somewhat and yeah no not at all because people that were doing this nefariously were already hiding it um and that was already against the rules so this is like this is like Banning the appropriate it's not even appropriate Banning the not really that bad but still bad part of something but leaving the really bad part of it just fine cuz it was already banned and people were already it's one of those
things it's like it's a really bad analogy but I'm sure there's a good analogy out there the point the point is just that um you're you're not really you're not really keeping the the Naro Wells from continuing to do what they were doing yeah um going to break the law anyways honestly unless Airbnb is doing any actual auditing on their operators I don't see how they're going to affect any kind of meaningful change there's no way they're going to I the there's there's no
way they could have a system where they have like a small team of people that like randomly checks in on airbnbs but there's no way they could do all of them and here's a problem for me is that if I was an Airbnb operator which I'm not I feel like this could push me underground because there is no possible way that I would have a property particularly one that I'm not living at like if I had a like if I had let's say for example I had a vacation property that I didn't live at fulltime and I
Airbnb 11 months out of the year and I used occasionally I don't but let's say that I did what I'm not going to have functionally any surveillance cameras even in the very common areas so I'm not going to have any record if say for example uh a fire was started in the kitchen oh yeah this is like so can I play like kind of Devil's Advocate here a little bit and kind of go okay so then what is my recourse well now cuz there's absolutely no way that I'm not going to have at least a camera in a
kitchen if I if I was an operator which I'm not because partly because I'd be paranoid about this kind of thing this is this I I think your reasoning there is fair and good but I think the ultimate answer is that the Golden Days V BNB is like over and people should just go back to cheap hotels okay you skipped ahead in our conversation a little bit I I wanted to play devil's advocate for a little bit longer yeah but I think I think it's fair I mean yeah if you don't live there
if there's no other way to observe cuz like at a hotel yeah you don't have cameras inside the rooms but you have cameras in the hallways y the common areas and the and the common areas and you have Hotel staff that are working there so you have some amount of there's attendance a level of expectation that somebody is on hand to deal with a problem but if if nobody is on hand to deal with a problem Kevin S FL plane says isn't that what's insurance for yeah but do you know how much lower your
insurance premiums are if you have cameras if you and do you have any idea what how much easier that conversation is going to go with your insurance provider if you have photographic proof of what happened absolutely so no yeah the yes insurance is exactly why I would want to make sure that I have cameras in in particular zones do you need do you need a camera mounted to the bottom of your hot tub at a 45 degree angle toward the seat no obviously not is that a thing that's happened I don't know a pro I
mean you name it some perv has put a camera in it probably uh but the point that I'm trying to make is that there are legitimate places where if I was an Airbnb operator I'd be looking at this going okay well now I'm not allowed to do this so I'm just going to do it sneakier um and you know man I I think about the tech savviness of the average person and for every airbn B owner with a hidden camera who Gets Busted by a really Savvy uh renter there's got to be aund or a thousand that don't there was one
interesting idea uh someone said bring a travel router and unplug theirs yeah that's that's not a bad idea pretty decent idea to be honest that's like pretty solid actually yeah um I don't know where the message went so sorry I can't quote your name yeah this is another thing Nova Frost says the hidden cameras are mostly nefarious actors in them without the owner knowing about them I think that that's probably a lot of it but I also think that that's a lot of excuses it's a very good excuse
and I mean here's another thing like I would definitely want a camera pointed at my internet setup I've got a camera pointed at my rack right now you do technically of course I do yeah I have at least three cameras pointed at racks that belong to me right now because and ones that don't even if all you want to know is are the activ LEDs on that working like if your internet's up but something else is wrong like there's are the fans spinning on that server is that server on or not
like there's a there's a hundred reasons that you would want a camera pointed at J rack yeah um like say you're a twitch streamer for example sorry um anyway the point the point I'm trying to make is that um I would consider it to be unacceptable for me to not for me to not be able to monitor if if someone is messing with the networking in the Airbnb and potentially endangering future guests so I like okay well what's the what's the middle ground here I'll just not I'll just not Airbnb my house
yes thank you we know you got to the we know you got the answer Loop God hostels are fun and super cheap I've stayed at a hostel for 30 bucks and it was cool met some cool people often get really good suggestions of like places to go places to eat things to go see I understand that I understand that Nick has found some more things to write off oh no uh what are we what are we looking at here okay so the tax write off shirt um oh okay oh it's actually not clear that that's a that that's an option but
okay sure whatever mystery okay so a perrywinkle and pink oh man did he bring them back and are they already gone again probably well there's some gray my goodness uh there's still there's still some gray and uh mystery definitely exists and then what what else is going on here uh oh my God he's adding more things uh what okay things are things are getting a little bit crazy I'm not sure where do I find all the tax right I give up let's burn it down faster what is it oh here we go what's on sale okay
uh tax write off shirt oh okay okay so here's everything in the tax write off sale wow uh that's a thing you can do what like view all of the crazy discounts I guess so uh okay oh he says hold on he says hold on hold on in all caps there's an extra eye in there okay uh let's do another topic then shall we sure yeah hold on hold on to yourself uh what we do this is going to hurt sorry this a fairly quick topic EU AI regulations the European Parliament has voted to adopt the EU AI act this is crazy like the
unit count keeps going up like wild but the revenue doesn't go up and the profit goes down good good this is good we need it to offset any gain that the company might have from the magnets where like it would have gone to our heads yeah yeah okay TR to keep ourselves leveled um the yeah anyways European Parliament they voted to adopt the EU AI act which bans AI enabled social scoring exploitative Behavior engineering and emotion recognition systems at work or school and limits law enforcement's use of
Biometrics except in exhaustively listed and narrowly defined situations not sure what exhaustively listed means exhaustively listed means that the list is allinclusive so it it it includes every allowed scenario so that there's no ambiguity in the interpretation of when it's allowed ah I understand okay okay uh the ACT also includes stricter scrutiny and transparency requirements based on the potential risk of an AI system some have criticized the act as for going too far and placing European
AI firms at a disadvantage in terms of development and raising Capital it will be some time before the new law does take effect with its new Provisions rolling out in phases over the course of  years yeah personally I'm not super worried about the poor companies not being able to raise Capital so that they can make EXP ative behavioral Engineering Systems but um AI enabled social scoring oh my God all of these things are like horrible emotion recognition systems at work or school
meanwhile in America you've got cars raiding your driving patterns and probably using machine learning models to determine what your insurance like in order to determine um you know I would be the insurance companies that are probably using some kind of machine learning to take that massive amount of data and distill it down into how much your premium should be America has got some stuff to figure out M and to be clear look I I I always feel like I have to do this where anytime I'm calling out you know the
problems that exist in America so many of our own problems we have we have lots of our own problems we're we're we got problems okay we're we're problem we're problem Bros I've been been sick for a month to get an appointment with my family doctor it takes longer than a month and when I went to the clinic uh I had a maximum of five minutes I was able to see the doctor for okay your doctor sucks my answer was uh I don't know something viral and then they kicked me out yeah your doctor blows chunks Canada
in case you're wondering mine's actually really good but it can be hard to find one especially Vancouver really good like you can see them quickly uh if we really need to we can see them in a pretty reasonable amount of time that's the problem all my symptoms have been mostly pretty mild yes so the really need to is not there it would be so it takes over a month it would be a few weeks but there's absolutely no way that she would like kick me out after 5 minutes or whatever no no no that's the
walk-in clinic oh the walk-in clinics are terrible yeah my family doctor doesn't kick you out right away it just takes forever unless you have very serious symptoms going on it takes forever to forget it it's I if I need to be seen quickly I just didn't if I'm sick for multiple weeks I don't want to like if I'm talking to you and other people about like why I'm still sick I don't want to be like yeah and I haven't gone to see anyone so I went to the the the walk-in clinic is like more of a
formality than anything I kind of knew there was going to be nothing good coming from that unless I can tell them what's wrong with me it's basically useless if I'm like hey I have this I need this thing and they're like uh yeah it seems about right here you go they'll like write me a thing yeah just just take some Ivermectin and then you're good to go nice no more worms yeah drink some bleach no more worm do not do either of those things I mean if if I did drink bleach I don't think I would be sick anymore
yeah you'd have a condition of some sort problem solved not medical advice he's come he's come up with an acute case of  mortise I'm not uh I'm going top I'm going to type that yeah I know I know yeah yeah yeah it's it's it's it's it's localized below the waist we get it all right he got it oh man I don't even have to tell jokes anymore just laugh hard enough and lus knows what I'm thinking yeah well anyways um next topic weird notebook check article about our video yeah this is super weird um
the original version of it credited this photo to PlayStation which I thought was really interesting oh yeah I know I did see this so they've made at least one change to it um everything about this is super weird well-known Tech YouTuber declares PS5 dead wants to provide proof by building his own PC for the same price and fails all along the line so this appears to be in reference to our It's Time to Kill the PlayStation 5 video where we made a um like a a secondhand crack at taking a
PS5 budget and trying to build a PC that is competitive and ultimately came to the conclusion that the PS5 Xbox series X Generation for a variety of reasons have held on to their better value than an equivalently priced PC title much longer than expected and longer than previous generations and that if you wanted to buy with brand new hardware you are still better off buying a PS5 than you are today however if you're willing to dive into the secondhand market and put something together
yourself you can get competitive it is possible today but you'll have to be a little bit patient and try to find a deal so the writer took all of that and came away with um that it requires compromises that hardly any gamer would make I guess they've never been to a land party because yeah I I so I had not watched the video sure but I did skim this and I found that line and was like huh so I went and looked at the parts list and genuinely stared at for a while being like what if this would I not
do this all seems quite reasonable I don't understand the number of trash tier inherited cases that I have seen at land parties yeah outnumbers the nice brand new ones there was an ER where there would be custom systems in Old Dell and HP cases at every single land that would be like a quarter of the system of course it was absolutely of course there were uh there's no question the gaming PC offers more possibilities Tech wanted to prove the opposite and embarked on an ambitious experiment he
put together a gaming PC that would offer better performance than the PS5 at a comparable price however a number of difficulties arose that the YouTuber had apparently not considered the project can therefore be considered a failure I'm going to reference you as the YouTuber from now thank you I love that that's so good here's the thing writer of this article by the time we've uploaded the video we know the outcome this may surprise you that's nuts but there is a period after when we
have conceived of an idea and film the video where the video is filmed and all the information is known and it is being edited before it is uploaded the project is exactly what we set out to do which was to look at what it would take to build a PC for the budget of a  5 so um the project was a success because we built a PC that was fairly equivalent to the PlayStation 5 in raw performance but did have compromises which we met head on acknowledging in the video even things
that most people probably wouldn't be aware of did you know for example that hdr on Intel Arc is a mess no it's because they use the standard direct X12 implementation which many game developers don't use instead they use AMD and nvidia's own proprietary Flags because they predate the standard implementation so you'll be playing a game on AMD or Nvidia Hardware in HDR and HDR will work and you'll play that same game on in and it will be all washed out you know like it'll have that kind of log footage
look um like it's not graded um and that's that's a known issue it wasn't one that I knew about before this project but that's that's part of the Journey of discovery of doing things like this is is you learn it's it's a learning outcome uh was initially able to obtain all components at are price comparable to the purchase price of the PS5 however this was only possible because the YouTuber decided to buy used Hardware without a warranty oh no the total price is not really realistic yes
it is um this was all stuff we found uh lus received the case free of charge due to signs of use signs of use I love him describing this case as having signs of use the thing was trashed um and getting a case for nothing is a thing you can do it absolutely you just have to be patient and you have to be willing to use one that's kind of trashed um additional costs would have to be planned for this no they wouldn't um the shipping costs for the individual components are also not included and
this is true but a lot of the parts that we found in fact we found better deals that we didn't include because we were worried that they wouldn't be reproducible uh David found a way better CPU for the same price for example on Facebook Marketplace which he could have gone and gotten and yes there are some you know Transit costs that you would maybe have to account to there but no these are actually things that you could obtain it is true that we didn't account for the cost of the operating system in
peripherals that is accurate but you can use Windows without paying for it even if you shouldn't um and we acknowledged that we didn't include the cost of peripherals we also didn't include the additional cost of buying games on the PlayStation Store games on PlayStation are more expensive buy and large than buying them on PC if you wanted to play a multiplayer game wouldn't you have to buy the ps+ thing or whatever it's called as well um I'm not sure how it works these days I haven't I haven't
daily driven a PlayStation basically in forever so or basically forever um the newest PlayStation I own is a p PS2 that should give you some idea hey me too um buying new hardware would cost "over $1,000 this is true but it wasn't" what we were talking about uh wait if you want to rebuild the PC sorry hold on a second if you want to rebuild the PC you have to plan for significantly higher costs if you want to rebuild it okay I'm I'm really not sure what that means maybe they mean like build the one
that you SPC out the advantage of gaming consoles is that they uh are ready to use straight out of the box yes yes yes yes um it is therefore unlikely many gamers would follow the YouTuber's example and build their own PC from used Hardware instead of buying a PlayStation 5 you're right and that's exactly our point with exercises like this and with scrapyard Wars is that they should um and one of the scrapyard Wars I've made my own there's benefits guys there's benefits to learning that's like saying
a lot of people are saying it's AI generated article no I don't think so yeah I didn't actually think it was either there there's there's this this article feels a little bit like saying um that we should have made a video about hiring a plumber to come and repair our sink instead of you know going to um to a a building materials refurbisher and buying a used sink and installing it ourselves and learning  money the are you talking about like are you are you even are you is
that an interesting video is that is that good life advice Honestly though yeah fair enough is that what we should be promoting just have someone build it for you don't do anything yourself don't learn pay as much as you can I just I don't I don't get it we we never at any point in the video were were dishonest in any way I'm just going through uh our success or lack thereof however you want to Define that online listicles and finding free computer cases right now I know I found
a few already not listicles listings what is listicles listicles is an article that's a list oh right yeah don't worry about it um anyway so there I have some notes from from Jessica here uh wait really what's up oh uh Jessica says I have read the article in German and it is basically the same in both languages also I am fairly certain the author is not an AI I didn't know Jessica was I didn't know she could read German okay Nei cool though he posts around four relatively short articles
every day to notebook check usually two articles in German plus their English translations I believe this to be non-suspicious yeah that's fair um she also said odd factors from the article the article provides a summary that misunder understands the purpose of the video and dismisses the project as a failure essentially because we chose to buy used Hardware without a warranty it is also extremely dismissive of trying to build your own PC simply because a lot of Gamers won't want to
spend a lot of time on it or don't have the skill and will choose to do something else instead well I've which is fair enough got a few words for the  are maybe you should get good yeah got him maybe the writer the article should buy a screwdriver and get free shipping on a tax rate off sh maybe your maybe your readers would be more likely to build their own PCS and save money and learn something if you promoted that instead of just buying a console that's a bad idea why do you even work at notebook 
notebook okay then why is notebook check even like the consoles of the computer work dude it's actually kind of a bizarre thing to me like the the the amount of coverage that some YouTubers get from traditional media um when they do something positive versus the amount of coverage that we get when we do something positive and then how everyone how everyone is talking about it when anything negative happens with us it's like so they clearly all know who we are but only in the context of when
there's something negative to report on it's it's do you think we do that with Wow become a bit of a pattern I think we report on positive things yeah but like car companies we always report when they do bad stuff do they ever do good things maybe um trying to think what we've  so far Flo plane chat just thinks they don't do good things that's fair things are pretty distopian these days concept cars I the rules I don't know if that I would consider that a good thing anyway
this was something that uh this was something that popped up to me um I do wonder how much coverage is simply paid lonus I hope this finds you well I writing in regard to my last email in which we discussed featuring you in the top 10 inspiring leaders of 2020 24 as mentioned previously you will be presented with a two full page profile in the magazine that includes a headshot of the leader a high resolution PDF of your profile an HTML link with a backlink a digital logo a media press
release and a digital certificate of recognition for the nominal fee of "$1,500 nice dude these come in extremely" regularly and I consider them to be kind of ridiculous and I didn't know that was sense for reason I see a lot more coverage of certain people and I see a lot less coverage of me when something's positive um it's just the the timing of this this this came in uh I think about two weeks ago this one and then there's another one last week that I didn't forward to the um I think there might be
other reasons I think there are definitely other reasons but so I don't I don't I don't think that's like a reason to Witch Hunt someone to be very clear no no no no no no no no oh no no not that all like okay there's uh there's definitely people in the tech space that I know get a lot of real organic coverage uh Marquez for example gets a ton of organic there's no way Marquez is buying any of that that would be no absolutely I would be CH I I would eat a tax write off T-shirt If Marquez
ever paid to be included in some stupid list so this is this is not about that U my point is just that it it has stood out to me as a pattern that when we do something really cool it almost seems like there's a deafening silence yeah of discussion about it um I don't know there's been exceptions seven Gamers one CPU actually got a ton of  ago o yeah I just kind of Wonder there's been exceptions it was six years ago or however long who I piss off uh yeah I don't is the answer everyone I think
part of it we're Canadian here's a weird bit I was talking to someone recently about like Creator events and like Creator deals and all this kind of stuff um and I mentioned like you know I don't hear about a lot of this stuff like I'm obviously not the business department takes care of those things they've taken care of those things for many years but I was like a lot of these things I don't know and he's like yeah that's really weird I'll like I'll like make sure I talk to some people and make sure you
guys get bumped more then I got a message back a couple days later and he's like oh you guys are Canadians uh there nothing we can do yeah I'm like oh I that happens a lot okay so I think just the Border makes things annoying so then it's just not really worth it yep honestly I think that's a lot of it yeah all right and like there was the I was in uh La not that long ago and the same type of thing happened a bajillion people are like hey let's like do stuff cuz I can get there easily they might
not be from there but they can get there really easily Americans don't have passports this is another problem that we run into often uh which just like there's a lot of like just not being in the states is like a surprising barrier um and one that isn't always often  exists yeah seven Gamers one CPU it's actually older than I thought it's eight  hey the FCC raised their definition of broadband on the very same day that we uploaded that video saying Hey uh your internet is probably too fast
and I knew that that title was going to be a little bit bity because I know a lot of people do not have internet that is uh too fast CU what I was talking about was how there's a practical limit to how much benefit you can get from faster internet agre I haven't watched it but I agree we basically go through all the reasons you might think you need faster internet yeah and if you don't have a top-of-the-line gaming PC and your reason is that you want to download games faster yeah it's not going to
happen there's basically there's there's not much check your system resources to crack to crack gigabit to get higher than gigabit you basically need a very modern high performance gaming p PC um to crack 2 and 1/2 gig like cuz there there are home internet connections that are 2 and 1/2 gig or even greater but to to to reach download speeds that high on anything that needs to be unpacked as you're downloading it you need like a thread Ripper essentially um and so we go through a lot of the considerations
like how much of your regular surfing is actually going to be a DNS look up or uh loading in additional trackers and other content on the page versus what is actually raw download speed we talk about how download those sites even offer that download Speed Spool right yeah most pages are so small you're not going to get anywhere near it's not going to yeah this like greater than gigabit speed when you're browsing the web it's just not going to happen we ramp up in time we discussed some of the
benefits like faster chunk loading if you're watching Netflix or YouTube or floatplane dcom or whatever the case may be um but we also kind of we also discuss we also kind of debunk some of the big reasons that some people pay for Mondo home internet and those are uh you know self-hosting or um uh Linux ISO sharing we're kind of like look I mean why don't you just um use a seed bu get yeah yeah they're so cheap both of those things honestly unless you're doing it for like home lab um I want to learn
about it stuff reasons subashi says just think of a family of five with everyone using at the same time okay I'm thinking about it yeah what are the OD what are the odds that everyone is doing something at exactly the same time and doing something heavy and doing something heavy even if you're all watching see this is something a lot of people don't realize even if you're all watching 4K Netflix won't be enough you're all pulling down chunks yeah so you the connection is still going to sit
idle a lot of the time now there are types of content streaming that are less optimized and so we kind of we kind of touch on things like twitch for example especially broadcasting twitch but even then the bit rates are so much lower that as long as you've got a few hundred megabit symmetric we're kind of we're kind of at and it's enough point right now where if you have a Mondo machine and it's all about you know loading the latest game installing the latest game on your
system as fast as possible by all means get a more expensive internet connection or or or whatever for sure but beyond that until the infrastructure changes outside of your home in the services that you're using we're basically there there isn't an insane amount of incentive for that because honestly load times are pretty darn good things are kind of fast enough I mean Google stopped even we talked about this a few weeks ago right where Google stopped having cached Pages because they're just like
yeah I don't know the web's pretty reliable I don't know um anyway on that same day the FCC quadrupled the minimum internet speed that's required to label it Broadband which is a really good thing because what I won't argue with is that for a lot of people their internet is not fast enough agreed um the agency concluded that the minimum speed an ISP must offer to Market their service at Broadband should be increased to 100 megabit down 20 megabit up this is the first increase since 2015 when it was set at
253 um I actually think that's pretty reasonable I think 100 down being Broadband is pretty reasonable and Luke remember you're a content creator upload actually doesn't matter to most people yeah no I totally agree I care about it a lot I care about it a lot yep like a lot most people are basically never going to use it though so with that in  it's I wouldn't describe it as the greatest broadband and it doesn't even meet the threshold for what in our video we said would be kind of the most you'd
need it's not it's not there yet I would still I do I do think more people than in the past are heavily using upload now though more work from home is happening oh that's totally true more school from home is happening and you might not necessarily foresee school from home cuz the whole rip in peace forever but uh snow days are now being like remote school days that's a that's a bummer um I know right that sucks okay this is cool hold on hold on I've got a tax write off update and I've got uh an
update from Jake on his AI video sorting thing oh nice okay hold on hold on so I'm just goingon to run over to Luke's camera for a sec here yeah so let oh do you want to switch it to your camera Dan got it oh you can focus on the merch  understand I can multitask can you read that can anyone read that no no someone can there are two men on a computer oh wow that's completely AI generated horrifying very reasonable to think that's a factory okay sup sup stream there is a man what's going on
there is a man with a beard and a hat smiling I mean yeah that's true there's two of them actually yeah you better read it for the people because my mic is very good oh well now you're done doesn't matter the point is uh it said there are two men in a factory working on a computer and there's a what is even happening yep sorry drop the ball on that one there's a man with a beard and a hat smiling that's AI generated and that's just chugging through our footage right now that's pretty good are you wearing a
hat in that or a beanie I can't really see I'm wearing a hat yeah all right so it's creating metadata like that that will allow us to search through our footage so uh Jake sent me that and then Nick said I'm adding track suits too L need a couple more minutes hold hold on okay psycho go for it when you want to this this if these are still available when I get home I'm buying more oh the Dropout oh the dropout's amazing I have a full red Dropout I love it and it's it's probably my favorite hoodie at at this
price I would just buy another set of uh long XL blacks yep yep yep yep yep yep uh do you want to go to the uh do you want to go to the tax rateof uh Banner so we'll have we have everything that is part of the tax rate off event as well how much are the tracksuits the hoodie the this is not just Red by the way the Dropout stuff um the tracksuits 20 bucks holy bananas jacket jacket 20 bucks for the 1999 20 bucks okay crazy okay this is actually getting a little bit scary for me I wasn't sure
he was going to add this much stuff we need to add more at this point no we don't actually you were suggesting backpack for 25 bucks I don't think we're going to add um anything else at this point not a bad idea if you want to write more stuff off um pretty good okay we added quite a lot to it at this point I think that we've added enough the Dropout is absolutely absolute Madness at that price I know what our costs are on this yeah so both both colors are on sale um of the I'm not sure why it show shows um
the thingy here show I I don't know the point is that um yeah uh okay like these are these are products that have rave  jacket amazing quality great for the gym Mohammad okay sure I mean whatever best track jacket I've ever owned um the Dropout is the dropout's awesome this is I hesitate to say my favorite hoodie we've ever made it's fantastic it's it's the if you if you're on like a Saturday off work and you want to just chill it's the best it's the best it might not be the
best overall I don't know but it's the best for like that he's got one on I mean it's the one I'm rocking today I like traveling with it a lot um it's good stuff I hope we reserved a few for after the tax write-off event because potato sack when are when are the when is the new potato sack stuff I have no idea okay yeah we have samples but I I I have no idea when it's coming I feel like you probably should have waited for the potato PC video for that to launch um I think I well I mean sure
yeah cuz you like announced it in that video I know okay do I seem like I know what I'm doing I told I told him this earlier today I was like the YouTuber I was like Google Google a picture of this was pretty funny I was like Google a picture of me and then uh images does that guy look like he knows what he's doing I mean look at this guy you can't even figure out his facial hair yeah that one doesn't I mean doeses does this guy look like he knows what he's [Laughter] doing what is the what is the that
famous birthdays photo what is up with your hair where is it up one this what what is going on you just got the one little Twix my hair naturally one little Twi my hair naturally fauxhawks dude like here look I you can you can probably see here but it's just one here you can probably see it right now like it no I know it's always had the little thing it does this thing it's from both sides like it just kind of like it kind of swoops I don't get it dude I should pull out one wancho I should pull out
the old high school photos of when I had carving in my hair carving I had yeah I had like a star on the back of my head and like all the I went to this barber shop in Victoria um and he like what do you want done and I was like I don't know whatever and he's like that's like that's a dangerous thing to like say here we do a lot of crazy stuff and I was like yeah I don't care just whatever you want to do and I came out  stuff it was bad never went back to it that's good yeah yeah oh my
God the unit count what goes up yeah I mean I tried to stop you from doing this I take zero responsibility the revenue doesn't go up no go up no go up but somehow The Profit go down sorry I just I'm glued to this report now buy Cable Management arches to go with it it's so weird when you like sell t-shirts for $10 that your profit would go down and you sell hoodies like thick high quality hoodies for like what is it 20 bucks or something I don't remember we better not
move through all the Dropout hoodies cuz  jeus so the cheaper than most places will sell a t-shirt we're selling a hoodie that's cool that's good we're writing it off that's really good yeah we're not selling it we're writing it off you're doing can you not do both I guess so yeah okay I'm actually getting a little bit of anxiety now I was kind of having fun earlier in the show and I've come down a bit welcome um cool so I guess it's time for the after party UPS the yeah yeah the AMD
UPS hurts um basically to have a free sync or free sync premium label on your product you have to support higher refresh rates for gaming it's good yeah okay after dark time please subscribe to float plane yeah yeah the L week video is great I'm sure it's going to be more cool stuff y I've never done that now's a good time to subscribe to float plane I'd appreciate that what's that Dan okay cool Chate   okay all right the Creator are you ready you got to answer some stuff uh-huh yep
I'm going to try to go through I don't think I can read them to you cuz I still have 265 to go yeah I can do that you keep chugging let me see if I can even get through incoming oh right I can just minimize it you just pop it down it's  right howdy the wow. dll I'm starting a music hardware company and I'm curious with your products has there been anything good or bad that customers focused on that you didn't expect them   um something they focused on that we didn't expect I feel like um like I'm
the the sort of anal retentive person who who is going to flip out if something's even remotely wrong is there like a reason why they liked a product that you didn't necessarily foresee being a popular reason or something like that like focused on doesn't necessarily mean  um man uh this is this is really hard I'm loading up the store and I'm going to look at our products oh okay here's something I didn't think people would care so much about our screwdriver bits being black that black coding is actually
functional um and it has something to do with something something the metal better something uh but it's cosmetic after that fact um so we've had people try to initiate return requests because the black coding has come off of their bits um that was something that was weird not something I expected people to focus on yeah uh fair enough there I came up with something good job lonus yeah uh hey lonus I actually work at a badmon facility or I should broadcast this uh I collect
shuttles at the end of the that didn't work uhoh it's okay just read it uh I collect shuttles at the end of the day my question is why don't we ever see shuttles that behave like feather ones but are nearly indestructible ah so they're working on that um I've actually tried a couple of them here's uh Victor's carbon Sonic so these are synthetic feather shuttles the ones that I've used I don't think they were this one I think they were a different one but very similar they use
almost a foam like material here and they do last substantially longer than feather shuttles and don't have some of the same um animal cruelty concerns as feather shuttles but I think it's going to be quite a while before we see any kind of professional tournament move to something like this because while they have a benefit in terms of cost they do not fly quite the same mhm it's nature is one heck of a good designer and as it turns out synthetically are mimicking the
properties of a natural material with a synthetic one is  and I mean it's has like yeah I don't think the like will the NBA ever move Beyond leather balls like why I don't think so there was that that 3D printed basketball recently which was pretty cool actually pretty cool but unless it is actually identical I just don't see it happening it's the same with baseballs they're going to be leather forever because at that level they can afford the real one and so you might see
in fact you do see like you play like a minor b game or whatever you're going to be playing with like a hunk of plastic cuz it doesn't matter they're just going to Huck it in a pitching machine it's going to get chewed up anyway but at an elite level I think natural materials are going to be king for the foreseeable future and when it comes to marketing you always Market what the pros use so there's always going to be that that aspiration to to use the natural material the the like the real one
natural material is always going to be real no matter how fraught it is with you know ethical concerns yeah yeah uh I this one is curated technically um I don't think it did work uh first time I've remembered to add a merch message and I'm wasting it on this meta joke about wasting a merch message love you Dan nice nice nice um that got curated it did um nice good job D I suspect that was a misclick uh hello W dll Luke I'm relatively I'm a relatively new IT director of a booming it team
what criteria do you use to give Junior admins or engineers admin passwords or the keys to the kingdom for critical infra uh generally it's Ru AJ um if the answer is no flowchart then then no if the answer is yes then yeah um so AJ's been with us over five years now um seven years shut up has it been seven pretty sure he he technically started helping me with things that's right nonprofessional capacity in 2016 good Lord um that was super light okay um by the time we're in
2017 things are ramping up he's still technically nonprofessional capacity at the beginning of the year by the end of  um yeah um I don't know it's diff it's very difficult though it's actually really hard um you need to not one thing that you need to communicate to your team that I think is actually really important to communicate is that it's not a sign of respect it's it's no seriously though it's it's no I was just I was looking at our um sales yeah yeah yeah um having the keys is a
threat for everyone it's not a good thing you don't want too many people to have access to Stu you want generally at least two admins on every system just in case something goes wrong with one of the admin accounts you can still recover it or whatever um but other than that you really want to limit it as much as possible and what you might end up wanting to do uh because it sounds like your team might be fairly sizable is to have some like areas of ownership so you have a person who has the keys to a
certain like portion of the IT department um but they don't have it for all of it and then a different person has it for another portion and then you have it for all of them or something like that but but there shouldn't be very many people that have it for all of them ideally just kind of one and then uh some people that have smaller amounts it's it's an  ah it's a risk Vector because every account has a potential to be compromised so even if like every single person at LTT was perfectly trustworthy
which I'm sure they are um if we gave every single person full admin rights to every single thing then every single person's account is now a major insanely scary attack Vector to owning everything that we have um so you just you don't want to do that um so you it's like I have people on my team that are like happy when they lose permissions to things because they're like oh I don't have to like worry about this thing so much anymore which is good um yeah I don't know so it's scary try
to try to slowly creep your trust with  um yeah fun fact one of the reasons why when I was at school I was seriously thinking about becoming a database administrator was because I was like hey if I'm in control of all your data you're probably going to pay me pretty well that yeah it's like I don't know like I I when you have access to extremely important important things and all that type of stuff it it comes with you are a portion of risk and you know that person is probably going to be taken care of
decently well that was a thought process um I ran out of curated already uh I don't know if that's because oh nope okay they're loading did  uh I was looking at that one going like the is this hi guys lonus are you open to criticism no turn it off would you be willing to have discussion SL inter with someone who didn't like you before August turn it off now and now are and now are giving you a second chance to see if it's better second chance to what the are you talking about like am I
open to criticism I'm here give it to me I don't understand why you would do that uh because I almost don't understand why You' do almost any interview um I don't know I don't do many no very few people ask me yeah um maybe you end up doing like a Callin and suir video someday I don't know I kind of doubt it but I kind of doubt we're not really mainstream yeah we're the we're like we're a big fish in a really small pond um like actually very small I think a lot of people massively
overestimate how big the space is and and the thing is like yeah we're we're we're big on YouTube but that's also a small pond like on YouTube companies like Dude Perfect are big and you know what those guys are killing it oh yeah they're crushing it they're doing awesome yeah for like you know a group of entrepreneurs not they're not running you know a multinational business in the same way that really big businesses are operating it's just not it's just not the same scale right and um I I'll
sometimes I find you know we talked a long time AG you mentioned the100 million offer thing yeah um and then I'll see some company that like I think is small and it's like oh they just sold  like or people are like wow I can't believe they were able to acquire this chy for company for so cheap it was only chumy yeah perfect who were you talking about that Freudian slip though I can't believe they were able to get them so cheap for only $2.7 billion and I'm like oh oh people are out there doing stuff
um Cory is the name Corey is the name has a great response to this tell the kind man thank you for giving you a second chance I appreciate it I do actually thanks I do I do actually um as for as for being open to criticism my word um I have been criticized from the moment I first uploaded a video and people talked about my my earrings or you know whatever else or my awful high-pitched voice um to the moment that you are sitting in right now uh telling me you didn't like me prior to August and now
you have to have an interview with them what you're willing to consider you can like me now will you now spend your time doing this um hey I I I do appreciate it though um the the the cold hard truth apprciate the second chance yeah I do I do appreciate that and um you know if you I if if you're chill then I'm chill and if you're not then that's you know what that's okay too because at the end of the day I just got to do my thing here um that that's what YouTube is it's from your
perspective you but but it's me right and uh for a lot of people that's going to resonate and for a lot of people that's not going to resonate and um you know we're just going to be us we'll be here if you're uh if it's third chance time another time because you didn't like my response to that then hey I feel like that might happen I'm still going to be here for that too though I'll be here yeah all right yeah sorry I just saw that when I was like all right c um I got uh let's do it congrats on
the MCM launch question for little L uh what was the hardest part about selecting the components of each pack of the MCM all right go ahead and ask  him H basically we were we were trying to make sure that um we had a pretty safe balance of what most people would need for kind of the targeted the stated use for them so what we did was uh we went around to people's desks we asked people about their home setups here at the office cuz we're pretty representative of Gamers and techies and
we kind of did it and we're like okay how much did we need without overspending and then we built bundles based on that oh that makes some sense I got a question about my setup a while ago and I didn't bother ask like why they were asking these questions but I was like what and I think it was is probably related to that um next question uh I'm 37 oh I should broadcast I'm 37 and had both hips replace last month if you could replace any part of your body with  head that's pretty good yeah because you
wouldn't even be able to tell the  him if it worked just as well but was less susceptible to damage I think my spine that'd be pretty sick but that's like that's just like a worst case scenario insurance policy whereas if you went with like the knees yeah then you'd know it's definitely useful pretty or hips yeah hips are huge dude they don't lie break your the the fatality percentage after breaking your hip is insane that's true like it's actually crazy how we doing boys uh we
ran out of curate it's never better Dan I just uh I just gave up and left yeah I I saw that noticed well no he was probably going to work on the Afterparty no I was just crying I was just crying outside I was going say I think he just took a breath oh okay well that's fine too cuz he didn't go that way he went this way yeah there's a there's a quiet server room where nobody can hear you sad um you mean scream sure I have no mouth um did you want two cameras or one camera um same as last week or more more
advanced Dan why don't you tell us what  for I can jump as high as you want lonus no matter what hour of the day or how long my shift has been how easy is the second camera what about second camera what what about second cam I'm I'm starting these lism and it's becoming a bit of a problem um after last week it's it's trivial now so okay um how long are you going to be to get through these 362 merchand we're not going to get through them all today okay yeah we're just going to we're
going to do some of them and then we'll we'll go up and we'll do super checks and then we'll call it there cuz um you don't know this but um I have to be at the airport in like 6 hours or something like that so okay I I also am incentivized to not be here forever let's do one camera could be two one camera it could be two I'm doing two cameras it's better it looks better how many games do you want to do it I me it's got to be best of seven or it's barely even hockey oh my God I think
best of five is the way I think best of five is the way if you're a coward wow are you AOW mean why would that be more coward Luke has a skill issue and he doesn't want anybody to know it I tell everyone I lose most I will I will wreck both of you let's play Let's play a different game yeah cuz you can't win at Super checks that's true he's spicy tonight I like I'm very tired I will break you um all right I'm excited for when Dan and I work out again yeah sounds like we're doing Mastery
sets for every single yeah let's let's go I almost said a bad word uh I'm going to go get another camera uh unless you guys want to end the stream or something like that we could do that together yeah well um not right no not yet okay yeah not not yet we should do a few more we should few give me give me 10 minutes yeah the uh we're still getting a merch message every 10 [Laughter] seconds we should do more of these though um yeah we'll do a few more but like oh my gosh uh this is ridiculous
I'll let you chew on this one for a second and then I'll go try to deal with more of them uh Hey dll I'm going to broadcast hey dll I have a question uh I've had this question for a while for lus between your relationship between your wife Ivon and your husband Luke which has had more development oh um it's actually a decent question I mean the one where you have kids together is going to be where you have the biggest questions to answer because at the end of the day it better be as much as we as much as we
to as much as we care deeply about our team here um there's a difference between the relationship of a group of co-workers and the relationship of your flesh and blood um and and while  um while we want what's best for the team and while the team wants what's best for the company at the end of the day I believe that money corrupts everything and I think that because money is inherent in an employer employee relationship the capacity there's still money involved in I was going to get to
that okay the capacity for it to corrupt the relationship is almost guaranteed like every work relationship pretty much ends at some point and there are exceptions but if you compare that to the capacity of money to corrupt a family relationship which is great which is huge the percentage guaranteed is lower and and let's not kid ourselves money destroys many families especially I think right now where cost of living is so high and it's so financially beneficial to split the rent with split
the rent of one room with another person yeah maybe taint is the right word instead of corrupt says moss in on float play that's probably right um I think that and you know obviously it right okay this is a perfect example because the thing I was about to say comes from a position of of a power and balance in the relationship I was going to say I don't feel like money has corrupted or tainted mine and Luke's relationship not yet I it hasn't yet I I I feel like it would be pretty tough for
but that's easy for me to say in my position and so the dynamic's always there it's always something that has to be kind of considered um and that I I I have to be aware of and have to be and I have to be careful of um because because that potential for taint that potential for corruption is always there even if it never seeps in if that kind of makes sense do you kind of get what I mean no it is yeah it's uh I often consider things I might say because because you might only think of
this from Linus's perspective but there's things that I can say that could be very charged as well sure like okay here's an example that could go both ways you know if I were to if I were to make uh a comment like uh okay let's say I was getting married this is a big thing right now uh Millennials are apparently destroying their relationships over destination weddings oh um not their relationships with the spouse but their relationships with their families over destination weddings
and the cost associated with it if I were to get butt hurt over Luke refusing to attend my stupid destination wedding and I were to somehow oh yeah make that about the money that I know he has right because why do I know that I only know how much money Luke has because he works damn hard for it and at the end of the day I sign the check but that's not a normal dynamic in a relationship and in this equal but opposite if I start complaining about expenses it can put pressure on me the the the human being
the friend that wouldn't normally be there if he was just a bro complaining about expenses which like I I have at times but I try to be pretty careful with it and I try to make sure that I'm presenting things the right way and I often am paying attention and so and it's always been fine it's something we both have to worry about a little bit Yeah because there's that potential there like okay here's here's another really great example okay when it comes to food right it
would be very easy for Luke to be upset that knowing as he does my financial situation as well it would be easy for him to be upset if I just didn't offer to pay for everything but then it would be easy for me to be upset if Luke didn't offer to pay for things at the very least because I might feel taken for granted I might feel taken advantage of so these are the kinds of dynamics that will always exist but that I feel like we're both cognizant of and that we're both respectful about and that we
try to keep out of our relationship but it's a conscious effort I guess is what I'm trying to say yeah every relationship whether it's romantically involved or not is going to have some amount of work element to it yeah uh yeah I mean relationships are a lot of work yeah and and work is tough on a relationship like it every way to be clear yeah it's worth it you should try to have like your the amount of friends you have is going to dwindle over time it really does doesn't it pretty pretty
intensely um I think we might have some and I started with like three I think we might have some somewhat unique uh things going on there um cuz I I mean Mo my like core friend group has always been cool and I suspect they will always be cool but there's some like people that I was more on the acquaintance level with that will reach out randomly and like now I am automatically primed and suspicious of like is this because of yeah is this because of public presence is this
because you need something whatever and it almost always is one of those two things I've told Ivonne before cuz she she and I she and I talk doomsday scenarios it's a hobby um and and and she has said things like well it would be easy for you to find someone um and just not in like an like angry way but just in like a debating way we we we talk right you know you're married long enough you talk about everything eventually and I kind of went well right but what would that be
yeah because it's it's going to be charged would I ever sure you're right honestly at at at my at my age and and like being a YouTuber which is from my understanding kind of desirable thing and you know having a pretty pretty decent amount of money you know could I could I find uh could I find a meat thing to spend time with I I don't I don't really question chat you don't need to get all yes Aon would do fine you don't need to she you don't need to propose in chat right now she'd have no trouble banging
I I have no doubt because because the same thing is also true in the inverse right yeah she is also very eligible you know as a as a bachelorette so but but but what I said what I said to her was like yeah I have no question that I could find something but would I ever find that genuine be trying to seek the same quality that I previously had I would never find it and I'm going to have to find someone that is worth the amount of work and effort that we did to get to where we are and I'm going to have to do
all of that again you want to have the small conversations again all the way to build up so that you can have the big conversations like is that effort you actually want to go through at this time I was talking to and every time I would be suspicious 100% okay Ivon and I do not have a prenuptual agreement do you know why because there was no money there were no assets like there I've SE I've seen people talk about how like yvon married him for the money or whatever I I it would have been the
other way around at that time she had a much better Outlook than I did when we got together you guys got to you got to understand that yeah and I was thinking about it could I ever trust another person the way that I trust Ivonne like Ivon has complete power of attorney she has complete control of all of our financial assets there are so many things that require only her signature and do you know how I sleep at night soundly like a fuing baby sorry that one part happens before
the sleep it doesn't matter the point is that you know what I'd probably be fine with Avon having those things for me too she is extremely responsible reasonable person an absolute rock yeah and I was thinking about even if I met Ivonne today could I trust her the way that I do honestly probably not knowing about the dynamic yeah no would I have a prenup yeah probably almost certainly and I have always viewed that as a sign as a as a and and and I've had the I've had the luxury of it because it never
mattered when I like formed this opinion right but I always viewed the prenup as as planning for failure if I was if I was I yeah if you asked me again today because I was single and and pursuing a a long-term relationship I wouldn't I would say it's an insurance policy in case of a catastrophic disaster but I had the I had the luxury of being allowed to be naive because I did manage to find a relationship where it wasn't necessary it was never needed um so the point is that um I forget where
we were going with this but I saw a really great comment from Fox and a box on Flo plane um at luk and lus I think as you guys just discussed any issue can be overcome if both people are trying and sometimes the effort alone is more important than any issue and I just  wise it's about what you built and you might have been able to build it with a variety of people like there's the the whole like there's only one fish in the sea for you and they happen to be in your hometown is just hilarious it my
thing my thing with Ivon is uh I don't believe in soulmates but if I did then I'd buy  yeah if I did I'd believe you're it yeah yeah which is which is great you want to ideally find someone that you're like yeah this this could be if if that was true this person could be it there's like no way it's true but what really builds that is the the effort and the work that you put into it and this this like castle that you collaboratively build together um that is  strong we are not getting through all
these merch messages no but I have some curated ones for you we literally have 40 more than we did before we started that one nice um question for lonus how did you like the Hydra facial is it something you would recommend and will you be getting another one um I don't know you tell me so I've I've always been transparent to a fault so the hydrofacial was step one and then after that I did Morpheus 8 which is uh three treatments of subdermal um RF essentially and what it's meant to do is radio frequency
really yeah so it essentially Burns you I was going to say radio frequency as like a joke I no idea hurts a lot um but what it's meant to do is damage the the subthermal layer whatever layer that is in a way that stimulates collagen production which is essentially what makes your skin youthful you produce more of it when you're younger and as you age you produce less of it so from my point of view and I've discussed this on the show before uh my mug is a business asset at a certain point and
taking care of it like I'm I'm not I'm not into you know going out and dramatically altering my personal appearance but if there's pretty minor things that I can do to maintain them at least until we can you know Go full uh vtuber um then I see it as a I see it as a pretty worthwhile investment so I guess my answer to that question is I don't know you guys tell me this is the first time this is was the first  um I have no idea yeah I I know um I'm not really good with that stuff though I
didn't notice when you first shaved your beard off yeah my a my aunt too she thought she thought I got a haircut which I technically I did yeah fair enough yeah yeah but she and my uncle they had dinner with me and they were  like messaged me they're great that's pretty good um blackm Smoke Rise says I haven't noticed anything at all I guess it's working then cuz that's kind of the point the point is that if you if you do it right it's supposed to look like you've done
nothing at all um you just look you know rested right um yeah so there you go that's uh that's it uh people mentioned your face was a bit redder than usual yeah so in some of the videos it's it's redder than usual because I just got stabbed a thousand times in the face yeah which Hurts by the way yes um however in The Vision Pro uh well here give me me a sec uh for the Vision Pro video uh it was The Vision Pro yes U and any speculation that it was makeup or anything is silly
uh it was just that it just doesn't fit me it doesn't fit me very well um I'd say here let's see oh it's really hard to because it's like it's kind of like a hot it's kind of like a hot pain but it's like kind of  the it's weird because each shot is I think 24 needles at a time but feels like one and they were explaining it to me it's because like you only have so many nerves and so multiple penetrations of the skin I almost blacked out uh last time cuz the first time you go the
energy is pretty low and then they turn it up if you tolerate it well and the first time I tolerated it very well so I'm I'm a fainter um which means anytime that my skin gets broken and I experience any kind of blood loss it's like a it's like a they're they're not sure exactly what causes it whether it's physiological or psychological or some combination of the two um I ran into one nurse once who told me that um she wasn't one she got struck by lightning she became one uh but basically what
happens is um and so so nurses or anyone who does um a blood drawing or injections or anything we we'll be familiar with the term but um what it means is the second you uh your skin is broken your your body basically goes into a a semi State of Shock no where it focuses on maintaining circulation to your vital organs and so what happens is whenever I get blood drawn uh my extremities go like immediately like immediately ice cold um and when I found this out um it was at a time when I was
I was in quite a compromised State like I was getting blood drawn because I was really sick and um this poor nurse she must have been like 90 lb soaking wet um she's she's trying to draw blood from me and one of the challenges is that they got to be in there forever because my blood stops flowing right so they take it from the arm and my body's all like yo you made a hole in my arm I'mma keep all the blood here thank you very much so my blood stops flowing um so she's on like the
fourth vein in the second arm by this point because I had forgotten I hadn't had blood taken in a long time and I'd forgotten that when I was a kid I needed a but butterfly needle um because it's a smaller it's a smaller needle but with a with a wider uh inner diameter so they don't have to make as big of a hole and the blood flows more easily they're more expensive so you have to ask for them um so I forgot that I needed a butterfly needle or else it's really difficult to
draw blood from me but it had been 10 or 15 years since I'd had blood drawn so I didn't remember um so anyway she's like she's going at it like Perforating my arm with this regular needle and not able to get any freaking blood out of it and all of a sudden I kind of am like oh um I'd never blacked out before but I was like oh my vision's going kind of dark she goes you need to get your head between your legs right now because I cannot hold you in this chair she's like it's tiny and I
was in an elevated chair so that at a standing height it was easy for her to work on my arm right so so I would have just plowed into the ground I would have broken my nose like we would have had blood everywhere never mind in the vials accomplished that actually doesn't work and so she was the one who explained it to me after I didn't black out that time uh but she explained it to me um and she basically goes yeah it's this it's this it's not a condition but it's it's a
thing um and so she had me lie down and she took my blood that way we we got the butterfly needle and she's like okay so you need to remember this you need a butterfly needle you need to tell people when they're drawing blood from you that you're a fainter so that they can put you somewhere where you're not going to where you're not going to black out and like crush them um uh where where where was I going with this I forget the question uh right so Perforating my face
oh so in this case I was actually lying down but so I don't know if it was pain or if it was penetration uh cuz they can also go deeper do you bleed um like I had like it looked like I nicked myself with a razor in like two spots by the end of it so in general no yeah uh but you're red and that's I was just wondering like is it the blood loss or is it no it's not blood loss it's like I I I don't know they don't seem to really fully understand it okay uh but I almost blacked out I was like yo um my vision's
starting to darken uh and she's like who okay let me get you some chocolate um apparently that's a fun side effect yeah apparently some of the like botox it's pretty relatively common for people to black out but with this one she'd never seen it before and she's like oh okay yeah I'm like okay so I'm a fainter I guess that applies to this good to know um I did blackout one time when um a buddy for an insurance company was taking blood from me at my house and um what I remember was U me telling him hey
I'm a fainter I was in the chair um yeah I I feel kind of faint I'm just going to go I'm going to go over on that um I have like the it's called Love Sack is the brand but it's like a big bean bag I'm going to go over on that bean bag and um give me a sec and I closed my eyes and I opened them and he's like you've been out for  minutes so um so that's a thing um not Bryce says butterfly needle is a myth I'm a nurse uh blah blah blah blah something no it's not a myth I I
can tell you for an absolute fact that even if I am not looking they just can't get blood out of me without one so um that's cool I'm glad that you have that expertise but as someone who actually cannot have blood taken from them with a regular needle um and this has been confirmed by multiple multiple nurses and technicians over the years  sorry yep uh okay more merch messages one for me uh Luke my birds Kirby and Carl finally like each other enough to snuggle and groom each other what cool
Milestones have you hit with your birds one thing that I like I always enjoy this is uh learning to communicate with people or animals or whatever else with with language berries obviously with animals there going to be language berries but um and like learning habits and stuff so my birds for a long time there if we'd let them out to fly to get them to go to bed they have terrible night vision so I would turn most of the the lights down and use like the the glowing from my
computer and stuff like that so that I could see um and I would catch the birds in the dark and then physically put them back in their cage and that was the like nighttime activity and they knew it was coming because they'd see me get up and start turning the lights off and they'd start chirping and stuff um I started to try to teach them to get back in the cage themselves and I would do that by like physically blocking off the other areas that they were at so sometimes
they like to hang out just on top of the cage so I'd wait for them to come back to on top of the cage then I would kind of Dome my arms over to be like look I am blocking the flying up area and then if they like indicated they were going to go to a certain side I would shift over and block that and eventually try to like kind of Corral them over towards the edge of the cage and then make it so that the the easiest way for them to fly would be to fly into the cage um and I this took a while to kind
of train them to do but now at this point if if I just Dome over the top of the cage like that they'll pretty much automatically just run to where the cage entrance is and then I don't even have to like do the rest of it they'll just hop off and fly into the door um and that was pretty cool something someone pointed out is that in different regions um there may be slightly different meanings so of what a butterfly needle is yeah so there are lots of different kinds and there's like it's the tape
that goes on it that makes it a butterfly needle so here it means a particular thing it means a lower gauge that has a finer needle with a sorry I shouldn't say lower gauge cuzz lower gauge is bigger but cuz I don't know Imperial measurements um it means a finer needle that has a narrower wall um in order to make it easier to to to get into the vein um your mileage may vary maybe they have like gigantic thick thick wall butterfly needles where you are and it won't help at all so then if
you are in a similar situation then what you would ask for is just a finer gauge needle or whatever um so your mileage may vary all right uh greetings LTT greetings LTT some videos blur logos even on shirts why you work at media I was curious what decides if you have to pay a brand or the brand has to pay you to have logo in  um hold on I think for us it's more about that we're just kind of inconsistent okay yeah I mean there are cases where we're where we have a high level of intent when we cover a logo
with Gaff tape or when we don't um if a brand sponsor of a video is like hey yo I'm Aus and I sponsored your video and you're using an MSI monitor look I'm not super mad cuz like we weren't promoting monitors but like could you have not really brother yeah then we'll go and we'll blur it um for monitors that we use on set a lot uh we try to kind of proactive just do it because like whatever um we get very very little product placement Revenue uh occasionally we've done stuff
on Wow like I think that's the origin of these but secret lab we just them then we just like keep them forever cuz like what I'm going to I'm going to tape over it yeah like that just it feels really transactional if someone does do a sponsorship or something and then the second it's over we're like I'm put I'm put tape on it it's ape day we're going to spend money in order to yeah I don't know yeah in order in order to in order to get you less value for that deal that we did together like I don't know I'm
just I I feel like I'm just not that petty if they want to update the chairs and pay us again or something like that like sure but yeah AJ says I am a fainter can confirm I need to ask for the butterfly needle and usually need to be slightly reclined yeah yeah I sorry all right what else we got um I burned my curated oh man I'm for some reason I'm scrolled all the way down to archived we we have more than we had I um yeah have you seen uh so here's here's one mean some of these are just like meme like I
can just click show oh crap yeah cuz they're just in incoming oh the LTD screwdriver has been made in the largest uh man-made M shaft on Earth apparently I accidentally clicked show on that one been used in there yeah mine M shaft hold on I I archived it by accident control F shaft oh there's a lot of shaft oh oh right because many of our items have shafts it's not in the message I get it oh oh there's a lot of shaft that's got to be one of the greatest Linus quotes um okay uh did you see the Star Wars
Battlefront re-release have you seen this I'm kind of surprised this wasn't in the like six to eight times the storage of the original games and like there's all kinds of problems I have I'm sure it's happened before I've personally never ever seen something on Steam you know we we saw with B's Gate 3 had to insert it somehow the show was almost over um we've seen with some games that they they get overwhelmingly positive this game I've never seen this before overwhelmingly negative
reviews never seen it before amazing uh so yeah the the merch message says they released the PC game from 2005 on multiple systems or they re-release sorry it barely works and the original which is the same game runs much  L um Amando asks hey lonus do you think that improvements in wafer yields by tsmc for example have contributed to the death of the entry level segment for both CPUs and gpus I don't think it's improvements in wafer yields I think it's increases in cost it's just not
worth building anything around um such a at such a low price point it's it's there's far better cost savings to be had by integrating things more versus building an entire discret product like why would you build a $50 board around uh a $50 GPU when you can build a $60 board around a $100 GPU and sell that for 300 bucks you know like it's just not worth it when you could take that small amount of die area and just put it right onto a CPU and get essentially the same benefit because it already had to
have a memory controller in cash anyway um I I think it's more just the the general March towards more integration and less anything to do with tsmc's yields archive oh my gosh uh okay how about   nope okay got to do all um Okay Christian asks I got my mystery color screwdriver amazing colors love it compared to my black driver the finish is not as perfect lonus what were the compromises you had to swallow and how hard was it for you we basically had to um yeah except that the the flow of the
uh of the plastic wouldn't quite be the same so if you look really closely at some of the color ones they have uh some swirl in the D and in the color that is not present on the black ones and um that's the kind of thing you actually have to put a lot of work into to get exactly right I read a really interesting artic about how the Xbox series X they wanted to do it in white and realized um oh the only reason the black one looks good is because all of these swirls were hidden by the black
color and they had to like completely redo the molds or something like that in order to make a white one yeah it's is color is really really really really really really hard so I basically was just like well I want multicolored screwdrivers at LTX and we're going to have them damn it so yeah there's there's some imperfections but they're really cool so whatever they're cool  uh hey Dan we're going to do like four more and then we're just going to have to call it because there's simply too
much like guys this is what we're dealing with here okay we've got uh we've been live for 4 hours we've had 1600 merch messages things have died down a little bit we're only getting about one a minute but you guys think about it by this point in the show we've been down to zero a minute for quite some time and we're we're we're chewing through them whereas now we are still it takes us more than a minute to do a curated merch message oh they don't all go to curated yeah but we also do a lot
it takes a lot more than a minute on average so I'm kind of fudging the numbers both ways there's also "1,114 left in the queue to display yeah" so that will show up when we go to the outro that'll be awesome I'm excited about that I've been excited about that the whole show to be honest I keep thinking about it yeah because exting this is not I don't even know if this is the highest Revenue W show we've ever done like when screwdriver launched and backpack launched I think it was higher
Revenue but in terms of item quantity I think it's the highest for that I think this is also highest merch message yeah as well like this is ridiculous tax "write off shirts are over 2,000 now um" oh my God Dropout hoodies are over 500 I was not expecting Dropout hoodies to catch up like that oh yeah fantastic hoodie for list in most t-shirts uh this is actually a record huh this is a record all around nope no are you sure yeah okay hold on let me double check yep it  profit it is however a record for the
inverse ah nice actually no no I'd say the record for loss is probably the one where I cut into the bottom of the backpack that was a very expensive W  ever so good oh man uh all right so what like three or four more Dan's ready for the super checks Afterparty stream already so  y I'm scooting through stuff I'm trying to find them um a lot of these are just  go oh oh oh yeah okay uh that's an you're like pack alarm no that's an alarm to do a thing when I thought I would definitely be at home
tonight meanwhile you're not going to be home for like at least an hour if not more nice um what is I got I got one I got one I got one I did it uh what is Dan's okay I'll read the whole thing I got my bread plush also I want to expand on the question asked a couple weeks ago what is Dan's favorite Retro Game oh man does this even count as retro PlayStation one it's game called Ein Honda by uh Square before they were Square Enix it's a uh sides scrolling space shooter thing extremely difficult
extremely complicated it has like seven levels or something like that you have ammo management you have weapon management you have place management it's one of those games that you get hit once and you're you're dead and then there's no checkpoints you basically have to restart after you run out of lives um so extremely skill-based excellent so good so so good is is PlayStation one even retro the time that was like five years ago that it came out glad you enjoy the tracksuit pants Kevin G just ordered
another pair of them and congrats on losing 20 lbs heck yeah keep it up brother good work uh yeah it's basically like a square made too that's a that's a good comparison bullet hell but also not it's like a tech bullet Hill game great  10 Luke you are clicking things so fast I can't even read them you just want them all to scroll past yeah do they not scroll past if we don't click show I don't actually know I I don't know pass no matter what okay I just and I am actually I'm scanning to see like does
this one have a question question that's all I'm looking for if it doesn't have a  zoom uh someone asks what kind of screws am I supposed to use with these magnet things screws oh well they come with little screws but they also just like have a hole in the plate and you could put any screw you want into it so if you okay for example I used a masonry screws when I um have you seen this no I don't think so my gate in my backyard so I screwed um a uh I put a little strap across the uh or sorry I I put a
little strap across the cable Arch like one of the big ones and I put it on my gate and then I used masonry screws on the other side for the metal plates and I screwed them into like these bricks that are there so when I open my gate my cable management Arch holds it open everything else I tried like I would I would wedge stuff under it and the wind just rips through there and slams the gate shut but that would hold but this holds so I'm very happy for gond door   um man I'm just clicking show on things
I'm clicking I'm clicking so hard I'm trying to I'm trying to David S says  oh oh man people are ordering so much stuff our 3pl is like screwed um okay we already kind of answered that earlier so forget it um hi Luke I applied for a software engineering role and I'm curious does your team often hire US citizens thanks yeah but as contractors not employees yeah that's yeah that's the whole thing yeah ah show you got anything Luke come on I'm I'm scroll so many of these are like
Aussie here thanks for the free shipping I work I study I sleep the  Chase um okay here how about this one I got one for you here Luke here's one for you while I continue to go through  okay oh you curated it yeah yeah I curated yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah uh oh uh this is a good one from Travis hey dast Duke and O glorious Dan leader of all what current product of yours do you think will get a V2 first what favorite product of mine I know the answer to this what oh wait it says current
product damn I was going to say w hoodie V2 because it like happened already oh um hm V2 out of current products backpack no would you consider the costed down one a V2 no that's a separate product they'll coexist Okay and like the backpack with the actual double layer and 1.1 that one's fine yeah yeah um I I was I was only saying that because of the the cost of download I mean we'd be crazy if we weren't examining based on how many we've sold we'd be crazy if we weren't examining
like a screw driver V2 at some point but sure come first yeah I don't I don't think that needs to come that's years away it's a good screwdriver and there's nothing that out competes it so we're going to we're going to continue to sell it and amortise the cost of development for as long as we uh as long as it makes sense um it's a really good screwdriver what would get a V2 I don't know I I could see us I could see us rejigging Northern Lights desk pad doing like kind of just an updated
style but still you know Northern Lights but then there's so many opportunities for design like why not just do something entirely new too much of our stuff not that this is actually a problem I'm I'm using the term too much as if that's bad but it's not a bad thing too much of our stuff is like so overbuilt that like what are you going to do what do you got it right the first time yeah how you going to V2 this I don't know whatever how about towels V2 for towels towels can you make
them more absorbent I don't know well we could update the design a little can they are they flying carpets now um I don't know uh anyway anyways hey dlll I'm about to graduate and need advice on joining the software engineering Workforce I've only ever been a tech sales consultant and I have yet to give ideas for a side project what should I do  um oh no I know the answer what something you're really passionate about ah there you go something that says something about you the free one got
yeah got lots of updates on Labs chain oh kids book a V2 yeah I'm not going to do a V2 why because I would write a different book yeah that's not a V2 no I would do the alphabet of gaming or something like that why don't you do  time sure sure right one on the plane oh man yeah what are youing yeah right you're on vacation and just write continue working what's wrong with you Ivon can drive to work and you can write it in the passenger seat I probably could write it on the plane a the fact the fact that the
author of like basic kids books gets first billing and the illustrator goes second is a crime Sarah put so much more work into the first book than I did she did a great job yeah it's awesome um Shay made me read I Want My Hat Back by John Classen and it's changed my life I wish all kids books were that  um hey dlll so excited to see the mystery color how do you all measure success in your lives outside of views on videos it's so deep it's so easy to just say happiness but there's so many
elements that contribute to happiness it's like it's one of those things where people um I feel like it's such an outof touch thing for people to say when they say money doesn't buy happiness cuz it's true there are lots of people with a lot of money who don't really seem very happy they seem they seem angry they seem depressed they seem uh they seem lost you know but for most people a lack of money yeah contribut significantly to unhappiness is a ton of people where money could solve the
problems that are making them unhappy yes but there are also people that money could not solve the problems that are making them unhappy but I think right now in our current economic climate there is significantly more people that money could solve the problems so I think that I think if I was to say okay there's a measure of success I would say it's to have enough not I think I think too much of bad this this is in your lives you personally oh I mean well then I'm just
going to take the cop out answers like relationships right like it's uh if I had if I had the fastest gaming PC in the world and no one to play games with what would it mean be worthless yeah for I I often oh sorry I thought you done no no go ahead I often go on two things um I don't necessarily need everyone to like me but respective peers is very important to me um and then what is my like current there there's like an overall assessment you can kind of do self satisfaction but not like in a smug
way no um and it doesn't mean that you have to be the best it just means doing your best yeah and like how am I I set out these previous goals for myself am I making previous version of me proud am i setting up future version of me for Success if these things are true I'm probably going to feel pretty good about myself doesn't have to be perfect but am I doing a good job and there's there's like little there's little things I'll try to do like if I you know I take the stairs when the next day comes if I'm
like I'm tired and I want to default to the elevator I'm like well previously I got myself over to the stairs if yesterday me was able to do it today me's got to be able to figure it out and then that motiv Ates me to get over to the stairs I don't know little   don't are you trying your best they know that there are two things that are going to set me off more than anything else it's if they lie to me and it's if they're not trying their best yeah um and kids will do kids will do that
all the time they'll they'll uh we we went skiing um a couple weekends ago and um we were going up a little Hill and I U my youngest I was like okay so do the do the skating thing cuz I saw her do it the previous weekend and she just went side to  chat because I have no problem taking off my board grabbing it and Hauling her up the hill I have no problem with that I'm I'm I'm happy I like it I'm a dad of course I like you know carrying my  right  try if she tried and she was tired or if
she tried and you know there was a problem with her binding or whatever yeah no problem soping in I'd love to help yeah but if she's going to to my face not do her best to me it's lying it's it's essentially the same thing it's not being honest to me it's not being honest to yourself it's not um it's not respectable I guess to your point um yeah fortunately she's still a little kid and uh I think she's she's getting a lot better which is you kind of got to this is the absolute best time for her
to figure that stuff out so like y yeah whatever not something to dwell on okay what why do I even read twitch chat hey what would be really cool is a very thin undershirt with long sleeves with thumb hooks so you could wear your uniform over it and gloves on your hands so when you pick up a very gross person you don't have to worry about their stuff getting on your arms but also breathable good luck this sounds like someone who's like a firefighter or or something like that
that sounds like a very specialized um piece of equipment and not the sort of thing that um we're likely to have on LTD store.com sounds cool though also good luck uh yeah okay one more pick a good one Luke I'm there's so many just like throwaway ones it's crazy uh and mine I have mine only loading 75 so that it performs super fast I went for the performance option so it's not loading all them oh I was reading one that I thought was pretty good and then it just jumped oh here's a good one Jeff
asks what do you think is the most important piece of equipment to not skimp on when getting into YouTube not including the computer also if you don't answer this does it become a write-off we'll never know um I'd say the most important thing is a microphone got him yeah he was so ready did you see how ready he was that was incredibly ready he was like so ready physically ready emotionally ready psychologically ready spiritually ready all of them every part of him was ready
he was sexually ready yeah and I am sexually ready for us to see you again next week check same bad time same bad Channel we're going to see you floaters anyone subscribe to float plane we'll see you guys on the Afterparty we're going to  bye oh my God who it almost broke it oh it looks like it's lagging and it's like oh my God that was insane that was sick I love it I can't believe how much stuff we sold at a loss it's the
