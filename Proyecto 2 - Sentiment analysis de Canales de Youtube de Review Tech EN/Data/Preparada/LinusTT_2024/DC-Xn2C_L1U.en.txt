oh man I keep watching all these PC build videos but the camera angles are so confusing where does this even go I'll help you oh no oh wow that was a close one let's do this here's how to build a PC start by clearing a tidy workspace with everything you need and Gathering the necessary tools while realistically you can build a modern computer with just a number two Philips head screw driver and maybe a number one there's a few other things I like to have in my kit some cutting implements
for opening packages boxes a pair of side Cutters for terminating zip ties a pair of needle-nose pliers for tightening the odd nut or reaching into tight spaces some cable management ties I like these reusable hook and loop style ones an anti-static wrist strap I'll show you guys how to use this later these are great so you don't end up playing baby simulator instead of PC Building Simulator the first thing I'm going to have you open up is your power supply don't worry too much about the
documentation or the accessories just yet I want you to grab the main power cord the power supply unit itself and a delicious snack in all seriousness those are not nearly as delicious as they sound now we plug this boy in and plug it into the wall then from here we've got a couple of options either we can diligently touch this anytime we're about to handle something sensitive or we can know we're just bound to be focusing on other things and put on our ESD bracelet with
the metal side in making contact with our be our skin and then attach our clip to any exposed metal on our power supply realistically paint is not a great conductor if you get given a little scratchy scratch it'll conduct ever so slightly better now obviously there are other ways to ground yourself I'm looking at them right now but if you know how these work I don't need to explain to you how to use an ESD bracelet even you Smarties might not be using the anklet hack yet though I'm a
big fan of this you just clip on and your hands are completely unencumbered  whatever let's break away baby now we're ready all we need is any reference materials that we might find useful and oh if you've got one a sponsor like I fix it it's May so it may be time to fix up your old broken gear from now until May 31st you can get 20% off select iFixit toolkits by going to the link in the video description let's start with the motherboard we're going to have all these parts linked below if you guys
want to follow along at home but don't feel press to use exactly the same stuff that's kind of the beauty of building a custom PC the basic process is the same even if the part numbers change a little bit from year to year now one thing to note is anytime you're handling a board you're going to want to handle it by the edges by big plastic pieces like this or large metal pieces like here and back here and as for where you're going to want to put it down well see I have an
ESD safe workm but you probably won't so conveniently your motherboard comes with a non- conductive platform called The Box just put it on there before we get too far ahead of ourselves though there are a couple of things we need from in here this small m.2 retention screw this IO Shield our Wi-Fi antennas and I don't know a say cable sure if you're a first-time Builder or even if you're not now is a much easier time to familiarize yourself with the layout of your motherboard the b760 DS3 haac from
gigabyte it's not a particularly high-end board but what it does have is the features we need and a very standard layout our CPU power connectors up here in the top left in its usual location our motherboard power connector is along the right hand Edge our CPU socket is right here dead center at the top with our Ram slots just to the right colorcoded for dual Channel operation our m.2 storage slots are just south of the CPU socket and between the PCI Express expansion slots and then all
of our front connectors are along the bottom edge with audio RGB USB 2 fans our front IO so that's our front power button and front lights some internal connectors for SATA those are for our hard drives and these are pretty important USB 3 and USB 3 type-c along the right hand Edge usually under the motherboard power connector the last thing is at the top there's going to be a special fan header usually called CPU that one is special because if for whatever reason your CPU fan fails the
system can be programmed to shut down safely instead of overheating now let's talk CPU I don't know quite how this happened but Intel has become a great choice for Budget gaming builds these days and the core i5 12600 KF is a fantastic choice it's got six PE cores and four poo cores that is to say six performance cores and four that don't perform quite as well it turbos to up to 4.9 GHz and jokes about them aside those weaker efficiency cores actually make it a formidable choice not just for gaming
but even for streaming and light content creation something to note though is that as an fq this is not going to allow us to use our onboard Graphics outputs and we do prefer to have those even if it's just to simplify troubleshooting but for a $30 difference in budget at this price point it's just not something that we can justify for something we'll be replacing before we ever even power on the system now it's time to get this thing installed all we've got to do is push down the arm here lift up this bad
boy right here find the little Golden Triangle that's on the corner of our CPU in this case right there then find the corresponding triangle at the corner of the socket or if you want to be even more careful not to accidentally touch these pins you can check before you lift it up line those two triangles up drop the CPU into place with no Force whatsoever if it doesn't go in it may not be keyed correctly so watch out for that give it a little wiggle to make sure it's in place lower the top cover lower the
arm and this should pop off just a little something like that hold on to this though if you ever need to RMA your motherboard back to the manufacturer they will require you to have this all right stop eating things now let's talk about another area where we saved a few bucks we went with 32 gigs of DDR 4 memory opting for this kit of g-skill rip Jaws 5 some folks might have preferred went with ddr5 but at around $80 this is a great kit for gaming today and in the near future and fit
comfortably within our approximately "$1,000 budget for installation the first" thing you're going to want to do is check where they go and oo conveniently this motherboard has a little silk screened legend that tells you but if not you can double check your motherboard manual usually you're going to use colorcoded slots and usually the slots furthest away from the CPU just peel back the tabs press down firmly until they click and you should be good to go by the way if you noticed how
three-dimensional and spatial all of that was you're probably watching on the Vision Pro with the file that we provided at lm. g/f floatplane for everyone else guess what you're also a "winner because you didn't spend $3,500" on a Vision Pro now we're going to need some storage for our operating system and hey what are you doing what year is it for the operating system yeah that's better we've gone with the crucial P3 plus is it the fastest drive on the market no does it have a dam cache which
can improve longevity and performance no but what it does have is good enough performance and a very attractive price we've got a 1 tab drive here which will be enough for our operating system our applications and maybe even a couple of games and while we recognize we could have spent more on a higher performance drive we found that a mainstream pcie Gen 4 Drive is all most people are B to notice in desktop use anyway so the only question is do we install it in the top
slot which tends to run at higher speeds and lower latency and is connected directly to the CPU or do we run it in one of the bottom slots which typically shares its Lanes with other nearby slots for us it's really not going to matter so een me money this one all we've got to do is align our little gumstick form factor drive with the slot right there push it in push it down and then retreat that little screw that we had earlier and this is where you're going to need that number one Philips head screwdriver
and screw it down a little something like this it's worth noting that many modern motherboards have unique toolless installation methods for these m.2 drives or even large shrouds or heat sinks that cover up the slots so if you find that that's the case just consult your manual for how to operate these slots and how to gain access to them when you're installing your CPU Cooler the first thing you're going to want to do is double check what socket you're using this will often be silk screened
on the motherboard in our case we can see socket 1700 but otherwise you will certainly find it in the manual or on the product page for your CPU then what we're going to do is we're going to open this up ignore absolutely everything except get out of here ah there it is we missed it this is very important because pretty much every cooler installs a little bit differently and sometimes a little differently on every single socket so we're going to want to find The Specific Instructions for Intel 1700 now
obviously your mileage may vary for this part depending on which cooler you bought but the thermal R Phantom Spirit 120 SE is a great choice at just about any budget so I'm going to show you guys how to install it starting by grabbing the back plate and flipping over your motherboard I don't generally like peeling these and actually sticking this thing down but as you can see in a previous take I already started so I guess we're down this path now so all I'm going to do is kind of Stick it to
my shirt a little bit to make sure that it's not too sticky now on older sockets the orientation mattered but on LGA 1700 it doesn't so we're just going to pop these little posts through the holes in the motherboard stick that down and we should be good to go now we put all of our fun little blue spacers in place line up our little mounting bars now for one of the most controversial steps applying thermal  that's not how I would do it that's how you do it look at the mess you made
being serious though that would have worked fine you can't really put too much thermal compound on your CPU all it does is make a mess but if you don't want to waste it then an amount more like this is more reasonable we used to say the size of an uncooked grain of rice now I would say think of whatever the trendiest most hipster rice you can think of is and how big it is when it's cooked and kind of go with that if you have a much larger CPU like a workstation size or server size CPU
either spread a thin layer across the entire shiny integrated heat spreader or check their documentation now for the most important step everything else you did was for not if you do not remove this peel remove the peel now shiny take that shiny put it on the other shiny line up the post with the screws then give her but not fully once it's caught I would strongly recommend tightening the other side until it catches and then tightening slowly in an alternating fashion you can just wrench
one side all the way down and then try and get the other side to go but it can be a little bit tricky puts a lot of strain on the motherboard too we are done well not done done I mean it's not a computer is it but done enough to deserve a nice snack now that we've enjoyed A light meal and a very heavy trip to the toilet we're ready to put these wire Clips onto our  so then we lower the fan down make sure it's even not that it really matters but it matters a lot to me and pull the
clips just like that see not going anywhere not that it would want to anyway look I brought it a little friend it's worth noting that this one is uh not going to go all the way down because it interferes with our Ram but that's okay we're still getting most of the benefit of that air flow now because modern day we need to plug in a thousand connectors JK it's not that bad all we've got to do is daisy chain together these RGB connectors you can see there's just three pins so they only go in one
way Boop then take this female end and plug it into where there is usually a header at the top of the motherboard then for these other two you've got a couple of options our cooler did include a y cable so we can just plug into that and plug both of them into our CPU fan header but our motherboard has a CPU fan and CPU opt header so we can just plug  that delicious now for cable management okay I'm just kidding a don't do that because you can actually accident accidentally end up with cables
that are stuck in your fan blades and they won't spin that's bad and B because it's not really the time for cable management now is the time to do a quick test boot here on the test platform before you assemble the whole system and cable manage everything it's a lot easier to swap a component now than it is to do it 2 hours from now and Moment of Truth we can see our power button is these two pins right  it's alive well we don't know that yet believe it or not it's normal for the
system to take quite a while to turn on in the first place especially AMD systems while they undergo a process called memory training so I'm not digging into my motherboard manual for what these diagnostic LEDs mean for probably at least a solid minute or two oh well okay well the monitor has to be on yeah that's step one boom booted great sign for bonus points we could install Windows now get all of our drivers set up make sure everything's working correctly run some stress tests but
realistically you're not that patient you're going to put the rest of the system together now that you know all the bits and pieces work you can set these aside and it's time to get back to the build and meet your case doesn't she look so beautiful just lift up the veil give her a little kiss we settled for the fantex eclipse 360a it's a great value at the the best of times and when we put together this parts list it was just $50 after rebate it comes with three 120 mm fans in the
front and even if we're not a huge fan of the configuration we' suggest moving maybe this top one to be a rear exhaust or a top exhaust there's no doubt that it'll be enough cooling for our rig personally I like to remove all my side panels and put them aside so there's no risk of them getting scratched or damaged while I'm completing the rest of the build a safe place to put them is in the box with foam separating the two pieces now it's time to track down all of your mounting accessories these will
usually be in either a bag or a box somewhere in the case or in the case packaging in fant's case pun intended it's clearly labeled in this box and nope this one does not include their little trademark organizers I guess that's only on their more premium cases good luck figuring out what all these are for JK I'm going to help but before we get to that there's one really fun step that everyone loves installing the io Shield if you have a mid-range or a high-end board it's possible that it
didn't come with one of these congratulations if you're anyone else now's a great time to find any of the little pieces that fold back like this give them a little extra fold to make sure that they don't end up stuck behind your Port then line it up with the rectangular opening at the back of the case pushing on each Corner one at a time knowing that there's a solid chance one of the other corners will pop out when you do it if you're not sure about the orientation you can just check the
back of the motherboard and make sure that the holes correspond to the ports speaking of your motherboard now's a perfect time to install it in the case but first we're going to do a quick sanity check some cases come with motherboard standoffs pre-installed in the motherboard tray in fact you can see I've got six s eight nine of them in this particular case this is really convenient but if you happen to have a mismatch between the whole layout of your motherboard and the pre-installed
standoffs in your case it can cause a standoff to correspond to a spot where there isn't a hole and scratch the traces permanently destroying your board so we've done a quick count and determined that we have both nine standoffs and nine holes we're going to orient the back of the board with the io Shield then keeping this side well clear of those metal standoffs slide it toward the back and and hopefully there we go get it to line up perfectly with our standoffs you may find this process
easier if you lay the case down but I'm making a video so I can't do that now quickly install one screw and only one for now there's a couple of quick things that we want to check first are there any metal tabs sticking into our ports preventing us from using them or Worse shorting them out causing damage to our board no good to go second have we accidentally caught anything under our board that prevents us from screwing it down ah there you can see we've got a cable that's stuck
back there if we tried to screw the board down with that back there we could accidentally cause a lot of undue stress as we tighten down the one side while this part is bulging out also since we're pushing it down the last thing we want to check is that through every single hole we can see a standoff if we pre- counted them and we know that they match then if we can see a stand off through everyone that means we have no extras that can damage our board time to start screwing but which screws do we
use this case comes with coarser threaded 632 screws and finer threaded M3 screws which ones are for the motherboard well it actually varies from case to case so there's a couple ways to check you can consult your manual or you can just trial and error it by starting with a finer threaded M3 it won't do any damage it'll just slip out if it's not the right size and you can switch over to a 632 in our case M3 is the right size so we're going to go ahead and do our other eight screws if you're having
trouble getting a screw installed because there's a cooler in the way or another obstruction honestly the best advice I can give you is not to sweat it if you've got eight of your nine screws installed that's no problem as long as you don't have any extra standoffs before we plug in our front IO let's go ahead and get one of those fans moved normally I would suggest removing the front panel usually by grabbing it firmly from the bottom but in this case um they are not screwed in from the
front they are actually screwed in from the back you can use scissors to cut these but I really don't recommend it side Cutters are much safer if you don't want to risk damaging any of the wires that they're holding it's worth noting that many modern fans will have two or even three connectors coming off of them this guy right here with four pins or three pins in these little ridges is for power this one right here is for RGB and the last one is for RGB daisy chaining so I'll show you guys how to hook this
back up once we've moved it since we're going to be using this as an exhaust now we're going to want to look for the little arrows that indicate the direction that the blades travel this one right here and the direction that the airflow goes and then I usually like to have the leads up towards this cut out at the back of the case so that I can rote it back behind the motherboard tray now just tighten these boys up you want to go hard enough that the fan is held firmly to the case without
vibrating or rattling but not so hard that you strip out the threads and they are plastic so you do need to be a little bit careful now it's time to hook our RGB back up and in order to do this correctly we need to understand a little bit of how the RGB Works in this case it has a lead that plugs into your motherboard to get an RGB signal and then it has a built-in Hub so we're going to need to power this with a SATA power adapter later but more importantly for us right now we need to have a look
at how the other devices are plugged into it and and Daisy chained together so the first link goes to our bottom fan here which then is Daisy chained into our second fan here meaning that any Multi-Device animations are going to start at the bottom front of the case and make their way to the top back if we connect it like this if we had additional fans say here and here for example we would want to make sure that we plug in this one then this one then this one otherwise things are going to
end up looking a little weird since we're back here now is a great time to Route any other cables that need to make their way to the front of the case as well so we're going to put our USB 3 over here we're going to put our power switch right around here and we're going to put our front panel audio oh is there a hole there oh yeah there is right around there hey stay in there hey hey hey stay in there back at the front here's our USB 3 connector you can see it's got a little key and a little slot
to make sure that it only goes in one way the most important thing here is just to make sure you've actually got it perfectly lined up before you press down because those little pins in the socket are extremely fragile there we go the power switch is not keyed and like the rest of these connectors for the reset switch power LED and drive activity LED is not really very fragile so we're just going to throw it on there and the reality of it is if you plug any of these in in the
wrong orientation it won't harm anything just try it the other way if your LEDs don't illuminate finally our front panel audio connector is keyed and is going to go into oh look how handy dandy labeled that is into our audio header right there Boop wow look at all that progress now let's plug in our fans usually there are headers along this Edge along this Edge and potentially at the top left and that's where they are so sure let's plug these two into the headers right here
and let's plug this one into the one up there something you may notice by the way about plugging things in in the top corner of the case here is that when you have an air cooler installed it's pretty freaking tricky so if you have a modular power supply a good Pro tip is to plug in this connector and realistically anything else before you put on your cooler otherwise hey worst case scenario you can pop off this fan take the cooler out plug everything in and then pop it right back on don't sweat it it's a
minor mistake now it's time to plug in our RGB woohoo let's just go ahead and run it over to oh no we already used it when we plugged in our cooler hm well there is another four pin RGB connector here but don't try to force it the four pin ones run at 12 volts and they will fry any of these 3 pin 5volt LEDs that you plug into them fortunately we've got a couple of options our motherboard like many modern ones has two RGB connectors so we can just run that down there or if you remember we have Daisy chains
already we could just plug this into our  here and then grab the other end of our daisy chain for our CPU RGB it's up to you just whatever you do don't bend the pins like I just did now it's time for our power supply which I realized I mentioned earlier but never really talked about we've gone with the RM 750e from Corsair it's fully modular it's quiet it's reasonably priced and perhaps most importantly it's rated Platinum from cybernetics who I trust quite a bit more than the folks at 80 plus these
days to tell me what's a good power supply we haven't done any of our own testing on this one but that'll be  if I had a case that either didn't have a filtered intake on the bottom or didn't have raised feet to make sure that it's getting a supply of fresh air and it's not going to get suffocated by my carpet then I might turn it around and have my intake at the top but that would mean that it would typically run a little bit warmer you can see that I pre-attached my cables and the ones that
I need for this build are my 24 pin connector my 8 Pin EPS connector oh where'd it go aha there it is my 8 Pin EPS or CPU power connector distinguishable from the other eight pin by the fact that it separates into two four pins rather than a six and a two so my two pcie 8 Pin power connectors and finally a SATA power connector I'm going to need that actually I'm going to need two of these but I have four now just to mix things up I'm going to be using the 632 screws that I mentioned before but didn't use
just four of these in the back of the power supply and if you have any extras hey don't worry they're delicious now to run these to where they go this one goes about here this one goes uh here this one goes where our GPU is going to end up right around and our SATA power is going to hang out down here I'll show you guys what we're going to do with that later the trickiest part of plugging in these big long connectors is just making sure you've got them oriented right so there's a little latch here there's a
little catch here those go on the same side line them up and you got to really press and make sure that you hear that click you guys hear that let's try again click if it's not  stick sure I mean sometimes they don't click same goes for our eight pin up in the corner let's go ahead and click that back together to make the installation a little bit easier and then uh yeah this will be a little bit tricky but but nothing you can't handle you dextrous folks now it's time to install
our hard drive we went with the 2 TB WD Blue from WD because it was affordable and we needed somewhere to put our games so let's go ahead and just pop these little sides out of these toolless hard drive trays then we just put this bad boy in here we're going to want these screw holes to line up with the little nubbins that we're going to close onto them anytime now buddy then we just close these up take the whole thing and give it a little shovel love into this tray down
here look at that since we're down here now is a perfectly good time to go ahead and plug in our sta power note that this is also keyed like so many other things here we are and oh I guess now's a perfectly good time to plug in our SATA data as well we have a side panel to close here so I'm going to go ahead and use this right angle connector as long as we've got enough  yeah there you go the lock goes on the top now we plug our next SATA power connector into our front panel there
there we go and we can just tuck these boys I don't know right around there now it's worth noting by the way that these trays can accommodate 2 and 1/2 in drives as well you can see they've got these little holes so you can screw in an SSD I don't really recommend buying SATA ssds anymore though now that the prices are so similar to nvme ssds and the performance is decidedly last gen but hey if you're bringing over an old drive you can either install them on these sleds or because they have no
moving parts and it doesn't matter you can hu them on these you can just pile them up in the bottom of your case like I've seen so many people do you just kind of you do you do you you do whatever works for you now let's take the other end of the Sata cable thread it through here wow that's an amazing noise here we go turn this around and plug it into our right angle SATA connector here at the front of the case this motherboard will support up to four drives not bad now look at that
we're just about done all we got to do is a little bit of cable management you don't have to do a lot I won't judge you but think of yourself like a PC Building detective you want to be able to at least close the case you know now for the big moment unboxing our GPU we went with the radon 6800 is it the most modern thing no it's actually last gen but it's a great value which has been kind of a theme for this build and compared to the 7700 it yeah consumes a little bit more
power but performs similarly and is less expensive and compared to similarly priced offerings from Team Green like the RTX 4060 series it has 16 gigs of video memory which should make it hopefully a good performer for quite a few years to come come before we can install it though we need to prep our case for the surgery let's go ahead and loosen our PCI slot cover holder thing not every case is going to have one of these but every case will have these screws at the back so let's just figure
out which slot we're going to be using it's going to be this one so we're going to take out these two screws to accommodate uhhuh the double slot IO plate with that out of the way now is a great time to take a closer look at our GPU and talk through some of the choices that we made earlier you saw us pop off this pcie slot cover earlier damn it well whatever I don't need that so if you didn't test on the bench now is a good time to take that off as well as any display ports that you're planning
to use be they HDMI or display port now there's two other things remember when I said that the fan that we wanted to take away was this one in the top the reason for that is that our GPU uses a three  here so we want to be bringing that fresh air from those bottom fans and blowing it right across our GPU the other decision that we made earlier was to use our old school 8 Pin pcie power connectors that's because this car does not use the new 12volt high power connector it uses dual 8 Pin pcie power
connectors now we can go ahead and get this installed all we got to do is line  slot watch out for this okay make sure that these are inside the case and not  motherboard push down firmly you should feel a little bit of resistance and then if you want to make sure that it's in you can just see if this lock at the back of the PCI slot here is engaged mine is and it's not going anywhere now all we got to do is find those power connectors that I just showed you hope that we didn't oh no get
them mashed under the GPU there we go and then just like we did on our motherboard connectors check for where the clip is check for where the holder for the clip is make sure we didn't cable manage them too tight and plug them in it's worth noting by the way that some folks recommend using two separate cables rather than a daisy chain style connector like this one if you've got a GPU that requires two plugs they're not wrong that is better but the actual risk of anything going wrong by
using one of these is pretty much negligible and this isn't a particularly High draw GPU in the first place so I am taking a calculated non-risk here now it's time to screw our GPU back in these are often thumb screws but I strongly recommend using a screwdriver to install them anyway because it can be really tricky to get these holes aligned just right and have your thumbs in there like that so just yeah do yourself a favor use a magnetic screwdriver if you can I also like to lift the GPU up a little
bit while I'm installing it cuz you know it's going to Sag a bit anyway and I like to see it level that's also one of the reasons that I like having the power connectors come from the top and then I'll tension them quite tight to take a little bit of the strain off if I don't happen to have a GPU support of course if you have a 3D printer or know someone who has one there are like a bazillion GPU supports that you can print out and is that it let's get her buttoned  oh good job you did it treat yourself to 
and she still works fantastic not only that but wow great job your RGB lighting looks amazing now if you don't mind I'm just going to excuse myself to the washroom I think I might have bruised my head  earlier oh no if I can't get these off I'll never be sponsored Again by someone like like iFix it say goodbye to your dollar store use one and it braks tools iFixit has tool kits that are meticulously assembled to give you the proper instruments for your repairing and tear down needs best of all from now
