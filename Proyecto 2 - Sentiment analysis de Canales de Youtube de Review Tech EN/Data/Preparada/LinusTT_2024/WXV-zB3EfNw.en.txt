have you ever gone down to make a comment on a video and thought Oh my God there's already so many who is ever going to read this the answer is me believe it or not I spend hours every week reading your comments everything from constructive feedback to Positive Vibes about your new favorite LT member to yes even really mean personal attacks some of which have gotten pretty creative by the way which is why it's time for another round of lonus reads mean comments but it's not all me this
year you name host we found a roast and we'll be getting reactions from the others as well so buckle up and put on your protective eyewear because this is going to hurt a little a lot what won't hurt is telling you about our sponsor lifein look none of us actually enjoy going to the dentist so why don't you keep those visits to the bare minimum by taking care of your teeth with the life end wave click the link below or keep watching to learn more all you got to do is read those you make it sound so easy
delusional lonus thinks killing babies should be a constitutional right what a father the earrings and socks with  makes wow you really aren't pulling any punches hey not this time swipe for more damn looking back Jake has really let himself go Jesus I actually lost weight I've lost 70 lbs in a year damn you Gio that's wrong damn Dennis's Canadian accent is actually getting really good really what's the Canadian accent I don't think people will agree with you oh yeah but just give her can I get my
double double I don't know why but I just can't believe anything plof tells me I think he's testing me wanting to see if he can make me buy things I regret I'm not testing you I just I don't know that's that's a weird one I don't even know how to respond to that thought these were going to be mean who decided to name their girlchild but it's my last name I didn't have a choice my parents didn't have a choice and also I kind of like my last name so you a blonde guy with a ginger beard
that's a bold Choice it's a bolder choice to assume I'm blonde I've never been blonde my hair not blonde my hair's not even red it's it's like decidedly Brown most of the time James and Riley it's not how you spell it talking about each other looks is ironic since they are perfect examples of how the genetic pool in Canada seems more like a genetic puddle what does that mean I mean Riley and I look very different from each other so I don't know what to say I think that
means there's a lot of genetic diversity here it's not like it's Iceland where we need an app to know who's related or not I feel like if you're writing a comment to criticize James and I commenting on each other's looks uh you know that's fair enough that's not something you should do and even less so should you comment on the genetic puddle of Canada which is objectively not shallow okay all right moving on this comment just says Dennis does he think I am Dennis is just cuz we're both uh minorities here
at lmg he's like oh well that must be Dennis uh cuz we don't look alike at all he's not even in that video he is not in that video it's me unboxing a phone and talking about a XI phone who would say something mean about Den exactly but I can also understand people who don't know me and can maybe can find me a little bit different absolutely so this   one it's fine Colin I'll read them for you says lonus is Skipper Jake is Kowalski Elijah is private and Colin is Rico the The Penguins of
Madagascar it's it's a it's a movie okay what a Menace is James capable of reading instructions at all hey I remember this one that was not my fault yes I actually usually on any kind of build project I'm the person who wants to read the instructions but for you people at home sometimes it's more fun if we don't plof man I'm sorry just can't stand this guy that's okay I'm like a combination of Alex Riley and James yes that is a compl with a e and not a i what does that mean
you're just a white dude like I'm also just confused about why you're volunteering this information hey everybody I'm like a combination of Alex Riley and James what does that mean he's like a like a tall engineering funny goodlook guy describing tinan dang damn lonus got hot I love Linus's final form more tinan please the amount of thirst in some of the comments boggles my mind sometimes maybe it's just me I don't know thank you wow okay this just says car guy but car is in
quotations what the angel who hurt you what are you a Honda guy Jesus hey hey hey Shut Your B lonus hired Badger from Breaking Bad I've never seen Breaking Bad who's Badger it tell me I look like this guy who is this the only clear thing is Alex it's not the most skilled guy if you're going to try and roast me like that at least get youring grammar correct Jake and Riley team awkward that I agree with actually this video the eBay refurbished one that is every day with Riley and I just out trying to out
awkward each other you you beta let's go see I just did it it I'm glad our awkwardness was able to shine through whatever sponsor talking points that video had was your opinions on the buying games in parts or as a whole were total dog you're cracked out of your gourd on meth you should not be that out of touch with the value of $80 okay one moment for a second here we'll slow down Linka I'm talking about a thing that is already happening look at Final Fantasy 7 remaster this ain't hypothetical jeez
I didn't buy it I waited I'm not out of touch with the value it's a lot of money ploof just loves anything that is a pointless gimmick doesn't he I kind of do that's like 100% true if it's a weird gimmick and makes something unique I'm all for it real fans remember the LTT 8K fireplace video where James pancks halfway through because a burning log fell on the rug that they borrowed and no one noticed for like 20 minutes and that was n't just a rug that was a beaver pelt that was very nice and
luxurious that my father-in-law lent me for the shoot and I was pretty horrified when I took that log off there's just like a perfect charred rectangle in it like basically ruined it it combed out a bit but honestly what a bless him he either wasn't that mad or really contained it cuz I I panicked a little more than seemed necessary in the end oh wow all caps would you I think I have to yell it would you please stop putting Riley in every sponsor read you know he's on the list right can't say which 
removed by He Who Shall Not Be Named Santa he's he's making a list imagine being a ginger and thinking I want more of this just to be extra virgin you know people pay more for the extra virgin olive oil right you didn't get sted eight for hiring mental handicapped are you talking about lonus or me Colin must be either Dutch or Belgian and if his English isn't as good he's  Belgian hell two times ads get real youing greedy potato okay for one thing we've done two sponsor reads in our videos for 9 years
years if you are just noticing now you might be the kind of person who comments before finishing the video she laughs a lot but I get the impression she is an absolutely formidable human is this a compliment um thank you I've heard laughing makes you a happier person and makes you live longer so I'll probably live longer than you average Discord mod I don't can I know what video this is from no I I did like I was the admin of our Discord for a very long time so I guess I feel like tinan had an
interesting and unique childhood compared to the rest of us you're probably not that wrong but also a little bit wrong very disappointed ploof should not be reviewing keyboards wow that's actually okay that's that one's kind of rough you know I own a lot of keyboards I've built a lot of keyboards there's not a lot of things that I'm like yeah I know what I'm talking about keyboards are kind of one of them so I thought Elijah was some annoying Autistic or add kid in the last tech
upgrade video I had no idea he worked for LTD yeah it was just Alex's little buddy or whatever I don't know if I can watch Alex destroy perfectly fine Hardware anymore and uh that one really hurt me too that was a difficult video for the most part I really like making things that are like they split janky and it's kind of a good idea and that one after lus separated the Heat types by doing what me and Nate said he shouldn't was just so bad oh my God it was awful I can't believe it worked at all Sarah has
done hot knives before you can just tell um no comment disliking every video you have Riley in we all know why Mr 500 ft you're a liar I we don't all know why I wish I did okay this person is definitely uh I feel like heing hates Tanner LMAO I feel like that a little bit sometimes too I'm just testing him Colin is the single person on this channel who has had more character development with each video all without even saying a word I feel like James and Titan either really get along or really don't we hate
each other we for the most part get along pretty well cringe anti- lovers creating the titles these days huh yeah there a nice one nobody more deserves Electro boom has done so much thanks LT not true I'm just pointing out how out of touch LT are by giving upgrades to rich people or staff or the host wife instead of regular poor people Rog rig reboot anyone jeez I love you guys it's Seb Dennis he's a why what do I do to you why are you so angry seriously the only person on this
channel who deserves any hate any at all is Jake he can be pretty annoying but at least he tries this is so mean like what did I do to hurt you there's definitely reasons you could hate me but I feel like some of those reasons probably apply to other people right please for the love of God get that bomb CX500 out of that induction Forge you picked the one PSU that is known to literally explode on the bright side if that power supply explodes that's the least damaging thing
in the induction heater to actually blow up oh my God Jake is like Nolan from donut media dipped in a vat of bleach mentally abusive to his wife what video is this on we can make jokes if this was not presented by the unlikable douch I really could have enjoyed this well I'm just very complimented that you didn't say an unlikable douche on I am the unlikable douche and I really want that on a shirt now Nick please see now this this comment threw me for a loop because the
first part says who likes Riley and then the second part says what a dork so I didn't like how much of a ride that comment was putting helmets on people who are not truly handicapped is not funny that wasn't the point we weren't making a handicap joke it was just I hit my head it was protecting  what is that from you're not going to give me any context I mean shizzy wizzy didn't bother to leave a timestamp she's fun I like her I hope she goes far in life are these supposed
to be mean comments I'm confused this is so sweet thank you ploof is like sliced bread gets boring and stale man and this is where I'm wearing my nice shirt too with the pink hat and everything I'm I'm not boring Andy am I boring  flavor Sarah is such a fun host Dennis in contrast is really cringe most of the time and always looks like he's trying to appear dumb Dennis is an amazing human being and this person is just wrong I'm pretty sure in this video I was pretty useful I was building the
desk everything I wasn't trying to be anything I'm just doing my job trying to build a desk Tanner if you're reading this I am you got to lose that Homeless leprechaun beard look I work at a place where 90% of the people here look so much like me that we could all be mistaken for one another in a police lineup how old is she 10 most brainless review ever giggling nonsensical and and then that's where the comment is cut off yeah this was my first short circuit ever I was really
nervous I agree not a great review but uh I think I've improved quite a bit so how much do you receive from comma the government to keep Elijah hired this line is getting payments from the government for me lots I can't trust plof on anything purely based on how he pronounces GIF yeah you know what I don't care I don't care if it's GIF I know it's graphical you know what the guy who invented it says it's pronounced GIF so suck on that Jake's mouth has eyebrows my mouth has oh the
mustache oh it's because I it's a little bit not filled out here yeah okay you too oh are you good good for you you rich F I wasn't born into money you know I actually still work a 9 to5 you know sorry what is it what is even the context here oh is it I'm keeping the world's biggest TV yes probably was on that look did you click the title wow new low for lmg no helmet for James unbelievable you're right I should have worn a helmet there's no excuse to not wear a helmet I've been in a biking
accident and hit a car like a freaking Dart and I was very happy to have a helmet on I believe in helmets everyone should wear a helmet a that's yeah look see the hell of paid off right there no need to yell at me Riley there is actually you know what you did why was Riley's n segue so loud because I need to get your attention you know what you did too all of you I like red Sherk guy he isn't an awkward idiot like Alex now at first I thought this was referring to Jake and I took a bit of offense but
then I saw that the red trick guy is Dan and we all like Dan fair enough dude unusually wide hips says is a man no wonder people thought you were a lesbian that is my physiology sir I will not apologize for my body I show my wife the takech makeover with Dennis's neon sign and now she only refers to him as oh my God it's live La thank you for grapefruits Zulu wife I love you too I am surprised floof has  car okay the funny thing is I actually I love sticker bombing stuff I hate
bumper stickers I can't stand it cars I like them clean I don't know it's weird Alex is too awkward to be in front of camera I've told you before listen up idiots this is from the asml tour which I frankly think is a fantastic video and if you think that it is not a good video you are an idiot cuz you did not understand what I was talking about you shouldn't call your mom aing idiot even if she is okay what she did was idiotic she's not an idiot if anything I get any intelligence that I got from her
why does Tanner look like he's held hostage because I am in a constant state of discomfort I'm uncomfortable right now then's going to have a blast once he gets to take this home actually I don't have the space for this massage chair I have it and Andy got it from a Christmas um PRI from Christmas price I live in a small apartment so I'm okay Andy enjoyed it it's pretty comfy lonus your daughter seems a lot more sensible than you well she's half ion so that explains a lot
Tanner looks so scared when you asked him to celebrate better lol I'm really not good at faking emotion I'm barely good at showing genuine emotion my God that cat is an absolute unit Arlo is the most amazing magnificent creature in this entire world and uh I'm glad he gets the appreciation that he deserves you're becoming a spoiled little brat it says 2 days ago so this must have been a recent video like we're definitely spoiled that's just kind of the nature of working for a tech Media company but
at the same time it's it's it's not so much spoiled it's like you just get desensitized to how insane some of the technology we're using really is especially to people that haven't played with some of this stuff so I mean fair I don't think I'm a brat though I bet pl's keyboard is worth more than his car they're actually not too far off imagine having lonus as your boss unsufferable the word you're looking for is insufferable I would rather go without "$5,000 rather than have lonus in my"
house all day well that's good cuz I don't want to give you "$5,000 Sarah was brought in to ensure" that Dennis could complete the video um I kind of don't remember what exactly going on with this desk I remember it was lot of work but Sarah did help a lot like 20% thanks Dennis oh my gosh she here oh no at least lonus hires mentally handicap people very Progressive of lonus I don't think I could take much more than 20 minutes of this guy if you think that you're probably right any
Tanner on camera is too much Tanner on camera you know what I completely agree with you and that's why I am very glad that Full House and Al are both off the air too many Tanners on screen it's way too many he was talking about me wasn't he I mean obviously it's going to fall "short of the 5,500 lb of German" engineering I drive today for the last remaining three people that didn't think lonus was a douche Elijah can you come here for a second I'm detecting some confirmation
bias here did you just search for the word douche I searched keywords and then looked for comments that was douche one of douche may have been one of the keywords all right that's thanks you're welcome talk to you later oh this one's just straight up Riley is a bad host okay you try pl's monitors are worth more than his car this is 100% true aliena I have the aw 3423 DW my name is plof and I have an aw 3423 DW at home dumb YouTuber stop spreading false lies wait what are you talking about this was about the
potential malware in those cheap Android that's not a lie I'm damned if I do I'm damned if I don't don't okay you know what fine here's a new version of that video go buy whatever cheap pirate software Android box you want there's no way that it'll be full of any spyware or malware enjoy every time I hear Riley my cringe meter blows up do you need a cring meter like you don't you can't tell if something's cringe just on your own still not convinced after all this time that Tanner isn't Mike Meers
undercover or a pentaverate agent when I was a teenager I used to get the comment that I look like Mike Myers very frequently so I thought you know what I'm going to grow my hair out people won't say I look like Mike Myers then they continued to do so so I grew out a grotesque beard maybe this will make me not look like Mike Myers and there is nothing I can do to make myself not look like Mike Myers hate Linus's bad boss attitude we were unboxing his CPU is this just cuz I wouldn't buy two of them for
Jake sorry this video inspired me to shout penis at Dennis at LTX he got his attention what did you do that I mean if someone shout penis in public you probably will look back tinan is the epitome of smart enough to know better stupid enough to do it anyway yeah I think I might need to make that my tagline why hasn't James being fired yet because I can write is Elijah single cuz I'd like him as my upgrade what the does that even mean uh I promise you you don't have to "pay me $5,000 I'd do it for a lot"
cheaper lonus I got to tell you what are you doing employing that idiot Alex man he brings you a dow G whenever like lonus or anyone that is hosting a video says things that are smart it's not just because they are smart even though lonus is a smart dude but also because someone has spent weeks preparing the things that he is saying holy sh wow this is a long one LTT please read I would fire Jake Jake is a useless tool he takes advantage of linus' good nature I don't know if it is scripted like he's
supposed to be the village idiot and he's just hired to piss off lus in each take either way it's annoying frustrating and I've worked with people exactly like Jake they typically accomplish about 25% of what you ask them sorry Jake I I don't do anything at all during the day I mostly just watch memes on my computer lonus isn't watching this right I think Dennis should do keyboard reviews plof is too much of a keyboard snob that's not fair you know you can like something that's
really good like I can like fine dining my dad's a chef I love to eat nice but I also go to McDonald's sometimes there's nothing wrong with that lol $100 for a screwdriver is worth it in whose World cost you5 to $10 to make and your markup is ridiculous okay first things first the screwdriver costs way more than $59 you know how I know go buy one for $5 to $10  wait find one does it have a ratchet does it have high quality bits was it tested by project farm and found to be
freaking awesome yeah I didn't think so the are you lonus and james' son I kind of see it but generic white guy with a beard ISM much it's good to see that nowadays it seems that so many writers are actually prepared and seem to have all this stuff together before shooting a video but sometimes I do wish Riley would make another PC Building vid with everything going wrong you know great fun to dot dot dot read more the first comment is Riley is literally their worst host
LOL this is just just this is just low effort like get creative you know if any employees steals you need to fire them why should we support a business who lets employees steal why support thieves I agree this is a totally reasonable sentiment you shouldn't steal I just do it anyways shame video preview wasn't just picking a lot of Alex the video was full of that annoying unfunny tool Space full stop such a shame Space full stop Riley with his worst jokes is more entertaining Space full stop my
opinion don't like I don't care not everyone can be pleased with everyone Space full stop dude it's a video about a fan that can actually chop your hand off I greatly enjoyed watching lonus torture spf's little brother throughout this episode this is from that one Reddit post where someone said oh my gosh Sam bankman freed works at LT because I had my Afro I'm not Sam bankman okay he went to jail I got out oh this this is the best way to get a tax right off can turn anything into a
tax rate off does labs exist solely as a tax right that is not how that works a tax rateof doesn't mean you didn't spend the money if I get someone give me money I give me a money I'm going to give you guys a little lesson this is a crisp fake Benjamin if I have paid all my other business expenses and I make this money I take it home or well at least after the uh tax man takes his pretty close to 50% cut okay I made 50 bucks that's great hold on a second I have a business expense this time I need to buy a
filming slate I'm going to spend that money that $50 is gone but I've got this slate and I've still got 50 bucks that's my profit oh wait I still pay taxes on the part that was profit the only money that didn't get taxed was the money that I spent on an asset that the business a separate legal entity now owns it's not a way of making moreing money and now I need another slate dang it that's okay I'll just visualize a new one virtual Sate ah much better now it's time to visualize a segue to our sponsor
