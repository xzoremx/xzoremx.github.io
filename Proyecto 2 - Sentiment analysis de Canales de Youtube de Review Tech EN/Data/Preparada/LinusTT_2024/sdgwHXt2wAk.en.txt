months ago I told you guys that I was in love with the new 360 HZ OLED gaming monitors I swear guys I cannot click heads like that and yet there it is but as you can see I never pulled the trigger well Asus found out and sponsored this video with something even better an OLED monitor with a 480 HZ refresh rate like the other 480 HZ monitor that we looked at a few months ago this thing should have absolutely wild image Clarity thanks to its near instant pixel respon times but unlike
that display we're not limited to 1080p if we want to go fast that's right guys the Rog Swift OLED pg27 aqp is a true endgame Esports display 27 in 1440p and zero compromises if I want to pop some heads but first we got to get this old monitor out of here look speed ke oh my God I I thought you were going to be Tails they didn't have any Tails costumes so I instead the greatest scientific genius in the world all right well it's too late to fix this now it's de and jam time let's do it to it well
when you say it that way it's   fast are you ready to get rid of this old monitor to be clear this is a really nice display yeah 1440p Ultra wide 240 HZ but nothing has ever made me feel like a gaming God the way those 360 HZ displays did and I want to try it at home so yep sorry Flex it's time for you to wait do do the trick one more time do the trick one more time before you put it away you got to flatten it for the Box oh yeah it feels so so wrong every time and then even going back yeah I
know where you putting it I don't even know where you're taking it I don't know I back to the office I guess to be clear everything we're seeing here is something we've seen before 500 HZ monitors exist OLED monitors exist and 1440p monitors exist we've just never seen all of those things in the same place so unlike the previous High refresh rate King we're not compromising on image quality with Inky blacks and support for HDR and unlike the last 480 HZ OLED we looked at this one isn't
limited to about 70 pixels per inch when we're running in high refresh rate mode instead it's closer to 110 which will be a noticeable difference in image sharpness it uses a w OLED panel from LG with micr lens array plus technology which they claim offers 20% wider viewing angles than before and clearer text with less color fringing thanks to clear pixel Edge and they've got a custom heat sink to help reduce the risk of burning and it comes with a three-year warranty they didn't mention
this but I will because it's not using a CU OED you also don't get that purple Hue that uh he has to put up with it's fine you never see it when the lights are off it doesn't matter he's actually not wrong I'm just I love teasing now as I go through and swap out my magnetic Cable Management LTT store.com there is a small elephant in the room without DSC or display stream compression 1440p 480 HZ is about 70 GB per second meanwhile the cables in my wall are display port
1.4 which is limited to 32 GB per second that's not exactly close so what do we do about that an obvious answer might be to use HDMI 2.1 except for two small problems that's also not enough bandwidth only 48 GB per second and I don't have any HDMI 2.1 cables embedded in my walls I could look into swapping out the display port cables in my walls DP 2.1 uh2 would support this refresh rate and resolution natively except that there are no gaming gpus on the market today that support the standard and and
even some upcoming ones are rumored to fall short that means that regardless of how we feel about compression we are stuck with DSC for those of you who are familiar this will be a review but for everyone else DSC is a Vasa made video compression algorithm that is supposedly visually lossless that compresses each frame to save on bandwidth but what visually lossless means is that when they conducted trials observers couldn't tell the difference between the full fat reference image and the the compressed
one more than 75% of the time I worry that I might be in that 25% especially for some of the higher compression ratios if you ever want to learn more about which interfaces support which resolutions and refresh rate by the way glenwing on the LTT Forum posted a great calculator years ago that you can use as a reference all right let's see how this goes man that looks good another Factor we haven't talked about yet plof is that when you're at the very edges of the maximum distances supported by these
standards even if it should theoretically work it might not I have fiber to the wall plate and then I have wall plate to the Monitor and it's been borderline sometimes oh yeah I might have to go get one of those little brush pass through wall plates and use that instead okay I just don't like them cuz they're ugly it's only running at 60 HZ right now so that's not encouraging it's just as the stone tablets predicted also uh sometimes this does look a bit bad like but yeah that banding is awful
uh-oh this is trouble 60 HZ I mean it's going to try to do 480 it's available in the drop down keep changes it's doing it oh she's definitely doing it the banding though does it change the DSC mode like can you can you control that DC support yep there's a toggle so we can see if that banding is caused by DSC or not the answer is it did not can you still go to 480 what's it capping out at now oh no way cuz you disabled the SC right 240 yeah okay okay so it's probably a pretty
high compression ratio considering this is display port and we're getting what 32 gigs uh gigabit per second yeah HDMI 2.1 really might be worth it cuz it goes up to 48 gbit per second I do technically have an HDMI 2.1 cable that we could fish through the wall let's see if you can even play any games okay at 480 frames per second all right let's try a game dude it is amazing how responsive a system feels when you've got this kind of refresh rate this kind of latency it's freaking crazy look I'm
not taking responsibility for that I had a shotgun yeah get them while he turned around nice I'm sure it could be a little bit on the brighter side but when we're looking at the latency numbers guys this is I hesitate to use the p word but good  perfect oh that was close me no that wasn't that close damn it damn it I hit him four times bloody hell oh my God where'd that even come from behind  oh this is why it takes so long for us to film videos that was fun but it's time to acknowledge the uncomfortable
truth of buying a monitor like this you're probably going to need a new pc as well now back when I saw the pricing of nvidia's 40 series I vowed to not upgrade to them to send a message that I felt that this generation was a skip but I never vowed to not use them in our videos so let's throw a 4090 rig at this thing and see what the gaming experience is like this will also be an opportunity to try out HDMI 2.1 and see if that makes a visual difference although based on what I've seen so far I'm kind of
doubting it I mean this is a completely different wallpaper so we're obviously not able to look for you know bending the same way we were before but what we can do is fire up Counter Strike here we go let's see what a 4090 and a 7800 x3d can do good Lord is that smooth ultimate power now you're speaking my language dude I have no excuses the motion Clarity is so good look at this I know that's wild this is crazy yeah yeah let's go buddy oh man she's so she's so smooth smooth buddy
yeah it's just instant yeah like you you 180 and it's just clear instantly dude it's like looking through a window yeah I know we've said that so many times before but this time no there's there's levels there's levels of perfection you know oh you know what no let's give him a let's give him a sporting chance that's he's had enough time yeah he's had enough time nice okay let's go equipment won't make you a better gamer but it sure as hell doesn't hurt that's let's go shoot
shoot enough of this though let's try a game where I might actually be able to do some damage let's play some Halo infinite I have not played like at all lately an error occurred while searching for players please try again the error is that nobody plays Halo infinite I was just going to say they're out of players whatever I like the game this looks freaking awesome I don't even have hdr on and this looks awesome look at my   buddy can't miss heads brother dude I love this Monitor and I
think I'll just game on this now seriously okay well it can't do anything about your game sucking but it has support for all the various syncs uh g-sync freyn premium I not sure how much of a difference those are going to make at these kinds of frame rates assuming that you you got a suitably equipped PC that accompanies it I do kind of want to try one more round here running it like medium details instead of Max that was  good it's not that much better for animation smoothness or latency even
compared to 240 HZ or even 120 it's just it's like the connection to the machine it just feels tighter everything about it you're not going to benefit from it in every game uh Sonic Frontiers for example of all things does not support higher than 60 FPS is this supposed to  okay flipping back over to my computer I really don't know if I'm going to be able to make the same commitment for 50 Series even if it's expensive I might go for it but that doesn't mean every game
is going to benefit from a high refresh rate monitor and a really nice GPU uh this is actually probably the game I've put the most hours into over the last couple of years and it really doesn't need more than about 40 50 FPS and I kind of missed the bigger Ultra wide display but hey it's always going to be horses for courses and lately I've been playing more FPS games and I think I want to switch to this for a while thanks Asus for sponsoring this video if you want to check out this
monitor we're going to have it linked down below and if you guys enjoyed this video maybe go check out uh oh our first reaction to high refresh rate ol gaming it really is that good then and it's that good now oh I can't stop
