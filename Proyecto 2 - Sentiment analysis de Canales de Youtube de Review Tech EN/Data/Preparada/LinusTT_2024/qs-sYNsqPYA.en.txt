what's up everyone and welcome to the W show we've got a great show lined up for you guys today yeah Linux it's got problems like no support for HDMI 2.1 but we know who to blame and it isn't the open-source community and actually it's not it's not AMD either in spite of the fact that it's their Ron cards that are having these problems they tried hard actually we know who to blame also Nintendo sud Yuzu makers of the emulator Yuzu this week we'll be checking a little bit about that be checking sure
I'm rolling with it what else we got today Lenovo launches repairable laptops cool very cool yeah also research reveals Vision Pros material cost and some people are super mad and some people are super happy and reactions are all over the place cuz I think people just really don't understand business yeah no oh 100% yeah yeah they really don't no no I don't even yet I think I get it more than most reactions to it it's all relative yeah Einstein's theory of business relativity are we where's the butt E
equals a lot of people are kind of dumb  squared  the show is brought to you today by manscaped The Ridge and symbolic software before people lose their minds oh my let's talk about the title of today's video the HDMI Forum the organization responsible for development of the HDMI specification has rejected amd's request to add HDMI 2.1 plus support to its open-source Linux graphics driver that's right folks for the last 3 years gnu/linux users with AMD gpus have not had support for 4K at
120 htz through HDMI 2.1 because the HDMI Forum restricted public access to its specifications in 2021 so only licensed manufacturers that pay both Annual fees and royalties are allowed to have access to the newest specifications now AMD right clearly a licensed manufacturer had their legal team and Linux Engineers work for months to devise a way to implement HDMI 2.1 plus support in their open- Source driver without exposing the now private specs very honorable but The Forum still
denied amd's request to open source for the open source driver support very dishonorable um really very annoying actually super annoying can HDMI off already oh I wish to be clear there are things that I like about it there are things that are very good about HDMI but I feel like they're kind of resting on the most important thing about HDMI which is its ubiquity at this point rather than recog extremely recognizable name rather than making HDMI just better to use like
remember why we create standards for the users no that's not why we do it at all is it that can't be why we create standards to unify the current existing pool of too many standards we make one more standard that's better than all the rest of the standards and then if we have the best standard we make money yeah so uh there's a note from Jacob here Intel's Arc A700 cards get around this problem because Intel and some of their aibs add a protocol converter chip to the card to translate display port
signals from the GPU into HDMI 2.1 signals which is insane shouldn't be necessary yeah it's crazy and you're paying for that and you are paying for that it adds it adds cost to the board because okay this is an assumption I would assume every HDMI output on that board would have to have one of those as opposed to even if there only had to be one you're still paying for it would be a higher complexity one that's for sure yeah definitely definitely um the the only thing that's frustrating about this
is that I often like HDMI just cuz I find it easier some display port plug like they're actually really annoying to plug unplug mostly but plug in as well kind of a pain in the butt the the the clamp connector thing doesn't really seem great you can get ones that don't have the lock on it they just kind of click in and then if you pull them hard enough they come out uh Dell's been shipping those by default with their monitors for quite a lot of years now okay um but my
biggest issue with display port is that sometimes it's Auto hand shaking can be a little shaky that too uh as you'll you'll have a system that is on you will plug you you'll go from HTMI you'll unplug HTMI you'll plug in display port and it'll be like huh I don't even think it says huh it just does nothing display stays black you plug the HMI back in it works um and you reboot the thing and the display port works like it can just be a it can have it can struggle a little sometimes
I find display port also has significantly more issues with the like monitor randomly goes black problem mhm um which is super annoying very annoying to diagnose yep so our discussion question here are why do you think the Forum made this decision I mean I think we could kind of come up with some good reasons for it you know we could say well they want to maintain consistency in that experience and in order to do that you have to have you have to have everyone who's implementing the standard contributing
monetarily to the standard to ensure that they can continue to develop the standard I mean look look I'm I'm making a devil's advocate argument and it's not stupid one they are AMD licensed manufacturer they are though they are a licensed manufacturer sure but what they are effectively potentially opening up the pathway to is the potential for someone to implement the standard by kind of reverse engineering it from this open- Source implementation yeah reverse engineering is specifically the thing I
was going to Le that's the thing that they're afraid of but then I'm sitting here going okay but then you know AMD and Linux developers went and they put a bunch of work they put a bunch of time into keeping the proprietary elements of the HDMI implementation separate from the open- source part of that driver but then okay hold on a second let's say you are you're Luke oh okay big assumption yeah you um you're kind of you know the Project Lead of like an online video platform let's let's call
it for sake for the sake of argument float plane it's I know it's stupid name yeah weird name makes no sense yeah but but let's let's yeah it doesn't matter the point is we'll just we'll call it that don't worry about it um someday you'll have a budget for a marketing department and they'll figure out a new one I don't know about that probably never yeah the point is that you're this guy okay and someone comes to you and they say hey um you're DRM okay for that that prevents non-paying customers from
using your thing uh we found a way for people to use your thing on this like unsupported device by kind of um integrating your DRM in a way that like we've done that makes it so that you know they can't reverse engineer your DRM but but but you told us how it worked and so we kind of we kind of put it in there and the rest of it open source but that's like really separate um cool right maybe maybe probably a lot of work for you to go in and figure out if you did it right yeah and yeah so I understand the
perspective but I am not happy about it and as generally someone who is supportive of things working as well as they can someone bought your product yeah I was going to say I I don't the comparison I think was was pretty good but it wasn't perfect it wasn't perfect especially because these people already were able to use HDMI up until this spec so it's it's it's more that it was taken away kind of and so there's a new purchase involved in this scenario I think for me if if the if the HDMI
implementers Forum if the HDMI Forum sorry I can't even remember all the names of these forums um if the HDMI Forum wanted to reach out to our inbox and say okay look here was the problem you know we had all of these devices that had this like reverse engineered HDMI 2.0 um and they weren't paying royalties and it was turning out that the implementation wasn't very good it wasn't up to standard and we were getting a lot of complaints like if they can if you can provide me with some kind
of documentation that demonstrates that this was necessary that it was necessary to close this off because people weren't paying their fair share and it was somehow harming the development of the standard and harming the user then you know all right I I would at least be willing to hear that argument but I'm having a really hard time right now knowing that HDMI is already one of the most expensive Port standards to implement in fact I'm not aware of one that costs more maybe maybe something from Apple
maybe maybe Apple's licensing for mag safe or lightning would be higher than HDMI I've heard lightning is pretty rough legitimately not sure I don't know exactly what they are for either of them I know that hdmis is quite a burden on device manufacturers um and I know that that is compared to things like USB um things like um category uh I don't I don't know what to call it whatever fits into an RJ45 Port all right if I call it ethernet people get mad because ethernet and you could run
over any physical I need I know but if I say ethernet do you know what I'm talking about okay uh the point is that on on a PC or on a piece of Home Theater equipment or something like that I can't what toss link like I can't think of any other interface that has the same kind of um same kind of costs associated with it so you're already charging a lot you're already reaping enormous enormous revenues from the implementations of your standard so can you just calm the down
no we must be chaos I don't want peace I  [Applause] problems there's the whole vote with your wallet question um but in in the discussion questions it says in a tweet about the forum's decision Wendell hi Wendell Wendell's great uh from Level One tech said to vote with your wallets um how can consumers avoid supporting the HDMI form when they are essentially paying for HDMI license fees whenever they buy a device that has an HDMI port uh I would say that um they're probably
also paying for uh HDMI licensing fees whenever you buy a cable you're you're you're paying HDMI um not necessarily may it I may it depends so we have looked into cables okay while we haven't looked into Port implementations we have looked into cable implementations cuz as you may or may not know in the background we've been working on cables yeah uh really good ones by the way and the way that it typically works is as long as you cuz the the connector is the connector okay so as long as you have
good conductors in a good configuration with good twists and good insulation and shielding right a cable is just a cable and nobody can tell you you can't make that physical cable uh in the case of this is not official documentation in the case of HDMI and USBC I can tell you that much but what they can say is you may not put HDMI ah yes on the box or whatever logos and emblems and and you can make no claims yeah so so these things are trademarked right uh and I'm sure
Titan's going to jump in and and sort of um clarify some of this if he's in float plane chat right now but the point is that you can pretty much make any pretty much anyone can make a cable and they're unlikely to get into any kind of trouble unless they violate a trademark like USB type-c super speed Ultra extra XL right or you know whatever they're calling crap these days um but where was I going with this as for as for as for how to get around the as for how to get around supporting them
then no no there's pretty much nothing that you can  yeah if you if you do stop using it if you stop buying HDMI cables um I think that will make a difference genuinely because if device manufacturers are like no one's using HDMI right that's what I was saying uh is no I don't think it will make a difference because because no my understanding is that the fees are for the are on on the device side they're not on the cable side necessarily no but what I'm saying is if you if you stop buying HTMI
cables manufacturers might stop including how would they even know oh I'm sure they know I'm I'm I'm Ben Q how do I know that people are plugged in Via display port to my monitor I  do and on the and on the like home theater side of things on the the multimedia side of things it's not like I have a choice I can't I can't use display port on anything on any TV i' I've not really understood this when Nvidia launched their bfgd initiative their big display technology um or gaming display
that that's what it was short for they they yeah I don't make the rules uh but when Nvidia launched that um I was like heck yeah one of the things that I hope gains momentum is dis Port mhm because honestly everything that I would need for a TV display port can do and it's royaltyfree so let's go what are we waiting for but the inter the interco compatibility and like like someone had to get it started was kind of my mindset was and if we start getting TVs that have it if every TV just has one of
these ports on it well hey that's a that's a starting point in time maybe we start to get devices that have both interfaces kind of like we've seen HDMI make its way onto PCS it used to be that PCS were just VGA and then VGA and DVI and then just DVI for the most part although you'd use VGA for your legacy monitors or you'd use the analog pins on the DVI connector for that and then all of a sudden HDMI showed up and the question at the time especially was why um it was smaller so that
was a dubious benefit but the HDMI standard we were using I guess it would have been 1 Point one one 1.2 whatever whatever it was at the time that it started becoming more ubiquitous on PC monitors um was Bend with equivalent to DVI um so there there was no compelling reason other than I guess you like spending a little bit more on your monitor like I just didn't really get it and then uh it was part of the big push towards home theater PC so I guess that's ultimately the reason why we
started to see it more but then it's just become this given that HDMI on graphics cards and now all of a sudden okay now it kind kind of is on most monitors and it's just kind of snowballed from there and I just I wanted to see something similar to that happen in the home theater space with display port and just hasn't happened at all yeah yeah I do think Market survey stuff would exist I do think stores uh would they would be reporting somewhere that these companies that are making
decisions on compatibility would be able to have that information for the fact that uh not the fact that but in this theoretical scenario uh where display port is outselling HDMI by a significant degree um and then adjustments would be made but I don't think there's anything that's a lot to ask from the market and it will not happen it's not happening yes it's not happening yeah um someone in twitch chat pointed out that uh HDMI did have the benefit of carrying audio while DVI did not that is true I don't
think it was a huge meaningful benefit for PCs at the time but that is a really good point and um then we've got the the The Conspiracy Theory reason that popped up in float plane chat that is probably the real reason and HDMI supported htcp so there was enormous industry  um because hdcp has prevented content ripping absolutely please continue to think this you know okay real talk though there is something to be said for the the the the hassle of it being more difficult like finding an hdcp stripper
is kind of a pain in the butt because nobody advertises that functionality because the second they do this well-funded group because of all the royalties they collect goes after them and makes sure that it you know goes away and so for the average person you know like if we're talking uh like my my little brother or something like that if he could just as easily pirate some piece of content okay let's think back to the R4 for the Nintendo DS okay it was brain dead simple to Pirate games for that
platform and pretty much everyone I knew did it they had an R4 cartridge you put a Micro SD in it and then you just downloaded ROMs and it was like way better it was way better than the paid experience because you just had an entire you know personal Netflix library of games to play and it you just selected what you wanted and booted it up it was actually better than carrying around a bunch of carts which felt stupid it's interesting that you went to Netflix over like steam I know but don't
worry about it the point is that when piracy is really easy I think it still is though cuz you're you're talking about ripping so you're talking about the work that would have to be done in order to Pirate the thing I think most people people if they're going to uh engage in the piracy they're just going to download it sure so it's it's hurting like the light hobby or the tinkerers that would like to do it themselves and you're actually hurting probably the people that are trying to do it in a
more uh what I think most people would see as a u maybe it's not okay with the law but this is pretty much okay sense where they buy the thing and then rip it for themselves I think that's a very hypothetical person I don't think too many people are doing that saying though but I think that's the only people that are basically being affected sure cuz I don't know how many people are like oh I desire to Pirate so I'm going to buy this thing and then give it to other people well there's a there's a surprising
number of I guess I'll say like selfless Pirates like there's a lot of Robin hoods out there yeah who will go and buy a Blu-Ray so that they can rip it and they can upload it to you know a private tracker or something like that I don't think there's that many though I mean there's enough yes there's enough there's definitely enough there's more than enough yes and you know but I think it's a like dozens of us there are dozens of us situation and back to my point though about how the barrier to
entry is measurable I mean even getting a membership to a private tracker which I have done it's kind of a hassle yeah it's a barrier and if you're downloading if you're downloading off like okay I'm GNA use a super outdated uh reference but for a good reason if you're downloading movies from The Pirate Bay yeah especially with all of the interesting things that have happened with The Pirate Bay name and the Pirate Bay domains over the years yeah don't do that right now that there's there's inherent risk
and even if you got a copy of a movie from it say for example it's probably not going to be that great quality so what I'm trying to say is that right now for my little brother for the Nintendo DS I'd be like I don't know get an R4 and download games right if he was asking me how to how to Pirate games and for something like movies I would say I don't feel like coaching you on how to do this safely go buy a movie subscribe to Netflix get a Blu-ray and so and so there is I think that among
the hyper Tey audience yourself included my argument doesn't make any sense but if you put yourself in the shoes of someone who is not techsavvy who asked you for advice if they ask you okay how do I pirate movies what would you say it's kind of a mess these days that is an answer I've given relatively recently I don't feel like setting it up for you yeah pretty [Laughter] much so when people go by the Blu-rays when people say htcp doesn't work anyway they're right it doesn't prevent anyone
from from ripping the content and hosting it on file sharing sites and a layer of Swiss cheese but it is absolutely a friction Point um and is it a friction point that creates an enormous amount of collateral damage that personally I'm not really okay with yeah but do I understand why they're doing it and why they continue to do it yeah it's Al it's not it's not just it's not Moon logic it's not like they're just dumb people doing dumb things and I think that sometimes if we allow ourselves to just
think everyone is dumb but me we miss the bigger picture and the bigger picture is that it is effective it's not 100% effective but it is something it's it definitely is to a certain degree yeah with all of that said off and let AMD Implement HDMI 2.1 on Linux because Linux shouldn't have a disadvantage because of your DRM yeah so that's what the whole thing boils down to for me yeah what do you want to talk about next um let's just maybe keep hammering through the headliner topics and what
the Vision Pro material cost let's do it research firm omita has released an estimate for the bill of materials yeah don't wor about it Bia I mean yeah I mean that is correct stupid name but um probably better than flow plane I like definitely better float plan relas research firm float plane the is that what is that name yeah as for the bill of materials for Apple Vision Pro uh placing the cost of  $542 notably this does not include costs associated with Market uh marketing wow
I can speak uh packaging or research and development which is going to be very substantial to be clear this is something that people forget about but constantly I don't know why uh meaning that it is not possible to determine Apple's per unit profit margin with the information listed and it never is unless you happen to work at Apple and know the exact profit margin even then it's kind of hard and it's technically a little bit of a guess yeah uh the biggest single contributor to the bomb
is or the bill materials is the micro OLED internal displays which are awesome so it makes sense adding that in there uh which cost 200 $128 per eye I wonder how that compares to the price of gold cuz I bet they don't weigh much yeah yeah crazy the combined costs for all of the vision proos displays make up around 35% of its build materials for context the psvr 2's OLED panel is 30% of its bomb and the quest 2's LCD panel is only 18% of its bomb Apple has declined to discuss the exact breakdown Behind The
Vision Pro price but they have emphasized the cost of R&amp;D and claim "that 5,000 different patents were used" in its design the main display is $456 alone wow that's that's a lot yeah it's a really wicked display so it makes sense yeah but but A good rule of thumb is that whatever the bill of materials cost is your probably looking at about double at least by the time it makes it to retail because you've got to account for I mean even even aside from the things that Luke already listed you know
there's uh there's there's there's middleman even if that middleman is your own middleman so let's say apple Apple's middleman is an Apple Store yeah does it pay rent I mean if it wants to keep that nice location in the mall it sure does if it wants to keep them employed it sure does does it have to deal with shrink does it have to deal with cleaning expense so just because a middleman also has the name Apple doesn't necessarily mean that it doesn't add cost that that it doesn't eat your
margin are there any failures in manufacturing at all oh yeah I mean that's uh certainly that's something that may be factored into these bill of material costs though because if the cost of a of a Sony semiconductor micro OLED display is $228 that's probably once the failed ones have been yielded out I didn't know this how however that doesn't necessarily mean yeah so generally your bill of materials is the cost of good ones okay however that doesn't mean that none of those good ones are broken in assembly
right they could still get returned they could whatever else that can happen I feel like that's not as common these days but that yeah with the amount of automation that they have in product manufacturing these days yeah it would be less common but it wouldn't be unheard of for something to go wrong on the assembly line and for some of these to ultimately not pass Speck now in many cases you can push that back on the manufacturer you can go hey Sony here's your pallet of crappy displays that
didn't make the cut when we were assembling them and if you're Apple you probably have the like penis to swing around to go uh by the way here's a bill for us to take them apart and ship them back to you yeah maybe maybe not we don't know but um that's absolutely something that can happen and it and it someone has to do that and I think that's something a lot of people kind of take for granted is every thing someone has to like move it every single time it moves someone has to look at it every single time
something changes about it to make sure that everything's going well and in some cases it is a machine doing that well guess what somebody has to build that machine somebody has to maintain it there's costs everywhere sorry yeah but there some some of these things are are like I know the screen is the main display is 456 bucks but like man nothing was really cheaped out on structural member just the middle frame and stuff $120 that doesn't even surprise me that much like it's metal
it's metal yeah and it's the the kind of CNC that you are to fre it's just like I I understand that but then you see it on paper and it's like yeah you know this was debated heavily and they decided yeah let's go with this expensive $120 at their cost metal frame uh Kumo star in floatplane chat says my glass lenses actually shatter at a rate of 40% of the time when they thin them wow yeah poor product yields are absolutely something that is built into the cost of Premium or Niche or just or difficult to
manufacture products um a perfect example of that is why much much larger TVs are so much more expensive than smaller ones you could have a TV that is twice the size as another TV but it'll be four times the cost trying to get that panel all of it perfect with nothing wrong with it is way more difficult than cutting around a bad section and making two smaller ones it's just it's so much harder it's requires bigger Machinery to manipulate it around as you're working on it it's just everything is bigger and
everything's more challenging and someone has to develop the processes for this by the way I to iCal twitch uh back to our last topic sorry Linus you're defending the bad guys here did did any part of any of that sound like a defense come on people what the HDMI Forum thing to win where I was talking about hdcp  effective I didn't say they're good guys I just said that what they're doing is working yeah yeah I said they're not as stupid as you might think they are discussion question is does this kind of
cost breakdown make sense for the Vision Pro um what it is and what it can do the $3500 price tag is it really all that shocking giving its component parts that's the thing is I I talked about this in my unboxing I said guys it's expensive yes is it overpriced no no if anything I'm looking at this bomb cost you should buy it either just to be super clear not even a little our review is coming very soon in fact I think it's coming out tomorrow nice but looking at this bomb cost the ret until price
totally makes sense so price is not higher it's actually I think unar uncharacteristically low for Apple I think it's pretty aggressive yeah um and I know that's going to sound pretty crazy to some people there's a lot of people who just really hate apple and anything that they do is bad because it's Apple who did it but do you imagine for a second that uh you know let's say  Azure like what how how do you think you if you if you look look at look at nvidia's h100s right now apple is a
publicly traded company you can get a rough idea of what their profit margins are anytime you want yeah and then you can compare it to companies like Oracle okay or Nvidia it's like they're they're not that far out there and so yeah is the Vision Pro a really expensive product sure yeah of course it is but like I don't know you have any Nice Kicks do you have any idea how much fuing money they made on those like come on yeah yeah clothing is like historically pretty notorious for this
um yeah a little bit Yeah and and to be clear clothing has very real costs you know back to my point this happens to be clothing that we're going to talk about a little bit later on the show new clothing or you want to package it in a way that isn't bad for the planet that's going to cost more that'll cost you do you want to ship it at all cuz even though even though this paper might cost exactly the same as some plastic it doesn't it cost more but it could cost exactly the same you still have to pay
for someone to go and Source it because this particular Factory only had plastic packaging on hand now they have to store that paper that's just for special snowflake us and then they have to have a workflow for you know changing the production line so that instead of plastic at the end it has paper at the end whenever they're working on stuff for us like is the failure rate the same everything adds up adds up adds up adds up and so yeah I said I said it already but I'll say it again um it's not overpriced
yeah it's expensive yes there are elements of it that are overpriced the fact that Apple charges so much for a storage upgrade on something that you are already paying them to be a beta tester for yeah is egregious to me but the device itself the base model device itself no it's not overpriced and given the R&amp;D and all the other stuff involved with it if Apple you would complain if Apple didn't pay the engineers who developed it yeah that would be a huge Scandal that would be a
huge Scandal or if you worked them too hard or too long because you trying to save money whatever or whatever so then when Apple kind of goes yeah turns out R&amp;D costs money so we're going to have to we're going to have to charge money for our products you can't complain then you can't you don't get to have it both ways I had a conversation with someone recently uh where we had a discussion about how your your employment to a certain degree if you if you are making things um and I've had this discussion
with a few people a number of times but there was just one that was very recent but if you're if you if you make things your employment is essentially selling your own company the things that you make so you can kind of boil it down to like okay I made widget X it took me two months the cost of the company for widget X was my cost which is my salary plus my you know benefit and whatever um government fee things there are on top of that the amount of hours is to take that thing and make more money off and
make more money off of it and if they don't then then I guess you weren't a very good salesman yeah um and you go bye-bye yeah pretty much and or reassigned or whatever else and you can be unhappy about it um you know it's one of those things where I'm not going to say hm you complain about capitalism and  this but that's that's how the wheel currently turns For Better or For Worse  yeah train. wve yep see that's the thing um we can't it turns out have a film studio in a
residential neighborhood we tried that zoning uh you get kicked out yeah unfortunately it's a whole thing it was nice while we were there and the vast majority of the industrial land in the Vancouver area is next to train tracks where you know people don't want to live uh so we just have to deal with that it's pretty cool it is what it is yeah yeah uh what do you want to talk about next uh Dan what's our what's our next topic um I don't know you got 11 minutes until merch messages uh no we have to
hurry a little bit because James is doing a thing later let mer and we need to clear out of this set wait what should we talk about the thing they're doing guess what guess what guess what's coming  iorry no not that don't say the name that's the wrong name carpo critics stop he's going to be so mad we should we should actually not do that they're just movies is shooting a special a special temporary return uh for Dune Dune part two that makes sense that's cool so they're coming they're
coming back they're coming back to the mics that that's that's like kind of a weird idea for a podcast but would kind of be cool which is like an episode gets filmed if an episode deserves to get filmed and that's it yeah and if it doesn't it doesn't and if if all three if all three hosts aren't like I need to see this movie I need to see it on launch day I want if I don't talk about it I'm going to explore then it just doesn't get an episode it's a pretty cool concept I kind of like it
to be honest cuz like if an episode comes out that means it's time to watch you know yeah yeah I'm I'm down with it  movies I'd watch that when it they mostly just movies and this podcast is not about those ones sometimes movies all right merch messages now I'm supposed to explain about merch messages the way to interact with the show you guys have been watching it all show so far is to send a merch message don't do a twitch bit whatever that is or a super chat you want to send a merch message
that way you can throw money at your screen and get great quality merchandise in the mail in return all you got to do is head to LTT store.com we got a couple new things to show you guys today in the cart you will see the field for a merch message whenever we're live you fill it out it goes to producer Dan there he is too late oh no he's got it this time oh oh well anyway the point is it goes to producer Dan who will either forward it to the appropriate party respond himself
throw your little shout outs at the bottom of the screen or curate your message for me and Luke to respond to later uh we've got a couple of we're going to do a couple merch messages to kind of show you guys how it works we try to get to as many of them as we can but if we don't then hey at least you get your order in the mail instead of just throwing money at the screen which you can also do but which you can do you might as well just get an order of the I mean we've got we've got super chats
enabled if you just want to throw money at the screen and then give YouTube a 30 or 40% cut or whatever whatever then by all means I I will I will take my my pittance that YouTube reserves for me out of that money and uh I I will I will certainly accept it but I would rather I would rather give Google share to you know our fine Creator Warehouse team or to our to our wonderful suppliers or our or our t-shirt printer who I I love the quality of his work and I just you know
I I just want him to make more shirts for us um it's it's one of those things if your customer's biggest complaint is they just want to buy more you're doing pretty good yeah so you know lots of love anyway the point is uh we've got a few updates on the store  up very crinkly well paper packaging quite experience cyclable that's good okay we do it because we care I I go  easier I don't need to know these things I can make assumptions about these    finger oh my God like  
underwear nice they are 5050 Marino wool and polyester blend they are comfortable for all seasons and because they're Marino wool they uh they Wick like awesomely um when I when I wear these for badminton my my nether regions dry out so much faster so great for anytime you might be outdoors uh whether the moisture is coming from outside in or inside out they're fantastic for that uh there are same great fit there the hand feel is uh yeah yeah it feels like Marino wall y well good stuff yeah I
mean that's anyway the point is uh I love Marin wall upgrade your software haha that's actually a pretty cool pretty good uh that's actually pretty funny so the LTT underwe are back uh new one pack it's really expensive that's why it's a one pack Marino wool is expensive yep it turns it's really really expensive and somebody has to pay for you know all those people all those people to get genetically modified to uh to make wool on their bodies and yeah they yeah we Harvest humans they're they're
volunteers though so it's okay anyway the point is uh it has more of a structured feel compared to our typical modal blend so they they kind of hold hold firm they hold a little firmer uh please follow the care instructions do do not put in the dryer oh it's wool yeah that makes sense they will shrink yep um okay and then they're underwear so returns blah blah fully sealed not opened etc etc so there's just a couple warnings I wanted to get on there what is this hat Adam um yeah good job I
don't know yeah it's good I'm proud of him um anyway the point is the other updates for the store this week are magnetic Cable Management you can sign up for a launch notification really can I say this available next week oh magnetic cable management is coming also the Precision screwdriver we are receiving the first 100 unit soon which will be sold to a randomly selected group of people who have signed up for a launch notification this will be ahead of General availability and the idea here
is that similar to what we did with the regular screwdriver popup shop once those 100 people have it use it review it we are going to take back orders so that we can get some idea like how the bloody many of these things we should order uh instead of just guessing danger without taking a pre-order because hey this way final production units are in the hands of people and you can take their word for how great it is yeah I do think we'll probably do away with that system at some point I
mean I think we've uh kind of established what just going to kind of take care of people this is not like this is not like a game I'm not going to tell you to pre-order I'm just going to tell you it's an option at some point I  um we have a demo for cable management let's do two merch messages first then we'll do a demo of cable management all right hit me Dan sure thing let's see it's been a while to walk over I was going to say for April Fool so you should just run over and like punch you
well I mean we're going to why punch it's a it's the most standard hit in the world it's not the most standard hit backand to the face is that the most you would prefer a backand to prer it that's not the argument here I'm just saying that's just kind of the vi yeah a punch is not the standard hit you think a backand to the face is a more standard hit that feels much more correct for this video game says like hit what do you expect the character to do well depends what they're trying to do I mean
in in a in a social context I would expect you know context if someone says drink to the you expect them to backhand you across the face this could be a forehand yeah what but I would expect a slap yeah I'd expect a slap not a Punch If I say hit me to someone else I would never expect them to smack me face it depends on the context yeah you could kill someone with a punch I'm not exp you could drive their nose bones into their brain happen to my face I mean I guess but why even bother  then
you should you should avoid hitting each other in the head by the way this is like a thing whatever Will Smith is very culturally relevant whatever he says is the correct hit is correct we're going with that yeah oh my good yeah fair enough you know what I rest my case all right yeah it's been a while since this question was last asked Are You Now open to 60 frames a second LTD videos I it's never been a question for me you'll have to you'll have to ask our production team um no I mean I can uh
here you know what tell you what uh realistically and he's pretty chill uh he's he's he's the the king of the camera nerds these days I I actually I legitimately I'm not 100% sure exactly what his job title is um but he's definitely he's definitely the ruler of  Roost hello lus hey Andy sorry to bug you you are live on the W show right now oh hi yeah we we got a merch message that was really more of a question for you than it is for me and I'll I'll let you kind of feel it here um uh we were
asked hey are you guys more open these days to 60 FPS videos uh I mean it's gonna eat a lot of my our hard drive if we are okay with you know this space and all the processing power lost though I think should be fine for our standpoint really that was not the answer I was expecting to get um I'm okay with that cuz like I mean I wouldn't watch like a 60 FPS like V uh movie you wouldn't oh I wouldn't no 24 FPS for movie only but like 60 you know forour video you know like if for we're
showing FES and that kind of stuff yeah it might make sense what about like a talking head video nah it's okay like I wouldn't be bothered but like I still prefer 30 but if we decided that we're going to do 60 that's fine what if it was your decision what if you were empowered I'm Gonna Keep like 30 okay fair enough thanks Andy y bye so basically he's more open to it than um that department has been in the past the bandwidth sucks oh the storage  video yeah this is this is why a lot of
platforms don't like like it there are there are situations like he was saying um where it totally makes sense totally completely makes sense we haven't accidentally done it by the way in response to float plane chat uh we do it on purpose from time to time if the purpose of the video is to make observations about the smoothness of something or it's really gameplay footage heavy we have uploaded in 60 FPS um just just so you know it's it's not something that we do by accident yeah
but like all content just magically being 60 FPS first of all is not actually going to make it better and second of all it's just really expensive across the board it's expensive in storage it's expensive in D bandwidth it's expensive in rendering it's expensive in every way really um and usually isn't going to offer you a benefit and then when it does though it's it's sweet yeah all right it's it's cool the support but so uh basically we'll think about it um typically I have
not really imposed artistic my artistic will on other departments I look realistically I could have said 10 years ago our videos are 60 FPS like it or lump it um but that's not really how we roll here so if Andy were to come around and say you know hey I think this video should be 60 FPS I would never say no to that um I have not been the obstacle to it is basically what I'm trying to say but it sounds like we're more open to it than we have been in the past so who knows what the future
holds yeah I don't think it's that hit me Dan hey W.C could a theoretical deal ss4 bring back SLI leveraging AI to address micro stutters and splice frames together to trick games into thinking it's a single  requirements I don't know I don't know enough about the architecture of SLI and nvidia's modern gpus to speculate about something like that but what I will say is I doubt it I don't think they want to go that direction either at all and realistically guys if they really wanted
to bring back SL Li that's not the way they would do it anymore Apple has shown that a high-speed enough interconnect can be built to have two gpus two independent gpus functionally act as one it does still have issues in fact we ran into this unexpectedly when we did our  um Apple's attempts to um make their platform more appealing to developers when we used an m whatever was M1 Ultra M2 Ultra whatever we used one of the ultra chips uh to to test it and what we found out after the fact was one of the
reasons it didn't work very well for us was because their Ultra chips are kind of bugged in some applications including that which In fairness to us is an apple problem not an us problem that does affect Apple's users and not only in this one weird beta Edge case it's actually a problem with their product that they need to fix at some point uh but it does demonstrate that there are definitely still challenges even if it can be done but that it can be done so if Nvidia were to build something like
that what I suspect is that they would build it as a product and they would build it as an AI product they would not build that as a gaming product I mean we're already looking at their top tier silicon their top monolithic die costing what what what are we up to "$1,600 Us by the time you equip it with" a whole bunch vram and a whole bunch of vrms and a big cooler and an HDMI port which to be clear on a card of that price is not a significant contributor but still um I just I I I I I just SLI
didn't make any sense beyond the top tier products because of the uh the the the the interconnect overhead like you wouldn't put that complicated that that highspeed interconnect on something that wasn't likely to use it because it's so expensive in terms of silicon you would just give it more Cuda cores or more AI cores or more tensor cores or whatever you why are you sing like 50 Series gpus yeah exactly it's it's silliness and so they would only put it on a top tier card and if they were going to do that
what do you really want a "$4,000 gaming card I mean some people" probably do but and maybe Nvidia would even build that product like if they built it already for the AI Market or workstation Market anyway then and they were looking at it going okay well we just slap GeForce on this thing and then it goes uh then may maybe maybe they would but I just I don't see it being in the near future sorry guys want to hit us with one more Dan yeah sure Hi D EI I I I he getting so weird I work in fraud and have recent
really shame on you yeah shame stop frauding people I'm a professional criminal and I have recent cases with customers falling for deep faked ads and fraudulent credit card apps with AI generated photos what other Tech can you see aiding criminals in the future oh dude that yeah basically things in that realm we we had a topic about this not that long ago about where people did a some form of AI deep fake thing for a confence call to convince someone to transfer millions and millions of
dollars and they did it um this is just going to get worse I I talked months ago about how people were um they were the scam was that they would Target mothers and they would deep fake the daughter's voice um in distress in distress which makes it easier cuz you like muffle it and stuff y um and and they would ask for like you know money or whatever else Ransom um and was working because you're playing on people's emotions and stuff like that and you're putting them in a in a
not you're putting them in a in a in a if I'm wrong a cognitive disadvantage yeah and if I'm wrong this horrible thing is happening and I didn't help uh if I'm right I'm out some money so quite a bit of people are going to take the chance which sucks that's why I just don't pick up my phone anymore yeah there you go honestly I get so many SP calls and just I don't have to deal with the Charlie problem if I'm not even there just walk away turn 360° around walk away if you
are not in my phone book I am extremely difficult to get in touch with and it causes legitimate problems I miss shipments all the time like no seriously like if I man if I ever ordered something on Uber Eats and they just like saw my number in the thing and called me instead of like texting me through the app or whatever I just they'd have no chance I'd be like God I guess I'm just not getting this food you don't call screen I call screen everything I don't have it oh yeah exactly so I just don't answer
my phone yeah I mean honestly it's kind of liberating I just I I just what's that my phone's ringing is it my wife seems like someone else CU she's basically the only person who ever calls me do you have custom ringtones um do you have different ringtone if they're in your address book or not no I just I glan oh yeah but I like I don't you know I don't see if I recognize the number or anything yeah what percentage of my calls are my wife I mean it's pretty it's pretty high
you know yeah wife something wife wife something vet something wife like pretty much my life once once yeah once you progress to a certain age that's kind of what it [Laughter] becomes voice calls are so Boomer oh you know what my phone does have though is it has an auto text response so anytime someone calls me um not anytime time most of the time when someone calls me actually this is I kind of misrepresented it before I send back an automatic please text me and if they
don't text me then it couldn't have been that important that's pretty fair I mean what were they calling from a landline if you're already not well if they're in distress and can't like type on their phone but if if they're not in your address book mhm and they can't text you the chance that you really needed it is like near zero yeah yeah um so that seems quite fair to me um what was the okay back the scamming question yeah I don't know all the AI things are going to be absolutely horrid for scamming
it's it's going to be really really really really really bad I know and there's going to be such creative attack vectors like they'll get you on the phone somehow and they'll be like uh it'll be something innocuous like they'll um they'll get you to they'll get you to type something or something and then they'll they'll use the you know the knowing what those characters sound like to uh you know if they so like this would have to be quite targeted but if somehow they manage to uh you know get an audio
feed from a security camera in your house or something like that if they call you and tell you what characters to type they'll use machine learning to uh take that audio signature and then they'll they'll wait for you to like log into something even if they can't see your keyboard and they'll like be able to steal passwords from you that way like there's just going to be things are going to get actual spy movie crazy like that's a thing by the way I wasn't making that up that whole audio
signatures and being able to tell what you typed that that's totally a thing in fact I think the researchers didn't even need the a recording and knowing what you were typing they were just able to they were able to figure it out just based on the vibrations or something like that it's absolutely incredible uh we have a video coming soon by the way on how easy it is to break into someone's Wi-Fi if you have the hardware for it it's the kind of thing that I think many in our audience are already
going to be aware of but many in our audience might not be aware of just how bad it is so if you remember Camino have you seen any of the videos we've made about kamino's machines okay they do these liquid cooled GPU servers and they sent us over one probably about 6 months ago now that we have had various concepts for what to do with and have ultimately not executed on and finally we settled on one um and it's good timing too cuz they messaged me they were like um are you ever doing anything
with that server and I was like ha I filmed the video today like there it's not a sponsor we would like to um continue to have it yeah it's not a sponsorship or anything but you know it's got like 649s in it so I'm sure they'd love to know where it is um anyway we came up with a really good concept and um Tanner built the Kraken Ator 5000 a mobile WiFi cracking monstrosity in a van um using a bunch of batteries and their server and we didn't do it because that would be
illegal but we were able should we have desired yes to go anywhere yeah find any wireless access point yeah and break into it in how fast did you guys get it down to seconds yeah so you could War Drive if you were like in a school district that's yeah that sounds about right nice very cool pretty wild um I think for a uh don't quote me on this cuz it'll be right in the video I think for someone who uses their phone number oh yeah it was 4 seconds yeah so if you if it's purely
numeric um because each each of those RTX 490s I think was able to do about 2 million per second or something like that 2 million attempts per second and with WPA 2 you don't have to be in range in order to do this either so even if we didn't have that kind of hard where we could steal everything that we need go somewhere else wait around for it to processing and then you got it and then we can come back connect and even a lot of techsavvy people don't necessarily have proper protections on uh every shared
resource on their Network um even here almost no one that I know here uses Mac filtering even Mac filtering is not a perfect defense uh there's all kinds of there's there's so many attack vectors once someone is connected to your network so please For the Love of All that is good use a long Wi-Fi password with lots of characters with lots of special characters and with unusual de deviations if you must use diary words make sure that it's not just well I used a capital letter for the
first letter of every word cuz that's a thing that people do try not to be predictable please please um yeah wpa3 much better but the problem is that if you if your uh AP is not configured to reject WPA2 capable clients that that do not support wpa3 then any WPA2 thing can just connect and then it'll negotiate via WPA 2 and then you can just break in with WPA 2 yeah it's it's the whole like oh nice this is secured through UB key as its two- factor and it also has a backup of text message
authentication it's only secure as the least secure of it um I I know multiple people who have in in the wake of all this AI stuff moved to entirely in-person transactions for highly important things multiple people at this point in time including some people that act as companies um to the point where they've made agreements with uh this the cellular provider one seems to be harder to get uh the only person I know one person who's gotten that but it's because they have a
more much smaller cellular provider uh but they they have an agreement where if a new sim is issued for instance they have to be there in person it has to be them in particular and they have to provide their ID no other scenario is allowed they will never ship it none of that type of stuff I know multiple people who have agreements with their Bank where if they want to withdraw a significant amount of money or wire transfer a significant amount of money or whatever over a certain threshold it
has to be them it has to be in person it has to be ID verified they can't do any of it online anymore none of it can be verified in in yeah we're going all the way back let's go back to the let's let's bring back check the way back yeah signatures let's go yeah it's weird it's weird that the solution is let's do all of the pre-tech things well we could combine like we could have you know physical biometric security I could have to pluck I could have to pluck a hair out of my beard and give it to them for
like analysis in order to oh I'm going to have to grow a beard again there you go shoot good solution yeah yeah I I like I I I love that like hey yeah I'll do that wire transfer but I only do wire transfers on like every second Thursday because that's when I go to the bank might be an actual like statement that people actually say in modern year that's crazy um yeah fun one what are we supposed to be doing right now oh we just finished merch messages oh yeah that took a while
that was fun though I enjoyed it it was good I'm cold we have some of it already like we we've actually been running these for months on wow I guess you don't see it much oh these are the old 3D printed crappy ones but yeah capable things you don't have to make fun of them they're pretty good I like you little the magnets come out of them too easily the molds for the finished ones are fixed fine I like them anyways good good magnet holder I'll break   um this is not something that I expected
to Happ okay yeah yeah hold on okay go ahead um what the heck is going on here why is there a backpack is it hanging off one of oh wow there's one for you okay I mean oh there's one for you have fun well how are we supposed to are we supposed to do anything with this while we're holding it all right is there a picture is there a plan wait you have to just hold it why not I mean okay why are you being tortured uh I mean well uh I probably did something that's fair okay so what are we supposed to do
Daniel besser I don't know this is a demo you can move them okay well there's different sizes of the cable management things so we've got this these cables here do you want to just pull an arch off Luke yeah so there you go that they can be used to manage cables nice strong  off nice nice so you can hold bigger cables you know you're doing it in the way that it makes it look easy oh who who Jesus who you got this so Luke was uh someone ripped it out of my head Luke was Levering it because he wants to be
effective but the point is how strong they are I was I wasn't aware of what the point me try and try and rip the backpack off maybe yeah you could yeah okay sure Luke rip the backpack off am I am I allowed to no you you have to pull you have to pull perpendicular from the board so I can't like slide it to the side nope nope embracing it with this is not going to go well it's going to go funny you slid it off I didn't mean to put back I can't I can't like I have to here we'll angle it Dan here we'll angle
it there you go perfect it slid again come on Luke don't cheat yeah that hurt okay you got it that hurts my body all right anyway the point is there's lots of different kinds there's the Arches there's the ones that attach to Cable ties it is very strong uh there's the ones that hold uh Power bricks I don't think we look this whole time one of the medium ones has been holding the screwdriver and it's fine there we go all right anyway thanks Dan  uh wonder if I could get it just by
throwing it uh I hear I hear the stream somewhere nice okay I think it was  week oh man try not to cheat challenge impossible chest Dan are you okay yeah all right  stuff apparently twitch ran an ad while we were trying to shill our products okay hold on hold on hold on this was this was good this was good cuz there's some misconceptions pit boy in all capital letters with maximum SAS says so I have a wooden desk and a uh uh drywall ah and drywall great products do most people have metal desks um no no
but what wasn't shown there is that they have I think he's running to go get them they have little metal uh Circle things to go on the other side um so if you have a wooden desk like lius or myself or even the wow desk or whatever you can screw or tape or glue or do whatever with these little metal plates and put those onto whatever surface you want the things to go on Wow having correct terminology for this would have been awesome so I don't sound like a so I will just go to my cam here so I am
holding three different plate sets we have the standard plate set which has uh the standard adhesive on it we have the and that one's intended for the adhesive to just hold it in place while you uh so you okay so you know what I'll just show you guys how it works can I have a small Arch please oh there's one nope that's not one uh I think that's uh maybe that might be a medium Arch that is a medium Arch yep may I have a small Arch please I don't have any oh my goodness we're just going to open all
the products I guess fine I'm over it okay all right cool so this one the way it's intended to be used is you've got your arch you've got your plate okay there's your adhesive backing so you yeah you peel the plastic protective piece off or you just don't I don't bother cuz I don't care cuz I'm going to put an arch on it anyway then what you do is you peel the adhesive back off you stick it to whatever it is that you want to stick it to and then you slide the arch off so that this stays exactly
where you want it then you put a screw through the middle and it stays there five ever hey now you have a metal desk um the VHB plate set is intended for people who don't want to screw into it and just want a plate that will stay forever with the adhesive um and then if you ever want to remove it then it's vhp so you can uh it'll take some time it'll probably rip the paint off of your drywall and you know whatever else yeah vhp really yeah but this is a this is a permanent mounting solution and then
this one's fun we haven't actually really shown this yet I don't think I haven't yeah I haven't seen this I know it's a thing but I don't know anything about it these are silicone grips that go with the regular plates and what they  is okay uh what they do is they have their own adhesive okay and so they're intended either for our backing or for a metal desk and they are a grippy surface so you stick it down in between metal and the magnet and then you lose a little bit of your perpendicular very
small amount no it's it's measurable okay yeah but it's probably so small uh but you get way less slippage so it increases the resilience that way and resilience is probably not the right way word or whatever but I don't care sure here you can correct yeah anyway okay uh yeah we've got there's that's fine it's fine it's been a very complicated launch because there's so many uh things to communicate there's so many different little things we've had to think through we had look
we had to make jumbo luk sized cable ties don't worry we still have the Linus sized ones normal ones for like big Power the ones that are definitely totally normal and fine according to my   goodness yeah I'm really excited these have been a long time coming and You' think it's simple but nothing's ever simple when you've got all the different sizes and all the different plate types and all the different sizes of cable ties that go with them and you're trying to have great compatibility with
the etc etc uh it's going to be a really really good product and we've I really wish we had it ready in time for launch but we just haven't I want to do a series where we go around and cable manage people setups with these things I think it's going to be a lot of fun like very um ultimate Tech upgrade kind of Vibes um and I would love if it's successful for us to actually expand this one to audience members so we get you guys to send us like your rid gamer dens and we basically roll in Cleanup
Crew style uh you know help and uh if Elijah's there and then and you know masks for everyone else and we like cable manage it I think that'd be super cool might make more sense once we also have cable products to go with our cable management I think so so we kind of come in and we go cuz one of the things oh I don't know if we've talked about this yet but I guess we're talking about it now one of the things that we want to differentiate our cable products from others aside from just being really high
quality is the availability of lots of different lengths cuz I mean right now yeah you can buy a USBC cable as long as you want  cm at about 40 or 50 it's really challenging and if you care about Cable Management it's kind of a kind of a pain in the butt that sucks yeah we're not going to be able to do custom links guys it's just with the way with how with the kind of frequency that these modern interfaces run at it's just not conceivable for us to be terminating them in a warehouse in Richmond or whatever
like these are going to have to be built to length but we want to offer more variety of lengths and we want to have a cohesive product line so that all of your cable stuff matches uh if you you know care about I did notice in some of our product imagery for the magnetic stuff which I've been peeping because we're we're doing stuff for the the store with it um some of the cables are like kind of random and I was thinking like man it would look nicer if there was like cohesiveness to the cables mhm and then
I was like oh yeah there will be we're probably going to do that in time there  yeah how are they with scratches as they move on the surface scratches on oh I mean they are magnets so if you if you want something to definitely not get scratched then what you would want to do is use the silicone uh the the silicone things so you would take the adhesive off the back you'd put it where you want it to go and then you youd put the magnetic Arch on there um the problem with magnets is
that the force drops off dramatically over distance and our differentiating factor for this product because anybody could see this and make a lower quality clone in no time at all the only reason this is taken so long is because we want it to be good right so if someone wanted to just make an arch with magnets on the end they could absolutely do that but most of the cost is in the magnets they're neodymium magnets they are extremely strong for their size and they will really hold your Flippin cables in
place but the problem with that is that they're magnets they're made of metal so if you put them on something soft uh or something that has a really fine finish on it like a you know really nice um painted surface for for example yeah there is a chance that it will get scratched so you will have to exercise some sort of Common Sense uh care and attention whenever you're using them um and if we were to we we considered developing them such that the plastic was what made contact not the metal and
it was me who made the call so if you're mad about it you can blame me but we made the call to go with magnet contact in order to best take advantage of our product's best strength which is its strength and like I don't know these ones right here have been on this wano set for a long time they don't really move they're pretty like this is oh yeah they're not really moving much they're amazing yeah I don't know I don't think they're going to do a lot of scratching because I don't think they're going to
do a lot of moving if you're using them to secure cables that you're moving often a lot of those are going to be things like USB cables stuff like that moving that around unless you're like really yanking on it I don't think it's going to move them is doing some really great Q&amp;A in the float plane chat right now um zarian asked well okay but putting magnets on your cables is is that going to be a problem for signaling and uh what he said was from our testing static magnets which is what ours are
they're not they're not moving they're not it's not a motor right uh static magnets are not a problem U from our interesting yep that's neat that's cool cool all right we got we got to do two more topics let's do some topics yeah yeah Nintendo Su Yuzu um for later yeah no let's do it now all right Nintendo has launched a 41-page dmca lawsuit against Tropic Haze the makers of switch emulator Yuzu does Nintendo know what dmca is cuz I'm not sure that they do they just they kind of
seem to think it's just everything to everyone sorry sorry I interrupted go on it yeah it's an arguable in court thing so they can get people scared about it regardless um they demanded that Yuzu be shut down and deleted according to Nintendo Yuzu users primarily use the technology to subvert anti-piracy protection not any of yuzu's more legitimate uses the gaming company disclosed that tears of the kingdom was illegally downloaded over a million times in the week and a half before its
initial launch or sorry it's official launch uh and that around 20% of download links pointed Pirates towards Yuzu as a tool to play the game while no one is claiming that Yuzu contains copyrighted codes if Nintendo could substantiate that it is a tool primarily for the purpose of copyright infringement that would be a violation of the dmca as pointed out by Rob FY fahi something around there of gamesindustry.biz Nintendo is arguably more seriously affected by piracy than
console Rivals like Microsoft and Sony in part because both those companies have a far greater number of live service MMO and you know always online style games I would also make the argument that both of those other companies provide a hardware platform that isn't a giant piece of that's a pretty good argument that was my primary reason for buying tear of the Kingdom a cartridge and never once putting it in my switch I put it in a switch for us to do a video here I never put it in mine I
didn't end up playing a ton of that game but the Limited hours that I did play were on an Rog Ally because I didn't want to run it 26 frames per second or whatever it averages out to like I it's not it's ridiculous um especially uh there's there was a rumor recently I have no idea how credible was but that the hardware for the switch 2 has been in development and at a late stage of development for a very long time like they're basically just deciding when to give us a console that isn't a giant
piece of um and it's just I don't know man Nintendo is one of those companies that just has such outright disdain for its users I I I have a hard time I have a hard time defending anything that they do at this point yeah this sucks for a lot of people because I know a lot of people really enjoy playing Nintendo games but with r tracing yeah or at 60 frames per second or you know at not 720p and I know this is a hey I actually don't know that many people and my circle is small and subsists of a
relatively similar type of person situation but pretty much everyone that I know that uses Yuzu also owns a switch and owns the games cuz most people are just like yeah it's just an insanely better experience so I want to play it there this isn't actually about pirating or whatever else I just like it's twice the frame rate looks insanely better is a I don't know bigger format whatever there's like a lot of different Arguments for it yeah I don't know it sucks I know there's other people on the inter webs
that are a lot more invested in this so if you are interested in it there are a lot of people covering this right now so you could look up arer K asks when are we getting the beauty page pageant pagent um internally I have been pleaded with to not do it yeah um it's not the kind of thing that I can make uh a unilateral decision on anymore I am no longer the CEO so I could be an and I could be like haha I insist because I am technically the majority shareholder but that's not how
a constructive relationship Works between um shareholders and board members and other shareholders is the chief executive um that's not how a healthy relationship Works between this shareholder and the other shareholder that Luke just mentioned um that's just not how any of this works so it is not a decision that I will be making on my own I would still like to do it yeah I think there's a way I I it's a mine field it's so basically here's the problem we could do it we could run a beauty pageant where
people's beauty is judged by the way they could play Super Smash Bros and uh um you know while they wait for judging you know we could do that if Nintendo decides to take legal action we are believe it or not still a very small company in the grand scheme of things and the legal costs for that type of action should they drag on long enough could significantly harm our ability to continue to operate uh I I know that yeah I don't fully understand where it comes from I think some of it is my fault because I
talked about that valuation that we got when there was the offer to buy uh but there's there's a perception I think that we are an enormous company that we're some kind of heavy hitter um and in the YouTube space I guess so yeah we're in sort of an an we're in a ve we're in very elite company in terms of our our our scale right like we have over a hundred people who work here but a 100 in Canada is the threshold for like a mediumsized business we we're just we're just barely we are
actually not a large company um we've been we've been very successful we've been very lucky but when you have a $100 million valuation or offer that doesn't necessarily mean that you have a $100 million valuation that could mean that there's some projected growth um so you could have been at a very high multiplier of your eida um it does not mean that I have $100 million in the bank that's super duper not how that works at all um I'm not complaining I'm doing really great and I'm deeply
appreciative to all of our viewers and all of our team members and and everyone but I don't have 100 million dollar 100% I promise uh so for us to go toe-to-toe with someone like a Nintendo is a legitimate risk that it would be up to the leadership team to  me yeah and it sucks because like it would be really fun to do but it is incredibly dangerous and for the same reasons that we would want to do it or H for highly related reasons to why we would want to do it Nintendo would probably want to come after
it cuz we're trying to like you know we're very obviously um trying to get around it trying to set an example to certain be trying to get around anything we wouldn't be trying to set any examples yes that is not the case we would be trying to run a beauty pageant that's true would like to make it very clear that's true that is what we would be the plan is you know if they were going to do activities between they could do a variety of activities they could they absolutely could yeah in
fact maybe that would be a good thing yeah if they could do anything they wanted yeah maybe they play another game maybe you know the console is there maybe they play tic taac toe but there's a variety of games available maybe there's lots of consoles available maybe  I mean it's just time between judging we're just trying to make it more entertaining for them fascinating yeah all right so we'll see long story short how did that come up we're talking about Nintendo and dmca and Nintendo just being generally
jackasses um okay our discussion question here is what happens to n if if Nintendo wins what happens if they lose I mean I think if Nintendo wins it's going to send huge shock waves um through the emulation Community I think that uh this is a this is a very important battle here um this will this will almost certainly set a precedent for uh for future similar battles with that said I would be very surprised if you know suddenly Nintendo emulation and suddenly game piracy
disappears because of this I mean um if it was as simple as you know winning battles in court then music piracy wouldn't exist and movie piracy wouldn't exist it would just go more underground but coming back to our conversation earlier that may be enough that may be enough friction that enough people buy Nintendo games legitimately that um it maybe won't matter anymore I mean I would honestly make the argument that even Yuzu as it is is very high friction the vast majority of people I know and
this is people I know this is not you know people that some random not Tech Circle person interacts with like the vast majority of the people I know would either a not be able to figure out how to get Yuzu running or B would be able to but look at it and go Noah I got something else to do today it's it's it's a bit of a pain in the butt and if you know exactly where to go and which file is safe and exactly what directory to put it in whatever yeah yeah sure it doesn't take long like you
can get Yuzu up and running in like 3 minutes but if you don't know all of those things man you can end up on some sketchy sites and you can end up you can it could it could potentially and this is a very real risk it could potentially cost you a lot more than some switch games so yeah I mean you get your like you end up with some stupid key logger on your computer you get your identity stolen that's going to be not worth it dog yeah so all that being said I honestly think this might bring more
eyeballs onto Yuzu and switch emulation in general than ever before um I've never been more tempted to download it and I've never downloaded it in the past oh it's it's pretty good yeah yeah I mean I I i' I use it I've just never bothered CU I was like I don't know whatever yeah if I'm going to play a switch game it's usually because I'm probably going to be in a situation where I only have my switch anyways so right and you don't have an ally so yeah you're by yourself yeah you have no Ally
except if Yuzu does get sued into Oblivion and told to delete their thing would disappear yeah except it wouldn't cuz it's open source so so it's not going anywhere which kind of makes the whole thing feel kind of um yep yeah yeah good job Nintendo but the easiest way to grab it would be to grab it now if that was the case not I'm not saying you should remember that time Nintendo was talking about uh doing like a sponsorship deal with us how glad do you think they are that they didn't do it
remember that time they like flew me out to Toronto no yeah oh yeah and then you like crushed that little kid in Mario Kart wow yeah really you you're so proud of that you have to bring it up right now he beat a child at Mario Kart a little girl pathetic mhm did they cry no oh they were upset they were Beyond tears Dan so I yeah they they brought they brought us out to Toronto to check out the switch and then uh I I was trying to like test it but I I wanted to check like controller range and stuff and they
wouldn't let me and then they were doing a Mario Mario Kart mini tournament up on the stage and they put me on the far side of the stage from the actual switch console itself um and it I was having a very hard time and at this point in time I played I would literally like okay so some people don't know this back in the old house when we used to film out of the house I lived in the basement I actually genuinely lived in the basement so what I would do is I would wake up I would go upstairs i' go
to work I'd work I'd come back downstairs and I'd play Mario Kart until I fell asleep and then I would fall fall asleep I used to be very very good and that's around this time so I expected to do quite well against a bunch of randoms effectively but I could barely even drive I was having a lot of issues uh I felt the like the controller was disconnecting so I started asking them like do I need to move closer is this a range issue and they're like no no no no no uh and the the one of the
people near me was like yeah you must just like not be that good and I was like okay yeah all right next race I'm going on the other side of the stage so I switched sides of the stage but they swapped one of the people out and it was like this little girl and I was like okay well I need to prove that I'm good so I was like crushing everybody but my plan was to pull off to the side right before the end and not actually win the race and then I didn't realize that they had the training wheels thing on so I
turned into the side and it dragged me  win so I like crush this whole race and then I get to the end smack into the  over and a bunch of people were like what like we understood you didn't have  to the real joke is Luke thinks he crushed it but he was the only one with  on oh man so it was uh it was quite the  yeah felt like a jerk totally looked totally looked cool at that event for sure anywh who somebody jail broke a prison laptop yeah Twitter user zephra wenting bought a prison laptop which I didn't
know was a thing yeah All Electronics prison have to be so they have like transparent PCS or uh TVs sorry and everything transparent or translucent whatever oh sure sure clear plastic so they bought a prison laptop off of eBay apparently assuming that it would be a normal laptop in a clear chassis the laptop's case and keyboard are transparent in order to make it harder for an inmate to smuggle Contraband but it also had no storage Drive no USB port and no apparent operating system the
computer consisted almost entirely of an Intel Celeron n3450 4 gigs of lpddr3 memory a Wi-Fi module one SATA port exactly one and a proprietary connector for a dock of some kind zeph ing crowdsourced advice on how to jailbreak it and wound up bypassing the password hot wirring in a USB hub and installing Ubuntu wenting then bypassed the system's hard drive ban list in order to add an SSD followed shortly thereafter by playing freedoom of course um I mean that's about it I just thought this was
pretty funny um here's the post on Twitter yeah I just I just had no idea that this was a thing yeah I only heard about this I heard about this before this but only fairly recently and apparently it's like All Electronics I would just buy the laptop that came in that chassis that's awesome yeah looks sweet if anyone from framework is watching um please oh that'd be sick I would be I would be super into this so cool anyway neat what else we got oh sponsors yeah the show is brought to you today by

a relatively new Mainframe storage engineer cool do you think going deep into Mainframe or Legacy Technologies is a boon for companies in need or backing yourself into a corner limiting options for companies in need I mean if you need it then you need it yeah I mean I think that for a long time the cloud was just treated like this this one size fits-all solution to every problem and I remember being really frustrated because we would take this constant criticism for building
storage servers why are the why are these idiots not just putting in like do have any idea how much it costs to upload somebody had to build a server somewhere the upload is often decently cheap and then they will destroy you whenever you need to recover that I know I know the point is just somebody somebody had to buy the hard drive it can be us it can be someone else someone had to buy it and they're going to get paid it's that simp it's that simple there is no free lunch so people would
be like why why are they not using the cloud sometimes there's nice scalability and and you get discounts and stuff but like we we're video editing we need to be able to access it you're not going to Video Edit from a Google Drive yeah like are you high yeah some people do but it like it's a terrible experience no it's a terrible experience and just the I guess the thing that drove me most crazy was the level uh of I don't know pomposity pom pompus you know just like how right people thought they were about
how Sil solution of 17 USB connected external hard drives is definitely better no it wasn't those guys it was the cloud guys they're like it's so it's so oh that this is this is the past and it's like you know what yeah it's caused problems but not for a long time it would have been worse at at all points in time it would have been worse so I don't know it is what it is because even even when there's a big issue with it we have the backups which is the equivalent of no I have it in the cloud so it's
like well now we do we didn't have the backups then and like it's been a while and and a lot of the people who looked at the pedite project data loss and were like see see I was right no you weren't because I just wasn't going to pay that kind of money to store all that in the cloud it wasn't the data wasn't that important and it's something I said I said it explicitly in the video in fact I'm pretty sure I said it when we built the paby project I was like this is a single copy I know that because I
don't want to pay for a redundant copy of it that is a decision I am making we have the YouTube videos that are uploaded Google probably isn't just going to shut down YouTube I know they shut down a lot of things but they're probably not just going to shut down YouTube um so it's not like the raw footage was always a nice to have it was not a need to have yeah these days things are a lot safer but the paby project server which now is like three pabes or something like that is still not replicated it it has
there's only one copy it's it's redundantly stored it's it's but there's no replication if it goes down it goes down and that's too bad we have like three or four copies of wanic server that matters a lot cuz that's got footage that we have not yet edited there is no finished video it's not uploaded to float plane or YouTube or whatever else any who hit me again Dan hi lld in the US we've recently had a Cyber attack on charge Health uh change change Healthcare that has shut down about a
fifth of all Hair healthc Care transactions haircuts haircuts was wondering if you've heard about it up in Canada no no but I think this kind of thing is going to become more and more common and especially by state actors you're going to see them going after things like infrastructure you know all of a sudden if you know the Eastern seab board doesn't have any working traffic lights or you know if your hydroelectric dams just stop functioning it's going to be far more detrimental than um traditional
types of warfare and or will enhance the effectiveness of traditional types of warfare we're headed into very very scary times folks being positioned as a deterrent a lot of different countries it's an it's an Open Secret that they are in each other's infrastructure and it's like yeah if we end up in a war you'll have no water power anything mutually and that would suck a lot and like millions of civilians will die so maybe we shouldn't go after each other  deterrence last one I got for you here
yo Linux just got hired as the first salesman for a video game production company looking to grow video production company video production company sorry there's split here uh looking to grow how did you know it was the right time to build out a sales team and who's the first sales hire I knew it was the right time because I didn't have time to keep doing it I was the one who was doing all the like sponsor negotiations um and it was a ton of work like obviously I understand the product
really well I I can sell it um but what I ended up doing was not selling it for as much as I could have because I didn't have time to negotiate and I couldn't get back to people in a in in a timely manner and so our customer service wasn't very good and stuff and our first hire was actually Luke's friend because I don't know he might know business stuff and stuff I don't think I interviewed a ton of people for the position yeah I was wondering what your recollection of that would be um
because I was annoyed with lonus for giving money back to companies do you remember this no we would like do a project and they'd be happy with it and you'd be like a it wasn't good enough and they'd be like oh we're like pretty happy with it and you'd be like no take some money back you did that multiple times I know one of them I know I'm remember one of them very vividly but I know you did that more than once um which which one do you remember vividly I'm I'm super curious now I don't
remember that it's probably fine for me to say the company name but I'm just going to type it like one of my whole things I talked to the sales team about this um now is the idea is not to do a one-time deal I can probably just say it but I just okay the idea is not to do a one-time deal the idea is to deliver enough value that they want to come back for more and to and to to have a recurring business relationship with with anyone who engages with you because it's so much
easier to retain a customer than it is to attract a new one which I think is super legit but the original price was already low and they were happy with it yeah so he says it was Corsair but what what was it though do you remember what project it was it  I was it the sword one I don't even remember a sword anything no there was like I jumped off a fence with a sword it was that time frame quiet okay it was that time frame but I'm pretty sure it was Corsair H I think it was around that
time though yeah I'm not sure I could be wrong but it's been too long was it a production job like did the video belong to them so I don't think it would have been Corsair at that time then because I don't know that we were a little they were building out their own internal video production team at that time and I think they were like trying to not be dependent I could have bits wrong but I remembered it was like it was frustrating being a part of the team and seeing lus sit at his desk for extended
periods of time when he could be doing other things um doing business deals and doing them in a lot of in my opinion uh in a lot of ways poorly so hey did your paycheck ever bounce no all right then I don't want to hear it but I was like it's up to me how much I mark up your labor sir this is a sign I didn't make this system but damn it I'm going to participate in it wait what this is a significant potential growth is to get someone else to do this cuz maybe they'll do a better job and also
lonus is time being used for this also just sucks so there was there was like a two-fold thing so I brought Nick out for like dinner or something and I was like bro you need to like quit school and come do this crazy thing with me I know it's nuts I know your parents are probably not going to be stoked mine weren't stoked but it'll be fine his parents are okay with it now yeah yeah I  and then yeah that that happened they seem chill with it now I think you interviewed like basically no I think it
was basically just yeah I think I might have just interviewed Nick yeah um yeah yeah I don't think that was a stage where we were exactly getting like a lot of and by the way no Luke's paycheck did not include ran board he had to pay you had to pay rent not much uh yeah that's what I was going to clarify and he was living with us at our house uh it was even worse because we had to feed him and it which was your idea I know which was awesome look I was trying insane de I was trying I try I try to create an
environment that is mutually beneficial Luke yeah I just I remember I remember I don't know if I overheard it or I might have even just genuinely been there for the conversation but I remember ion like kind of breaking down the cost of like ingredients even not even counting like her time for which by the way is valuable yeah Y and she was like this just really doesn't make any sense if I remember correctly you guys were like negative just on the ingredients let alone giving me a room to live in so I
was like wow this is an incredibly good deal um yeah as long as you don't mind  Yeah which I mean see I didn't realize until much later how paper thin those walls were yeah cuz I never I never went in that room I didn't care like that was not a room that I would go into I lived directly across the hall yeah like literally directly our our doors faced each other yep yeah it's all it's all good yep I had headphones like it's it's actually like fine I don't know you just play music do
something else it doesn't matter I can't the the place I lived before that was uh a like shared living scenario with a bunch of college age people yeah the place I lived before that was another shared living scenario with a bunch of collegee people this was not a new thing I was already fully desensitized see the thing is it was for me I never lived in a shared space with a bunch of college aged people and uh I just had never really gone in that room and said hey hun can you like make
noises and I'll see if I can hear them turns out yeah so there's that yeah yeah anyways uh what are we supposed to talking about think it's I mean topics are on the card so okay I think it's topics uh will AI replace call centers in Brackets probably not Clara an e-commerce e-commerce an e-commerce fintech Company Karma Ecommerce country I'm sorry lonus we're both all messed up today yeah we'll do better has been bragging that it's new open AI in enabled customer service chatbot has been doing the jobs
of 700 customer service workers equivalent to the number of employees it laid off in 2022 coincidence I don't think so they say yes yeah uh this has sparked concerns at some customer service centered firms but others are skeptical according to Clara the bot has handled around 2.3 million service chats in the past month around 2/3 of chat conversations with customers Clara claims that the bot has a satisfa rate on par with human agents and will drive a $40 million USD profit Improvement in
2024 however people who've actually used the chat bot say it's mostly just filtering customers who neglected to read the FAQ and supporting documents mostly through telling them direct quotes from the supporting documents which is a job that customers support people do I would point out discussion question how much uh of the fear we have about Job automation thanks to AI is a matter of reframing trends that were already happening yeah because like this is there was already
customer service chat Bots yeah they didn't need to be AI a lot of them were to be pretty effective better the Lego one is awesome like I sent it to the LTT store guys I was like I'm glad I didn't have to talk to a human yeah well more more accurately I'm glad I didn't have to wait around for a human because it just I I just had a missing piece and it just immediately resolved highly transactional things like that which most customer service inquiries are yeah it's nice to be able to effectively type
through a form hey I got I got the wrong thing it's a dynamic form hey what's the status of my order like that's mostly  yeah yeah um moving on Lenovo good topic yeah launches repairable laptops this is really exciting Lenovo is is partnering with I fix it can I fix it all these Brands win harder like I don't I don't get it this is crazy they're partnering with I fix it on a series of ThinkPad business laptops with user replaceable Parts owners of the T14 Gen 5 and t16
gen 3 will be able to independently swap out the battery Ram SSD and Wi-Fi module actually that's not really as exciting as I thought it might be um our notes that is not more that's then used to be default um oh okay well this is less of a threat to framework than I sort of thought it might be uh the CPU is still soldered although I would have assumed that that's they just they just come in BGA packages these days um are we sure that's it is that a Miss they will come
with easily accessible repair guides in videos though that's good I fixed it gave the new laptops a parability score of 99.3 out of  so investment disclosure framework appears to be safe for now since Lenovo is not talking about upgradeability and that's a big I don't have any investment in framework they have a massive value at over this it's not even close however I'm willing to bet these thinkpads are more price competitive frw workk because they know that at most you will be fixing it not using you know
lower margin uh lower cost parts to upgrade it um so you'll have to you'll have to Reby a laptop if you actually want a faster one so this is cool and I'm really glad to see that this conversation is not going anywhere but so far none of the tier ones have seen what framework is doing and gone I can do that and I would like them to uh I been part of the goal the whole time yeah I uh I have no intention to sell my framework shares they're only they're only profitable if I ever sell them um so for
me it's just an investment into this movement I want to see it be a success and uh I'm really I'm really glad ultimately I think what I was trying to do has borne out better than I could have expected yeah you've been well I I don't want to too attribute too much to you but I think framework's existence and its success has inspired at least some amount of change especially in the laptop industry but we're seeing it spill out to other ones as well and I think that For Better or For Worse the
discourse around me and framework whether it's people complaining about you know the ethics of it or or people whatever just the the the association I think has been good for the framework brand um and so that goal that I had of putting my money into it and saying no really I believe in this enough to do this um I think it's had an impact kind of ironically I think whenever whenever you do the uh like warning I am an investor in this thing people are going to look into it it like gives it more exposure it's
almost like more helpful that you have to tell people every time you talk about a laptop it like totally works out because goal sometimes I forget because it just it makes no difference to me yeah I'm going to use it the main reason I daily drive it is not because it's my favorite laptop the main reason that I daily drive it is because I want to force myself to be a user so that I can good feedback give them feedback anytime I run into a problem uh so that I I can make a difference like that's that's the
that's the reason I'm doing it um there there's multiple laptops that I like better than it I'm a huge fan of the Asus RG uh flow x13 for example we're looking at think awesome standardization updates for systems here in a big conversation is like how many people are going to be how many people are we going to move to laptops effectively oh like and not even have desktops anymore yeah oh interesting tell me more yeah and in that conversation because there's been like a cost benefit discussion one of
them is that a lot of people that have desktops tend on uh eventually ending up with both so if they're going to have both they might as well just have a laptop and a solid dock uh then not paying for like two licenses of things like our yeah basically so it's not just cheaper in licenses it's cheaper in Hardware it's cheaper in a lot of different ways it might also even literally be easier for them to just have one instead of two um and then they can also have this uh company secured device that they can
take home if they need to work from home for being sick or whatever else other reason etc etc etc there's there's a lot of arguments for it it shouldn't be everybody obviously I want to put editors on laptops I would just be stupid um but uh some some people and in that conversation it's like okay what do we go with because we basically just want to have one because this only really fits the use case of the like low-end desktop user who basically just needs a browser or that type of stuff because if
the second you need like a GPU well I don't really want you on a laptop anyways so it's it only really fits one type of user so we probably only need one type of laptop so what don't one do we go with framework keeps working its way into the conversation and then working its way back out because they're price yeah cost matters right especially when we're buying like a bunch of them and we need to have someone Reserve that's pretty costly but then we do still care about things like
repairability we do still care about total cost of ownership yes so sometimes it kind of works its way back in and it's like right but what if all that was broken was a stupid you know fingerprint sensor or whatever the case may be and you know what there's a lot of really repairable laptops from guys like HP yeah from guys like Lenovo but will they maintain stock yeah of all those little replacement bits and bombs I don't know it does I will to throw Lenovo a bone here it it does help
they're partnered with iix it that makes me believe they will a little bit more um the the partner with I fix it every time that happens my like how much I believe in this thing that they're doing does go up I hope I fix it doesn't sell out me too because right now they have an amazing name to throw on projects yeah I fix it is awesome I I immediately trust someone more when they're partnered with iix it's 100% which is a hard thing to earn and easy to lose very easy thing to lose
so hopefully they keep holding on to it I believe they will um but you never know someone's going to retire at some point uh leadership will roll over Crystal D Fier 88 asks wouldn't framework just Supply laptops for LTT and float plane oh wow so let me let me put it this way as a shareholder of framework wouldn't want them to do that I want them to do that just give away laptops if I found out that that was a thing that they were going to do I'd be like who else are you guys giving
laptops to you guys crazy we're not even asking them you're you're backordered for four months yeah ship your laptops to your customers you mad Lads for real yeah like if if that was a move that was going to be done it would be for effectively marketing and advertising and they're they're buying on shipment so it's not a problem yeah yeah yeah no please no they we got other things to work on also we got like a hundred people so yeah it'd be like at least it's not going to everybody though oh
that's true that's true so some people will still end up having desktops and laptops some people end up do wrers will need them writers are probably going to need them writers are probably still going to need desktops yep it is what it is but like me for example I could just have a laptop would you go 13 or 16 if you were getting a framework 16 do you need a GPU oh is that the differ I don't it the 16 has a GPU I don't need a GPU to be honest oh but you would just want the
bigger screen yeah oh okay okay that makes sense oh man see that's the thing is framework doesn't have a broad enough product pfolio because I would tell you you well you should just get something with a bigger screen that's a thinner device because you don't if you don't need the power then you don't need all that bulk you don't need all that weight has a really good cooling system in it do you need that no yeah it's tough it's tough you should use that folding one that I had for a
little bit that think so cool yeah that one is pretty cool the review is finally coming soon part of this whole thing like yeah like could maybe have something different but part of the whole thing is in general standardization this guy I could have something different because you know I'm in charge what a guy I'm have something to I'm going to have something different too I'm going to have this laptop of course yeah get I'm going to have it right now sure I'd rather have help hosting the
show actually wait no okay I'm  GPU um but yeah like we're we're trying to pick what oh no the oh did I unplug something oh no I think so cool what just happened like it just shut down yeah nice that's uh sweet I'm helpful like that I I'm fast quick fingers there you go um you should see how quick I am  though what I I think Luke missed it oh I don't think he saw really oh oh that's even better that's pretty funny you have the VOD I yeah I know I have no idea oh boy don't worry about it could you allow
that type of thing on Flo plane we definitely do I don't even know what it was but yeah yeah we've uh We've we've debated internally many times you know what would be our limits for content on float plan I think Luke and I are both pretty uh if it's legal it's uh it's allowed on float plane but we've never really had anyone approach us being like you know I want to do only fans but I don't want to go on only fans I we have really yeah oh I didn't know that y oh okay and it just came down to why I
think the platform features were pretty limited back in the day yes we even support DM they wanted to upload pictures and we only at that time supported videos oh that's funny and I  well sorry only videos and they were like nah like okay someone's like don't do that guys how about this how about just how about just subscribe to it that's that's the thing that's that's the reason why we kind of think this way is you would literally have to be actively giving them money in order to see their
content so if you don't want to see their content don't actively give them money now we are partnered with stripe and uh effectively PayPal through brain tree so they exert a significant portion of control which is very interesting to me and very interesting that so many people are cool with this but theyt actually a lot of control um so it wouldn't be exactly the same as something like an only fence because if we have nudity on the platform it has to fall under the artistic license assuming
anyone ever noticed anyway yeah because they have to pay to see it and we're a pretty small platform but um so that's why for a long time there I don't think it's as popular anymore because people just ye it over to only fans and then just went full ham but for a long time there there was a ton of there there was a there's lots of other there was a ton of artistic nudity on patreon a lot of people were doing cosplays while nude why do you think that's happening it's because it fit
under the terms and conditions that patreon had because patreon was partnered with whoever at the time right a striper whoever it was yeah it was it was the payment processor that was running through patreon at the time and then only fans came out and everyone dropped the yeah like pork everyone dropped the like clams everyone dropped the shade and just started going fully for it because they they were only doing the artistic part to fit under that license but that's what we would have as well is it 
havek I had I had to have a conversation around that time that I had that conversation with that person I had to have a conversation with my development team at the time be like like if one of these things has a transcoding failure oh I see yeah I was like are you guys cool with this and I like advise people at the time I was like you should like talk to your partner right right yeah so I was like don't tell me right now right yeah like go think about it and come back and
everyone was like yeah it's fine don't think it's going to happen that often anyways and like then it ended up never  matter and chovies though I'm I'm not sure what that's a euphemism for that's a difficult one yeah you're just very small y small pointy wait plenty po um big swarm packed in all together this week in AI background musac and 2D game worlds yeah Adobe has revealed a prototype for a new generative AI tool Project Music gen AI Control that allows users to both
generate and edit music it's broadly expected that adobe will eventually integrate this tool into Premier and audition like the integrated generative fill into Photoshop uh Google Deep Mind researchers have published a paper debuting a machine learning model that can create a playable Game World from a single image uh General uh generative interactive environments or Genie was "trained on over 200,000 hours of videos" from 2D Platformers and currently can only make very low resolution 2D
Platformers that operate for 16 seconds at 1 frame per second but you got to start somewhere I guess yeah and finally researchers at Alibaba have created an AI system called emote portrait alive or emo that can convincingly animate portrait photos emote portrait alive or emo yeah emo that can convincingly animate portrait photos to show them speaking or even singing along to an audio track uh okay this video demonstration of emo shows sora's AI Sora ai's famous Tokyo lady
talking as well as animated images of real life politicians okay so let's have  this em really they went straight for  alive huh I mean some parts of this are pretty uh this doesn't look better than what we already have to be completely honest well uh it's pretty good yeah remember too that they are they're they're doing this with one image oh yeah so here it shows the reference image oh and then it shows her talking okay that's actually pretty crazy yeah it's pretty nuts okay all right what are we looking 
here it's not perfect but this black and white one in particular is uh the fact that it comes off of one image is  wild wow that is uh there's odd eye movements here and there but if someone sent me this I would not immediately realize frame rate feels weird different things like that feel weird but yeah there's a good comparison at the end of that video where it shows off a bunch of different models compared to theirs uh at the end of that video uh the one down underneath the abstract should be near
the end this one this one here yeah oh okay at the end you said yeah I think the the comparison's near the    ours man I wish those were a little longer  scary yep want to talk about h P printer subscriptions sure I guess HP has actually launched a printer subscription as hinted at previously in a wildly unpopular interview with CEO Enrique lores hp's Allin plan offers customers an option of three rented printers and a scaling monthly fee the cheapest plan is $7 a month oh my
God and has a cap of 20 pages per month I was trying to stay calm but what the crap dude 20 Pages a month for seven I could literally go to Costco and print like photos for that there's a 12-day grace period after which the customer will be forced into a 2-year commitment or a cancellation fee that is worth a significant fraction of the retail cost of the printer that fee then doubles after 30 days meaning that if you attempt to return the printer three 13 days after sign up it'll cost more than
buying the printer outright this is complete Madness feel like a scam HP will replace a printer if it starts to fail or after it's been in use for 2 years the printer also informs HP whenever it's running out of ink which HP will send to the customer for no additional charge okay so it includes ink that's something but 20 pages yeah EX for $7 a month that's $85 a year I'm not going to spend that on ink $85 a year for for 240 pages of text are you kidding me HP is marketing this subscription as
a way to leave behind the hassle and never- ending struggle of owning a printer hey HP I've got another idea to take away the hassle and never- ending struggle of owning a printer don't buy aing HP printer how about that cool what's the different okay so the the plan isn't the scaling of the plan is by printer I'm looking at their official site right now um and so in hpah says all 20 of my pages will be solid black you're still getting host U HP Envy is seven bucks a month the HP Inspire is n bucks a month
the HP Office Jet I got to interrupt you here why the is V Voodoo PC branding being used on printers remember when they bought Voodoo PC so they could use the Envy brand the Envy why is that on a white boring rectangular printer who is of do you know what a voodoo Envy looked like okay this yeah they was sick this is a voodoo Envy hold on one moment   oh actually I stand corrected this is an omen okay so this was their uh this was they did this goldplated one this was a a gaming PC yeah uh hold on I forget
what the Envy was no no the Envy was their laptop okay hold on hold on let me find it let me find it okay um there okay this this is a voodoo Envy can I go back to your computer yeah that is not an Envy anything it's an Envy Inspire no it isn't it neither inspires Envy nor does it Inspire anything else look at it moderate I I this this whole thing sucks like look look at this one sec okay so I got the printers right Bambi says maximum speed of 10 pages per minute so you get 2 minutes of printing per
month I uh imagine a car that you could drive for 2 minutes at Max 2 minutes at maximum maximum speedometer speed a month um so if if when you click on compare plans because it just shows these plans right starting at whatever when you click compare plans it's just printer specs there's no it it details nothing it doesn't even say how many times you can print yet compare plants just printer specs I love that I love that the paper tray  the output capacity is three months you
could not clear the output tray on your printer that middle one for three months yeah okay so so you just print things just so that you can use up your your allocation not because you actually need the stuff you just leave it there guys I know I needed to click customize plan my my joke the joke that I was pointing out was you click compare plan and it doesn't compare the plan it just compares the printers anyways now that we're on customized plan you can select the three different printers whichever
one you want so let let's just go with HP Office Jet Pro it actually looks like that looks like an Office Jet Pro exactly at least it's not trying to pretend to be an Envy Inspire no okay yeah I'm actually going to go with Envy Inspire because this is this is like a if you wanted a nice printer for at home right seems about right I don't know sure looks pretty much the same as the printers we used to sell when I was at Best Buy um 13 bucks a month is 100 Pages a month $9 a month
is 20 Pages a month and they put popular on the moderate one which is 100 Pages a month so they clearly want you to do this because they I don't think they expect anyone to get light so I think the whole 20 Pages yeah I think it's like uh whatever yeah it's there so that you look at it and go oh I don't want that and then you go up to this can I propose a different solution just buy yourself a cheap color laser laser yeah the nozzles don't it you're not going to be printing photos
on it I'm sorry just do that at Costco uh but the nozzles don't get clogged so you will probably if you are one of those light users you will probably never replace a toner drum and you will probably never replace that printer uh up until no I was about to say up until very recently but I still have it I still have my Samsung ml16 or ml20 something whatever it is color laser print I don't remember the last time I replaced toner in it and I can still manage to fight my way through
driver installations even though HP these butt chugs uh bought Samsung's printer business and make it really difficult to use old Samsung printers on new devices the one thing I couldn't use it on was Chrome OS I had to have something slightly newer to get it to work on chromeos and there's some like hacky way to set up a relay or something but I was like I use my other computer that's probably the same printer you had when we did the Linux challenge yeah it is and it was Flawless back then yeah
it's fine on Linux but it won't work on chrom OS because they don't have the driver and there might be some way to like hack it in or something I don't know I just didn't feel like dealing with it when my desktop was right there and I could just go print it there so they say that the hpmv Inspire is the popular printer option if you go down to the standard HP Envy which is probably everything most people need they they recommend the terrible plan oh I see so they only want you buying it for $7 a
month if you have a printer that's worth like 70 bucks yeah I see office jet pro what do they recommend there 100 Pages a month on The Office Jet Pro is 17 bucks  crazy my goodness please no one do this go buy a laser printer I'm going to I'm going to go on Facebook marketplace right now so if you want to buy me some time I'm going to I'm going to shop for Laser Printers right now yeah sounds good uh I don't know if there's any other topics for us so I might need to get Dan to throw me a thing yeah we're
done all the topics actually uhoh you got one for me I'm sure uh is it after dark time it might be after dark time it is uh you just transition to that you want to just do that now no here we go hey Luke yeah last W show you mentioned about people using remote raid passes instead of going outside yeah have you seen people playing on multiple phones and if is this a form of cheating or not it's the it's not not a competitive game what do you mean cheating this this is you're only cheating yourself I have
so many issues with Pokémon go and Pokemon go players I have so many I'm going to go get some Welches and then I'll be happy to listen I thought you're looking at printers I will okay he's just also going to do that um good choice but yeah it's who cares who cares at all it's uh it's oh there's there there is technically PVP in the game um if you want to look up strategies one of the most popular ones is to basically AFK it's called tanking you basically AFK and drop your rating
and then you play back up and win all the time and get all the rewards for winning all the time and you just do that over and over again um so no one cares really also the PVP in Pokémon go is horrible and if you really wanted to uh play PVP Pokemon you should go play in other ways the um as far as I can tell it's the only good thing about the C current Pokémon standard Mainline video games is their uh online competitive play because people actually do seem to like it so that's cool so go
do that or something I don't know don't don't play PVP Pokemon go um the the whole remote raid passes thing is uh I I can get I can get pretty spicy on that but I would have no issue if they completely remove that from the game um I have I even have some ideas on how they can make cuz people people immediately when you try to say that will jump on you and be like a rural players whatever um I think there's a lot of different solutions that they could do to make that better I sometimes like to bring up
my story of the first day that Pokémon go came out which is I was like I want to get a geod dude and went to go hike a mountain with Pokémon go and then immediately was like there's nothing here what's happening I didn't think they would just make it a city game I didn't expect that to be a thing so yeah they could obviously make that better um I think there's also ways that they could make rating for Rural communities better by um by there was this this idea that I had where like if you if you like
battled in a gym somewhere you could have like established that you've been at that gym before so if you go to a gym that's in your hometown that has the same rate as this other gym you could link into that one and play with the people that were there but you'd still have to physically go to it um people thinking it's more accessibility it's like yeah okay but a lot of people are not using it that way yeah and like it's it's a little hard to like okay we need to break the entire core functionality of the
game so that people that have difficulty going outside don't have to go outside it's like okay I understand but the whole point of the game is going outside so that puts them in a really difficult position where they can't have Solutions what what are they going to have you have to like upload a picture of your broken leg Yeah and then like what upload a new one every month to show that's not healed yet like like what like what are we even asking for here the way that I've experienced it is um
I'll I'll like go out to a community day and go walk around I'm I'm all stoked cuz I get in my like 18 kilometers or whatever I'm like yeah this is why I'm playing I'm out moving I'm talking to people this is good uh and then the Community Day end ends and I'm like oh I could like extend this experience for myself by going and doing some raids and everyone around is like yeah I'm going to go home just send me a send me an invite I'll remote raid in and the last one that I did after the event when it
was like time to go do raids literally everyone left and I had no less than eight people ask me to just remote invite them to raids and I was the last person there and I was like oh no I'm just going to go home I'm not going to like facilitate remote inviting a bunch of people I don't care like which which reduces the amount of like there there is a very negative impact on these types of things on the community and I actually personally this is going to drive a bunch of people nuts and I
understand I am not a friendly person in the Pokémon go Community don't like me um but I respect that ntic has held back raid passes and limits how many you can use per day because on on one hand people will rage at them for any amount of uh you know microtransactions in this free game which is crazy they have to do something or else they won't be a company anymore and then on the other hand they'll demand that you allow them to buy the higher priced remote raid passes because remote raid passes are
more expensive I'm sing this to lus because he probably doesn't know um so they can sit at home and raid from home and I'm like no the reason why this game is sick is cuz you go out and walk the game itself is terrible oh I sit on my phone I go like it's not it's not a good game the PVP is terrible the catching of Pokemon is terrible it's it's like designed to keep you in the cities which is not cool like it's not actually a good game the good part part of the game is that it Inspire it gives you some
gamified reason to go out and walk and be outside touch grass so like do that and if you're not going to do that if you're sitting at home man there are so many better games to play like I don't know um people don't want to hear that truth man but I want to play this one stop just like wasting your money like a remote rate pass I'm guessing it's all OB fiscated cuz it's through coins and you would have to buy coins to be able to buy it whatever um I'm guessing it's at least
a1ar $150 and you're getting a couple minutes of enjoyment out of this and then at the end the thing that you want is like a a high value Pokemon out of it which is going to be extremely rare because it's either a shiny or it's like a 100% IV thing ofama uh both of those are extremely rare you are probably going to be disappointed statistically you're going to be disappointed at the end of this thing so you're going to spend spend a lot of money per minute compared to pretty much
any other activity you can do and be disappointed most of the time just don't  it just don't do it Nike I don't know and like to be clear play the game however you want I'm just saying when I when I see people complain about this stuff he'll judge you yeah kind of a little bit and you can judge me that's fine maybe I'm a bad person for whatever reason I just I the only reason why I see Pokémon go is a good game is cuz it gets me it gets me outside it's something that I can very
easily play with a variety of members of my family I can get my mom my dad out they can have a good time we can all be walking around together talking about probably unrelated things throwing some pokeballs around being guided around by this little game because it's like oh there's some cool thing over there there's a gym over there we can do a raid we can do this other thing so it inspires you to keep moving keep walking around do this healthy positive good thing um and then people take it and they're
like no I just want to sit on the couch all the time I'm happy that Pokémon go introduce a system so that you could still play it during Co when you were supposed to stay inside that was smart it was a good move we can go outside now go outside again cool yeah did you play Ingress yes and for the exact same reasons why I like Pokemon go all right hit me Dan oh sure are we moving to after dark or did you find pictures of printers oh right I remember oh here let's see what kind of things show
up on Linus's Facebook Marketplace let's play that game first nice hey Charizard cars that makes sense listen to us kids toys yep whatever the this is Charizard no I know what a Charizard is but what is this I have no idea exactly OKAY model Gundam World War II stuff okay uh custom kinetic computer cases I mean man Facebook Market place like oh what did I do I clicked the wrong thing sorry I'm I'm navigating from uh very far away right now does it move yeah that's cool that's
sweet this is probably like uh it's probably like some how is it $100 yeah it's probably like they buy them on AliExpress and resell them or something no 911 ooh a Sony q q oh I think you mean clay I no they spelled it right I just can't see from here personal entertainment organizer what is a personal entertainment organizer whoa oh it's an organizer okay neat a CW Devastator ooh futur complete 19 DVD Disc set in a bender head that's  okay yeah yeah that's probably pretty
representative okay let's learn about uh  printer nice 48 bucks I have no idea if that one's any good but you could almost certainly use the oh you know what let's   color HP darn it and that says monochrome dang it Facebook here we go Canon Image class color Wireless all-in-one laser printer okay that's 250 bucks that's a lot but that's also a lot of printer um 120 bucks for a Lex Mark that's probably not a bad option especially if it comes with some additional toner that's wild actually
what I would want to spend one that's crazy probably around a 100 bucks is what I would be targeting here's 150 Canadian so that's more like $115 us um you could probably get $20 one for 100 bucks y somewhere in that range if you message him like I've got cash I can come now like it's pretty good chance you'll get it that's what I would be looking for the only things you're going to want to make sure of is that you can still get replacement toner for It um and that it still has drivers for your
current operating system if you don't feel like fighting with things Bart the tech said that brother one is amazing back when I was at Best Buy the Brother Laser Printers were like crazy we'd sell them all the time no one would ever bring them back they were great all right wo after dark let's go that was a crazy long time ago just so everyone know it's not an endorsement I don't know if they're still good yeah brother might be your uncle by now yeah it could be yeah oh Dan's getting it all right
cool it would be funny if like br's aged like if brother brother actually just became like Uncle at some point Grandpa great  printer Ancient One shut your printing   goodness okay all right let's go you want some merch messages my mother is working in dermatology and told me their laser they use requires a subscription to give treatments have you guys experienced anything for labs that  use timing that one worked out well hadman shared this link and it's actually very funny it's from The Verge
I want to show it really quick go for it best printer 2023 just buy this Brother laser printer everyone has it's fine yeah the brother whatever it is will print return labels for online ship shopping never run out of toner and generally be a printer instead of a physical instantiation of a business model it's so funny 120 bucks brand new Brother laser printer Works sounds good like yeah exactly I think I've had that one for like 12 years I train I've changed the toner cartridge once and you can pretty
much just shake them and then they're good for another six years it prints black and it's perfect that article is actually brilliant I'll scroll a little further down to the bolded text keep going chat GPT ideas about printers I didn't even proof read this don't read it unless you are a lonely Google search robot in which case look at this incredible demonstration of experience Authority and trustworthiness and rank  printer 100% piss take love it but it's also right I don't know back in the day
it sound it sounds like it might still be true back in the day the the whole thing was bu the best bang for the buck Brother printer and just don't worry about it how often do you need to print color black laser yeah forever it just lasts forever they're like a 100 bucks yeah 120 apparently yeah and it comes with Wi-Fi all right back to the subscriptions for things related to Labs I mean there subscriptions related to pretty much everything you guys if it's a commercial product the manufacturer is
trying to turn it into a subscription right now and um you know some things are explicitly subscriptions and other things are implicitly subscriptions we've already had to recertify our chroma power supply tester for example recertifications okay it's not a subscription but effectively is you buy the product once and then you give them money every year or every two years or whatever the time period is until forever yep okay uh you can't go to anyone else for it so it's a subscription right so
uh absolutely there are there are definitely uh things that we that we are going to need subscriptions for but it's one of those things that you know I think that we can in time do enough testing and create enough value with the testing that we're doing that we can um make that department profitable somehow and um and and and justify the the few subscriptions that we absolutely need in order to get our work done I mean obviously we're going to try to find uh you know and rather than subscribing to
a you know benchmarking service or something like that we're going to try to you know build our own thing um as much as we can but you can't completely avoid it these days it's just not possible and in the case of those laser treatments yeah absolutely they just want a piece of of every transaction they don't want to just sell you the equipment and then let you profit off of it forever when they could take a piece of every single time you zap  yep hello dll what's the shelf life of
PTM 7950 honey well States it's 12 months is it safe to use after I will never use all of it in one year don't want to waste a good product so you asked a question and then you immediately answered it I think it's 12 months with that said I would be extremely surprised over engineered if a product that is designed to last in your laptop for many years and many thermal Cycles I would be very surprised if it suddenly evaporated after 12 months on a shelf I think if you just pretend it's
cooling or heat transferring the things that it's between what I do suspect is that it may be more difficult to apply in that case like it may be harder to peel the thing that may be the period of time that Honeywell validated it for in storage um as opposed to the period of time that they actually expect it to last but realistically I'm not going to say anything other than what's on honey will spec sheet so 12 months buy a small one most of the people that are actually
a customer of Honey Wells are going to be buying in such a high quantity that that 12 months is more like yeah probably don't buy more than this worth of  yeah buy a subscription pretty much oh hold on uh Nick just messaged me he says it's fine longer than that apparently Kyle has used it after like four years but technically 12 months expiry because that's what they certify it for it is less Malle malleable after 12 to 24 months yeah so application ISU all right I'm sure it's
fine next up what do you think of the White House urging people to only use memory safe programming languages uh it's interesting the the whole Tech you know developer Twitter and social space is kind of meing on it um let's go Tech political Grandpa yeah I don't think anyone's really acting on it so much um I wouldn't be too surprised if you were a development host of sorts that did development um and a development host that did development uh what I meant to say is development host
that did development for governments or or tried to play for development uh contracts for governments that you might want to start leaning towards those because if the government's like hey use these things maybe you want to play into that a little bit I don't know I'm not in that space um but I suspect that might be a thing um yeah rust mentioned yeah yeah a lot of people are happy about that um it's cool I don't know yeah I I don't see genuinely see or in conversations that
I've had I don't think anyone's changing paths because of this but uh it's interesting and like I said I suspect government contractors might want to pay a little bit more attention than anyone else hi when. K-C love the the show this question is for lonus planning on building a house in the future and was considering radiant floor heating but wanted opinions on it how have you been liking it uh radiant heating can be great uh it's if you live in a place where natural gas is inexpensive like I do
then it can be a very economical way to heat your house in the winter it is delightful when you are getting out of bed on those winter mornings when you know you don't want to necessarily pay a ton of money to heat the house to Tropical temperature but uh you do have your heat on on the floors and you step on those nice toasty floors it's it's pretty cool dude I don't have to worry about it I my building has a very high ratio of much older people in it that makes sense and they just cook my
apartment everyone else's apartments around us just crank the Heat and it feels like it's summer oh okay our heat like almost never turns on that's pretty funny and it's never very cold every once in a blue moon I I will like notice there's not a ton of cars in the parking area and then I'll like go upstairs and be like oh it's cold yeah okay to like turn the heat up because they're literally they also micromanage their thermostats and if they're not at home they turn it off yeah that's
awesome weird but yeah uh I'm really happy with it but I haven't had a leak so if I did I'd probably be less happy with it they are rare though because the tubes are encased in concrete so you know technically nothing should go  know hey lonus Luke and Dan wasn't there a plan to sell cables that were tested by you guys is that the still plan or a dead project uh we are planning to develop cables and we will test a lot of cables and make sure our cables are the awesome cables I'm not going to say
they're the best because there's lots of great cables out there and we're not going to try to pretend that we have a magic cable that's better than any other cable on the market but ours will be very very good with that said we have definitely fallen behind on our original plan for the cable tester which was to produce content with it like every quarter or so and just like test lots of HDMI cables and lots of USB cables and lots of display port  sorry hello lld longtime listener first
time caller have you heard that due to changes in Google's policy Google Assistant will no longer be available on Samsung TVs what's your take on that oh no no I haven't heard of that but I um no actually uh H trying to think what I would do you not have phones Ty and Os deserves to die anyway uh no functionality that was included with a device when you researched it and paid for it should be taken away that but otherwise I um I don't see this as something that would be a great 
personally how long does it take to make the average clothing item everything I've gotten has been great quality and I keep coming back oh my God I just killed one that's been in development for over a year yesterday oh uh I haven't actually told the team it's dead yet oh they know whose mom you're talking about they haven't seen her in a while um oh no liess anyway um yeah well uh this is this is like I could how about I talk about something that isn't canceled how about these
pants sure these are cargo pants they're really great um I really like them they have a pocket for for the uh Galaxy um Z fold 3 that I owe Dan and is hopefully charged so that I can uh wipe it and give it to him today I put it in here so I wouldn't forget and I totally forgot about it until I realized it was time to demo pants don't put it back in your got too many pockets um yeah yeah they really are quite cargo uh they're really expensive I think we might tone down some of the pockets a little bit to get
them to a price that is somewhat reasonable and then maybe we could bring back this version as like a cargo pants pro at some point these have been in development for over a year um you know our bathing suit launched in like fall or something like that because yeah yeah uh we do have we do have a bit of that yeah it's a it's a whole thing uh I mean the screwdriver was three years the Precision driver has been probably about a year I um even the fail pen the one that's just
made of like failed screwdriver shafts I think has been at least 6 months and it's not done yet so good good product design devel takes some time the thermal pad all we did was design a way to cut it up and put it in a box and that took a year and a half there's a lot of steps though there's lot of communication steps Honeywell doesn't pick up the phone for LT yeah I'm I'm sorry who are you a government no oh how did you get this number you know what it doesn't matter like it's 
government oh uh nope I don't have a source this let me go try to find that before I say  first you can hit me with another one in the meantime though Dan sure sure sure sure uh is there any old software or Hardware that's been long forgotten for example physx that you'd like to see come back again I would like to see a game developed with physics as a like like a multi player shooter game with physics as a core part of the gameplay as opposed to just kind of for show um I
know it's been done a couple times in the past but I feel like there's room to innovate there MH I keep installing the driver yeah yeah every single yeah if I'm going to have it I might as well uh you know might as well use it hey by the way there is no source for the thing I was going to say so I I will not say it this is not it I already stop searching for it oh but that's it hey D what do you think of software companies still having bugs in their code related to the
leap year our company was stuck with the Citrix solution to disable the time service and set the date to March the 1st it's kind of funny yeah it's pretty funny dates y 2K oh no no it's leap year I know it's just it's just funny when software has bugs caused by the date the date is surprisingly annoying to deal with didn't didn't we develop Linux time to like actually deal with this annoying I could not imag this is one of the reasons I'm not a programmer it's just time yeah um it's just time just time to
stop uh please ask the talent I think that's you guys what they think about Jensen saying don't learn coding just for NVIDIA to announce a coding llm the next day yeah it's a marketing thing yeah obviously he just wanted the headlines you you do still need to learn coding to use a coding LL well so there's a lot of arguments here there's been some arguments made by people much smarter than me um I I think it was John karmac um talking about how like while Jensen you know might not be
completely correct and it might not be his tool llms or not there's been this like ever marching path of abstraction and simplification in software development which does make sense so so it would make sense even if llm AI stuff never came to be that you would eventually be able to code through close to natural language at least for very simple things um but advanced stuff like oh man I really don't see that being completely done by AI for a long time and a lot of the core competencies of
software developers is deep difficult problem solving and solution finding um which just at its root is a skill that could be applied to a lot of other things um something that I've found to be kind of interesting is to watch people's career paths watch software developers career paths after they get laid off which has been a major thing lately we've seen what is it like layoff FYI you can see the like tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people getting laid off um and they tend
to be I accidentally screwed up a reply yes I believe we are restocking the keyboard pins but I'm not 100% sure they tend to be very successful um because the skills of deep deep problem solving and solution finding are applicable to a huge amount of things it's like it's like uh when I took physics in high school I thought it was one of the best courses I ever took not because of physics but because of the problem solving and task breakdown and how to learn basically that that teacher by using 
know um here's another one for Luke while lus does does some potentials hey Luke bread and 2019 lonus best tips for traveling the work uh traveling for work and living out of a hotel what are some of your top stories from conferences or events thanks I don't have a ton of tips for the first thing other than I I very much prefer to travel as light as a human L possible uh when we booked our our uh stay in Japan uh I think about half of the places we're staying have laundry so our plan is to take as little
clothing as possible I can't believe laundry is not a thing in North America at hotels it drives me absolutely crazy it's just common sense I'm going for two weeks so I have to bring 15 shirts like this is ridiculous I would be very careful uh because like uh the place that we stayed in Taiwan for example BNB okay okay okay cool I'm more talking to them though oh sure uh it's quite common that if your hotel has laundry in it that will be insanely expensive oh but it's like it $5 to do a single shirt um
and it doesn't go down no no no that's not what I'm talking about no no in Asia you can stay at places where like it's it's two bucks and they have like a washing machine and dryer it's awesome this was in Taiwan that's in Asia okay I'm just saying the place I stayed in Taiwan was amazing for that you stayed at the same place as me no I didn't yeah the last time we were in Taiwan we were in the same hotel when was the last time we were in Taiwan copy Tex like just this most recent one yeah okay that's
not what I'm I didn't use their laundry service my point is like the Wern theyh shirt for five bucks you can just Google Maps cuz I did this I used a laundry mat down the street sure this is my whole point it was like $2 okay well the place I stayed four years ago I guess in car for everything at compex on every floor had a laundry room oh sweet and it was like two and you just like use the Wasing machine it was amazing it was the best thing ever and I was like everything should
have this why do they have an ice machine but no laundry machine how often do I need ice how often do I need clothes let's go and if it's if it's in the hotel and it's like that and it's nice and cheap that's like Wicked if it's not there's probably a laundromat and you're probably not uh you know making your own food anyways cuz you're on the road so go drop your stuff off go get some food go pick it up you're done yep 100% it's great super easy super cheap super easy overpacking is like the
worst Noob move yep don't overpack uh as for stories I think uh my favorite story is probably from Japan that time that we did the WAN show from the hotel room and Ed was pass out drunk behind the camera like like could like was actually just lying there throughout the duration of the show he was trying to hold the legs to the camera which I think was for like his own stability more more than the cameras at that point but he's like his arms are over here and he's completely leaned
over that was awesome that way show is  up not a replaced Background by the way this is this is the actual W can man you remember when wcho was 48 minutes I think that was just so so that we could go check on Ed though make sure he wasn't dead yeah I think I think the worst part was when we filmed the video too right yeah we filmed a video because that was the L show but we filmed a video in in one of the rooms yep yeah yeah it was the whole thing pretty epic we used to go pretty hard
dude I don't think I could do it anymore not like that yeah that trip was rough yeah I I really like that trip but it was rough it was rough I I can't I've I've like tried it a few times um I can in one shot and then I need the recovery time like immediately back then I just I whatever forever I'll do it for a year who cares more than that but now yeah like if I stay up too late the next day I'm like  too hello Lena and Lucy we'll be going on a trip to Japan soon and need some
new clothes to pack lonus I remember you said you were planning a trip to Japan what are you most excited to see or do there I think everyone is going to Japan right now there's at least four people internally that are like going to Japan or just came back from Japan it's it's ridiculous um great I think they opened up later than most other countries after Co they had completely shut off vacation travel that makes sense uh I'm looking forward to seeing my children's happy
faces they really wanted to go pretty much everything we're doing is mostly like kid oriented so um I hope they have a really really good time and I have lots of good stories about it once I get back yeah should I get my eight and nine-year-old their own computers or just get one and do virtual machines they are homeschooled and like video games virtual machines it's an interesting idea yeah it's so okay do it if you're looking for a fun project and you are fully anticipating building the
second computer later anyway yeah that's a good one cuz it's clearly an option it's one of the options you're weighing would would you what would you think about just getting the one and then making them learn to share it I think that's actually solid yeah or just don't do either of those things and have one computer and be like you need to share yeah I I still remember uh we had we had a 30-minute cycle so like if if it was my turn on the computer I had 30 minutes and then it would be my brother's turn
on the computer and I remember my brother and I going to my mom to try to negotiate like we want bigger play Windows because there's things that we like can't do in that time like certain games like it's you just can't play it within that time window and I remember her being like I don't care this is set up so that like you won't fight each other and we were like oh okay sounds good um yeah I don't know two computers is a lot of money they're like eight I don't know make him share it iw.
dll for Luke do you think the lmg is still small and Nimble enough to adjust and stay relevant uh PS thanks for including models clothing sizes on the   are you trying to mock me for being big what no what is that being like what is this come at me we got this oh yeah in in regards to staying relevant no I'm not concerned about that um I I think like dude the the Kyle video was amazing um it actually it's it's like really long and I didn't realize that I actually watched the whole thing
um yeah I'm going to right now this one the Ultimate Upgrade took two years to be fair I didn't watch it on YouTube I watch it on Flow plane but that's a killer video the potato PC video is hilarious watching David at one point in time he like I don't know Spider-Man crab like shuffles towards something to talk about it and then like shuffles away I burst out laughing like I yeah I don't know I'm not worried about relevance um I think we have better a better team than ever I think we have
the quality of the videos right now is insane an endless bucket of ideas is um I think he made he made on the potato PC he made a mouse pad out of hash browns like come on are you not entertained like no I I don't think relevancy is an issue I think we will be able to keep releasing and this is someone who's not even on that team um I I I think we'll be able to keep releasing fantastic content um we are const conly taking criticism about the direction of our content or how out of
touch we are we've been being told we're out of ideas since the house yeah we're not out of ideas we're never going to be out of ideas uh there's an endless Wellspring of ideas I I I got into this with someone on Reddit a little while ago I went okay look you've got my attention tell me which content pieces and I think I said in the last uh out of the last 21 cuz I was I was trying to pick like an arbitrary CU they said recently the content has been trash and I said okay okay and there will be some
tips but that's like no no no no no there weren't I said which ones were trash tell me specifically like what about them was trash and they kind of come back with this sort of vague posty thing about how we used to be cool and now we're not and I'm like okay you got to actually hit me with something and they attacked me for the arbitrary 21 day uh or 21 video time frame and I was like okay how about this let's make it not arbitrary let's make make it 28 videos that's everything we've uploaded
since CES what was trash and they just like I kind of they came up with like nothing and at some point I'm like okay what it sounds like to me is that you criticizing the content but you are not watching it so how can you possibly say that recently anything when you haven't watched the video so I'll tell you what why don't you respond then once you've actually opened up your mind to enjoying it and watched something and then and then we can discuss what about it was trash but like this is your
opportunity to fix it if you really care you have my undivided attention right now tell me what the problem is and there just wasn't really one super common yeah it and it happens it happens all the time where people will say something like you guys are always making videos about stuff that's too expensive no one could afford anything you're talking about and I'll just I I'll break it down for them I'll go through okay here's the last month of videos yeah we had you know the world's biggest TV
um and then we had the found that thread very fast oh wow I'm impressed that was crazy uh it was oh is it float plane chat yeah oh yeah okay no found it like immediately well that makes sense um yeah so I basically I I basically said um now that it's not an arbit time frame can you point me to the trash that is geared toward the lowest common denominator and that's that's something I see a lot I see people uh talking about how our content is for Dum dummies dummies it's for people who people who
you know don't properly appreciate maybe I'm stupid because I like potato PC but I still like potato PC okay so I go on to say let's say let's say I was pretending that our videos really do have a lot of good educational nuggets and you were going to prove to to me that I'm wrong and that I'm a leader who is simply focused on profits which videos would you use to demonstrate that I don't even disagree that some videos SK toward entertainment more but if you're calling them trash it's clear
you've watched them and have strong feelings about them I'm just asking for that specific feedback or as I suggested before it's possible you haven't watched them if that's the case why did you type your original critique of our content are you even open to trying it and enjoying it yeah and that was where the back and forth that had actually gone back and forth and forth and back and forth and forth and forth like times or something like that um finally died off finally just died they just gave up and
they're like okay well you got me and I didn't watch I actually had no idea what I was talking about I think it's pretty common that like if someone's tastes change mhm now they're now deciding the thing that they used to like Now sucks even if that thing really didn't change much um sometimes that thing does change and sometimes we diverge but not always sometimes it diverges that's okay no relationship ship lasts forever at some point you know you change or someone dies or you know whatever and you might
even maybe you inspired to get into Tech by watching fun uh like entertainment kind of focused LTT style content and then now you're like a tech professional and you work in the it field and you're more interested in like uh Linux focused uh infrastructure videos and stuff like that and you don't want to watch t a particular model of network switch you know but we're never going to get to that kind of depth but that doesn't mean that content is now bad it just means you're looking for other stuff which is
it also doesn't mean that there isn't a lot to still learn from us yeah it could be about something else you probably know more about something else but the writers work hard the labs team works hard every video has something to learn in it we really do go out of our way to make sure that that's the case and sometimes you'll have already learned everything that's in a particular video and that's totally fine but to to say to say it's it's trash or it's purely for entertainment I think is um is more of
an indictment of you than it is of us I the effort level is so high just to bring it back to the potato PC again yeah the amount of steps taken to like I I mean conformal coding yeah we we talked about you might not have even known that conformal coding was a thing it's not a normal thing that comes up in people's lives and you might have maybe but I guarantee you a lot of the people who watch weren't familiar with it yeah so I don't know and then onto the company stuff I am a small company
preferer um and I think my my alarm Bells go off quickly because of that um but I think a lot of the steps that have been taken lately even if they are kind of more corporate have been really good so we still care I don't know I know it's hard to believe right I am small company person but I'm only going to I'm going to try to only complain if the complaint is valid and I don't have valid complaints about the changes that have been happening the changes that have been happening have been good so
I'm happy I think trajectory is good I don't think ideas are going down I think the writing team has been doing a fantastic job I think videos are doing great I don't know I genuinely loved the potato PC video genuinely loved Kyle's upgrade I don't watch everything so I haven't seen a bunch of the other things I don't know I mean I can tell you guys my favorites I watch every video now um so I'm the I'm the final QC pass um and it's a it's a QP QP s uh it's a it's a QC pass for kind of kind
of everything but I'm particularly focused on you know making sure the content's really good um this one's really solid this one's great uh the all China PC is a great video uh oh I am subscribed to our members only content so I guess uh we're going to have to Wade through that a little bit this is s tier had a ton of fun with Kyle and Elijah and it's so watchable Leone uh it's an incredibly watchable video I I'm very proud of some of my some of my uh my moves like it's one of those things
where am I tired sometimes yeah I'm old um compared to when we started doing this I'm I'm 11 years older than when we started this company and it's you know it it hits you at some point we both got Grays now but I'm also experienced like some of the comments from people on that video um were things you can actually you can actually see on my face the moment when I think of the idea of doing that transition to upstairs and leaving Kyle and Elijah arguing in the background and Elijah walks in to help
me you can actually watch me go and then I run out of frame so that we can do that transition um like I I've been doing this a long time and I'm still having fun I guess is what I'm I guess is what I'm trying to say about that uh the gaming the the potatoes just I mean this is going to be one of those ones yeah 1.2 million today um we built a gaming PC and a potato this one's great uh this one's a little dry uh but was super interesting for me the Flander scientific uh mastering
display um fa phone review I was definitely right there's uh oh my goodness I can't believe we didn't get that on the dog this week I didn't even think of it they response yeah they they responded um and basically made themselves they they had an opportunity to um to take feedback and make the phone better and they they went and linest it  quote all right hit me Dan okay  yeah is that a verb are you a noun to now oh man you're the linest you're going to jail uh hi that's the one we just did
sorry recently had my keyboard die on me it had a USB slot in it for my fingerprint sensor it's so hard to find a good keyboard with USB pass through any idea why it's not more common love the show if I had to guess just say it's because front USB and monitor USB hubs are so commonplace and docks and everything are so cheap now why would you need that feature also in order to do Pastor you would either need to have a secondary plug like many of the old ones did or you would need to have an
integrated Hub and you'd have to have a low enough power budget for the rest of the keyboard that you would have enough left over to power a secondary device and a lot of modern keyboards that are expensive enough to have you know extra Frills are going to have backlights on them and stuff these days so I just wouldn't expect that to be as common why don't you to pick up like a used g710 plus I'm still partial to it what are those going for on eBay can't be too much these days can't be too 
seriously there you go $33 wow $13 buy it now and just pop all the keys off and wash them and you're good yeah pop all the keys off was the board was the keys if you're in the state so I mean here in Canada I'm going to pay like 65 bucks oh yeah and this one definitely has passed through it's USB 2 pass through it's nothing special Canada has it gross it's whole thing any updates on the Khaki work pants I have been in the need for some and have been holding off buying some to see when they will be
released oh no I do not have any updates to share at  time I've got I've got a question here for Luke yeah everybody works at CW turn turn off their computer uh hey Luke are we going to get a native float plane app for Apple Vision Pro started exploding I don't you guys can hear that oh no oh thank goodness oh God okay Vance already told the team that that they're dead okay pants are dead um I can I can talk a little bit about why uh we're going to alter the way that we we we've
done nine samples of that product that product has been in development for probably a year and a half or two years or something like that I can't remember how long it's it's it's been in development for an obscene amount of time and we've had pants are hard for starters um the cargo pants are going really well but that's not a guarantee for other pants everything from materials to Pockets to fit blah blah blah blah blah pants are really really really hard compared to shirts um and
everything that can go wrong with the with those has we've we've seen everything from Pockets that kind of flare out so they look like vaginas on your thighs to like um and with zippers in them so ones that bite um the best kind to just like uh General tightness to man I don't know just oh oh one of okay something that personally I think the world needs a lot less of is um men's hairy bum cracks hanging out and since so many people I know refuse to wear a belt uh I insisted that when
sitting our pants need to not just show you know more than you know half an inch of crack kind of thing like I like we've got a whole but but we're not making high-waisted you know pants or whatever so there's just there's so many things that I'm really picky about that have been very difficult to achieve with a with a a work appropriate you know khaki pants garment um and what we realized was doing all of these samples and everything for for fit and we realized earlier this week that
no one had ever actually worn them for an entire day because we'd never had them close enough for our previous standard for wear testing so I kind of went okay well these kind of suck for a number of reasons but um there are probably other reasons and if we're going to do nine more samples then now's probably the time to unless we want to do nine more samples now's probably the time to wear them for a day and find out that the angle of the pockets okay we fixed the flaring out
thing but they're they're I I almost cut my hand open trying to get into them and if they weren't zippered everything would fall out and this pocket that we had on the knee was kind of useless like the idea behind these pants was they looked like normal slacks that you could wear to the office but they had like hidden pockets and stuff so you could carry a bunch of stuff stuff that you need but in order to make them remotely wearable it was just it was a mess um nothing was really that easy to get at
and it they ended up looking really weird and bulgy whenever you had anything in the pockets because they had more of like a formal fit uh someday maybe someday maybe we resurrect them let's see the cargo pants be a huge success they're great everyone who's wear testing these freaking loves them so no problem were full steam ahe had on the cargo pants but the Khaki ones are they're down and out like I didn't even realize that I'd forgotten to make sure there was an airpods pocket
included until I wore them all day and I went to like transfer all my stuff and holy crap we forgot an airpods pocket and like just it's so it's so easy to miss little details unless you actually live with the products every day I mean people will kind of joke with me about how I you know we only shill LT store products but it's it's not about that obviously yeah I want to promote the products this is a great hoodie by the way I I had Spiderman I had to Spider-Man meme uh
three separate people today who were wearing the same hoodie today CU it's just awesome anyway I um it's not just that obviously I want to promote the product but I also want to live with the product I want to be stuck with the product so that when there's a problem I'm going to be the first one to find it because I've done more wash Cycles with it than you have um yeah this is a great hoodie by the way LTT store.com did they come in all yet no soon all right the question was oh
yeah sorry hey Luke uh are we going to get a native float plane app for the  this yes if you make it I was going to say Never Say Never  no yeah extremely unlikely  yeah hi D I'm 19 and work as a remote tech for Asurion I repair 8 to 13 phones a day what would you say is the next progression for my career path what should I look into learning entrepreneurship oh yeah yeah to be honest if you can fix a fold then you can get a free fold all right I'm wiping it now it's yours this is this is not business this
is not investment advice you can't just keep your clients phones when you fix them no but seriously yeah it is probably entrepreneurship you go on Craigslist and do like phone repair from your bedroom and you make a lot of money uh we're we're kind of Apple products um their their users are uh Apple users and apple charges also a lot for repairs yeah yeah you you might the only other really good career path I think in that realm are going to be only tangentially related um getting into
board design doing things like that but that's like electrical engineering stuff but I'm just the only reason elonics engineering sure my bad my mixed doubles partner would have a word with you if you think it's elect I remember this conversation um sorry Electronics engineering uh but that's I mean that's just the only reason why I'm even saying that is because you're probably at least somewhat interested in that due to the career that you're in not because they're necessarily even all that
related so I don't know would enhance your abilities if you learned more for sure you'd probably be on a leg up um compared to other students in those classes as well but yeah all right she's wiped well I think that that's the bare minimum she's wiped like a butt of someone who hasn't bought a swipe bday from LTT store.com yet hey disgusting it's like animals can you imagine it's like the three seashells toilet toilet paper yuck all right good chat see you again next week
same bad time same bad Channel bye it's time for they're just movies are they here I have no idea they're coming back from abbottford oh wow that's why they went there I don't know cargo kill I think it's the premium theater oh okay how come they get one is there anything abbottford has premium things when did abbottford get like you know to be a city uh manscape the ridge symbolic
