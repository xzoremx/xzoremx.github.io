I bet you think this is nothing but a cute little 12-in notebook but there's far more to it than meets the eye now I can check my emails and catch up on Fallout and there's even more check this out I can pop off the keyboard and trackpad fold the screen kick out the kickstand and now it's a massive 17in IMAX enhanced HDR laptop with a wireless keyboard and touchpad I mean look at this thing it's hard to believe it's started out the size of an M1 MacBook and weighs just half as much
as hp's other premium 17in offerings and the leathery little keyboard is even shockingly usable for a folio style device what's not to love well the price tag for one thing but we're going to talk about that later first there is so much cool stuff crammed into this thing that I just can't wait to show you guys just like I can't wait to show you our sponsor Ridge just when you thought there well s couldn't get any cooler now they've added Meg safe compatibility so you can attach your wallet to your phone
absolute mad Lads check them out in the  carry looking at it it's hard to believe that the HP Spectre fold packs a 12 thread core i7 16 gigs of lpddr5 memory a terabyte of PCI Express Gen 4 storage from kokia almost 100 W hours of batteries and an HDR OLED touchcreen that starts out at a better than full HD 1920 x 1255 in clamshell mode and expands to 2560 by 1920 in tablet and desktop mode at an old school 4x3 aspect ratio that turns out is actually pretty great for productivity not only that but
it even outperformed hp's claims reaching a whopping 500 50 nits in HDR in our lab man we've got Wi-Fi 6E Bluetooth 5.3 not one but two Thunderbolt four ports audio by bang and olivon a 5 megapixel webcam and a battery that takes only 45 minutes to get to a half charge this thing should be a productivity monster especially if you consider that when it's fully charged HP claims the beefy batteries should last you 15 and 1 half hours 14 and 1/4 hours 13 and 1/2 hours 12 and
1/2 hours well at least 11 and 3/4 hours I I guess you can't be wrong about your battery claims if you just put every possible number on your marketing collateral runtime Shenanigans aside this thing looks pretty awesome on paper and spoiler alert I ended up kind of loving it but my initial Impressions were well I don't want to say negative so early in the video so let's call them unpositive out of the box there is a learning curve for sure you're reliant on HP software for window Management in
all of the different modes and it kind of stacks up on top of the default Windows management so God help you if you miss the introductory animation that shows you the different configs and how to use them once you get the hang of it though the magnetic system for holding the keyboard in its various positions is pretty fine but what isn't is this clumsy hack of a USB tether it allows you to charge the keyboard in desktop mode that's we're looking at right now and that's definitely a good thing and
the Magnetic connection saved me from snapping the connector off multiple times but HP must have known that having this loose wire just flapping around on what is and I kid you not the most expensive laptop in their entire lineup is not a good look not even our new cable management gear on LTT store.com can save this one so I would like to see HP find a way to charge the keyboard I either with induction or with Pogo pins in the Next Generation instead of using this bajoran earring looking thing and I
hear you guys it's Bluetooth you idiot unplug it and of course that's the obvious solution but the Bluetooth was unbelievably buggy on this thing failing to stay paired sometimes when coming out of sleep or switching between modes or even failing to pair it all to make it worse I'm getting these constant popups about keyboard firmware updates I then dutifully click yes and then it takes me to an internal HP website that needs a login but since I'm neither an HP employee nor an HP business partner I
guess no update for me I mean hey I get it HP you've only been selling laptops for longer than I've been alive these little details take time to get right to be clear I'm a reviewer and I could obviously escalate the issue but my job is to review the product as you would receive it and given how otherwise good the keyboard typing experience was the connectivity issues were a real Downer with that said I understand some of the compromises in this product like the webcam in the age of remote work and
endless Zoom calls there just isn't an ideal place to put a single camera on a device like this it's going to be poorly placed for at least one of the modes now the obvious fix would be to add another camera so that you've got one oh I don't know right in the middle of the hinge or maybe under the display but there not really a lot of room inside this thing for additional Hardware so a tiny webcam somewhere more reasonable for a desktop mode would be a welcome addition next time but the sideways mounted one
realistically didn't bother me too much unlike the pen it's usable but it's also very losable and this might be an unpopular opinion but I've always felt that if you're going to give me a stylus you need to give me a secure place to keep it in clamshell mode it's supposed to charge at the bottom edge of the fold and it kind of sticks there with magnets that is until you pull down the keyboard into extended mode and knock the pen into your lap or just I don't know dare to move the machine there's also some
magnets kind of in the hinge back here but it doesn't really stay put there either so I guess it's time to dust off the old high school pencil case roll into the meeting with your super nice expensive laptop and also your Pikachu zipup I swear though the point of this review is not to trash on this product because I really did fall in love with it by the end warts and all there is nothing like rolling into that aformentioned meeting and casually slipping a 17-in productivity monster
out of your tablet sleeve sure it's not 4K but the 2560 X1 1920 resolution is totally acceptable for a 17-in display and obviously there's a crease in the middle but has someone who's been daily driving folding devices for the last years I promise you guys you'll get used to it quicker than you think and this one is particularly non bothersome the Spectre fold is just in its element in this environment it's amazing for note-taking it's great for multitasking when the conversation drifts off topic
and it's even great for giving an impromptu presentation in a pinch because the screen is quite a bit bigger even than it sounds think about it the more square a screen is the more total area that it has per diagonal inch and it's also a head turner and a legitimate conversation starter when every other NPC in the meeting is using a freaking MacBook it's just that there is a lot that I would like to see improved before I spent this kind of money on it the weight for instance it's certainly light
for a 17in laptop but for a 12 or a 13in which is realistically how I used it most of the time it's pretty heavy and at just under an inch thick when folded up it reminds me more of the laptops of my childhood than modern ones and I mean that in more ways than one remember those old glossy screens that had the kind of ripple effect under direct light yeah HP brought that back I didn't find it too distracting day today but I also can't promise that you'd get used to this one like with the fold down the
middle and that's especially true if you're working an open concept office with a bunch of foot traffic behind you on the plus side though that might distract you from the cooling fan the thermal design of this machine leaves a lot to be desired at idle it's dead quiet even silent but should you have the audacity to do anything like say conduct a zoom meeting it sounds like well here I'll let you guys listen now I could excuse that noise if the performance absolutely rocked and it
should be pretty good the internals of the Spectre fold are virtually identical to the Asus Zenbook fold same CPU GPU Ram speec max resolution and even similar nvme drives but the performance doesn't Rock in virtually every test the Asus Zenbook fold outperformed the HP Spectre fold with the only big exception being of course battery life where the HP outlasted the Asus by an hour in our full screen endurance test and more than 2 hours at half screen and this seems to
come down to Thermal management while HP had an edge in maximum clock speeds a seus averaged about 300 MHz faster over time and 100 MHz faster at the bottom end HP sent over a disassembled unit for us to investigate this was before we got our CT scanner by the way and the problem was immediately apparent that's a cooler who do they think they are apple with these guts no one expected it to be a gaming Powerhouse and the tradeoff for extra battery life is a valid one and one you personally might
prefer but a shocking number of people do like to play casual games or run other somewhat intensive applications and it's always painful for me to see Hardware performing less than its best on that note we fired up a couple of games then just to see how it fared it got a little confused about what resolution it should be using it tried to use desktop resolution in clamshell mode for example but repositioning the keyboard resolved that and then it did manage a respectable average 60 FPS in
both rocket league and DOTA at 1080p so not not for gamers confirmed but also not for folks who need something completely bug free or for folks who need something very affordable it's "$5,000 for the one configuration that" from our understanding is because intel only has one chip that is able to meet the thermal requirements of this chassis however with all of that said if you are that special someone who saw this thing and went oh my God that was made for me and I absolutely can't wait for the
inevitably much better second gen I can't say you're the only one now that the review is done and I just auctioned my daily driver framework laptop for charity investment disclosure I think I might just adopt this orphan designer Breed Puppy and hope that it doesn't get prematurely worn out from being folded in half over and over and over again while I eagerly await a second gen that hopefully fixes all those little issues and brings me to sheer Nirvana gigantic screen meeting Bliss
just like I'm blissfully telling you about our sponsor vessie here in Vancouver the weather can be all over the place bright and sunny one day to a sudden downpour the next but thankfully we have a secret weapon vessie they claim their shoes are 100% waterproof thanks to their diatex technology which means even the most torrential storms don't stand a chance the storm burst shoes are now available in a lowprofile form providing the warmth of a boot and the comfort of a sneaker it's rugged
