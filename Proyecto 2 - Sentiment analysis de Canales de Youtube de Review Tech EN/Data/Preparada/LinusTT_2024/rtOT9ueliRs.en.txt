you open up this suitcase and their eyes light up with Wonder until they ask it's just a big laptop no way man it's a TV a it weighs like 30 lb well yeah cuz it's a home theater in a box how much is it how much does it cost the LG standby Migo spelled like I am claiming to have written the hit Eminem song El leave is a briefcase system designed for entertainment on the go inside this box is everything you need for movie night in the woods a bright 27-in smart display four speakers
in Stereo configuration and a battery to power the whole thing but none of that is what made us want to talk about it it's rare that a device splits our team's opinions this cleanly on the one hand we've got the pragmatists who expect the most performance for their dollar they aren't thrilled with this thing but then we've got the gadget Geeks Who are always excited to see cool new ideas and the standby Migo is certainly that it's eye-catching it's different it's kind of cool but is it
good let's find out after this quick message from our sponsor vessie protect your feet from precipitation and perspiration with vessie and their diatex technology check them out at the link below and use code Linus Tech tips to get 15% off for fun this is my first actual Hands-On with this thing and the real question is is it cool to have my own little home theater in the woods I got to say I kind of thought it was going to be stupid but immediately I'm looking at it going this would have come
in handy so many times I mean it's more luggable than portable but the colors pop the anti- glare performs way better than I expected immediate Impressions kind of like it it's a little cold today thank I got my 3D downjacket LTD store.com but if I wanted to watch TV outside or play games it's probably Dumber Solutions got little rubber corners on it for ruggedness oh whoa hi oh yeah it does that oh yeah it does just in case you want that to happen given how close you're seemingly
intended to sit to it 1080p does feel like a bit of a compromise but overall there's got to be Dumber Ways to solve this problem we pleasantly surprised to find that the display has pretty good color accuracy this is in spite of a bit of overemphasis on the Reds and a color temperature that pushed cool by default for a little boost in luminance bit more on that later we measured an average Delta of just 2.68 and in this Vivid mode and plugged in we also measured around 500 nits Peak brightness which is
not amazing but certainly usable but wait says 250 when plugged in 250 when you're on the beach you get 250  450 okay a portable power station that kind of defeats the purpose of this thing don't you think so even though it's Dolby vision and hdr10 compatible it's on battery performance 250 nits Peak with no local dimming means that the highest thing about your High dynamic range is probably going to be that fungus that you found behind a tree or who knows maybe I'll be pleasantly surprised all right magad
gals how you going to look on this oh my God it switched into Dolly Vision mode and immediately it's like d it switches out of the Vivid mode so you can switch it back for a little color or we can plug you in it's not even broad daylight guys it's freaking overcast and foggy and this looks like I have my laptop screen in power saving mode this is on battery right now it's on battery let's plug it in shoot man that's not good I can't see right now swipe from the top see if the
brightness is at Max it should be but swipe is this a touchcreen is a touch screen well there's good news and bad news the good news is the touchcreen works the bad news is that's it boss this is not HDR that's not a flame that's white this is not fire or lava or whatever the crap it's supposed to be it's yellow circles and that's what the low Peak brightness is going to do to you what are these speakers going to do to  you what a disappointment they had this entire enclosure here and they put the speakers
behind the screen hold on the speakers are in here yes why all they had to do was put some angled drivers in here so that they would actually hit you instead of bouncing off the back of the monitor not trying to be a jerk about it or anything but that's not how you do this nope if I do this and I sit here it sounds way better yeah you're right it's not impeded yeah yeah you're not wrong why you don't build a speaker and then put a thing in front of it Here's a thought though maybe that Dolby Atmos
label is less about clear dialogue in your movie and more about pounding That Base when you're around the campfire   fares wow it doesn't sound good from back here either dude they had all this room in it and they didn't put in a sub yeah the next thing I've been asked to try is the ambient wall paper so I like healing why  fireplace now my next challenge is to turn off the screen while my background music or audio plays in order to  life oh wow webos is a little laggy on  click
okay I give up the only way is to use the voice controls that are disabled by default seriously yeah I see on a normal lgtv remote they have a button so that you can just talk at it when you want it to be listening but on this one I guess they cheaped out on the remote it doesn't have a button so it just has an always on threshold so it has to be disabled by default I see hi LG turn on off the display okay I'll turn off the screen thanks Tik Tok wow well there it is you can also use your LG phone app
cuz you definitely have that installed video and music are just part of the pitch for the standby me go though it's got some basic onboard processing a touch display and it can rotate as I showed you guys before to portrait mode so you can mirror your phone's display to it as long as you twist it this way and it should be noted that we had somewhat mixed results with that but what you can also do is load in some of the apps that are built into LG's web OS or download new ones including games I'm going to
play billi and marble oh it's Monopoly how about a Philippine City purchase uh okay how do I not this game it occurs to me now that I had asked for a particular game on Android cuz I forgot oh right web OS they don't have Android games necessarily okay can I can I Dodge or you can move what is this game a tank battle dude come on uh okay ah my notes say that we experienced some responsiveness issues take that Anakin I have The High Ground even at its best the web OS game
library is going to make you wish you had anything else attached to this thing the good news is you can all right all right all right fine we'll go home go to HDMI oh oh it fell through the table oh that's not good I mean look if it couldn't survive that then it's not  anyway how's the motion Clarity for you being completely honest I wasn't even paying attention to the motion Clarity of this display not because it's good it's really bad but I just didn't really feel like that was the point of it uh here's a
question what if I just unplugged the Ally and handed it to you which one do you think is going to be better oh wow is this ever a better display what's really embarrassing from my point of view is LG literally are the guys when it comes to IPS why is this the cheapest worst IPS panel why do you even still make these ones the thing is a lot of what I've said so far is evaluating it as a television but it's Unique so why don't we try something unique let's play a two-player game Let's Play The Chess the
chess I'm a big fan of the chess do you chess not really cuz I don't really chess I think we're both about to embarrass ourselves then it's okay I'm going to bring out my Rook right away I'm going to be a pro bring out my king what okay I I don't think Pro works the way you think it works I'm going to bring out both Rooks it's the two Rook defense a country is only as strong as its king a country is only as powerful as its pawns it's loyal servants check no here we go you kill it no I don't
want to you don't want to kill it I believe in peace if you guys want to see the whole chess game L mg. g/f flat plane we're going to have it up there why you run away you're falling for one of the   the [Laughter] what that I have no idea what happened in all seriousness though there are other aspects of the device that we should talk about battery life is advertised at around 3 hours we got four to five and that was streaming Disney plus and YouTube the io is both limited
and good enough you've got a power in a battery on and off button an IR blaster Port just in in case you want to set up a relay a USB port which I could definitely see people using you bring along your little collection of videos to watch in the tent or whatever the case may be and a single HDMI port one thing that does feel a little conspicuously absent given that it's a smart TV is any kind of connectivity there's Wi-Fi obviously but there's no ethernet Jack and maybe more importantly
there's nowhere to put a SIM in it or anything like that so you're pretty much tethering to a phone if you want a connection and you'll need a connection ction because there's no internal accessible storage realistically though in spite of all of my complaints if you're the kind of person who wants a standby me go whether it's for Van life or giving presentations on the road you already know who you are and I'm honestly not here to argue that it's utterly unique so why don't we focus
then on the ways that I feel LG could improve this experience for the people who need something like this losing almost half of our brightness when when we're away from power is a huge Downer when the whole point of this thing is to be away from power on top of that once the external juice is cut we saw some 240 HZ flickering remember this is a 60 HZ display meaning that there were duplication artifacts in high motion scenes it's not a huge deal in most slow-moving video content but it's
definitely distracting if you got your PS5 hooked up and you want a game or wait okay that's a bit of a problem too the standby Migo doesn't share power with external devices it's like saaron okay so you're going to need a power station for anything that is beefier than a USB drive with your MP4s on it and at that point compact portable monitors go up to 24 in now and pair very nicely with stereo ready Bluetooth speakers from the likes of JBL or sound core none of that is my biggest issue
though my biggest problem is the cost you could buy a whole ass all-in-one computer with a built-in battery like the HP EnV move for much less than the standby Mig go and then you end up with a full fat Windows PC instead of this weak web OS machine we're going to have links to some alternative suggestions in the video description this thing was 400 500 bucks it's a winner and even at 6700 I still think it has a place but at $1200 look if you like it you like it it's not awful it's it's just it's hard
