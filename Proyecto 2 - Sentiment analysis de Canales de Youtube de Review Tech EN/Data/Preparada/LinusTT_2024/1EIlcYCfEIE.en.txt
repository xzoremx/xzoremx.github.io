why would origin PC sponsor a video where their top-of-the-line gaming machine performs like this well maybe because it doesn't hey there we go that's better the neuron should be getting hundreds of frames per second in CS2 and ours would have if we hadn't given it to our techy friend 2 fix and gotten it back worse than before of course it arrived from origin in perfect working order but well we'll get to that it's a really common situation and for many people the next
move is to prepare their wallet and head to the tech shop if they had an origin PC they could just use their 24/7 lifetime support but if they don't have an origin PC well the big question is where do you go the service department at a big box store would surely have the processes and tools to diagnose and repair your PC but on the other hand maybe the veteran Tech at the mom Pop shop down the road is best equipped to evict your systems Gremlins yeah we couldn't decide which
route to go either so we dropped off two identical and identically broken systems courtesy of origin to compare big box versus small business but before we get into the results we need to know the problem let's take a look at the messes that we're going to be handing over I'm that friend everyone asks for tech support but I don't mind helping to set up such a beautiful machine it looks so fast and it is but it's a little loud okay I've watched a lot of videos about system tuning and I know what this means
overheating that is where everything went from oops to OMG that cable that was loosened during unpacking handled communication between the PC and our Cooler's I Q Link system Hub so that knocked out RPM monitoring for our fans meaning it's Full Throttle o clock all the time now a quick reality check before we go further the link AIO and fans all have temperature probes in them so this Behavior doesn't normally happen but in general a hub running full speed due to a loss of signal is a very
common scenario and one that should be easy for a technician to rectify too bad our friend isn't a technician first they tried rolling back the Nvidia driver to the earliest one available Unfortunately they did so without removing the existing driver so not only did this not solve the problem it created a new one device manager is now reporting error code 43 oops too bad my friend didn't notice then they ran C cleaner and started uninstalling stuff in hopes that it would help which it did not friendo was
running short on ideas by this point so they dug around in the Bios and disabled everything they could find that would cause extra heat in hopes that the fans would slow down and for good measure they also locked the core clocks as low as they would go it's too bad the LTT hat Pro doesn't make you smarter just more water resistant LTT store.com now as a pretty average buyer of a pre-built system I don't know any of what my friend did and even if I did I wouldn't understand what it meant all I would
know is my games are unplayable they crash and my system is as loud as a vacuum cleaner I would have no way of knowing is it a hardware or a software problem or even how to tell the difference and I would probably be scared of damaging it any further now I could contact the manufacturer and for a brand new pc that's probably a pretty good bet origin PC has scored well for customer service in our secret shopper series origin PC what can I say wow A+ a nail under 10 minutes and bacon face mask 24/7 A+ and
they have free lifetime support but not everybody has a brand new PC or An Origin PC for that matter now of course what we actually are dealing with here is a software and bios mess and one loose cable the quickest way of fixing it then would be to plug the cable in clear the SOS and reinstall Windows but it can also be fixed without doing either of those things if you know exactly what we did the texts of course don't so let's listen in and see what kinds of conclusions they drew starting
with the langly Best Buy hey so I bought this off of a friend a couple days ago and it's been giving me problems when I've been trying to play games on it um they're just running super slow and the thing sounds like it's going no um chew who bought it um from origin I believe I thought butas it from no no no no is a custom made right uh um I'm not sure he he bought it and never even took it out of the box it's a yeah put a sticky note here with my steam in case you need to
get in there like when you play games they're lagging or they're super slow yeah super slow one of the games I have hell divers 2o when I open it it just crashes and it says something about the CPU being bad or something I'm not sure chewy did a really good job of both playing the ignorant customer who has no idea what he's talking about while also putting out a nice little trail of breadcrumbs for them to follow in order to diagnose this issue he even gave them access to a steam account that has a
specific game installed that requires AVX support so they would get the error message that would help them reconfigure  it excuse me I mean I guess right like I can't force you to work on something you can just be like no look this job is not right for us maybe take it somewhere else but we we are not taking it it's a little direct we're not working on custom Bill he say you know what up like that because we have those parts from the brand directly with manufactur warranty
okay fortunately I'm really sorry for that but that be okay he tried to soften it a little bit some called memory memory the shop nearby they do B C and stuff like that on the one hand I kind of get his rational now look we don't necessarily have access to replacement parts for this thing on the other hand if you're going to recommend that I go to another shop can you at least tell me the actual name of the shop ah the irony of not being able to remember the name of memory
something Express that's it so we just got told to leave essentially at the first Best Buy that can't be policy Emily is that that's not policy is it no we called them afterwards and they told us that yes they actually absolutely do work on like pre-built computers or and also custombuilt computers that they they don't sell in their stores you know what I bet it's about they probably saw how high-end it was looked at the issues that we were having with it and went this thing's haunted and just didn't
want to deal with it cuz you make a mistake on a you know $600 office box okay what that's a $50 mistake or a $100 mistake you make a mistake on on a you "know 5,000 6,000 Canadian dollar gaming" rig let's move on drop off this time at the Best Buy on King George Highway heyel is this big is this what do you want to do now get it fixed whatever whatever it needs chewy really does play the ignorant customer extremely well he has like strong trust fund kid Vibes I've got this like crazy machine I just
like you know fix it I guess sure whatever J's our community coordinator by the way so if you ever see a reply on Reddit that's not from me it's probably from him you st or a monitor it's an interesting question do you hook it up to a TV or a monitor unless they were trying to help figure out if we were plugged into the onboard GPU or the dedicated graphics card maybe it's a custom leave order uh I I bought it off a friend I'm not sure what is a custom PC they won't look at it wait this is an interesting
distinction and I can kind of see where they're coming from but even at this second Best Buy location they're drawing a line between a system that was built of custom parts by an experienced integrator Like An Origin PC and a system that could be built of the exact same Parts but by the individual user and in that case it's not about the value of the parts and the risk of you know breaking them or the difficulty finding Replacements because they're willing to work on an origin PC they
just don't want to work on potentially those exact same Parts if you put it together yourself and maybe bungled something up because who knows you could be trying to blame them for it if you bent a pin in the socket or whatever the case may be they've probably run into some horror stories working on custom PCS you so my friend tried but he moved just before just after he sold it to me it seems almost seems like what he did made it worse I don't really know what he did and the thing is if you've ever worked
in a tech shop you will know exactly how common this kind of scenario is oh yeah my friend or my nephew or my uncle worked on the system and like I don't know what they did and you see all kinds of wild things that supposedly techy friends and family members will do to systems they're well-intentioned they just don't really have familiarity with the hardware this is not a software issue so it's kind of a hardware issue we need to ship it out to the what you can't tell me that you know
what kind of issue it is without even like turning on the system then again what I suspect is that they just don't want to deal with it there in the store they want to send it to the depot so they're just telling us anything that it takes to get us to accept that this needs to go to the depot so that they can just kind of go yeah fancy expensive system I don't want to deal with it I send it away to the other guys P shipping and diagnosis it's $100 man 100 bucks to even start to do anything do
you have any important data that's a good question they're going to call you after diagnos do you want to sign up for the wait what sign up for membership hopefully you're going to fix it I won't need a membership to Best Buy the whole drop off process at the second Best Buy took about 20 minutes half of which was filling out paperwork they did log the issues that we had with the machine and they gave us a case ID and a phone number we could call to get updates but we're still having a hard time figuring
out exactly what Best Buy's policy is with respect to working on custom PCS versus just OEM PCS from HP Lenovo and the like when we called the main line they said no there's no reason that they wouldn't look at a completely custombuilt PC let alone one that was built by a system integrator but both of the stores we talked to were like whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa when it came to working on custom PCS and only one of them was willing to work on our origin now for the one I'm more excited about
let's listen to the drop off at black laab which you guys may recognize as the mom and pop shop that we bought all the old inventory from a couple of months ago Keith seemed like the kind of battle hardened technician that should be able to make short work of this but only the result results matter and let's see what they are what's going on with it right to the point um so first of all it's insanely loud and I feel like that's not right and it's it's running slow in general but especially trying to run
games like it can't even run anything really really yeah SSD obviously I'm not sure huh first thing he asks is do you have an SSD that makes a ton of sense it's really interesting how the kind of shop you go to dictates the kinds of questions they ask just like secret shopper you know Dell is asking questions like are you buying an entire fleet of these things do you want on-site service whereas a custom builder like origin PC is asking what games do you want to play and what FPS
do you want to play them at so in the same way Keith probably sees a lot of 15-year-old machines so he wants to know okay is there anything obvious that's making this thing dog slow like does it have a hard drive and also do I even want to work on another machine that has a hard drive in it wait you know 10 minutes for an application to install you didn't even take it out of the box interesting what yeah how much uh that's hilarious chewy doesn't know how much he paid for it like 3K he
just made up a number yeah he was moving away so he just want to get it off his hands but it's not running right nope maybe that's why he wanted to get it off yeah for now so it goes into Windows yes and then everything goes is there a password no but my steam info is Hest sticky note there perfect I'm going to  tonight I can't believe neither of the best buys called chewy on giving his steam credentials whereas kei's like Yo dude the low points for professionalism but high points for efficiency the whole
interaction with Keith took less than five minutes is it a 49 you know uh I don't know we get this video part 10 I'm just kidding that oh man see I don't know Keith very well but I've spent enough time with him to know that I think he's honest enough that he wouldn't actually just swap out the hardware in someone's machine who obviously has no idea what they have but he's also smart enough to see that this is someone he freaking could if he really felt like it awesome all right
okay thank you take care of just as I remember him an efficient troll now it's time for pickup Chewy was sick that day so we sent in llo to grab the machines starting with Best Buy so I just want to SC can I see the document that they're looking at please yep my goodness we got a whole folder jeez motherboard uh the hard drive Ram everything is good so this is the T P okay wait a second whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa how much did I pay for this whole tube
of thermal paste of which you guys used one tiny dollop they sold me a giant tube of thermal paste because they Reen read the cooler really how much did I pay for this 20 bucks in thermal paste that wasn't even the problem you guys okay uh nothing wrong with the hardware just the pH like you know the overheating was causing the problem overheating was the problem no you put on new thermal paste you think you solved the problem but H we're about to look at this machine and
I don't think we're going to find the problem solved if they think overheating was the problem if anything under heating was the problem we had too much cooling fans they played the game for a little while and see how it goes they uh kept it on like you know the computer for almost like you know more than 24 hours you to sees anything happening passing anything okay all is good I'm afraid I don't really understand what they're saying so they reimbursed me the hardware repair
and then charged me almost double for software repair because they reinstalled the operating system they made no mention of Bio settings no mention of the loose link Hub cable they charged me 20 bucks for a gigantic tube of thermal paste that I think it's pretty clear from the way that I'm talking about this system I have no idea what it is I am never going to use did they even solve the problem you had the lot of fan so the fan like over the time you were B noise oh oh the fans were noisy yeah
yeah because say you had three here three here six oh just a lot of fans in it yeah so that is normal there more fans is not more noise yeah we have 12 fans which means they should be spinning very slow and making very little noise oh Best Buy Best Buy Best Buy it is very heavy yeah yeah I know I know I going have to carry are you manag to carry yeah it'll be okay yeah going to somebody to their credit it seemed like they were offering to help them carry the system out that's one thing they did
well but I paid $123 to fix a computer that as far as I can tell is not fixed actually it was a total of 209 because what a total of 209 holy bananas we paid 250 bucks for them to not fix the problem maybe they shouldn't work on custom PCS all right let's see how black lab did can I get the documentation for that one about the same price though realistically I guess what it comes down to now is did Keith manage to fix the computer hey I just had a pick up oh okay what was wrong with it oh it had to
be completely reloaded completely reloaded it was wacko man those fans were just roaring I tried everything to get them to shut up oh yeah okay reloading software all that stuff just didn't work so ioaded everything did all the drivers again it's awesome interesting Okay cool so it's all it's all good now yep and if he has any problems whatsoever just tell him to call me that's nice offering the followup and he did have some malware on there so malware oh okay do we have any
idea what malware he's referring to did we have logging software on there to see what they were no nothing no no the best I can figure is CA cleaner and windzip yeah I wouldn't consider those malware awesome thank you so much thank you so much have a great day all right you too full marks for efficiency and love the personality but I think at best Keith is headed for a partial pass here he says that the fans are quieted down now and there is a way to do that without recing
that Link cable but he didn't manage to find the underlying problem and he made no mention of any of the issues in the bio so I have to say I'm a little worried that the performance of the machine even if the fans are quiet is not going to be up to Snuff he also charged a little more than Best Buy did but if you managed to solve the problem at least solved enough that I can use my computer then it's hard to really complain about that God I can sure complain about how much it costs to get service done on a
computer I can see why people just buy a new machine like if you have a 5-year-old Dell or something and you take it into a shop they're like yeah it's going to be three or four labor hours to reload Windows put on drivers and get it up and running again be like a screw it I'll just get a new one and then it'll just be fast anyway and this my friend is where e-w babies come from starting with the Best Buy PC I am not that impressed with the condition of this computer I mean we dropped it off
brand new and it is so covered in fingerprints and thermal paste that I could probably defeat the biometric security of the phone of this technician not to mention they left this giant stupid service tag sticker on it like why it comes off pretty easily so just remove it I don't know maybe I'm just in a bad mood and being picky because I don't think they solve the problem let's see let's see maybe I'll feel differently when we open it up and they did a great job or whatever all right get me my
screwdriver I'm talking to me I will get me my screwdriver how's their thermal Pace job um realistically probably not going to cause any problems but I'd have put on more especially since like I have plenty do we have thermal results for uh the after no probably shouldn't have pulled this off then oh seriously you made it that easy on them I thought you meant you were going to pull out like one of these USBC connections between the link devices you pulled a freaking USB header
off and they didn't notice that they did not brother I mean if you diagnosed it as a software issue and you didn't look that closely at the hardw where I can kind of see how you could miss it but you went you did a full re and re on the CPU Cooler so you thought it was hardware and you didn't check if a USB header was uninstalled what that tells me is I'm going to press this button and that's going to happen which they passed off as normal how much you want to bet origin PC based on the
experiences we've had with them would fix this issue over the phone in like 10 minutes before we hook up a monitor and see how they did software wise let's have a look at Keith's Hardware also a little fingerprint but the difference here is that the fingerprints are in the typical carrying positions and uh are not made out of thermal paste so this is probably us wait where's the US oh he plugged it back in did he plug the USB header back in we didn't do it okay so that's interesting Keith is still it was a
software issue at least that's what he told us but he found the hardware issue which solved his problem if you do the right thing that's definitely better than just not seeing it at all even if you aren't sure exactly which thing you did fixed it he took longer he took a week compared to 3 days and he did charge us more but here let's get this thing fired up oh and of course my RGB is working properly now too now that we're posted let's see how they did they managed to enable XMP they put it on the
"first profile which is 6,000 megatrans" per second rather than "6,200 AVX is still" disabled frequency control is fine though you know what's funny to me we've talked about this in our troubleshooting challenges before if you suspect at all that a bios configuration issue is present modern systems all you got to do is go into the profiles create a profile for what they had just in case you know if they had like weird Legacy boot settings or something like that reset it and see if that solves the
problem and if it does then great you enable XMP and you're done you don't have to dig through all the sub menus to  adjusted there's no avoiding it is there we're going to have to start a tech shop so people can have their computers fixed properly well we'll see maybe black laab did great now that we're on the desktop I'm even more confused did they really install user Benchmark and then just leave it here yeah Ida to which is not free software like you're not allowed to
just use it however you want and leave it on any system you want oh this is even a oh no it is a trial for yeah yeah there's even a thing that pops up and tells me that probably their worst sin was that Norton 360 was not on this computer when we dropped it off now the reason for that can actually be traced back to MSI who includes Norton in their driver package bundle thing but when you do a Windows refresh I kind of expect you to pay attention to what I had installed on the machine and not leave
anything extra on it that seems to be about it now let's get this machine shut down so ah our audio is usable let's move over to Keith's machine oh Keith didn't turn off fan speed monitoring so we get that CPU fan error when the system First turns on that's a rookie mistake it's even in the simple interface that's how quick that is to fix oh Keith used the higher XMP profile and did he reset seos no AVX is still off he's got all the frequency stuff fixed why not just clear seos both
of you In fairness to Keith the CPU fan error message is a lot less of a problem on these MSI boards on an Asus one it'll hang until you go in and tell it not to check it now that we're in Windows I see no sign of user Heaven Benchmark okay a really  B can't can't believe in software installed on people's systems if you have a conversation with them that goes I put this on there in order to do this it's really useful for this you may want to use it otherwise you can just take it
off it's not harming anything then at least Le that's a conversation we had if you're just leaving software installed on my system it's it's sloppy no Norton though Kudos Keith for installing the drivers properly either doing it manually by downloading them and then installing them or by making sure you're paying attention when you use that package and unselecting Norton for gamers since we have Heaven on here I guess we can do a quick check and see if the system is performing as we would
expect and it is casual 600 fr per second did they really put 409s in these things mhm oh origin you guys and your crazy systems now that we've run through both systems the results are both clear and also not clear Best Buy they failed they solved problems we didn't have and they didn't solve the problems we did have all while charging us $200 and selling us a bunch of thermal goop that we probably don't need meanwhile over at black laab Keith did manage to nail the fanish is so that
was the underlying problem but what he missed was enabling AVX in order to get hell divers 2 working which we explicitly told him was a concern and even gave him our Steam account so that he could check however I don't want to write him off yet because on our way out the door he did say hey just give me a call if anything else goes wrong let's see if he's willing to troubleshoot this for us over the phone or fix it for free in which case I'm ready to give him Colin can you call this computer shop
for me and just explain the problem that we have uh it's AVX related and we can't launch hell divers too right no it's okay never mind we found Hoffman I can't talk to him because he'll probably recognize my  may I ask if uh Keith is around no he's coming back in two hours yeah we'll give you a call I guess yeah I want to talk to Keith in two hours well that went about as poorly as it possibly could have two hours later Keith gave us a call back and in about 8 minutes walked us through changing the
setting but before he did that he did say hey if you bring it in I'd be happy to fix this for you for no charge he joked about charging us $600 for it or something like that but was obviously joking in the way that he does and I guess at this point it's an a he hit everything now that everything's fixed up we should take a look at the kind of performance we should be getting from our origin PC and this is cool while I was digging into that I noticed a couple of other things that Keith got right he
installed IQ and he installed what then was probably the latest GeForce drivers these are quite new even though they're not quite the newest uh the reason I was poking around in the control panel was that I want to enable DSR Dynamic super resolution so we can see what kind of 4K gaming performance we should expect from a machine like this here's what I'm thinking 4K Ray tracing Ultra natively rendered and then motion blur off should should handle it right maybe we'll see God this game looks so
good when you max it out but it is so demanding this is a 4 490 with a core i 94900 k and we're getting about 70 FPS now with that said it's a really even 70fps so it feels extremely smooth compared to if we had lows that were much much lower and we were getting any kind of hitching or stutter but uh when you crank it man is R tracing ever heavy the good news is now that Keith has solved our fan problems it's quiet not everybody needs a Swanky LCD on their cooler a ton of RGB fans an
RTX 49d a 99d pro SSD and 32 gigs of Dominator memory the neuron starts at "just over $2,300 with respectable specs" in readyto ship configurations and you can find links to their neuron desktops and more in the description down below but if you want one that goes this hard you can win one for free origin PC is giving away a neuron just like like the ones we used today with a core i 94900 k and an RTX 490 winners will be drawn 2 weeks from today and all you need to do is follow the link to origin PC's
giveaway down below and enter big thanks to them for sponsoring this video while I can't speak to the experience you'll have at every single Best Buy or at every single mom and pop shop I still think there were some interesting learnables here that might help equip you better if you or one of your loved ones who you don't feel like fixing a computer for ever needs to go through an experience like this if you guys enjoyed this video maybe check out the recent secret shopper origin PC makes a very small cameo
