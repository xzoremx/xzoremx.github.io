ah good month eh right I haven't charged my laptop in days couldn't care less I didn't charge mine for an entire week have not had a single problem me neither but there has been one thing stressing me  done I was worried we might not have enough content to talk about but now  Ridge they're doing a massive sweep Stakes now until September 13th with prizes like a Hennessy Velociraptor not the dinosaur a goldplated cyber truck or "$100,000 in cash enter for free and get" one entry per dollar spent using the 
description the first sign that this ch all was going to be a little different than the previous ones was the number of people who wanted to participate Arc GPU challenge anyone want to use Intel Arc for a month come on Snapdragon challenge anyone want to use one of these for a month oh my God and it's easy to see why people want it in my entire mindset has changed to the point where I used to see a sliver of battery and I would drop everything that I was doing and dash to the outlet whereas
now I think hm interesting I guess I'll finish up a few things and then maybe I'll plug in at some point right on one of my first days okay I got a notification that I was at 10% battery and it was in critical mode I then proceeded to finish up a team's voice call including screen sharing on that call I made some edits to a script I then wrote a couple of emails did some notes checked my battery life and hm casual ual 6% no problem however it's worth noting that in the last month I've
used my laptop the way that I use my laptop which is to say I've installed basically nothing on it we don't even use word in the writing Department anymore so almost everything I do is in a browser or a browser based program I've used it for video conferencing Discord OBS screen cap okay that's not in a browser but all of those things worked perfectly now I have had some slightly weird stuff happen with bong Jour always um but it hasn't really bothered me enough to go back to worrying about my battery life
yeah for me the experience has been even better than I expected in a month I have charge my laptop a total of five times and if you look at the dates there is an entire week where I did not plug it in once obviously during that week I was not using it a ton typically two 3 hours a day day something like that but with every other laptop that I've ever used Windows Apple you just cannot do that that's actually really good point because lots of Windows laptops are rated for eight plus hours of battery
life yeah that's not the issue the issue is when I go to use it the next day on any other laptop 20% battery end of the day you have to plug it in on this it's like okay 20% I'll use it for 4 hours tomorrow great the heaviest program I use regularly is solid works and for occasional use like what I do on the Go performance is usable for me it is fine because any large assemblies I need to tackle I just do on my desktop and I only run solid works on my laptop to make small
adjustments to Parts in the shop but it is emulated and the raw performance is very similar to my old laptop which has a low powerered 2p cor CPU that was slow when it was released 2 years ago right what I was afraid would be a deal breaker for me was car audio but it's actually just totally fine our calibrated measurement microphones just worked allowing me to get these measurements right here for MX5 review watch it on short circuit and then came the much bigger challenge doing a new
tune on my car no way this involved Niche DSP drivers a bunch of random Windows run times and direct lives licensing server all to cooperate which is not even a guarantee on regular x86 Windows machine maches but it just did it and now I have a 2C tune of my car it sounds absolutely fantastic so unfortunately uh my work can't be really done on the pen and paper what are you saying about what I do is also work well my work is you know more video editing and uh I can't really Video Edit on like
you know a pen and paper and as a recent graduate uh I decided to take a perspective of a university student because I feel like University students are the people who really buy these laptops so I just like oh it'd be a cool way to determine if this is actually good for you know people school yeah exactly yeah cuz you're not going to have another computer exactly yeah the first and simplest thing I try to do was watch YouTube videos but instead I got audio render issues saying I need to reset my
computer fortunately I had this great LTT laptop bag LTT store.com man this thing is freaking awesome it's got all the room opens up so big oh yeah baby stores everything sorry sorry sorry what were you saying well fortunately the computer was one step ahead of me there because for the first couple of days I had a load of crashes that restarted the computer for me next I want to edit some flow plan exclusives which I thought be fine because qualcom did say that they're going to support
Adobe crater Suites which turns out it was only Photoshop and graphic design stuff no Premiere great no I thought Premiere works when I first got it the my first thing was to try installing it and it was wasn't there I was like what's up with that it just works fortunately after a week of daily driving it it was there but there was a catch After Effects still missing so I couldn't do any of the fun Graphics Premiere was emulated andoss it just sucked honestly using premiere on this
thing was not a good experience there is one more thing to say it's in the script he's doing his best but only the 2023 version is supported like 2024 is three qus over and they're only supporting 2023 I had to convert most of my projects to the 2023 versions just so I can start editing I tried editing three videos the first one was fine until I started adding screen caps to it which then it pooped itself the second one was a YouTube sh at 1080p which was mostly fine but I ended up switching to a real
computer for animations at the end and the third one was a 4K multicam sequence and oh yeah it died I think it loaded it in and then it just didn't work there's not a chance honestly I think the most telling part of all of that is the way that you referred to a normal x86 computer as a real computer so in a month you didn't manage to completely edit a single video on it even though Premiere is supported yeah like the worst part is parsik didn't work that great either so I didn't really get to remote into my
desktop and edit it so I was like this I determined that the speed I was going to go at parcing in versus editing on my computer wasn't going to justify it so I ended up just moving back to my computer yeah I didn't try to use Parc and that's the thing right is when an application doesn't work you're basically stuck if this is your only computer there's there's no backup plan the emulation all runs automatically so it's not like you can install an emulator and maybe it'll
work now it just doesn't work I actually had my first near showstopper just yesterday talk about a buzzer beater I was using channelizer for the how much Wi-Fi is too much video and I started getting random crashes at first I thought okay it's probably a license issue since I haven't checked in with metageek for 2 years and then I realized oh hold on a second it's always crashing after a little while when I go inside the chamber maybe it needs an always on connection but obviously I wouldn't have
any Wi-Fi in an RF isolation chamber then it turned out that the emulation was bad oh wow yeah so nothing to do with the license and I had another bizarre issue yesterday too I got a notification that I was running out of battery which was fine I hadn't charged it in like 6 days or something like that but when the speaker went off I didn't think about this until you mentioned your audio rendering issues but it started like like buzzing at me really weird which makes me wonder if maybe it's
something to do with the platform you guys haven't actually seen this yet but  weird oh what what the it's like a spaceship it just didn't stop overall I've been happy with the machine though especially the keyboard and like I said to you I never use my laptop outside so the screen total non-issue but I noticed right at the end that HP cheaped out on the Wi-Fi I only got Wi-Fi 6E instead of Wi-Fi 7 well my Surface laptop 7 does have Wi-Fi 7 but I would much rather have your 6E chip in
there if that meant my experience was good in areas where my Wi-Fi strength wasn't great like you just know that spot in your house it just wouldn't work sometimes I would load in YouTube video and then halfway through it would just disconnect from Wi-Fi and it was super annoying both of you guys had good Wi-Fi right yeah yeah mine was mine was perfect actually it was really good yeah I used that thing for a week making the review I also didn't have an issue so that was great I think it's Microsoft
and their antenna design wait I wonder if HP knows something I don't know and use the 60 for a reason wh which one's yours Wi-Fi 7 must just be the antenna design then yeah could also just be a bunk unit but another area that's been pretty good for me is gaming now in our live stream half of the games we tested didn't work but real world use is a little little bit different than just having you guys send games to us and US running whatever you ask like for me from the time that I
spent with the steam deck my mentality shifted a little bit from I want to game I want to play this game and nothing else is acceptable to I'm in the mood to game I'm willing to find something that works with the device that's in front of me so obviously it's not the best but I actually kind of found that I was okay with it yeah if you treat like a second computer I think it's okay but I tried playing a lot the games that are popular with the youth like me okay 27 uh like League of Legends
valerant fortnite and Minecraft the first three didn't work like it just it would not boot I could download it but uh and Minecraft was just too laggy so getting one of these laptops for school means you probably aren't playing games with your friends don't do that parents I'm kind of split on this one the three games that I play the most just straight up do not work on this laptop but also they straight up do not work on the last laptop that I used either so right you used to thin and
light with old onboard Graphics anyway so I'm pretty flexible like I'm going on a long flight tomorrow I installed animal well on this it works great I do not care if I don't get to do 3D games on this and at the same time 120 HZ display this thing is awesome to game on I just I just want to highlight how good this screen is Sami screen as well fantastic 3x2 Quad HD 12 HZ bright enough to use outdoors and the most incredible thing is that this display did not even stand out in our last video
typically the two biggest power draws on a laptop are the CPU and the display and previously I was willing to live with a mediocre display because the OLED scream option was just not worth it for battery life but when the CPU is this efficient you can just give up 4 hours of battery life and it will be totally fine it really is the closest thing that we have to the MacBook experience and while game compatibility sucks compared to normal windows it's still a lot better than
mac dang sick burn one final thing about the surface is that the webcam is fantastic in the very first video call that I had on it I got compliments of just how great it looks yeah I also got compliments on it mic was good and webcam was good now here's something I'd like to compliment you guys you've lasted a long time here at lius Media Group being on Microsoft and Samsung's payroll respectively you guys what okay no you know what they are right they're right the webcam is actually a standout
feature however I want to change the topic a little bit this is 2024 we got to talk about AI we love AI does it make me a boomer that I completely forgot about the co-pilot button except for the one time I pressed it by accident wa really I'm actually a big fan of co-pilot and just like chat ch BT like llms in general and I like how accessible it was to you know just one click button I can just look it up it's way more convenient than open my browser typing in chat GPT you kids know
about bookmarks right do you know about doing up more than half of the buttons on your shirt it's it's it's a style it's a uh he knows style I know style and my Footwear is cringe my Footwear is Yo okay well you guys vote vote in the comments leave a like for mine and leave a comment for Samy's subscribe to Flo plane if you just want Runners and I do use chat GPD sometimes just to help with polishing my wordings and and just general research because ghou sucks we have a whole video about
that I used co-pilot a couple times when I accidentally tried to lock my laptop went like that I just want to mentioned before people think I completely hate this laptop I think the like the physical appearance of the laptop was great great like you said the keyboard's great you know the webcam is great the mic's great it's extremely light i l the Samsung laptop with my personal heavy laptop and it was so light and thin I didn't notice a weight difference in my backpack nor
did I feel like I had any space issues the fan also I don't know if you guys have any comments about it but mine was so quiet I totally forgot to comment about it because I didn't notice it once it's just that like quiet and I feel like you know if you're in like a lecture I feel like you always you always hear one two people that have like the whole time right like their their alien wear and that's especially true if they're trying to actually like record anything like especially with
video like man I don't know what it is every Windows laptop I've ever owned all  call it sounds like it's trying to take off from the desk I mean I don't blame it those calls are boring anyway what are we feeling overall guys I've had a great time with mine only running into a major issue at day 29 out of 30 that's pretty darn good I love it I don't think I'm going back to x86 I'm not sure that I will for now I don't feel like this can be your primary computer maybe not even your own laptop but personally I
would highly recommend this as a secondary computer or tertiary by that point since you've got a desktop and a laptop already and this is just your Mobility focused computer but that's fair enough depending on what you're doing now one thing to remember is that AMD just released a lineup of CPU that is much more competitive battery LifeWise but they aren't competitive pricewise these come in at a lower cost than AMD and presumably Intel's upcoming latest gen mobile CPUs meaning that you
can't really compare them directly like maybe by going Qualcomm you give up some program compatibility but you get more RAM or you get a better screen which could make things even more compelling if you can actually work on it though well yeah that that is a major issue and I think we're in agreement then Qualcomm Snapdragon X laptops excellent if everything you do is in a browser or if you already have another computer for the work that you need to do on another computer hopefully someday it'll be for
