when one of my gaming systems spectacularly failed dumping water down the entire rest of the rack the most expensive piece of equipment I lost was this battery backup now the obvious thing to do when a piece of uh high voltage electrical equipment gets doused in water would be to buy a new one but I have a better plan you see battery backups are expensive and one of the most important parts the lead acid batteries seem to be working just fine no that isn't how I checked them to eBay
I went and while I could have bought a lightly used unit Sands battery it was this shipping damaged one that caught my eye hey tyan have a look at what we're going to be working on today oh boy specifically it is thousands of dollars worth of shipping damage I got this unit for just 500 bucks meaning that it could very well be worth the time assuming not to mention dangerous process of transplanting the hopefully working internals from the shipping damaged unit into the uh well probably still good
steel chassis of the original one so we can hope that's why I brought tinan he's going to help make sure that I don't die today are you out your ug whip well I am excuse me what are you doing now you can enter the rich takes to win a Hennessy Vasa rer 600 a go play disp a truck of "$100,000 " cash don't smash the car smash the link in the description from my point of view there's two options we can look at the original unit and try and diagnose what exactly in it may or may not be dead or
we can look at the new unit which I have about 12 days to inform the seller if it doesn't work and we can determine if we think there's even a chance that transplanting those parts in here is going to make this fully functional let's open up the shipping damaged one if only there was some way to remove these fasteners like a screwdriver from LTT store.com now I have to confess to you I did something bad I did open up the original one to have a look at it I didn't touch anything which is very
important because more than anything else we've ever done folks do not try this at home this is high voltage High current electrical equipment there are capacitors in here that if you touch them you will die and the batteries that too oh yeah I I fooled around with the batteries too that's why I'm pretty sure that they're working but if you wanted to validate that for me then uh that would probably be really good U Titan's background is what are you like megatronics like mechatronics
engineering yeah yeah so some mechanical some Electronics oh grief yeah lead acid batteries he told me when he came in today that he was worried we might be doing the lithium ion one I was like no I know much better than to fool around with any lithium ion battery this 196 volts it's pretty pretty clear that some of these boards did get a little bit rough housed in shipping like this one yeah that looks very distra I've seen so much worse than this the outside is really bad you can tell this thing took
some bangs yeah but like most of it looks fine what's safe to touch like these wires for sure yeah this shroud probably maybe depending what's under it everything's probably safe but double check boards designed like this should have bleed resistors on any of the big capacitors so they should discharge in a safe time but you don't want to assume that right how do we check looks like there's a whole bunch of touch points on a lot of the main traces that should be able to be measured before you get to
probating those should we change gears and have a look at the water damaged one to see if there's any clues as to what we may or may not need to salvage for sure this could be good because what's missing from the ship damaged one is all of the boards associated with the interface and the display which I mean clearly didn't get at least much water on it does anything jump out at you immediately here it's really dusty we moved all the equipment in while the house was kind of still a
construction zone that's on me I think I noticed something the new one is rev03 and the original one is Rev 00p see even when you revise a product that doesn't mean that you revise every component of the product they may be  go wholesale complete change out and then hope for the best depends on how much time we have probably first thing is figuring out if there's anything obvious that's not connected that's supposed to be everything should be connected I haven't actually touched
anything in here because I knew that I was out of my depth yeah I more meant like shorts or disconnects oh sure other possible spots are over the fan here in fact you can see where the water drips were coming through here there are no holes convent over this board which is good these holes are obviously the relay right there breaker and then there were also holes here what's this that's a plug that oh that should not be a problem okay and then these holes were over the battery compartment which
survived and is now completely dry this happened over a month ago now and it seems fine I don't think the breakers are damaged to the point where it would matter oh really cuz either they're connected or they're not connected and they're connected Ed oh balls it's probably not going to be an easy fix there's a chance that there's like some of the fuses for the inputs blue or okay maybe some of the control board or what looks like a control board back here fried uhhuh oh oh oh oh oh
could this be as simple as a safety feature working for safety and our fuse blue quite possibly hey blown fuses we know this because we're getting a continuity beep on the shipping damage unit and we are not getting a continuity beep on these units this is input from the batteries to the inverter mhm this looks like it might be the ground return maybe no what is that for what I'm gathering is you don't want to just put the new fuses in because then we don't have backup fuses if they blow depends
on how dangerous you want to live cuz yeah we have one attempt at these fuses not blowing again right we should probably take these out of the chassis okay I can do that cool I'll do that one one of the things I am concerned about for this is the second board underneath which may have been water damaged more than we can see here and this other fuse looks like it goes straight down whenever you're looking at an electrical system like this for capacitors you want to look for anything that's 50 volts
rated or higher I would recommend checking everything but those are the ones you really want to look for 275 so we want to check the big oh I didn't even see that one big and then you want to see look for the two sides of the capacitor in this case there's a whole bunch of vas around on these traces so you can just find traces on both sides prep across it and you just want to see that it's zero or close to zero now I noticed you have this set to volts DC but this says it's rated for
275 volts ac yeah capacitors are rated differently for AC versus DC depending on the type but when you're trying to make sure something's deenergized you want to measure DC cuz AC can't exist when it's unplugged I'm excited they never let me play with stuff like this that's why I'm here my only thing is that if I ever die on camera I expect the company to monetize it get that cheddar I know it doesn't matter cuz they design around it but it always sketches me out when you screw a metal
screw with a metal washer directly onto a PCB I just don't like it well that's probably a good thing they can cause fires sometimes while I was doing some research for this shoot I found a nice eaten handbook that I found extraordinarily entertaining oh super professional oh my God that's Professor Watson I love him the particular page that really got me was this one nine ways beer and UPS's are alike okay here she comes oh perfect I can look at that now okay I'm not going to break anything
wo nice solder jaw eaten that's quality didn't realize these were passs for the ball yeah it took me a minute to figure that out too they go into what look like gigantic chunky ground it's it's they're essentially bus bars between the boards so that's how they're getting lots of power in between the two boards without having turn wires it's kind of funky though that they just use Giant standoffs I mean Metal's metal yeah and if it's metal then it's metal but like and they're brass look at this Sho we
thought the top was bad yeah look giant capacitor Bank wa wa look at the size of the bleed resistors yeah yeah before we tear them both completely apart what are the odds that the short in the breaker would have caused those fuses to blow it would have had to have been a short between the breakers cuz one breaker is a single phase of power so it have to short across two phases for those to blow and in theory these should break if anything Downstream of them fails but if that
were true then why would you need fuses anyway uh because you're dealing with enough power that if something goes wrong your board's going to melt right your hands are small right oh yeah cool that's my superpower I will need your small hands to get that exact connector out uh all right cool I think it's dead I it looks like it's dead I call dead oh yes okay we found another dead fuse this time on the bottom board huh all the fuse is blue the system works oh yeah okay actually getting a close-up of
the two fuses is probably interesting cuz here's the noted one oh yeah oh there's your problem hey we found it we were looking at the top yeah that's not good okay that's very not good okay well no that's great now I know why it's dead yeah can actually see where some of the electricity was breaking through the solder mask around the edge of the trace oh cool that would have uh electrolyzed the water so this fuse probably tried to save everything else but it was completely soaked in water and never
stood a chance unfortunately thank you for your service I found some more hidden and sneaky shipping damage on one of the boards that got a little bit crunched oh it doesn't look like it's damaged it'll impact anything but I'll be taking a closer look at this board after we get it out okay I have bad news I believe this is a different revision than the one that's in here so we may need this board to work yeah like your IC is completely yeah different from mine there's the
crunch oh that might be fine yeah like it's it's it's probably fine that might just be a ground or something right I'm not taking everything out of here because we decided that we were going to keep the receptacles and also uh the side is super mangled on this one yeah for the input so I guess we just leave all of that which is kind of convenient because it means we're not actually rewiring that much so is this it yeah I think we just put it back together okay good luck everybody now under normal
circumstances I would absolutely look at something like this and I'd go oh man let's just let's do a quick test of it you know on the bench but we can't we don't even have a way of connecting the top board to the bottom board without screwing the whole thing together anyway also from a safety standpoint this chassis protects us from even if we're careful accidentally touching something that we really don't want to touch yeah there were I think 7 or 600 volt caps under here looks like I'm now ready for Board
number the two no way yeah I've got my Breakers almost in dude ni this is going so fast yeah we're going to plug this whole thing back together it's going to turn right on we're going to be like damn we're really good at this and it was totally worth it you know we've actually got a couple of videos coming soon on the economics of you know buying broken stuff on eBay and fixing them we bought half a dozen CPUs and then I think we bought a bunch of motherboards then we're going to compare to the
median us wage and see if we could make a living just like buying things on eBay and fixing them um this one was unint this was more just I really really really really really didn't want to buy another one I don't know exactly why these are directional but I do see what looks like a diode marker on them which implies it's designed to go in a particular direction oh generally with these when they break they're high enough voltage that it'll maintain an arc even if the conductor has broken so
they're filled with glass or sand that act to damp out the arc that's created okay here's your orientation cool got to say I kind of feel like I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop a little bit here on this project uh same it's going too good okay this cable was almost certainly supposed to be routed underneath but um it makes it which means that's the last screw what's your confidence level honestly pretty high now I have an idea okay I was thinking we power it up with just the battery
before actually plugging it into the wall sure okay do you need help no you sure I'm used to having to carry around something heavy like this you know with  yeah squeaky noises in electronics yay uh BP volt out of range UPS shutting off battery pack let battery pack the J of range which is probably too low okay oh it's probably shutting itself off cuz because it's too low too low yeah which so with a wall plug it's probably   is slide her in I was about to say that's the last thing that's broken I
forgot my son's gaming rig is like she's working but she's limping he nothing beeped or was  I hear the UPS let's go have a look load knot powered emergency off says battery pack voltage out of range but we measured the voltage at about 200 and on the top of the unit it says nominal pack voltage is 180 volts so that should be fine yeah dude tyan oh did we do a dumb uh well we didn't oh no but I might have see that little green RPO thing it's supposed to be jumed oh yeah it is I know the thing
I've meant to put that back in yep that's important after painstakingly paying super careful attention to everything we did internally I think we just were like oh we put it back together let's go test it and I think we might have just missed that jumper and that might be it well powered on already okay hold on it's saying please wait right now it worked online mode boom we're in oh that was terrible that sucks yeah let's go she's on load protected online mode okay okay
yeah yeah yeah I'm plugging the pdu in okay go for it oh it's alive it's drawing the power yeah this right here this is the face of a guy who just saved thousands of dollars ah freaking awesome time to get everything plugged back in probably the worst thing that I've been doing lately no no it's not in this is the fact that the 240 volt device on the other end which is the 115in TV cuz it's China I just plugged it into a 120 volt outlet and I was like I don't know maybe it's going
to be fine my understanding is it does put additional strain on the power supply but shouldn't kill it immediately so I'm going to be powering my TV properly now properly well properly is you know you can just re terminate the plug onto the actual cable instead of Jerry rigging the cable to another cable right um yeah but this was convenient because I think the cable was already in the wall or something I don't know yeah you you can terminated to the cable that was in the wall yeah I don't know there was
a reason I did it that way I can't remember what it was okay boop boop boop "boop boop and boob 1 and 1 12,000 Watts" no problem baby efficiency 87% I don't know if that's good but it's good enough for me and it's good enough to tell you why would I be working if I could be driving Hennessy's brand new Vel brother in Soul Lake City shut up Dennis wo Baja mode oh that sounds crazy oh my god did I just run over someone now we have the chance to win this truck home but our sponsor Rich
look at the new Hennessy world how beautiful oh it's actually salty if this is not to your tastes how about this goldplated cyber truck and this is real gold I'm sure you will get all the attention you've been dreaming of but rid I'm more of a real gold digger oh my Wick fine you can take this bag of cash home with you instead from now till September 13 you can enter the contest with no purchase needed or get more entries when you spent on the rich website $1 equals one entry just
make sure you use our Link in the description denn how did you get into the car I can't tell if I'm blessed or C you know both like the water the random corrosion wouldn't have happened to someone who was blessed right but then someone who was cursed couldn't have possibly gotten a UPS of that caliber for $500 and conveniently had someone on staff who knew how to rebuild it well yeah that too if you guys enjoyed this video maybe go check out part one where the bulk of the diagnosis of the leak
itself took place hey do you want to see the fitting yes
