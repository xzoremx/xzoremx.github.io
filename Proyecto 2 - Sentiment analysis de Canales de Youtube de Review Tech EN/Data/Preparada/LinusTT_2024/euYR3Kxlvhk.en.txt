okay here we go Dan why are your pants so wet not on camera and this is why I need MCM bad cable management it's disease and someone's got to cure it that's why lonus became the setup doctor I'm Dan I'm 31 and I'm the technical architect for Linus Media Group most of my free time is spent doing OST work for games uh solo Dev and all that sort of stuff are you planning to put on some weight Dan this is a wide door wow ceiling power ram wall I live in a garage am I doing this right yeah also this picture
there if you want to just move the eyes oh God uh you got projector screen yes and projector screen no this was the original one when I had the projector mounted up by The Loft up there right and then you were like what about second projector about second projector screen and so I made the custom wall with you know projectors I don't know what my expectations were but this is them any who there's not actually that much in the way of awful Cable Management in here I assume that's somewhere else 
God don't don't look when did you stop trying when I couldn't fit behind the desk I mean there's not that much more over there you know what it's not that bad with the setup doctor here in the house and his capable team I think we can fix what hails you wait where do I even start for this procedure oh too complicated thankfully our sponsor ODU is here to save my patient with their allinone platform for business it's great for finance sales HR marketing and more ODU brings your dead workflow and
your poor patient back to life you know considering all the utility it's really not that bad in here you've got your soldering SL working station you've got a couple 3D printers you've got couldn't help noticing a 4 Bas station VR Gaming setup in here got to love it and then can you explain this to me because I um don't music so this is a Digi design control 24 and it only worked with a few versions of Protools because avid's an evil evil company I was taught that these are basically just a big mouse the
nice thing about this one in particular is it's motorized so when changes happen in the Box here they're reflected in the unit somebody wrote a piece of software where you can connect it to anything including Ableton and it also has a midi mode which is pretty cool too okay cool and this is your mouse pad yeah cuz I don't have enough room for you know a normal mouse pad when I'm using this thanks I hate it yeah and then when I am not using it I use this I hate it slightly less yeah
it's kind of a bit better moving over here I like your rack Dan thank thank you uh you got a 280 TI the GPU actually came from one of the other things that I won at the Christmas party which was that giant Digital Storm PC with the LT on it thought you'd never use it you thought you'd leave it for so long that the die separates from the water yeah well I haven't really had time to like finish out my living room computer right now it has a 390 in it and then there's two more 390s there and then this 2080
TI and this 2080 TI cuz I mostly just like I don't know do DS game emulation it also has two CPUs for about 112 threads and 128 gigs of ECC memory cuz you know I got to watch YouTube videos in the living room right so this is an in progress project it's amazing that you talked for that long and yet I have more questions than when you started what's in here is that the C that that thing is made of no the C box is in the living room that's the name of the living room PC whoa that joke's not safe for YouTube
but you can check out the uncensored version on lmg g/f flat plane but don't worry the rest of the jokes are good old familyfriendly fun that's what this house is all about do you have a cat no that is for nail polish oh why is that for a cat oh it's good for finding where they peed there's a not yet I mean I can see how it all happens yeah exactly with all this lewd material lying around mhm okay so what's the plan we get to work Absol a lot of cable management there's a lot of cables Step
One is we've got to get access to the back of this desk and I assume the best way to do that is kind of slide out this side a little we're actually going to be taking the whole desk out oh my God yeah Dan has made a custom new desk that's going to go in this space so we got a lot of moving to do like everything's just coming out of here everything everything to where garbage I can't  damage per second is not something that I really want in a gaming chair yeah I left the to wear the or the back both of 
stuff good work guys here we go SP it down for a second no no God dan stop stop little F what is falling Dan's got this ingenious way to mount his monitor so that they're directed at him it's a screwdriver do you know how much prime Acoustics are I'm not going to buy entire new ones most of this EUR racks by intelligel who I believe are local boys shout out intelligel this rack's cool cuz it's 19in and it's also uh desk stand as well I like this one it's wow is this the same company
that makes the computers I highly doubt   thumbnail a spaghetti day I'm having an Italian food day too much a noa's cooking you're so skinny you should eat something no mama let me o do something about this mess with our sponsor Odo you see you probably have all kinds of different software for different things like accounting project management stop zooming in my house HR and lead generation and of course marketing wait what is that doing there stop wasting time on app hunting ODU is
an allinone platform for everything you need kind of like a magic toolbox I just finished sending an invoice I got paid and I even reported Dan for stealing things from the office all here on Odo with no sweat involved try for yourself with their 15-day free trial of all their apps check out the link in the video description now let's put things back so we can continue our video oh come on so do you see why cable managing is hard now are you going to know where all of this goes back into yeah I made a
plan that's part of what those are for so this is basically where everything plugs in I've labeled all of these in a little map of where everything's going to go I'll take them from you this is uh this is what Flo plane looks like Luke's in charge of float plane I know for a fact this make sure that it doesn't like  sideways ow one of the reasons I'm so excited for this desk and for the doctor to come in here because I'm an advocate for my own care I've designed this desk
to work specifically with MCM so we've got two steel tubes along the back here which should perfectly fit one of these XL arches that'll create an integrated cable channel right in the back of the desk all of them kind of connect to each other so this cable channel will run perfectly along the entire back side of the desk and if we want to get cables out of the back side of the desk we can just put them like there and bring them out easy now the last thing we have to do is just get this thing assembled we
got the leggies and they're going to bolt in like n this is one of the first welding projects that I've ever done so some of them are nice and his tinan says uh Grinders and paint make me the welder I ain't who designed the desk me is there anywhere that people could learn about how you designed it there is I did a float plane exclusive part of Dan  n Dan why are your pants so wet you also got a server rack yeah why cuz you took mying rack oh yeah all of those are like
all of the stuff has the stuff has to go back in the stuff so I got a what's it called like a relay Rack or something like that which is more like a skeletonized rack I got a whole bunch of cables from infinite cables we'll show them off later I'm really excited I figured it was easier to like get all new cables than sorting out that Rat's Nest and this is also something they sell too which is pretty sick not super expensive and probably a little Overkill but it was the best kind of thing that I
thought to do you can see it's like a 209 28 U Rack or something like that not too bad I should have got rack studs as well that was a mistake hey look at the rack stun yeah so the rest of the plan is going to be we're going to move the desk into its final position we're going to get all of the stuff back in here on it and then we're going to Route all of those cables into this rack and it's going to be really smooth and there's not going to be any problem problem s everything's going to go great no one's
going to cry Dan Dan not on camera Dan do not cry so loud you're on mic uh computer time um sure monitors let's get everything up there thank you yeah that goes right  now the cable management is great but it's always a good idea to start with properly length cables you don't want a whole bunch of excess kind of baled up under your desk so I went and got a whole bunch of these perfectly length cables from Phantom cable which will help us redo everything to be super neat movie movie Switch normal whole Patch
Adams I was going to say Frey  MCM uh Dan you said you had a good use for the cable ties oh yeah cuz I'm trying to mount this uh HDMI cable to like a vertical surface but the these ones don't work on vertical surfaces cuz they have to do that way so the cable ties go vertical so you can mount them vertically one cool trick that we found out about these cable tie holders that we didn't even think about when we were developing them is that if you have say like short cable ties and you can't hold
the whole bundle of what you're trying to hold you can actually route two of them through this so you can have two runs of cables going parallel by just putting instead of wrapping them all the way around the bottom you just wrap them through there look at that you can have two runs going we've taken our magnetic power bar keys and we've hooked them up so you just kind of put them through the little hole and you slide them in to lock them and then you tighten them down bada bing bada 
dan stop not at the Dan not at work wow this is great progress you guys much better thanks okay I'm kidding oh wow that sarcastic thing I said before but again do you guys need some help we would love some help oh I love your desk though Dan Isn't it nice this looks great yeah it looks like the last thing we got to kind of do is the rack and kind of get everything terminated here um but I think most of most of the stuff I'm back right now you came back thank you most of the stuff is going to end up
here and then I think that's about it can I mount some stuff in a rack or what can I do yeah let's get some stuff in the rack did we not bring him rack studs do we not love Dan nope okay right there and right there yeah okay I got you Dan the space looks amazing well looks like it has the bones of amazing all right what else can I write I yes okay yes good yes under dude this thing is heavy for not being on Rails of any sort oh yeah also it's called a liquid Channel but
did you really have to get liquid on it I don't know I wouldn't touch it the previous owner I'm going to not finish Ence where do you want this power play pro oh under the liquid would work sure and could you pull the like in the in the sink or the bathtub uh bathtub sinkless stainless sorry you want the rack out yeah if you could just pull that out okay here we go how do I keep doing this hand you good I have a I even I even preloaded one man I meant to hold that in my mouth
and it ended up all the way in my mouth so Dan there's some Linus DNA on one of these nuts don't do anything weird with it I'm taking your black light no and I can't Harden my nail polish I've never seen you wear nail polish is that actually what it's for uh it is actually for hardening nail polish but the nail polish is used for like filling in embossed things cuz I used to do photography for a nail company apparently Luke's bomb works there no way yeah small world huh it really is
then again Luke's mom works everywhere  no no no I meant she has a strong do I meant she has a strong entrepreneurial Spirit yeah what can I do for you boys wow it's actually thank you looking somewhat serviceable down there yeah what I think you can do now if you so dare attempt do you want to patch this uh sure now you're going to do that I don't like your spreadsheet why it didn't print well a three I'm touching Adam's knob right now he says it's the best Dan's knob this is
Dan's knob sorry Dan's knob yeah you got you won't get to tou this this don't be gross Dan I have patched your patches oh okay cool awesome I put a cable tie there oh beautiful well I don't know about beautiful but you can face the wall with it acceptable that's the nicest thing he's ever said to me don't forget it so all the power is in this one here so all the gear is going to get patched into that and then the sub and both those monitors are also going to get patched in here and where's the Dom
go uh that's you I routed everything here so that most of the audio equipment comes on with a single button simultaneously s ously you and all the gear and you and you there we go monitor monitor subwoofer and all of this we've got everything assuming I patched it correctly yeah but I mean that doesn't matter as much that's on everything looks good and I've even got these nice pullout lights here on this power conditioner W pull out lights yeah I could have used one of those then I
might not have three kids so Dan we're almost at the end how do you feel I feel pretty good everything seems to be working so far uh plugging things in everything kind of worked out of the box which is good couple of them were backwards seems to be a lot more space in here which is kind of nice I still have some work to do probably after these guys leave me alone with my new desk and room but yeah I think we're we're just about there it's been a long day yeah it's been a couple hours oh God
sorry I think that today was an undeniable success I think this whole room looks crazy good there's barely any cables in sight despite the fact that it already looks a little bit lived in I think it's been awesome it's like sure there's a little bit of mess but that's a server wreck you're going to deal with that yeah there's more work to do on it anyway yeah and when you get your desk organized this would be a great place to exist now that we've tied it up Dan's desk which by the way looks
amazing it's time to tidy up his business I do a lot of freelance and right now I'm just using Google Sheets to track my projects and do invoicing oh do ah ODU has all kinds of apps like their project app which will help keep Dan organized and productive allowing him to ATT track everything he needs in terms of communication with the client as well as its current status it even has built-in  logging looks like I just made you 4 seconds worth of Revenue on uh new music project that's $4
then when he's done he can create an invoice in the accounting app which includes integrated messaging so he can communicate with his team and he can preview the invoice and go ahead and send it off so don't wait try ODU now for free at the link in the video description the setup doctor does it again tune in next time when he treats the setup of one of you yes you the viewer another successful operation from the setup doctor no
