people pay big bucks for the fastest PCS so then you would think conversely if you buy the slowest components you should save a ton of money right I mean it sounds logical enough and this is brand new hardware it's got to be better than buying something used right well not necessarily last time around we used the Athlon 3000g which by the way AMD still hasn't replaced other than to give it a packaging refresh and a shiny new partner just a couple of months ago not to be outdone Intel has come out with
something since then that is somehow a bit slower on first glance the Intel Celeron G500 is quite similar to amd's worst both are dual core chips based on their respective Brands 14 nmet processors with PCI Express gen 3 dual Channel ddr4 memory and built-in Graphics but the Celeron is slower clocking at 3.4 GHz to the Athlon 3.5 with just one thread per core rather than two all while drawing almost twice as much power we're going to have it linked in the video description in case you want to see the
full specs but I really don't think any of you should be running out to buy this thing even if it does include this spiffy heat sinking fan maybe you'd rather check out our sponsor pulseway it systems can be a pain but with pulse's remote monitoring and management software there a breeze get real-time system monitoring instant alerts and auto remediation all from one platform at any time using any device start your free trial today with the link below we'll pair our little Celeron or celery
as we used to call them with a basic motherboard that we dug out of storage since the exact board doesn't affect performance much for this generation h410 and b460 were the entrylevel chipsets but they'll cost you around a 100 Yankee Doodles these days notably this is not a good price when you're spending only $50 on your CPU which highlights one of the major issues with buying super low tier brand new hardware the supporting players might end up breaking your budget even if you feel
like you're getting a deal on one of the components that's why we took a completely different approach with our comparable system this time around oh yes we're doing one of those as well by going secondhand the DDR 42666 supported by our CPU is still readily available though these days you have to go out of your way if you want to find less than an 8 gig dual Channel kit which we did so we have gone with this single 4 gig stick avengeance lpx ddr4 and for storage we've got this bad
boy it is getting pretty unusual for us to do a build with a conventional hard drive these days and literally all of the pre-built PCS that we looked at from major retailers Shi with ssds now but hey these good oldfashioned Spin and hunks of metal they ain't dead yet so we settled on the WD 5000 AZ RZ from Western digitals blue lineup it holds 500 GB of storage includes a 64 megabyte cache spins at 5400 revolutions per minute and has a transfer rate of up to 150 mbes a second
yeah you're going to be plenty slow for our little sluggish PC here ah isn't that cute to be honest guys we weren't sure how to settle on the slowest case is it the heaviest the one with the worst airf flow the one without any keyed heads on the screws so it takes longer to assemble even with the help of a trusty KN to Edition LTT Screwdriver from LTT store.com we ended up settling on the fantex eclipse g300 a and then we made a cute little na decal for the side now for some reason power supply
manufacturers don't include a speed rating in their spec so we went with a basic 450 W unit from fsp nothing to really write home about here folks but plenty capable of powering this sluggish setup it's the hexa 85 Plus Pro with the Final Touch being our 8 Pin PCI Express auxiliary power which we are not going to need at all believe it or not you can still get brand new GT 730s which did work on Windows 11 at one point but seem to have lost support in recent drivers so we are
going to be going with the almost as terrible GT 1030 it really is still more of a I desperately need a second Monitor and a low profile case sort of card as opposed to a gaming device especially considering amd's recent launch of onboard Graphics that can run circles around it but let's give it a go that is one slow gaming PC you can fit so much slow in this bad boy I think having one RGB thing is worse than having no RGB things just looks so out of place that's the hardest working red LED gaming hey
actually can't see it on my display I can see it on the capture machine over there now it's on mine awesome haven't seen Windows take this long to load in a little while uh wow it's like the gym teacher came in and Microsoft was like okay how many laps should I run coach and the gym teacher was like yes going around oh my God it's still going it went black for a second thought we were done do you guys remember the early days of SSD when people like me were out there going yeah SSD it's a big deal it
makes a big difference and the hard drive enthusiasts because yes that was the thing we're all the transfer speeds aren't even that much faster hard drive hard drive hard drive no no this is what I was talking about  helping are we going to leave this whole uninterrupted clip in the video just to show people hoing long it takes okay there we go there's the wallpaper hold on where's my password prompt look guys this is not fake okay I'm still waiting on it hey I don't know what we were doing for
all those other circles but we're not done yet let's run some more my desktop icons are still loading Google Chrome what's that oh there it is where's my start menu at I right clicked let's see how long it takes to register this is not all hard Drive I've seen hard drive based computers be  acceptable and this meets Windows 11's minimum specs this is within Windows 11's minimum spec Microsoft did you learn nothing from Vista okay I'm just going to click the start [Laughter]  
it hey you besides that no problem at all okay there we go oh no Counter Strike has an update Q Jord come on what 160 megabytes that could take hours pause Doom yeah yeah no it'll it'll it'll do that it's just it needs a second to spool down it's stopping the download oh my God it's happened today yeah that 150 Megs a year hey there we go baby I'll fire up frame view but first I want to see how fast we can download a game we are almost certainly CPU bottlenecked right now and we are
looking at 20 megabytes a second that's atrocious it's too broken for me to even compare the download speeds to I was just looking at our chilled thread per video and we were downloading at 8 gabit per second desktop window manager is pulling 5% of this CPU Windows problem reporting 4% we are coming down at between 15 and 20 megabytes per second so that's in the 200 megabit range and we are sucking back 40% of this CPU we're going to see what's faster Linus's bladder or Counter-Strike running and install
script my bets on Linus the computer wins and lus is not fast in the bathroom did I win oh never mind it's launched but I mean is it we could probably call it a draw it says walking wait up close it warning graphics driver is out of date we'll be okay don't show again they're from yesterday it'll probably be okay hello is it just broken I do not understand what's happening right now I think it's fading in cuz the background is getting darker this is messed up okay 1920 x 1080 here we go here we go 
how is this built out of components you can still buy brand new why are companies selling these things is this Counter Strike 2 we're not trying to play cyberpunk I don't even think we'd be able to play Peggle on this thing  leg I'm waiting for task manager to load right now task manager in summary we spent 38 $380 it's not even that cheap to build a steaming pile of garbage for real guys this is so slow that it's basically e-w by modern standards but we didn't do this because we thought it was a good
idea we did it to illustrate a point which this far into the video we are now finally getting to thank you for your patience our alternative to the slowest PC last time went a little bit off the rails we suggested a build that cost twice as much and while obviously I know what we were trying to say by spending 2x you could achieve a performance uplift of 3x or 4X or even more this time we wanted to challenge ourselves to do better so we have stuck with the exact same price point of our slowest
build and by turning to the used Market we have gotten a lot more bang for our buck Facebook Marketplace unfort for didn't have much exciting in our area at the moment but we hit Pay Dirt on Craigslist with this Acer pre-built with an eigh gen core i58400 that is a six Core sixth thread CPU 8 gigs of ddr4 RAM a 500 gig SSD and a fresh install of Windows 11 all for $200 old pre-assembled Office Machines like this are great for Budget Gamers because they are known to be compatible
and working and they often come cheaper than the individual parts or even older custom gaming PCs if you see people listing those so we snapped it up and brought it back to the office to test out it came with a rather disappointing power supply just 300 wats and only enough connectors for what was already in the tower but otherwise everything looks like a decent enough base with our system and left us with a budget of $180 for a GPU and a new power supply we were someone got a synonym for pretty darn
surprised we were stupified to find a used 1080 TI for just $150 on eBay what a deal but unfortunately that didn't leave us with enough for a decent power supply so we ended up with a used non-ti 1080 for around $120 and added a brand new thermal smart 650 watt for $60 let's fire this up for comparison hey nice it's even got a speaker for that price one two three and we're booted wow it's almost like it's a way better computer there's my task manager I mean sure that's a
fair bit of CPU to be using at booted up but at least steam is open already wow what a difference man to be clear this is still an older machine that was a bit of a delay when I clicked on the system tray for the first time but this is a market difference I want to see how fast we can download a game get pegle okay it's not quite the same game I'm I'll get F1 so it's still not fast and we are clearly CPU bottlenecked at that speed look at this this is great but I was able to open task
manager at least I was able to identify the problem the whole interface is so much snappier look what if I wanted to browse the web there it is look how quick this download is done the whole update is done in the time that it took to just click on it on the last computer oh that was supposed to be a video okay hilarious wow you can change to full  remarkable jeez man that was brutal dude okay that's not a ton of fpss those 1% lows in particular not that great but I got a
kill already um I'll just oh oh hello spawn kill oh no what okay I'm not getting the highest FPS or anything like that especially those 1% lows are dipping down to like 70 but this is very very usable and I know some people are just plain not interested in used Hardware because they have concerns about reliability they don't like the process of meeting up with people on Craigslist or whatever else but guys before you buy something entry level try and find your scrapyard
War spirit because these experiences are not like when you're choosing a new graphics card for $400 and you might get 72 FPS or 83 FPS we are talking dramatic differences in the usability of these machines oh what that was terrible I'd be so much happier with this like not even I mean look I do understand that you are giving up a warranty by going this route but if you test things before you buy them it's probably not a big deal if that 6-year-old 8-year-old CPU hasn't died already it's probably not
going to die anytime soon and realistically if it does hey you've gained some valuable scrapyard boring skills that will get you back up and running in no time going the used route also reduces e waste keeping these still serviceable Parts in operation instead of in a landfill and I mean hey you get a better machine for your money just like you'll get more for your money with our sponsor Opera GX browsing the worldwide web doesn't need to be as dry and boring as Shredded Wheat Opera GX is
a flavor explosion of a web browsing experience it has a bunch of different mods to make your browser just a little more personal things like unique and customizable themes alongside background music music and keyboard sounds this is crazy or check out the GX store to see what features and backgrounds others have made some browsers can be a major resource drain while you're trying to game oper GX lets you adjust how much of your system is being used at any given time which means you don't have to
download more RAM from freer.com not only do they make it easy to Port over from your old browser but oper GX supports all Google Chrome extensions I'm learning so much so get started with Opera GX totally free today by clicking our Link in the description below if you guys enjoyed this video check out the last time we built a slowest computer most of those parts are still available as well you want us to want us to race them or I know it's going to win maybe if we put Windows XP on them they'll
have a chance maybe
