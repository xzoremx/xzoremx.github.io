then I'm afraid this one's not going to be a lot of fun because the badminton SL land gaming center is going freaking awesome I've got Dan and the smash Champs team here to show you guys everything from the server room to the vending machines to the game cameras on the courts let's start with the access control okay Dan let us in all right here's your new Badminton Center there you go open the door but that's an aerono invalid pin but it works in you go it's great start are there problems
with the other stuff yeah probably all right the haters might get something out of this and they're going to get the segue to our sponsor Odo their all-in-one business software can help you focus on running and improving your business rather than wasting time jumping between different apps click the link in the description or watch till the end of this video to learn more this is incredible the shop looks amazing and I noticed all the security cameras are in there's a couple that we didn't do
upstairs but they're not technically our fault what even does that mean I'll show you later there's lots more before we get to that our Pro Shop's going to be carrying a variety of BS rackets strings grips and shuttles from Brands like Victor and yanx and look at that we've even got shoes did we show the stringing machines last time I don't think so these things are awesome I've seen these binton tennis racketball squash theoretically these machines can do them but I think
we're only trained for badminton r rets that's right right we don't know how to do tennis rackets do we no we don't no we don't cool but what we do know how to do is install TVs and I'm really excited to show you guys how these work not on this one this one I don't think is powered on yet oh no hold on before we get to that yeah you're going to need a point of sale system I don't see one yeah uh there's also no ethernet for it did they not put the ethernet in here my original
plan there was three along here yeah and then at some point it got changed and now there's none that's for a security monitor so there's a pull cord why would they put a pull cord and not the ethernet cuz you didn't ask for ethernet I did I did get your documents out of here I have papers to prove it that doesn't mean I didn't ask for it that just means I didn't make it on the they on my drawings okay but the TVs have networking right that's right they run on 100 Meg well okay yeah uh we would
have gone with high-end digital signage but then we saw the price it was a lot of money and these TCL TVs they seem fine with that said there may have been some advantages to going with digital sence you didn't have to buy the absolute cheapest TVs well let's drop in on Jake real quick your review of the content management system for these in five  less that's not even a word he didn't even need words folks we have some learning to do and also I hate it yeah look once it's got some static images on
it to just cycle through it'll probably be good enough but uh are you trying to put crab rave on it yes wait a second is this like a TCL thing it's called Zebo it's like a signage management thing oh okay so it can run on Android it can run on like Tyson OS it can run on all the different things so we just side loaded the app on there it gives you a code we're self-hosting this it's cludy and like it'll look fine here and then you get to the TV and it's whatever that is it's definitely playing I can hear it
but why is it in a tiny window at the top also that's got to be like 144p well maybe it's cuz it's a piece of crap and you bought the cheapest TVs a Costco I think it just doesn't use the hardware acceleration of the chip that's in this TV when it's a YouTube inent I was going to try just uploading crab Rave as a file but it fails with no error reason all right enough of what doesn't work let's look at what does work Raj you're the vending machine King right yep okay can I buy something sure you can are you
sure yeah it's going to work yeah he's staking his entire reputation on this working just try it h what should I get wait why do we have Prime are you a Logan Paul fan wait is that the Paul brother that does prime does it matter no not really uh okay I'm going to buy a  it works success look at that and it's cold how does restocking work ttic oh wow that's tedious and then I P it out no you just  more do the twist sorry oh okay cool oh wow that's going to be pretty heavy with a bunch of stuff
on it so I can put my like half drunk one here and like no one would be any of the wiser sure no that's the wrong answer you can't let me do that it's a funny thing right because until I had to buy a vending machine I didn't think about it at all yeah my understanding of vending machines is like stuck in the '90s where they're all like super mechanical and things like that this one's got like Windows on it and it's got Wi-Fi and like wow no I think it's more than just Wi-Fi I think it has a
cellular connection that is and it talks back to their servers in order to like make sure that they're getting their commission basically enough about all that stuff though let's move out where the real excitement is we had these benches specially made for our Badminton Center and there's a couple of things that are pretty cool about them uh let's put one right here which is going to be behind Court 1 first things first it's at exactly the right height such that you can plug in your phone to charge
while you're waiting for court time these 1ex one strips are going to have those like gym mat pads on them oh look Dan has one cool so when you lean against the wall it'll be comfortable but wait there's more the clearance between the legs is perfect for a badminton bag apparently Chris Pi fives are Priceless ah that was not that great but this is pretty great um hey hey what' you do I've changed it to 4K what that was the solution yeah also I found out in the settings there's an
option to enable Hardware acceleration all the time did that and it seems like the playback is a lot better oh that's great that that's passable right okay we take back most of the mean things that we no I still think it's stupid we take back some of the mean things I take back nothing coming back over to the court we've got another big video related update here we have two of the Sony cameras that we're going to be using for our court cams these are going to be for uh live streaming tournaments or just
recording game footage so people can look at it for analysis or just for their own enjoyment mhm I know very little about them what are they they're the Sony srg xp1 they're Poe powered 4K 60 frames a second cameras which send live stream feeds anywhere you want cool yeah can they do higher than 60 frames per second no that's probably enough anyway though right I think so I know you originally wanted 240 but getting a camera that does that with a wideangle lens with the kind of like you know
streaming capabilities IP Control and all that okay but do they look good they do they do well why don't we let the people will be the judge okay we've got it configured two different ways either landscape M or portrait that was Jake's suggestion sir it was J suggestion okay there is a reason for that see when Dan did the modeling for what the view should look like he expected to have the cameras mounted a little further away from the courts but it turns out there's a wall there as much as I hate vertical
video I'd rather use the original camera position so let's see how we feel about  ah oh no oh no oh the floors are not in yet actually I could totally talk to you guys about the concrete that is on the floor right now so it's less of a concrete a more of a leveling compound the point is they sanded down the high points and then they put this leveling compound on the low points in order to make sure that it's super flat oh no  you let's see how it looks if we have the cameras farther away but shoot
horizontal ready Dan I hope so our ceilings are super high so you can basically hit it as high  want okay let's see how the recording went this is real sweat oh speaking of which I don't think the HVAC solution was in last time I showed you guys so normally if you have air conditioning or heating you're going to have like one big duct like somewhere up in the ceiling it's going to be blowing an enormous volume of air and it'll create a current inside the building we didn't want that because
it means that the shuttle will drift when it's falling down which can be distracting and can harm your game performance so instead we're using what are called duct socks essentially they're just fabric ends and they go on all of these ducks all around the facility and just slowly dissipate the air out from the vents it's not on right now if it was it would be all like inflated it looks kind of cool Works kind of like a bouncy castle um I hope it works look at how much of a smear
there is behind the shuttle M yeah that doesn't look good good Lord how much would it cost if we needed something with like a global shutter so I have them completely full auto right now but we can prioritize shutter we can set a dedicated shutter speed we can kind of do whatever we want might be able to fix that up dude this looks like a freaking LCD from 1998 yeah that's not great how much how much were those cameras so these are about 2500 bucks each oh good the problem is that
any other competing one is 2500 bucks "and then you need a probably a $2,000" lens per camera and the uh the streaming doesn't work very well if it uh if it helps uh we haven't paid for these yet they're just loners from Sony oh okay so I "haven't spent the $40,000 what about" those Panasonic ones that I had sent you those were also loners those probably aren't going to work oh the video's better but they don't have the streaming features that you want they're really bad hopefully we can make these work you
know what of course I'm hopeful you should be let's go look at the other side where things are even more interesting especially for a lot of you folks what what what was that okay we were looking at it on that monitor and we were wondering if part of it was just motion blur on the monitor oh dude there's some ghosting but it's not bad it's not that bad it's totally fine yeah all right hey all right maybe the cameras are good okay try again I thought the access control works
Dan well wait it's not even locked anyway it got scared we're going to have access control between the sides because over there is going to be all badminton all the time but on this side as you guys might recall we're hoping to do land gaming events oh um we should not be standing on this has like just been late today we're hoping to do land gaming events and most of our fiber terminations and our California standard 50 amp power outlets are distributed and perhaps more importantly Dan I gave you
a bit of an update on this off camera but these guys don't know yet we had a really promising meeting with the city of su that's right with the general manager and he's super excited about us potentially doing Esports events here bringing them into the city um and hopefully we're going to be able to cut through some red tape and get some land  go all right but I should show you guys uh the fiber connections I guess 25 gig and it's not terminated yet it's only going to be 10 gig it's going to be dual
10 gig to like each row basically oh well that's good that's 20 gig yeah oh my God this is awful Jake it's not synced they're in a s  group I forgot our drinking fountain speaks whale what they have to do something they they they're going to fix  but anyway this is where we were heading and behold the staff Lounge it'll be staff and members only okay so it's the staff and members Lounge yes okay okay these rooms are staff only yes that's right what happened to the server room
well it moved smart guy this looks awesome we've got our Minit HVAC in here completely separate from the rest of the building just in case we have to add some you know Machine Vision or AI servers in here at some point to go along with our steam cash and any other Associated Game servers we've got a "5,000 watt uh UPS this is the fiber" that's going to the court side and will serve potentially hundreds of landg goers assuming that we can get everything sorted out with the city and
then I mean this is going to be what all of our security cameras waps speakers which we're not quite ready to show you guys but based on our early testing are going to be really cool and I'm really excited about them uh Jake is there anything you wanted to shout out in here I know the fiber stuff looks pretty awesome here check out in there that's actually Pro huh a professional did it yeah we should do that more often check it out dang you might just have to get taller thanks man and we've got all the
coolest stuff from ubiquity uh we've got dual udm Pro Maxes we've got a bunch of switching up here core switch is all hooked up now these are going down to downstairs this is all of our Poe switches for the cameras and APS and all that and then we've got a couple of their nvrs which can be stacked together in software now handling all of our cameras which Dan says he has an update on oh and Hammond set this stuff to make the rack strong they're actually even going to adjust the design of these
racks they had never really accounted for somebody using them for all networking only on one side they were meant for servers well the Design's getting beefed up now what is going on with the cameras there's a camera missing so we don't have any security cameras for the entire courts what what what happened to that no no that was on the plan well they're that one yeah but those were supposed to be for in here oh well what about the other side the same thing that side they misunderstood and
only ran one here instead of two so thankfully we have enough cameras to cover this whole place here can we just go do po powered Poe switch and just Mount two cameras yeah sure but now we have lights in the way oh it's not as bad from this they're perfect look at that badminton England calls for the lights to be at about this height so we were like okay let's have the lights at this height and then we didn't realize hey we've got an observation deck because we didn't VR tour the plan with
the lights anyway yeah we can't see very well but that's okay there's going to be uh chairs and tables all along here so you'll kind of be able to see any who it sounds like that's very solvable and we'll just run an ethernet cable nicely cable managed down to there and point it that way I have a better solution oh okay we didn't realize that the new hubs actually have room for two Poe cameras and there's a hub right down there so I can go through the drop ceiling and put one sort of in that
corner and it'll look nice there boxes up there you could just stick them on the box yeah that would work too that was another thing I was considering okay so there's Solutions around it all right I'm glad we put those boxes there yeah they're nice uh they didn't put any boxes along the back though you see that giant nice uh spaghetti thanks infinite caes we got some spaghetti wait a second why am I not on the Wi-Fi um some of the aps are running fast ethernet right now
um some of the cable runs are just not great no no no no no no we just haven't we haven't patched everything we've just got everything plugged in and we haven't reorganized everything yet yeah we've been having an issue where your phones and the Wi-Fi will prefer the 2.5 gig ones to the one gig so this one here is 1 gig the one on the ceiling in the other building is 2 and a half so your phone wants to keep on that one I just  likely there's also a couple that are at fast ethernet and they might be causing
some problem I'm so glad I don't have to deal with this stuff anymore I I think that's it for today guys what about the room downstairs what do you mean the room downstairs oh yeah he's never that happy when it's good news for more money more money we need no split system no J no way no way it's not that hot running no speakers are running there's barely any power draw in the building it's like 28 in here shoot okay In fairness I freaking thought of this and I spec this completely differently I spec this
as two rooms with the divider still down the middle and then with little hobbit doors that had a like an exhaust on the top and an intake on the bottom so I did spec this we can probably fix this without putting a mini split in here it just needs some amount of cooling like honestly knock to a fans on the top of this yeah would would probably be enough in fact Creator Warehouse kind of the same idea where there's a closet under the stairs with the Transformers in we just added one of those duct booster
fans and the problem totally went away okay but it needs something yeah it needs something this is going to be a problem once it's all right all right all right all right what about this though did that work I mean it opened oh uh they haven't put the mag strikes in yet yeah I see that uh why I don't know they didn't have enough they didn't have enough they ran out didn't you tell me that they don't want to run the wires yeah it's not in their contract to actually plug them in so when they put
them in the door I have to take them out again and plug in the two wires and then put them back in the door on the other like seven that have to be done you know what else has to be done the segue to our sponsor ODU imagine this you're running a business but it's held together by a bunch of different software that's where ODU comes in they're Allin one business management software takes the Essential Elements of any business and combines them into one unified operating system system you can
