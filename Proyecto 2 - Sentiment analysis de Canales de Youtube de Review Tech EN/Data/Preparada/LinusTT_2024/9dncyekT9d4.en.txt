when my fellow YouTubers need help they know who to call not them me and based on electroboom setup he should have done it a long time ago you have 6 million subscribers and you make your videos on this laptop it's oozing goo and the power adapter looks like a fire hazard Don't Unplug it the battery is dead oh you shut down the computer now well no more Jes and llen electroboom is getting an upgrade courtesy of origin PC who is sponsoring this video and will be giving away one of their PCS to one of our
lucky viewers as for you dude we've got everything we've got a computer a NZ a TV a camera streaming gear I knew if I believed in Santa his elf would show up how are we going to get this all in the room how about we just don't give you all of it what uh or maybe we could give you all of it but you have to earn it please sir ah what did he say before we get started on the room upstairs we want to take a look at what we're working with and this is your network closet and there's
more you know not bad everything's tucked away the place looks amazing but it's actually got a fair amount of tech in it Nest thermostats got uh wait no I have a Wi-Fi for upstairs and a different one for downstairs uh that's not good oh what's wrong with that we're going to get all that sorted out with some gear from ubiquity you'll just automatically roam between all the different access points and one name for the entire house one name for the entire house everyone will be named medy ah
great and they'll all have eyebrows like this that works but a question that I have is there's so much stuff here are you planning to share any of it with the other medy who live here you know what I mean you have a family right I do but I mean I keep as much as I can for myself we got you a desktop what do you need the framework laptop for oh that one that what I think my daughter can use that one although I also dropped  know I also have a problem with that now you would think that since lonus is an
investor in framework he would know every inner working about the laptop but medy I want you to put him to the test I bought dog shot collars cuz I didn't think you had enough gear already it goes from a zero to a 100 every minute you're adding one medy once he gets the boot you hit the button what I get shocked no matter what I do yes sir I would do anything for my craft ow ow hey you're not allowed to press the button yet yeah just just testing you know we have to do a test run always I
started the timer you better get on what you start the timer yeah it working still can you not it's still working yes you're not allowed to Slow Me Down what is this a notebook well the DIY Edition comes with everything disassembled so you have to put it together yourself that way you could choose if you wanted to bring your own Ram or your own SD if you build it if you build it yourself the first time can you not stop throwing stuff around okay then you will be amply prepared for any repairs or upgrades
that you might want to do in the future how's two you're supposed to wait till the end wait till the end no wait till the end here you unbox this make yourself useful okay ID the Idle Hands Devil's play thing and all that gone with 16 gigs of ddr4 from crucial ESD protected or something am I not going to break it uh I wouldn't guarantee that yeah should I test to see if it is prot no no no oh personally I like to have the mouse on the right and so I don't like to have my usba on the ow ow damn that really
hurts stop dropping my stuff okay ow okay I'm turning it on I'm turning it uhoh power adapter give me the power adapter I had nothing to do with that yay go ahead hit him just just eight that's all all it took  ow well that's really intense oh let let me see how it feels on the neck what the hell that was I told you no one should buy this thing I'm fine with you know consenting adults playing around with this but putting this on a dog not cool your neck is red yeah because he hit it like four times
yeah what this is the red too so it's okay that was very fun and I'm not upset at all incidentally Elijah I've got a few tasks for you they're not going to be a lot of fun okay can you figure out the monitor mounts yep you can put together the chair yep and uh can you figure out the TV wall mount I don't want to mount to TV that'd be great thanks yes sir and take care I always try meanwhile a wild Jake appears hi I see we are fixing up the networking we got a Poe switch that's that's not a Poe
switch oh no this is that 10 this is the 10 gig one does he need a 10 gig switch for for the nas so that'll live in his office oh and then the network closets are going to get a Poe switch and some access points yeah I'm trying to figure out what makes the most sense he has a lot of cables in there right now and I have like the exact amount I need probably these things are sick have you seen these before no what is this this is a U6 inwall Enterprise it's a 2.5 gig Wi-Fi 6E access point but it also has a
switch on the bottom that's so cool and the switch also has Poe passw we don't need that but these are like the best thing ever for behind a TV not that we would normally recommend putting an access point behind a large metal object necessarily but if it's kind of nearby or if it's only serving a very small area it's a super clean way to ins I have them behind my TVs and they're totally fine meanwhile medy have you ever built a computer before nope broken computers before you are going to build a computer
usually you start with the motherboard uh is that the motherboard absolutely this is going to be for your Nas origin sponsored this video so they sent over a sick gaming editing PC you don't have to worry about any of that you're doing great so far do you need some guy smells new valve just issued a warning about this and I was like who would who needs this warning about what smelling the board yes I always smell my board smelling the exhaust of their devices that's how you know if your
board is broken or not right out of the gate this is a little bit of a hard mode build because this very unusual motherboard from ASRock rack has an am4 socket for the CPU so that's for AMD but it comes with a back plate and a cooler mounting pattern that would be for Intel so in order to get a cooler on this thing Jake had to pry this back plate off which was glued thank you very much ASRock rack and he knocked off this resistor what I want a refund sure thank you traditionally the first thing we
install is a CPU what is this oh that's a fan that's the cooler but remember this doesn't fit on here because Intel mounting okay I need to supervise what's going on here these pins don't touch it where's the gold there's a gold oh there this is yes and that goes with the triangle but you got to lift up the arm first oh lift up the arm first yeah yeah okay arm goes down computer belt this is a really special SSD that uses what what's called optane which is a really high endurance kind of storage
it's kind of in between storage and Ram uh and make you go faster that's good you are not putting in a screw with your hand no you have what is in my humble opinion the world's finest ratcheting magnetic screwdriver there you go this is a really cool case from John's B it's the N3 it's super small I think it looks flipping awesome and and it can fit up to eight hard drives in the default configurations you're doing awesome well I'm an electrical engineer I can do anything oh crap we
haven't actually put the cooler on yet wait you guys are using our cable management stuff right yep that's the goal okay good cuz we have new cable management products that are have been awesome this guy right here onto this header right there okay okay first thermal compound though okay hold on whoa whoaa okay that's Lots can't believe you've never built a computer before this is so fun well I'm having fun still not in how tight do I make it I just keep going just keep going breaks wait hold
on it looks like this hold down is bent I just eyeballed it you did great don't worry about it it's all okay well this is bent but that was probably from you I'm sorry I mean I don't think it was there before I mean it's your computer you can do whatever you want hit it fix it that's okay there you go like new normally you would just do this up the the whole way but because of the weird janky mounting mechanism on this motherboard we're not going to do that and if we overtighten this we're going
to flex the bottom of the socket down potentially deforming or breaking those traces I have personally killed motherboards like this that have sort of weird mounting mechanisms not realizing that it was being overtightened because that's not typically how it works this is a pretty cool board it'll take up to two 110 mm M do2s so you can get some higher capacity or high performance perance ones that are a little longer than the standard 80 mil and while it doesn't have an onboard pcie switch that
allows you to just use it in any slot you want this one requires a motherboard that supports bif foration they do have one like that as well so appreciate you  over now that that's done it seems like this is a perfect opportunity to show you the system that origin PC sent over it's really light check it out oh my God what okay what did they put in there yeah no it's fine here here we'll just we'll just rest it here on this side we're looking at uh 14900 K so that's a 24
core processor we've got 32 gigs of ddr5 memory an RTX 490 so this is as powerful as it gets whether you're video editing or do you play games at all not really I I play tatri like I said before Corsair kitted this thing out with a whole bunch of their ey Q Link RGB no no this is just the beginning just just just just just just wait for it wait for it things are going to get it has its own display yeah things are going to get crazy in here what happens if I open this tab here H
don't please I can drink no it will drain the system all this stuff links up together with dramatically simplified cabling compared to previous RGB Solutions and that was a big thing that Corin origin PC wanted us to talk about because it is simpler than ever to wire up a system like this in the past you would have had to be an electrical engineer to set up some of the RGB setups that I've seen in the past but this is relatively straightforward like the fans for example just clip in
together and then you just plug in the one end and all the RGB signaling and power just runs through that click-in connector can you play Tetris on that thing someone's probably done it but I don't think it's supported by default as weird as it is to put a unibrow on the CPU Cooler origin PC is giving you a chance to do the exact same thing that's right you can win in the PC we gave Electro boom including that core I 914 900k and an RTX 490 all you need to do is follow the link on your screen or
head to the first link in the description for your chance to win then you'll be able to put whatever you want on the CPU Cooler screen thanks again origin PC now back to the video I think we need to answer a lot of questions about where things go before we go any further I had a plan before you came but now there's no room for anything can be mounted on a ceiling or something what are you even building what is that looks like a decapitated drill which one that that's a time bomb I made it for one of
my videos I guess it's an improvement from your projects where it just blows up without a timer yeah at least you can anticipate on the volage maybe we need to move them some things out before we bring anything in about that's a good idea I guess hey lonus if you think it's too much stuff do you want to challenge into a game so he doesn't have to keep it all two colors you guys will choose randomly which one you're going to have mhm I'm going to hit the button that's the game that's not a game yes it
is yeah we are going to put it on the lower settings so are you sure yeah okay wait no shoot ah crap no I I just lost the game all righty we're starting with 10 what 10 no no no thank God all right one one round give me the callers back oh we which one do you guys want you guys can argue I'm letting him pick this time doesn't matter here you go all right hold on right it's on okay but we but we each hold each other's oh do we sure yeah that way you won't hold back are you sure you want to do 10 yeah
we'll do 10 3 2 a dang it it's me again ow thank God it wasn't me do you want to do you want to do three of five I mean I'm losing so I guess so I can still win this and then I don't have to give them all the stuff and then you don't have to set up all the stuff I'm just trying to say that maybe there's an incentive for  three ow my NE muscles I can still win this which one do you guys want oh you're just going to take the one in that hand I mean do you guys want to switch statistically it's like better to
switch or something right that's only if that's the three-o paragra yes right that's what they want you to believe okay all right okay oh my God please don't go a dang it I lose I give up I yielded I yield take as much stuff as you want this thing is so cool but it has no way to mount it I mean maybe I maybe it does I didn't read the manual but um yeah oh LT Cable Management thinks and then we'll just put these little plates in the thing and when you want to take this off if you have something bigger that
it'll fit on this ended up being a little on the short side so this is more for power bricks this is the one you want to use so the cable tie goes on here there's a little lip right there grabs the end then uh I don't know you can mount anything you want realistically so let's say scale uh banana you just wrap it around and then Bippity bity magnetic banana how's it going Colin you're enjoying your assembly time did you want to put some shelves there maybe or maybe you can put shelves
under this and then stuff go in front of it is this always your decision-making process this is uh wow this takes a long time yeah it does it do we have the first of your monitors though Zenon these are OLED 27 in and they do 240 frames a second for the gaming you said you don't do but it's totally fine these are actually amazing monitors and we have two of them for you so we're get these going here is your shelf we're going to do one here then about halfway to the top we're going to do one more
and then we're going to do another one there oh that's great and you're going to have so much more storage I have my beautiful tiny St binder oh this is one of those magnetic ones yes hey we found a St actually found a yeah that's perfect I would to put this here o is it not too close to the door it's a little on the tight side and one of them's going to be all drywall  think hey brilliant okay where level go we're going to level up our installation game wait he got the cool job I feel 
sucker wow that really uh that really goes that really sucks yeah and then it's see you got the little threaded hole back there and you screw into that they'll hold like 200 lb or something stupid like that screws um yeah they uh they're big boys doesn't go through that hole oh no the Ikea hole we can expand those holes oh you're just going to hold  vacuum all righto because the theme of the day is not finishing anything before we move on to the next thing now seems like a good time to talk about this 
instrument where do you want the TV mounted in here break it yeah that's probably a good idea there used to be a crap TV mounted on the wall here oh wow and a crap mount for it I already have the yeah you know for someone who was lecturing me about stud spacing and you know handyman stuff I um oh one of them is in the do the other one well the spacing wasn't good enough mhm are you sure you don't want it at the right height uh what's the right height you know how nobody likes to sit in the
front row of the theater yes okay so the right height is so that you don't do that I noticed your other TV is above a fireplace and my mind exploded what did you do to my room for God's sake why' you put the garbage up there I me good at least the shelves are holding up yeah and and none of the togglers fell into the wall that's a that's a real plus okay one Toggler fell into the wall did it one second I don't look at what you're doing and my God you'll still need a display port cable just
because this is just an Uplink for the hub for data so this handles all of your actual display data yeah no not awesome look how strong they are we somehow convince Med's lovely wife to have an access point in our office so at the very least what's your favorite color green green okay let's try this that looks not like green this go with orange orange okay okay cool yeah with the frame TV the Samsung uses this one connect cable and basically you just put this one cable into the back of
the TV it runs to this box here and with this box here this is where you can put all your inputs of HDMI ethernet uh that's where the one connect cable connects power pretty much everything comes through this this box here just don't trip Colin I don't want to don't  Hazard totally ate it you think we're  yeah I made a big boo boo so we're going to try again we're going to use the frames Mount I didn't think it came with one but it does and I messed up so what the hell dude you know you told
me that this was no problem all of your power bars plugged into Power Bars but you know what I see what do you see I see a big problem because I'm looking at this side well that problem is me not the series power connection that that you probably have seen in one of my videos wait these two were already plugged into another power strip to be clear Med is an electrical engineer he knows what he's doing he knows how to add up the total current of all the downstream devices on all of his
different octopuses that are connected to things and make sure that they don't exceed the maximum amperage that you know each one of these sockets can support except that even though he does know what he's doing he seems to make a lot of mistakes what that's what I do what the hell what is this I I I I needed the ground connection I use that for when I walk on my treadmill because I noticed I pick up charge when I walk on the threadmill and I have my headphones in which is connected to the
laptop which is connected to the ground so when I'm charged it zaps me right in the ear so I had to ground myself these are better for running cables along the direction of the magnet am I the first person to receive this actually awesome things you are the first person outside of Lis Media Group to try these okay I went to spin this drill and like it just popped through the drywall and now it's like well it might be me but why do all TV companies suck at make making mounts
hey working okay that's a TV hey good job igmp proxy let's go basically your TV is IP TV or like TV over IP like the internet in a normal internet connection it's unicast unicast is kind of like a sniper where you're sending the packet directly to the Target you know where it's going well that would be very inefficient if you had a thousand targets right so instead they use multicast which is kind of like a shotgun it shoots all over the place it doesn't even know where it's going
really your ISP provided router does know to look for that and so so does the UniFi ones if you turn on igp proxy which is what we did and it works which is awesome because now we don't have to have any of the ISP crap we can just have our full ubiquity Network up here we're using a ubiquity switch light 16 which is way more ports than he needes as you can see there is four plugged in I left a couple extra cables over here if he needs them but it's a lot cleaner than it was before so you'll notice the
TV is still on the floor did you really put extra holes in someone's wall again I put like five extra holes in someone's wall realistically if you ever watched our Channel you would have known better than to let him put hes in the wall I would have known better guys your fault yeah hey it's not our fault bye guys for the wi let's go in all seriousness though we tried to use that flesh Mount that medy had mhm it wasn't compatible with this TV after I had mounted the wall plate so then we tried the included
frame Mount which is these two brackets here yeah they look great they look great the problem is is the drywall anchors they give you they just free Spin oh yeah okay as long as the TV the TV is only pulling down right the gravity is going this way if it was going sideway I would be worried we also chose the mount that makes it as close to the wall as possible so ideally you won't have any of that tipping Force yeah so yeah okay so yeah all we have to do is we have to line these bolts yeah
up with the circles there oh I think I got it oh see now you can go sideways oh yeah you can adjust it that way well actually let's test it oh my gosh it's fine don't worry about about it see I told you you get some of this clutter out of here a little bit and like it's not so bad dang that's clean it really makes the space feel bigger this is awesome sweet cool well we actually have to plug it in and then we'll run it to that Port we showed earlier if I can turn back down
who is that Shar oh okay you don't know Shar oh my God I didn't know who the Beetles were until 6 months ago oh my God how old are you 12 46 wow you're a boomer that's what my channel is I an electro Boomer what do they do I don't  who sounds like Nintendo music it's like I just booted up my Wii for the first time in 2007 it really does actually kind of look like art like it doesn't really lose the brightness on certain angles like it's pretty good what if I turn off the light oh yeah
so we're not going to use a mic on an arm you'll just put on your lab like you normally do right compared to my old transmitter from Road perfect oh wow uh everything fits in this form fact yeah they've gotten a little smaller yeah wait we also got him a camera where's the camera at what is oh my e R8 oh my god oh that's a fulls size sensor isn't it don't spit on it I wouldn't spit on it that camera actually also upgrades you to 4K let's go maybe now with the new computer I can edit in
4k too oh oh yeah 100% it this this thing is going to chew through 4K no problem what's really cool about the wireless Pro is that it has the pass through to your camera so you can monitor your audio and you can just edit directly with that but this pack acts as both a transmitter and a local recorder so something goes terribly wrong at least you have the backup audio if you if you're recording here yeah very first zap in 4k hey oh my God he Zapped me did you see that I almost dropped the camera man
what do you mean almost dropped it you dropped it well my reflexes are very fast so I cut it in mid there and then somehow we ended up bringing you a Galaxy s23 phone how does that um how how did we get scammed into this exactly have you seen this pH I don't know you ask and you shall receive although my old phone still works pretty well it's like a what is it S9 note 9 baby let's go n gen cheers I was told apparently you use your phone for videos though like occasionally just I do but this one does
1080 all right so I see you okay just take it actually what I want to talk about first is this chair I was there I saw it had strong wife approval Factor she said she actually liked it uh is this going to fit here this is this is well as long as the door closes oh yeah if you push hard enough yeah the handles turn I just turned your monitors to 240 HZ so just go ahead grab your mouse and just grab this window and drag it around have you ever tried this before Oh my God this is moving so fast it's like my
God yeah even if you don't game I actually find a high refresh rate display just makes everything feel like I may just use the computer more responsive move Windows around with it oh hey and the thermal camera Works look at that super cool there's two cameras right there's the camera that gets the visible light image and then there's the camera that gets the infrared image and then it just kind of superimposes them but those cameras aren't exactly in the same place so you can see as I move
around like my eyes kind of you wobble yeah they kind of wobble around cuz the cameras have different frame rates right the thermal camera refreshes at a much lower rate but the game that looks good right yeah like the speed is super smooth origin PC wicked fast great cooling you barely hear this thing oh my God that's quick and this is off of the nas off of the do you know how easy it  me this is so good thank you uh yeah I guess now's a good time to thank origin PC for making this possible they've got
a giveaway you guys can check that out down below um another opportunity for us to talk about IQ link all the cool RGB software so you can download that and you can set it up to have all kinds of different colors or maybe your kids can play with it this is about as topof the line As It Gets Elijah is a sweet precious boy and we must protect him therefore we didn't set up your saw we also really weren't sure where this was going to go oh this bad boy goes on the table here yeah and then and
then wait what on this table yeah see I I made some planters there if I had this it would make life easier and maybe the craftsmanship would be a little more exciting you know I was just doing it by hand so it's all sideways you know what it's really good this looks flipping awesome do you guys remember the before in here yeah it looks awesome we got switch light eight switch Enterprise eight this is one of the inall six Enterprises Cloud key and then the little Gateway light
he's like the ubiquity fairy he just flits into your house and ubiquities everything and then he leaves and there's 10 gig and fast Wi-Fi everywhere I was getting 300 so it's pretty good 500 what what did you do that's hilarious he thought he had like 300 down 100 up because his Wi-Fi sucked if you guys enjoyed this video maybe check out the last time we collabed to debunk Wireless grounding straps yeah yeah that was that that was yeah pretty stupid straps or the first time we
collabed to determine whether static electricity actually kills computer components yeah that was an enjoyable video and he's got a follow-up video on his channel as well so there's lots of lineus tech tips plus electroboom to go check out if you guys enjoyed this one really subscribe to this guy
