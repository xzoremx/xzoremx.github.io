we got the 96 core rad Ripper Pro now we could do a straight face review of this thing tell you all about the Herz and the degrees and the molts but realistically are you a Saudi oil prince no are you a procurement manager then for $100 million design firm Oh no you're not that either well then realistically you and I were never buying this thing so why don't we just have some fun with it did you know that we are going to make this thing fast enough to set multiple world records
including cine bench yes we reviewed the script together like always nice also with 96 course and a new vrm layout this thing is insanely fast even before you "hook up a 5,000 watt Chiller to it" "apparently can draw over 1,000 Watts on" "its own really 1,000 Watts just to the" CPU like through the pins yes that's wild but but not as wild as this segue to our sponsor build Redux they're so into building custom gaming PCs for any budget they made an online pc Builder that shows you how your favorite games
perform so they can start building your perfect rig sooner they just want to build for you dude head to build ruxcon and create your new rig today ours then was sent over by Falcon Northwest who told us don't look that closely at this thing it was a total rush job the RGB doesn't light up and this UV printing isn't up to our usual standard but honestly we think they're kind of crazy because this thing looks amazing the chassis was fully designed inhouse by their president kelt and the specs are
mindblowing we've got 64 gigs of ddr5 6000 ECC we have two PCI E gen5 ssds running in raid zero alongside a casual 30 terb SSD from Micron that Falcon Northwest said well you know for anyone who's doing content creation they're going to need lots of storage so we threw that in there just to make sure it runs an Asus TRX 50 Sage Wi-Fi with an insane 43 power phases on it really 800 amp limit no that's the old limit this one that's the old limit shut up 800 amps was the limit of the old one through one
plane that's still the limit mhm but there's power planes on each side of the socket that go to each side of the Chip And you can do them individually so now we have six 1 1600 amps total that we can draw I guess where's all that going to come from you ask they swapped out "the usual, 1600 W power supply for a" 250 wat Silverstone hel hella cool it's worth noting in North America that power supply is still a 1600 W power supply so you need 240 volts in order to get the whole 2050
which we have we have a power supply tester and we're going to need it enough chitchat though we promised fun what do you want to do first I want to play City skylines 2o of course you do all of you guys know that this game is very difficult to run demanding we have a million population city this was sent to me by bffa plays Indie Games if we were using the same machine as bffa 5800 x3d 4090 and 128 gigs of ddr4 memory our system would simply crash as soon as the level loaded who buddy
holy crap I mean it's not running great well do you want to look at the uh processes holy crap they were not kidding when they said this game would use the CPU cares you gave it I have never seen an actual real game use this kind of CPU power not even close although it's not all of them yeah yeah what's up with that what's up with these ones I think it can do 64 cores wow which is still really impressive I mean unless you don't happen to have a 64 core CPU and you want to build a
million population city then it's a bit of a problem this is totally running now though oh yeah like it's not great but you could play it wait we drew up to "1,000 Watts already Yes I mean yeah" we've got a 4090 in there but it's running at 35% capacity we haven't even overclocked anything yet nope wow so lots of them are at lower clocks but a lot of them are right up at 4.7 like all of these are hitting 4.7 surprised it's not 4.8 that's the uh limit when you're using more than eight cores at a time
for this chip okay what's next uh next is we download a game cuz that in itself is fun whoa whoa whoa whoa okay that's just reserving space okay I thought thought things were really crazy for a second there oh look at that CPU usage go 48% holy sh yeah it goes I've never seen anything even close to this no the CPU decode always just starts killing you over about like what 1 gab guys this is Forza Horizon 5 2 minutes remaining did you have to connect to the Seattle server to get the
best speeds or like no I just did it you know what's well we're peered through venx and I believe valve is also appeared through vanx so theoretically we were always just CPU limited it's probably also those 4 TB raid zero drives to be clear you don't need that kind of throughput but the iops the random iops cuz it's it's unpacking this in the background that's why it uses so much CPU we are writing to our disc at 1.4 gabes per second that is closer to 12 gbit damn right cuz it is on unpacking
in the background knock to a screwdriver now I know you guys saw this already except you probably didn't because if you blinked you would have missed it in the intro we're going to do a quick run of cinebench R23 and by quick I'd mean that by the time I finish stalling for  done "115,000 points this thing is" definitely a little bit overclocked from the factory oh interesting so Falcon tune in it well probably Asus is uh yes okay good old multi-core enhancement yeah let's take
it to another level uh okay so wait uh should I just be like dumping fluid into it while you talk through the CH the alterations we've made to this no we have to do the alterations oh we're going to make some alterations cuz we thought you guys might get bored of "seeing the same old 5,000 watt Chiller" with the same old 5° Celsius limit um how Factory approved are these alterations to hit lower temperatures so I talked to thermoscientific cool hi thermoscientific yeah they were not
super happy about uh what we wanted to do if our fluid freezes in the plate heat exchanger that they have in there uhhuh it will expand and completely write off our entire unit I see but they told us how to do it anyway no oh we are just spoofing it we're spoofing it what is what do you mean by spoofing it what does that even mean you're just that is so janky right here is the thermocouple that they use to figure out how cold the water is and when the water hits 5° C they turn it off but if this
right here just goes I don't know right there they don't know how cold the water is speaking of which it can't be water because if it was then we would almost certainly blow up the plate heat exchanger that's where this stuff comes in windshield deicer we could use antifreeze but from my experience working with chilled systems in the past it tends to get a little bit viscous once you hit -2 - 255 this stuff by contrast stays waterlike in its viscosity down to almost its entire
rated temperature temperature range which is down to - 49° c now what then I basically just pull this block we put on a new block we call it a day yeah but it's a tiny bit more complicated than that for the new thread rippers they want 135 lb of force from the heat sink oh that's basically like a small adult male standing on it yes although it turns out it's actually not quite that much these older ones should have about 96 lb of force which is enough so we did go ahead when we thought we needed the
135 made our own man for this sp5 block uh-huh but now I kind of just want to use the old one cuz I don't think it it should be fine I mean the worst thing that could happen is the system won't post or one of our memory modules won't show up or and then we'll try again yeah and with this guy the worst thing that happens is we it oh my good one thing we also can do right now is upgrade the RAM if we so feel like it what is that these are the 6400 Mega transfer per se G skills oh
wow they only put stickers on them really G skill I mean I'd rather have highp speed Ram with a sticker than slower Ram with a big metal cooler on it so sure yeah let's do it yeah all right there it is goodness gracious that's a big heat spreader goes all the way to the flipping Edge now something you guys are probably wondering about if you've watched us use the chiller before is guys where's the precautions where's the Subzero treatment for the motherboard it's going to die and you'd
be right under normal circumstances as soon as you go below the ambient temperature in the room by too much condensation starts to form on your tubes and on your blocks and on the back of your motherboard which can cause a short which can cause death but because we didn't really want to put this motherboard through the shmoo treatment we came up with a new idea what if instead of insulating our system against the cold we embraced the cold as long as the environment around it matches that
temperature it shouldn't be a problem so we're going to put the whole thing in the environmental chamber set to what- 20 sure orus 10 or 15 I don't know I just picked that as long as we don't go too low cuz we did do that video a little while ago where we found out that certain components don't behave well below about -30 -40 yeah it's a bad time I just want to clean this so we don't get any shoo on anything when it's hanging out here yes do we want to take the whole thing
out no I was just going to kind of leave it hang oh wait you were waiting for me to figure it out right the fluid in the lines it's going to freeze it might it's going to blow up our radiator oh crap all right yeah it's going to have to come out uh one moment please okay time to get Frosty not Frosty cuz Frost is from the moisture in the air we don't want that is that minus 20 already yep heck yeah boy oh God oh God uh okay hi hello are we using Worm Drive clamps yep now under normal circumstances we
would have concern concerns about condensation build up on these tubes but in this case it doesn't really matter because oh wait we do have a solution for who we have a solution for that oh I didn't really care I was just going to let it drip onto the floor oh no no no one sec I me okay there's those but what is that it's insulation that's not insulation oh inside of it is insul insation I mean sure fun fact when we're done with this this system is going to have to sit for
probably about 3 or 4 4 days to let all the sweat all the water that's just going to condensate on it evaporate and allow it to function  woo that's a good noise no no it's good it's good it's cycling it's going oh temp probe thing yes man we have gotten so much mileage out of this thing yeah I have owned that since pre- lmg times oh nice all right 15 and dropping fast it worked wow damn all right 128 gigs ddr5 64 freaking 100 what else are we doing in here other than appreciating this delightful throwback
bios screen I think we use AI the power of AI what uh you want to go back to that the warning one the warning oh this oh sorry I it's like ads I don't see warning a lot of people probably don't but these CPUs actually have a little fuse in them that will tell AMD if you have overclocked your chip now they promise that they will not deny you warranty if you have overclocked your chip unless  overclocking but then why do it that sounds like a trust me bro guarantee if I've ever heard one manual CPU
overclocking okay what do we what do we want no we we don't want any of this garbage manual stuff go to AI recalibrate cooler yes more inclined to update what is this what am I what is even happening right now optimism scale what the hell is an optimism scale if it's going to stay as cool as it currently is I see okay so keep training more inclined to update optimism scale 100 okay were you happy sure what what does this do this just gives it more power and more hurts I don't know but
Gary said it's really good that's hilarious AI tweaker after all these years finally has some AI in it it was a 100% a branding thing I think it was back LGA 1366 was when they first launched that branding what do we think level four sure this is where you can see that you can actually change each of the CPU rails independently wow so if one of your like sides of your CPU is a little bit faster you can give that one more voltage and and give the other slower side less so that it doesn't eat into your like
cooler budget jeez this is great hey not having to insulate and she's pristine in there actually all that Frost that formed before looks like it's sublimated away cuz I guess the humidity in here is so low this is awesome nooo and our CPU is at 9.6 de all right in a bench then we ready yep so the is doing nothing but telling the AI to be optimistic slower huh why is it slower good AI what if we try again be more optimistic okay so it's the same H all right back to the BIOS I see that after all of our around
with PBO and curve offsets and all of that we've gone old school yep we have very simple allc core ratio set manual voltage on all of them that is scary 5.1 GHz all course there's no way that's going to work oh wait and see are you expecting this to actually "work yeah I said 1,000 Watts not 2,000" wats oh we're we're going to get close "to 1,000 or" "2,000 we should have right now the" fastest non- overclocked thread Ripper going mean non- overclocked or the fastest not ln2 thread Ripper the
fastest one of these has ever gone is "168,000 in cin bench wow we weren't even" close without ln2 for now I changed the priority to high 168 696 wait are we not there I just want to see 169 168 6 that is an exact match holy crap exactly to the point well let's run it again "yes we did it 169 nice nice 1,400 wats" through the socket those poor vrms I don't think anyone's going to try and replicate this but before you do there are a couple of other things we change so you played around with the Curve
Optimizer curve Optimizer which is what I don't know I mean that's fair but it's part of amd's black magic that's part of PBO and essentially is kind of like undervolting underload but not V dro yeah something like that okay perfect thank you that's very helpful uh also turned up load line calibration to five and then there was one other thing that you did uh slew rate uh funp that up all right we gave it the Old Slew rate yeah sweep the leg boom go faster otherwise we'll get you yeah so we're here now yes
5.2 what let's go to 52 but we'll have to change the uh B4 up or down up oh good I mean we peaked it 30° last time yeah we have way more yeah we'll get way more until we blow it up what no why do why is everyone but me "wanting to kill this $10,000 chip no the" chip will probably be fine I think it would be the motherboard that would poop itself but that's fine we have acers contact do they even still like you no but they like me yeah they they like  go still can't believe how fast that is
should we set the 2003 world record cenge 2003 yep sure now this isn't going to hit all of the cores but the 96 core world record in this is 457 okay I think we can beat it yep we did easy I I don't even know where to find the score in this application right there they're 8600 all right see you later World Record yep hell yeah nice knowing you I wonder if we could game at this though can we fire up City skylines too again I I have a strong suspicion that we're not going to make it into the game do the
mouse still move oh yeah okay we're not locked up yet here we go here we go here we go here we go oh she's still working Alex it's still a system there we go oh and there it goes it hit 1100 Watts for a second in there our GPU is only running at about 34% utilization like the GPU is not the thing struggling here I think the game engine is what's struggling this does seem smoother than before he said right as it completely crapped itself oh my  cable my hands my PO hands but no danger
to it as long as it's in there isn't that awesome frad Ripper Pro then practical for the average consumer absolutely not it's going to be a lot of years looking at how City skylines 2 can't even use all these cores before we see any kind of consumer workload that can take advantage of this kind of muscle but is it cool yeah whether you're a business that can take advantage of all that grunt or you're just the kind of person who likes seeing things go really fast you know what
would happen if we took amd's epic server processors and just completely let them off the leash it's freaking mindblowing like this mind-blowing segue to our sponsor Squarespace need a website but don't have the knowhow Squarespace is allinone platform makes it easy to get your website up and running quickly so you don't have to longingly scroll through other people's cool websites and wonder what might have been grow your business online through their marketing features including SEO
