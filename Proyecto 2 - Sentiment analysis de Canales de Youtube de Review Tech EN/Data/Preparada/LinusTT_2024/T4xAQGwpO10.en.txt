it took us over 3 years to build a $500 PC that could beat the PlayStation 5 and even then there were some compromises and now we're conspiring to murder the PS5 Pro in less than a week it shouldn't be that hard I mean that $200 price bump that everyone is angry about frees up a lot of money for our budget except for one small problem David while $200 is certainly a lot of money it doesn't buy that much these days and while we could have taken the easy path and just thrown
a better GPU into our original killer this is LTT we don't play on easy mode when we're done we're going to have upgraded Graphics more features a case that doesn't look straight out of the Fallout universe and the same or better performance than the PS5 Pro but be warned this ain't going to be a smooth ride unlike this smooth segue to our sponsor shut up oh that's my boss yeah okay Ridge if you're dreading the giftgiving season let Ridge help you out with finding that perfect present now
for even less that's right their holiday sale is live and you can save up to 47%  description I'm not going to lie it was pretty cool when I heard the PS5 killer mentioned by By the Mark cery lead system architect on the PS4 and PS5 even if he was being kind of salty about it I mean to be clear I think he recognized that our Declaration of victory was obviously tongue and cheek and that we do fully appreciate the gaming value that's on display from the PS5 Hardware but he clearly still felt the need to
call us out on shortcuts that we used like the fact that we used a secondhand motherboard in our system while comparing it to a brand new disc based PS5 but here's what you got wrong Mary my guy it was all used parts not just to use motherboard so wait no that's worse um and Mr CER wasn't the only one to take issue with that comparison many commenters accused us of giving an unfair advantage to team PC but as you would expect from any coverage of this topic the angry comments came from the
other side too with many of you accusing us a favoring team console lonus you said you didn't Place enough value on the extra flexibility of the PC on the free online play or the cheaper larger game library but guys look not every video can be about every topic and today our goal is straightforward we are going to beat the PS5 Pro in visual Fidelity and frame rate at the same price we are still going to allow secondhand parts because yes Mark we do need shortcuts to beat your wonderful machine but but we
are going to uncut as many other Corners as possible which means getting the absolute most out of every penny we spend starting with our CPU the Intel Core i5 12400 F and I can already hear you saying lonus Intel for gaming and yeah to be clear the AMD 5600 x would have been our ideal pick and if they were priced identically we would have gone team red just like Sony did for the PS5 Pro but when we can save about $30 and still get a better CPU than what's in any version of Sony's white monolith
it's kind of a no-brainer once again we aren't going with the exact specs of the machine we're competing against we've actually got two fewer processing cores but our cores are more powerful than Sony's meaning that in gaming we should come out ahead and the included cooler that's a nice little bonus for additional savings the leap over to team blue comes with other benefits as well now that the LGA 1700 platform has been out for a few years there are some cheap motherboards
out there like this ASRock b6m hdv that we found for under $40 now you don't need to go for this one in particular in fact if it wasn't for the outstanding deal we got we would have preferred something with a couple of Gen 4 nvme slots and built-in Wi-Fi but going used means you need to be flexible and snag whatever works and is cheap but hey at least being b660 it does support higher speed XMP memory kits like this one this our 16 gig kit of gskill rip jaw 5 now it's worth
noting that because of our CPU choice we could have gone with ddr5 and a ddr5 motherboard but this kit was just 20 bucks and every penny counts especially now that we need to match the PS5 PR's 2 terabytes of storage and we did or at least we were supposed to this is 1 tab it was marked in inventory as 2 tab we're still counting the price of a 2 terab 1 against our total I see okay now you probably noticed this is a pretty decent looking SSD last time around we didn't
have a high-end SSD and we Justified our choice by pointing out that it doesn't really have an impact on real world gaming performance but this time we're challenging ourselves to do better and we found something that meets Sony's minimum recommended requirements for a secondary drive and we went with the WD black SN 850x which we found for a little under $75 and which happens to be Tom's Hardware's pick for best PS5 SSD though it should be noted that there are other options out there at very reasonable
prices you smell that that's the smell of a right angle get it cuz we didn't cut the corner anymore uh anyway for our case we chose this perfectly decent midsize NZXT h510 that we found for $30 on Facebook Marketplace okay eagle eyes it's not the exact same one but come on what's the point of us buying that black one that someone else could use when we have this white one sitting in our warehouse and besides the point is not the exact case there are a ton of options out there around this price
point including some much more fun ones if you don't mind rolling the dice we also found some older model cases that have support for an optical drive if that's your thing but we won't need one this time around because uh the PS5 Pro doesn't have one either thanks for the free right angle comrades of K karagi when it comes to raw power there are any number of power supplies that could do the job but we didn't want a shoddy heartbeat for our Sony Slayer here so after looking through a number
of reputable units at the right price we settled on this Corsair cx750 for $35 750 watts yeah that sounds kind of Overkill considering that the PS5 Pro draws less than half of that but we're going to need it to power a GPU that can beat the pro which I guess brings us perfectly to the star of any good gaming PC and also the star of the PS5 Pro if you consider that the GPU changes are the only ones that really impact performance Sony made a big deal out of the big three larger GPU with 45% better
raw performance more advanced rracing hardware and a new AI driven upscaling that they call pssr ever since the announcement I've been very eager to get my hands on this bad boy to see what kind of pie C card that's going to translate to in the real world we can make some guesses the closest comparison could be a downclocked 7800 XT but the not yet seen Ray tracing hardware and custom better than FSR but not quite dlss upscaling makes us wonder if we're going to need to wait for amd's 8000
series for a true equivalent one way to avoid giving up features would be to go for an Nvidia RTX 470 because as digital Foundry pointed out its feature set more closely matches the new console but when it came to decision time we felt that this XFX quick 7800 XT with its higher raw performance would make up for the lack of shiny features and help us secure another win for team PC what are we looking at for our total $655 wait really that leaves enough for a sketchy Windows key that 8bit do
controller we checked out recently and even some stick locks from LTT store.com to cover those precious analog nubb during transport but uh I couldn't help noticing there's still no Wi-fi 7 H okay well that's a bit of a corner isn't it but but hold on if we built this machine using the absolute lowest prices we found scrapyard War style maybe we could get it at a lower price $535 not bad that's a potential $165 of budget to play with for a Wi-Fi card and I don't know other stuff but
would you use the money for lers that's a tough question cuz you're not going to go up another class of GPU and you could upgrade your CPU but that's probably not going to affect gaming performance that much I think the best use of it that's a pretty well-rounded system probably just go for some games speaking of let's do a side by side how close are we here I definitely am seeing some weird moare in my rug me as well oh you are too yeah right now I've set our PC to the PS5
raid Trace performance mode which is the ideal way to play on PS5 base but we probably want to mess with the settings a little bit to get a little more visual Fidelity and see what we can squeeze out um question for you where's oh yeah no we're still getting some Popin from the confetti it looks about the same on both of them honestly when we did the short circuit on the PS5 Pro I didn't find that the PS5 and the pro looked that different in this game and I'm having a hard time picking anything oh the grass
your grass is noticeably higher Fidelity than mine yeah okay if I want to catch up I'm going have to change that nothing here looks like it's going to help with that all I can really do is I think it's just resolution and FSR so FSR will be in display oh w w w w wo wo interesting does it look closer to yours right now yeah it cuz we looked I SW I swear when we were looking at before it was hold on okay I'm going back oh now it's poo poo again that's so interesting it's so blurry what do I have to change
to make it operate like it does in the menu look at this am I supposed to be able to see what I'm changing no definitely not we're definitely getting 1% lows below 60 raate tracing is on which is definitely not the 7800 xt's you know Forte but that's the trade-off I think in this game we're going to have to say there's an advantage for the PS5 Pro it is an exceptionally well optimized game even on the base PS5 so the PS5 Pro just gets that extra little bit however with
that said if you had me blind taste test these I would not object to either of them this is a great experience if you want to play Rift apart I watched something that I've been curious to see for myself and I would be able to tell the difference with pssr for one big issue which is some of its upscaling looks like it's moving if you look at those lines in the deck you can see them kind of like moving and they're not supposed to be like they're supposed to be stationary oh okay so hold on a
second see yours are just stationary so there's motion artifacting or something I saw it in a digital Foundry video and I've been curious to see that so we've got some advantages and disadvantages both ways yes I'm just looking at the confetti in there inside yeah I think mine is just going a crap FSR has no idea what to do with it it's pretty Bonkers yeah there's a lot of motion artifacts in it and it's clear that the PS5 Pros upscaling is doing a much better job here like it's really
hard but if you can catch one with your eye and try to follow it around you can follow a piece of confetti around yours mine good luck yeah that's just a garbled mess yeah it's pretty bad overall the motion is still there it's moving clockwise or whatever but those are individual objects and that's just it's shredded almost looking my foliage doesn't look way worse than yours here though oh my trees do though that was background yeah the background trees look so flat we I think this is an L I
think the PS5 prob might take the win on this one I have everything set to high but I think we're going to want to mess with the settings again I think your menu looks better though like substantially oh oh would you like to enable the pro rendering mode here we go yes we reset these displays right before we started and when we were using them for PS5 versus PS5 Pro on short circuit they looked the same M I thought Windows 11 each chir was supposed to be good [Laughter] you just said you liked mine better
that's true hey did I load first I think you might have loaded faster than the PS5 Pro got him oh no just kiding between the two wow that's remarkably close feel like your hair is better but maybe I'm just at an angle it's true I think your textures are worse that's pretty if they are it's not by much dude I think like the photos are a little bit clearer here I don't know if that's a pssr thing cuz it looks like it's doing some weird work on their shirts yeah dude I would rather have the
softer photo than the like shimmery line on it it was distracting are you getting a good solid 60 FPS oh yeah this is very 60 FPS e me too looks like your 1% lows are a little bit lower but I wouldn't be able to tell not with any kind of variable refresh rate the fact that we can be this close to the screen and not tell the difference I think tells the story yeah they both look great they both look fantastic I think we could call this a close enough yeah I think we could probably tweak settings and get it
a little bit better but you're already at your performance threshold so yeah I think this is as good as it's going to get uh wow this is not good oh wow yeah you're 40ish I'm not even no I don't even think I believe what frame do is saying dude touch this oh yeah that's like sub30 way that's way this is bad the the the pacing here is terrible turn off your raate tracing you know what I'm going to turn vsync off and see if that helps yeah that helps a lot okay okay now it
feels like what it says it is the thing about vsync is if you dip below the target frame rate in many cases it will actually have to dip even lower in order to ensure smooth delivery of frames and if you are oscillating between them it can feel extremely stuttery worse than if you just didn't have it at all and in this case this was clearly the right play I'm getting a little bit of tearing but this is way smoother it doesn't look as smooth as yours though once again your
HDR pops so much more than mine and for those of you looking at frame view up here and doubting that HDR is working my menu pops like HDR is definitely on on both of these displays it says HDR mode right here Asus gaming HDR trust me we reset them right before we started we did learn when we did the last PS5 killer that Intel's implementation of HDR just plane didn't work because there's a lot of proprietary nonsense that both AMD and Nvidia have baked into their drivers to
get the bloody thing working so we could be seeing some of that here it could also be that Windows HDR just plane isn't that great I'm curious kind of come stand on that semicircle want look at the background cuz I getting a lot of that motion upscaling crap in the in the background again yours looks a lot more stable no mine's clean but I think you need to turn down some settings to get to 60 yeah okay I don't like pssr I think it looks bad like look at this tree am I crazy is
that like that's no you're not crazy that's a lot worse than mine have a look I expected this to be better than FSR and I think you know well it is better than FSR but it's not better than just if you aren't using as much FSR that's fair I have a more powerful GPU than you yes however it's pretty clear that I'm not getting an even 60 FPS and honestly all things considered I'd probably take that gaming experience really hey I mean here try it that's try swapsies oh yeah all right and I'm not looking at this
going wow what a huge difference in visual Fidelity when I'm actually playing the game if I'm not sitting in pixel peeping now these are both more than adequate I would be fine with either of these I think I would be prepared without changing one setting at a time and rebooting the whole game I think I'd be prepared to call this one pretty much a tie yeah it's not quite there I don't think we're quite there but it's pretty close it's pretty close let's close this out by answering some questions is the PS5
Pro as bad of value as people are making it out to be well I think that depends who you are if you have a 1080p display absolutely do not buy this machine if you have a 4K display though and a base PS5 you could get anywhere from 250 to even more for your current machine meaning the upgrade is going to cost you $350 to $450 that is a pretty tough sell the PS5 Pro definitely looks better but from TV distance I feel like like only the Discerning of gamers are going to easily
pick the pro out of a lineup with that said if you're coming into the PlayStation 5 ecosystem fresh it's undoubtedly the better machine it's the definitive PlayStation 5 experience and for $250 more it's no worse of a deal as we just showed than spending another 250 bucks on a gaming PC for better Fidelity because I don't really think that our extra couple hundred bucks blew away what Sony was able to do with the extra budget I wouldn't judge you then for going for the PS5 Pro but just be aware
that you'll have to factor in an external disc drive if you want to get the best deals on games as we showed recently it's definitely worth the investment if you buy more than a small handful of games each generation the other big question is PS5 Pro versus our PS5 Pro killer PC well if you're the buy everything new sort this machine is going to run you around $900 before tax we're going to have links to all the parts in the video description now over time you might make up that difference
in cheaper games and extra utility but not everybody has a couple hundred extra dollars up front which means that the choice is not exactly clear as for our secondhand machine well I think there's a ton of value here I love this machine I love this configuration and I would strongly recommend scrapyard Waring yourself a kick ass gaming rig like this but before Mark Cy calls me out in another interview I fully acknowledge that yeah we killed the PS5 Pro but we also threw sand in its eyes before the
