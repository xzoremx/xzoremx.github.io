it's the weirdest thing Elijah can you hear this speaker yeah I can hear it somehow my microphone picks up nothing right next to it but Elijah can hear it from down the road now sound waves are always directional to a degree but this thing is on a whole other level perhaps magic spoiler no the oddly model B uses Ultra rasonic Audio Waves which you normally can't hear and add some special sauce to create a directional speaker that's designed to create a private listening Zone giving the user a headphon like
experience is that something people are asking for and what are we giving up in return also are there any fun creative ways we could use this technology not sure a few things and yes but before I tell you about them Elijah needs to tell you about our sponsor hey there you are Ridge upgrade your everyday carry with a ridge wallet their new Ridge lights are just as functional and even more compact than before use our link and save 10% off your purchase and get free shipping 
lonus to help you guys experience how cool this thing is we've set it up on a lazy Susan in an open area of our warehouse then all you got to do is pop on a pair of headphones and you'll be able to hear exactly what we hear with   it that is so weird it sounds like it's in the one ear and then it sounds like it's inside my skull and then the other ear and then it's gone and then because we've got flat surfaces here in the warehouse it actually bounces off of some of them and
sounds like it's coming from completely different places now alongside the greatest song of all time you might have heard a slight buzzing or interference or Dropout sound that's because the microphones are picking up some of those ultrasonic frequencies that I mentioned earlier but to most human ears it sounds as clear as any other speaker you'd find at the local Best Buy how does this work and what makes it different from a traditional speaker in a traditional speaker two things contribute to the
audio that you hear the amplitude or how hard the speaker pushes against the air around it determines how loud it is and the frequency which is how many of these Cycles it completes per second contributes to the pitch Sound Energy travels in waves just like ripples in a body of water meaning that when you make sound anybody nearby can hear baby no money forget that Melody now we can  but because the wavelengths of audible sound are so long the waves can travel through solid objects and even bend
around corners that's why I can hear this speaker pretty well from behind it that's why these speakers use ultrasonic transducers instead and I can practically hear you guys shouting lus humans can't hear ultrasonic frequencies that's what makes them ultrasonic and you're right we can't but thanks to some math that I don't understand now and probably never will we can alter the amplitude and can modulate our ultrasonic transducer array to encode audible sound within ultrasonic sound
now it took decades and the development of sophisticated computer simulations to go from the original Theory to this point but now that we're here it flipping works and because ultrasonic waves have much shorter wavelengths they spread out far less creating a   sound it's still about 15Â° meaning that at a great enough distance multiple people can hear it but the effect in person is really trippy not to mention a lot of fun I'm in position where it should be hard for anyone in the lab to
see me and I'm going to start up a Wan show I thought someone was talking I thought then I'm going to beam it around    Logistics I don't even know what this plastic is here for it's clearly to prevent peep Bad actors like you Elijah's bringing a knife so we can control Logistics now we're going to point it through the plastic but first  Elijah so confused I can see Jamie okay we're going to go for Jamie we're going   okay where the how they all find us  dang it how'd you guys find us so fast I
heard through it earlier oh dang it well you win some you lose some still a lot of fun if we were smart and we really wanted to throw people off though we would use the effect where it bounces off of flat surfaces creating a really weird effect where it sounds like it's coming from the Reflection Point rather than from the location of the speaker let me show you what I mean okay Elijah  right there okay what if I bounce it more times I hear it right about there yeah and it it's super trippy if I
did not see you I would think it's coming from the wall pretty wild right I mean you'd think after a bounce or two it would sound a lot farther away but ultrasonic waves don't attenuate nearly the way that audible waves do so whether I'm 10 ft away or 100 ft away bouncing once or four times it sounds really similar the question now is how far can we go well based on what they saw in the intro you're going to have to go a lot further than that buddy all righty poor Elijah he's
getting his steps in today boys most exercise I've done all year how about now yeah I can still hear it how about now no I don't hear it oh okay how about if I aim it at you I it sounds the exact same I hear it totally fine okay keep going oh oh my goodness it's crazy to me how it's been sounding almost the exact same volume the whole way how about now I can still hear it that is wild we'll keep going a little bit more very faintly but I can still hear it that is very cool we're almost at the
end of our parking lot yeah you can still hear it I can still hear it yeah and Andy can hear it from back there still oh  there's a car in the way but we are from end to end on the parking lot here's the Google Maps image to show you how far we are uh let's see if I can still hear it do you hear it Andy I hear the truck you might as well come back oh my God this is freaking hilarious they're standing in that corner with all those cars around them and I'm kind of moving it around a
little bit it's got to sound like it's coming from like freaking everywhere there was a split moment where all the way at the end of the parking lot I heard like one or two notes at that distance the issue you're running into is lining it up not even that you can hear it anymore that is super cool but ultrasonic waves do have a downside they get blocked very easily you can see I'm sitting here chilling listening to music all I got to do is put this piece of paper in front of it and
H and there's more remember that sound  in theory it can be deployed stealthily but in practice we found that people with sensitive hearing sorry sorry sorry can pick up those high frequencies and because those ultrasonic frequencies need to be very high amplitude for the encoding to work meaning they're very loud it can create an uncomfortable feeling for some people and especially some animals with all that cool how does it work stuff out of the way what are these even for I mean I guess as a gamer
having a personal private listening cone without needing to wear anything on my head would be kind of liberating but at this price yeah it's more for commercial installations you know showrooms museums and the like so you can step in front of an interesting piece learn more about it available now at LTT store.com and when you're done you walk away and the audio is gone with a cleverly designed Gallery including soft surfaces to minimize Reflections you can offer a pretty
engaging experience for your customers or patrons oddly the makers of this particular speaker focus on digital signage and advertising but they also highlight some pretty creative uses like this one integration in a playground haunted house pretty spooky what's really cool is oddly is working on cutting the costs but if you don't want to wait there's actually tons of videos online showing people building these speakers for themselves including this one guy who actually made it look like a
little gun to point at a Target I don't know it's kind of cute just like this cute segue to our sponsor thanks to Corsair for sponsoring this episode Corsair custom lab allows you to create a gaming setup as unique as you are start with a product like their K65 plus wireless keyboard and select from a variety of different themed key caps to match your style from there you can add a mouse and a mouse pad to complete the look course sah handles all the heavy lifting for you just make your Custom
Creation and they'll build it and ship it right to you learn more at the link in the video description if you guys did enjoy this video go check out the recording Jammer video that one was super cool as well and helped cover up some hot takes that lonus had
