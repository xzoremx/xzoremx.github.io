with internet service providers in dozens of countries around the world advertising gigabit or even faster internet service it's awfully tempting to yell shut up and take my money and then bathe yourself in a waterfall of dank mes but before you spend even more of your hard-earned dollars upgrading an already too expensive internet plan there's a lot you need to consider first of all how is that connection even getting to your PC or other devices is it going to be a bottleneck well for
most people the answer to that question is by using the ISP provided router now if that happens to be in the same room or you're lucky enough to have ethernet in your walls great any reasonably modern device except Smart TVs for some reason should have a gigabit Ethernet port meaning you will get the full benefit and even if you weren't so lucky as all that modern powerline network adapters and even Wi-Fi can handle gigabit or more however everything that I just said comes with some big big
butts let's start with the most common connection today Wi-Fi if you happened to buy yourself a premium Wi-Fi router or access point in the last 20 minutes or so well congratulations 1center you're ready to download at gigabit speeds sort of more on that later for everyone else who grabbed a $15 USB Wi-Fi dongle and called it a day well I've got some bad news advertised Wi-Fi speeds are a pipe dream specifically this kind of pipe dream I mean sure with enough spatial streams your pre-plague
Wi-Fi 5 setup could hit gigabit in the real world but between your walls cats and just plain old distance you'd be lucky to get half of that leaving the rest of your tasty megabits untouched now the justification for these advertised speeds is that with multiple concurrent users all downloading at the same time the total might add up to something approaching that number but that also assumes that you have a bunch of people who are downloading at the same time and that your router and your
devices have implemented optional parts of the Wi-Fi spec that spoiler alert they often didn't Oh and before I spoil that too our sponsor is Ridge they're celebrating their 11th anniversary right now why don't you join them there might be cake virtual cake in the form of savings head over to the link below bring your party hat and check out the sale everything I just said about Wi-Fi applies equally to power line and mocha if you're on anything but the latest version of the tech under optimal
conditions it is unlikely that you need a gigabit pipe to keep them fed but let's say for the sake of argument you have overcome those problems let's meet potential bottleneck number two your computer whether your computer looks like this or this or this or this the data that reaches your network adapter still needs to be processed and sometimes stored now as long as you have a solid state drive the storage part is "probably fine gigabit or 1,000 megabit" is just 125 megabytes per second it's
not that much in the grand scheme of things so then why is the processing an issue well you you see data hosts and internet service providers greatly prefer that the files you download are compressed this helps them save on storage space and helps them save on bandwidth costs as your juicy memes movies and games come flying over the wire the downside of all of this is that someone needs to uncompress them that's you which is why downloading games from Steam has turned into kind of an
informal Benchmark around here because it turns out to max out a gigabit line in Steam you need a pretty modern CPU to max out 2 and 1/2 gig you pretty much need a top-of-the-line gaming chip and to even approach the limits of the 10 gig connection that we have to our on-site steam cache we need a "$10,000 996 core thread Ripper Pro now" as you can imagine most people's PCS and especially game consoles aren't equipped with any of that stuff I mean even the PS5 and Xbox series X struggle to reach
full gigabit speeds for game downloads and as for the Nintendo switch well it's in a class of its own the uh less advanced class struggling to reach real world speeds of even just 100 megabit which was the standard on PCS so I don't know 25 years ago now there are valid use cases for fat download speeds and we will talk about those but first let's change gears to what most people are actually doing with their internet connection most of the time and it isn't playing that game it's playing other
games now obviously every game's a little different but but we spent 10 minutes in rocket league and Halo infinite moving about 6 megab and 15 megabytes of data respectively that doesn't mean you're going to be able to get by with a25 megabit connection your voice chat uh might not be too happy about that but what it does mean is that a 200 to 300 megabit connection is lots for even a Full House of active Gamers especially now that steam allows local transfers of game files however that
doesn't mean that just any connection will do because any gamer will tell you once you've got enough bandwidth latency is the real difference between pone or be pwned and it can be worthwhile to test drive any available local isps to see who Nets you the lowest ping times to your favorite game servers the same actually goes for streaming games from a service like GeForce now or Xbox Cloud depending on the resolution and frame rate that you target they call for anywhere from 10 to 45 megabit now game
streaming is a unique past because even a tiny disruption can spell disaster so while I wouldn't say you need gigabit I would probably double or even triple the onp paper requirements just to ensure that my little sister's book report doesn't get my squad wiped out but the same is not true of Netflix and other video streaming services which is actually kind of funny when you consider how much 4K video streaming gets talked about in ISP marketing materials we're talking Max 50 megabit per stream and it
pre-buff in chunks for smoother playback kind of like your old old disman with anti-ip so yeah the faster your connection the quicker you'll be able to scrub within your content since those chunks will come down so fast but even then there's a point of diminishing returns and past a few hundred megabit Netflix's own servers are unlikely to send you the data any faster which brings us to the third big bottleneck for data to transfer from one place to another well it's going to have to be
received by you but also sent by someone else at the same speed and how many businesses do you know that like spending extra money on an Overkill connection that most people won't benefit from that's right guys the vast majority of the services that you use are going to be throttled on their side rather than on yours well okay liners put on a turbo tabbing browsing social media consumption machine I'm going to use all the sites at once neat do you want the bad news first uh here let's
load up say LT store.com ooh cable management and precision screwdrivers coming soon sign up for a notification anyway I was going somewhere with this that sort of traffic page loads small pictures videos is made up of a whole bunch of smallish requests and resource files that are so small that they typically finish downloading before they even get up to gigabit speed you can use the network tab of your browser's Dev tools to reveal what exactly is going on behind the scenes when you visit a web
page just click through to review your timing details and you can see exactly what's taking up time and potentially slowing down your experience it turns out a lot of the time it's actually not the data transfer speed at all your isp's default DNS needs to give you the IP address of a server before you can connect and in many cases this takes dozens of milliseconds meaning that most of the time you spend waiting that hyperfast connection was sitting idle anyway compounding the problem you also
need to wait for the remote server to process your request and begin the transfer more idling the good news is that switching to a public DNS provider like Cloud flare Open DNS or Google can improve this performance in fact we did a whole video about it and Gibson research offers a DNS Benchmark tool that can help determine the best option for your location we're going to have that link down below the bad news is that everything I just said is free and a fancier connection does nothing to
improve it wait bad news that's not bad news that's good news I like free stuff oh wait here's the bad news what is this analytics and advertising okay if a website is doing everything right those resources should load after the content you actually care about so they shouldn't impact your experience too much if they're doing it right in the real world though ads and analytics can significantly impact your browsing speed services like browser-based ad blocking or a pie hoold
DNS resolver on your local network we actually made a whole video about that as well we'll have that link down below can eliminate at least some of those load times but as someone who relies on web advertising for my livelihood and to pay my staff how you guys doing good last paycheck clear yep good stuff I would only ask that you consider the impact if you go that route now let's talk about your butts but Linus I like to download and share Linux isos well first of all your community spirit and
commitment to open source is admirable comrade but you should really be looking into a seed box for as little as a dollar a month you can get dedicated space and bandwidth on a server in a data center that has multiple high-speed internet connections all away from the prying eyes of your internet service provider many of them even accept crypto as payment because hey you know how much they hate when people share Linux isos but lonus I want to run a web server at home okay again why virtual private
servers start even cheaper than seedboxes and have the same benefits along with static IPS easy backup options and room to grow and scale if you need more capacity in the future you also won't be risking your residential connection being terminated because you're technically violating your isp's terms of service you could even collocate if you want dedicated Hardware with a Raspberry Pi costing under 10 bucks a month which is probably less than that internet upgrade that you've
been eyeing but lus I'm a content creator and I need that sweet sweet upload speed all right you've got me on that one a proper fiber to the home ISP offers symmetric speeds that is to say that the upload speed is the same as the download speed and I'll be the first to admit that when you're uploading multiple 4K videos every week that higher upload speed and not having to sit around and wait it's pretty amazing but watch out not all fiber services are equal and many isps Market their
services as fiber because I don't know there's fiber somewhere but that last mile connection from your home to the nearest node is actually docis 3 or 3.1 and your upload speeds tend to be much slower another thing to watch out for is that we've never seen YouTube inest at multi- gig speeds so you're probably still okay with a decent but not maxed out connection which is especially true for Twitch in that case you only need about 8 megabits per 10860 stream so again real-time streaming I would build
in some additional buffer in that case even like Forex if you don't want your audience to be like Yay what happened bottom line if you told 20-year-old lus that he would one day be arguing against faster internet speeds he would have laughed in your face but things aren't getting any more affordable out there right now guys and if a reality check here can save even 1% of the people who watch this video just $10 a month that would work out to over a million dollar saved a year which is a pretty big win
