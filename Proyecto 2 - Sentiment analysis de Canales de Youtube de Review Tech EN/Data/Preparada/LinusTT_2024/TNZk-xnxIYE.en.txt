you've seen a portable projector you've seen a CRT but have you seen a portable CRT projector okay portable might be a little generous but the vidam magic fp60 from Sony came with its own carrying bag has a microphone input for projecting your voice and did I mention there's a built betamax player no how about the fact that it uses a single tube to produce a color image rather than three tubes like most other CRT projectors in this episode of lonus overpays for ancient Hardware that
you've probably never heard of we'll be cosplaying as a traveling salesman from the 1980s I can't wait to play with this thing just like I can't wait to tell you about our sponsor build Redux sometimes computers are hard but all the time build Redux is easy they'll get a custom PC built and delivered Direct ly to your doorstep just check them out at the link down below according to radiomuseum.org the introductory price for the viam magic fp60 was "$3,000 that's not that bad for a" portable
projector except that was in 1984 meaning it would be closer to "$9,000 today that's high enough that" just about nobody was going to be buying these for home theater use but businesses well that's another story and cosmetics giant Avon even went as far as to co-brand the fp60 and deploy it to company Representatives across the United States hence my uh world's largest makeup bag here at 35 lbs she's more luggable than really portable but when you compare it to other mid 80s
options for boardroom presentations for example like what a CRT on an AV cart or a real toore projector the fp60 had major advantages in terms of screen size and in terms of durability and convenience so we're going to get to that whole presentation use case but first I have a burning question kenet game oh yeah fun fact by the way the NES wouldn't come out in America for another year we just felt like being Gamers it would be a great choice for us to evaluate the latency not going to lie
brother I can see it's on but uh wow barely I mean is that supposed to be curtains at the top or is that just this reason everyone had blacked out media rooms right okay we're going to have to lose some lights yeah get the lamp there we go oh my God yeah the lamp doesn't do much no we need that one hold on I got you I got you it's still horrible get this okay hold on I got this one I got this one what that's the only light we have left and that's all we got turn it off dude this is terrible
well you know it's a crd yeah but it didn't get very bright to begin with okay hold on hold on that's that's markedly better okay we're getting somewhere I mean that's about as far as we're going to get but that's that's not bad okay that lamp's got to go that lamp was throwing so much more light than the CRT projector with that said looking into this thing that's about the brightest CRT I've ever seen right that indextron wow there's like hairs in there oh yeah you can probably it'd probably be fun to
try to play with the focus if you want to basically that's the cross oh it's probably slightly out of focus there's also a uh manual focus on the very front that you can use okay but you shouldn't don't touch them together or you can break the whole Focus system yeah it's definitely still got some blurry spots do you have any idea what that is no Elijah tried cleaning the lens so like it's been wiped down so basically Elijah touched it yeah Elijah tou said that it was bad before he touched it I'm not
blaming him in this scenario maybe some of the phosphors are worn out or something or like some of the co CU you can see it looks like burnning when you've got it on a single um like color here oh my God what this is perfect right there's no latency there's none cuz it's a CRT it's a projector but it's a CRT a CRT wow it's like so easy this is like freaking Easy Street and it looks pretty good hey like those blacks actually look pretty black it's pretty colorful too like this is not bad no
it's not bad at all I mean it's not good no but in a in a dark environment though  fine oh no wow you're diding so well let's see you do better I probably won't another thing that's not included with ours is a working speaker unfortunately yeah it's just not working and theoretically we could use our uh technical manual service manual to repair it or we could just not do that oh my God you're wasting the pow there's no pow we don't need it I thought you were too good you don't need the pow did
you die yeah again I hit a blue shell while it was flipped over we've already realized that when it comes to old games you'll usually win new games I don't know okay well that was you dying on purpose I actually did not okay all right this is it for all the marbles here we go um they kill me yeah yeah yeah they kill you if they're um moving yeah yeah yeah this feels too good I know right like it feels like you're playing on a CRT yeah because the only additional latency compared to looking directly
into a CRT is the speed of light to the screen that's it so just the slightly increased like distance the light has to travel like this is awesome but blue we're getting about 2.2 nits 2.2 nits the point two matters let's stop it for now cuz I want to talk about brightness In fairness most projectors don't get that bright compared to direct view displays but this is clearly way behind the experience that Sony showed off in this by the way amazing promotional video that was recently re-uploaded by retro
TV film and video and if we look closely yep composited got him now it was probably brighter when it was new CRTs do Decay over time but they show this thing being usable in a literally sunlit room when realistically it would have needed pitch Darkness even then with that said how cool would a land party have been if someone showed up with one of these bad boys oh it'd be sick with like a GI even not even 180 50 60 in that would be unheard of as a kid unheard of a regular
CRT tube TV works by coating the front glass with a phosphor material that lights up when it gets Zapped by one of three electron guns one for red one for green and one for blue with our CRT projector we're not looking at a lit up phosphor screen so what are what is going on here it turns out it's surprisingly simple they're still using a cathode ray tube to generate the image and we can see that if we look directly down the barrel but it's upside down and backwards so
that once it goes through the lens which is basically functioning as a giant magnifying glass it'll be the right way around now I alluded to this before but one of the big Innovations for the vid magic was that most CRT projectors in those days were using three separate tubes and lenses for RG and B kind of like this they were reliable but they were extremely heavy and and inconvenient to set up supposedly it took quite some time to get them all lined up correctly and something as
small as a swift kick to the table it was resting on could put the whole thing out of whack again another major hurdle they faced was well you can probably guess from what we've seen so far brightness CRTs by modern standards are pretty dim to begin with and projecting that light across a much larger area exacerbates the issue how do you fix all of that okay the fp60 is no regular CRT it uses a single electron gun with a beam index tube so to get the right colors from a
single gun they would modulate the beam strength then there was a fourth phosphor stripe and when that lit up the result was captured by a photo multiplier tube and that signal was then Amplified and sent to a decoder circuit which would basically check if the colors were correct and then adjust the modulation of the beam on the fly if you open this thing up the number of boards involved to properly index and decode the signals is pretty wild by the way shout out to 12volt vids for this
amazing footage from his repair video a few years ago that gives us a great look by the way at the water cooling that was built into this projector now this design did have drawbacks like inferior contrast but the benefits were Brighter Images no convergence problems and lower sensitivity to magnetic interference which is why they saw some military use Sony commercialized a couple of versions of this technology including the indextron tube which was used in our fp60 as well as in the highly sought
after kvx 370 watch cube a super cute 4in bedside TV that came out in 1989 realistically nobody was buying this thing for gaming so why don't we try a movie this definitely makes these 1980 special effects not look out of place yeah I mean they look pretty good um at this resolution yeah at this brightness got to love those four textures not 4K just four this looks about how I remember watching TV in the 9s no we had more color than that the contrast is terrible fine yeah terrible so I guess what we
want to know is how much of what we're looking at is limitations of the betamax format and or degradation of the tape versus how much of it is limitations of the performance of our projector so do we want to throw our DVD on yeah let's put our DVD in I think it's already in the player okay I love how delightfully easy to operate this thing is yeah it's pretty simple switches for different modes y this looks better I think that other than getting 16 by9 M which we can actually kind of take advantage of with
this projector because the image isn't so small that you are basically just like well I gave up 30% of my whole screen I don't think this is a whole ton better though like a little bit I think it's a little better a little bit looking into the lens this is as bright a CRT as I have ever seen how small does it get to be CRT bright off the projection screen I'm going to move it okay moving forward careful this is like 60 80 lbs worth of I got I got you oh yeah I got hang on yeah um wow that's
still really dim okay more I think that's his oh that is as much as it goes boy so we can't go any smaller than this yeah all right so it's not great for watching movies either but there were advantages to using a CRT projector even when LCD and DLP option options started hitting the market better black levels and better flesh tones no pixelation and exceptionally long tube life most CRT projectors were "rated for around 10,000 hours while the" bulbs in LCD and DLP projectors were
"only good for 1 or 2,000 they'd also" gotten pretty cheap on the used Market by then so you could go with the used CRT projector and still have money left over to spend on the new noock to a screwdriver from LTD store.com to take it apart when you need to change the tube by the way guys we got a full service manual for this thing and a second projector let us know in the comments if you want to see Dan try to fix it with all of that said these benefits were not enough to keep CRT
projectors in fashion like their TV set Brethren they were replaced by lighter brighter models even if it meant sacrificing a little bit of image quality for actually years to come and the last CRT projector came out in 2001 the pro 1200 X from Zenith it retailed "for about $30,000 and weighed around 155" lb by contrast the high-end Christy Mirage 200000 DLP projector launched in the same year for 55 grand but weighed almost half of what the Zenus did and was roughly seven times brighter modern
