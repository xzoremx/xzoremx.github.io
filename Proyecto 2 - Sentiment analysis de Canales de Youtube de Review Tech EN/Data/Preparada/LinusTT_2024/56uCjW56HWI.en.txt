when we took only the top results last time we noticed that hey if you're willing to scroll past the sponsored first result Amazon actually provides very clear guidance for what they feel is the best choice with this helpful little badge but should we trust it I mean on the one hand I'm sure that Mr Bezos would only mine the finest of data from our purchases and reviews and use that to lead us to the promised land of value PC gaming Town surely he would never use his powers for capitalistic
evil but of course on the other hand reality so we built a second all Amazon PC this time using only their overall pick to see if beating back the title wave of sponsored crap really is as simple as just trusting Amazon the guys who sold us out in the first place will it be better let's find out after this segue the segue this segue this segue to our sponsor ug green their Uno series of charging accessories may have cute little faces but that doesn't make them any less featur so add some fun to the
boring Act of charging your devices check them out using our links and save  sale my first question was what exactly is is the overall pick badge well based on what we can find it looks like it was added to their Amazon's Choice system back in 20123 and in a nutshell it takes our herd mentality concept so the idea of just buying whatever's popular cuz Hey it couldn't be that bad to a whole new level to become an overall pick though an item must not only be purchased often it also needs a fourstar
rating or greater and must be returned infrequently that extra bit of data about returns is what makes this such a GameChanger exposing that to Shoppers makes sense for everyone the buyer the seller and even Amazon themselves I mean nobody likes dealing with returns so the only question is did it work if it did I should have a high value high quality and reliable computer and you know what outside of a few odd choices this build doesn't look half bad While most folks probably don't need need a motherboard
with amd's premium x670 chipset the tomahawk Wi-Fi from MSI is a pretty nice board it's got an eight layer PCB PCI Express Gen 5 on both the x16 and our top m.2 slot loads of vrm cooling Solid iio 2 and2 gig networking what's not to love well for one thing apparently this board doesn't like WD or Samsung drives that's not going to be a deal breaker for us because spoiler Amazon picked a crucial vx500 for our system that we'll talk about later but we're also going to try a Samsung nvme drive just to see how
that goes before we can do that we need to get this to a state where we can actually boot it up though starting with our CPU the ryzen 7 7700x for just $245 now this was on a deep discount at the time of purchase for a whopping 39% off but hey I mean if that's what makes something an overall pick I'm into it it's eight cores 16 threads Zen 4 and it'll boost to a Max of 5.4 GHz making it pretty hard to beat at this price so as you'd expect most of the complaints about it were just about DOA chips or
empty boxes probably due to the shipment being opened and intercepted annoying but hardly amd's fault for our ddr5 memory we ended up with a sweet looking 32 gig kit from Corsair but under the surface it runs at "6,400 megat transfers per second CL 36" that's not awful but most folks should be shooting for about 10 NS of first word latency these days especially now that prices have come down if you want a bit more detail about that stay tuned for our next memory speed matters video
for now though I'm still feeling pretty good about this Choice thanks to the low number of onear reviews most of which just seem to be complaining about DOA products I mean to be clear DOA is bad but course air support seems to fall somewhere between adequate and hey maybe even good so if you get unlucky reach out and they should get you taken care of oh you know who also has good support LTT store.com check out the new circuitry hoodie looks great feels great and it's puny as all heck
circuitry now let's talk about our SSD while there's nothing inherently wrong with using a SATA SSD in 2024 I mean they're perfectly fine for booting your Os or running games it does feel like a questionable choice for overall pick when you can get an m.2 nvme drive for a similar price for one thing they're faster but perhaps more importantly if you don't get care about performance you don't need to mount nvme drives in your case and then run two flipping cables to them so when Amazon recommended that we
buy the BX 5001 tbte I was a little surprised however we've had good experiences with crucial drives overall and it's easy to believe that Amazon has too I mean heck I'd probably promote this drive on my store if it had a 4.7 star rating with over "120,000 reviews I mean they're not all" good but the onear complaints are mostly about right speeds and rmas neither of which uh should affect us today for our CPU Cooler I was pleasantly surprised to see the Peerless assassin 120 SE I know
it's good you know it's good but was Amazon going to know it's good apparently yes and honestly there's really not that much else to say about this thing it's a great cooler from a company that's been playing the game just about as long as anyone and it comes at a great price now let's fire it up and see if this Samsung SSD works H I guess before we can fire this up we're probably going to need a power supply Amazon suggested the rm850x which is a little overkill for our build today but it's a reputable
unit and it gives us some headro if we want to upgrade our GPU down the line also being 33% off at the time that doesn't hurt now the key out among you might have noticed something though we thought we had an rm850x in our stock so we didn't order one but it turns out we  we could have delayed the shoot but we thought you know what shift happens and it doesn't make a difference to  so time to get some modular cables installed power hey there we go all right theoretically we should just fire up
into Windows unless it actually has problems with Samsung drives did they say what the compatibility issue is supposed to be should just be Motherboard BIOS update okay well evidently ours is updated so cool but we can't leave it like this so we took Amazon's advice and bought a Corsair 4000d airflow at full price honestly it's a little on the expensive side but at about 24% off it's hard to say no we've built in this case plenty of times and I like it it's thoughtfully
laid out easy to work in and most of the low star reviews had to do with the lack of space around the power supply unit which uh we accidentally remedied by going with the uh um side mounted modular cables but you could also Remedy by just plugging in your regular module power supply cables ahead of time then sliding the whole thing in and Finishing Touch now for the moment you've all been waiting for the GPU and wow okay no I'm I'm kidding it's not going to be an offbrand rx580 like last time instead
we've got something far more modern an RTX 36 12 gig it's neither the latest nor is it the greatest but it should do us just fine for high-end 1080p gaming or even 1440p in a pinch thanks to Nvidia frame rate boosting features like dlss most of the complaints about this card had to do with them breaking down overtime which can happen and it seems like most of those folks were frustrated that it happened past the return window so maybe we found a fatal flaw in Amazon's returned infrequently criteria
after all a card that can can't be returned is not necessarily a card that shouldn't be returned let's see if ours Works hey there we go so overall we paid "$1,147 which is not too bad we've said" for years that this is Right Around The Sweet Spot of price to Performance and without even firing it up I can tell you this is going to be a much better machine than what we built last time however the question isn't can we beat last time the question is can we beat this plof believes that his handpicked
configuration will outperform Mr bezos's Tech tips while also being cheaper by about $20 and I don't believe I know a bold claim he is rocking the same 7700x thanks to that sweet deal but he managed slightly faster memory a Gen 4 drive with a dam cache and a Radeon 7700 XT sure we downgraded to a motherboard that lacks pcie Gen 5 and the H5 flow it's not as premium a case as the 4000d airf flow but man is that ever a lot of GPU and the big surprise here is that almost all
of the deals that we found to build this machine were on Amazon so if their overall Choice was algorithmically adjusted they could have offered us this same config for just $60 more than what we paid so let's see if he slayed the dragon starting with Horizon zero Dawn so 1080p quity ultimate ultimate quality okay I mean oh hamburgers I know that we're in different zones yeah but still I I've got like over 50 or 60 FPS higher than you yeah this is not close I I don't think it's close at all I've got
almost twice the frames it's not a perfect scientific benchmarking system we're doing here but uh I don't think even if I go to the same spot as you I'm gonna suddenly shoot down to like 83 FPS let's go to another game let's check another game hold on I want to try turning on frame gen I can use dlss it's still not as good no it's really not yeah that actually didn't boost your FPS as much as I thought it would it's higher but not by a lot do I have amd's upscaling method with super resolution
so don't get me wrong it's not as good it's not as good I don't even like dlss yeah cuz I can tell when it's on but now I'm getting almost 200 frames a second well okay it dipped a lot but I'm 170 160 especially in a game with a lot of nature a lot of trees I know it looks so bad it looks so bad it I can't I can't do it even this you can see well you're a diva look at this you can see the shimmering I can't do it okay we're at different spots okay that's fine I've kind of got a bit more going on I mean I
don't it's oh my God look at this 47 43 my 1% lows are 90 it's amazing what skimping on basically everything but your GPU and then blowing as much money as possible on your GPU will do for your gaming experience at higher resolutions or higher detail levels oh yeah and we didn't even skimp that much these are all pretty brand name parts I chose you know no weird thermal T power supplies or anything like that yeah what power supply do you have uh also Corsair but I went down 100 Watts I don't think this
is any kind of contest I don't really think we need to run any more games I think this has been very much settled at this point overall then the system is nowhere near as bad as last time we were given decent products from reputable Brands sometimes even at a great price but while the 3060 12 gig is a perfectly cromulent card if you want to game at 1080p well medium depending on the game we'll have it linked down below along with everything else it's impossible to avoid the truth that it is getting a
little long in the tooth especially if you consider that 50 Series is rumored to be right around the corner along with this segue to our sponsor our sponsor our sponsor our sponsor ug green you know what can be a bit boring charging your devices I mean it's such a mundane task you'll plug in your iPhone when it's dead you sit there and wait for it to get enough juice so you can send a text well ug green wants to add a little spice to your life with their Uno series of charging accessories they have all
