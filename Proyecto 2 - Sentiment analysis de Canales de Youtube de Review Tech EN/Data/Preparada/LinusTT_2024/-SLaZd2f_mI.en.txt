and welcome to the W show we have got a great show lined up for you guys today we're going to be talking about the Apple Vision Pro Luke will be having his first hands-on experience with it I've got it in my backpack beautiful so we're going to see your beautiful eyes it will be yours uh yeah it'll be don't worry they're blue for some reason perfect uh we're also going to be talking about the Canadian government who did something spectacularly either stupid or awesome depending on
your perspective sure I mean someone obviously thinks it's awesome otherwise they wouldn't have done it what else we got today h did I take yours again yeah you stopped for one week and now it's just gone uh wait there there was one uh yeah deep fake scam boosts $ 25 million for those of you who are new to English especially young people English boosts means steals steals yeah what else you got that was that was absolutely wild also I don't know I'll pick this one FUNimation libraries to be deleted which
is bad that's a bummer that means Initial D I'm surprised you didn't take Florida man kicks kids off social media    the show is brought to you by grammarly ag1 and updf why don't we jump right into our headline topic which is of course nothing we named the show after your face my face being actually oh I guess we should talk about that yeah that is a topic oh yeah right oh yeah how did you not take that one I I left you the juiciest yeah fair enough I was all and you were like usually usually
you always take the headliner and you skipped it so I didn't even like realize that was still available but yeah it was it totally was um so have I told you why no oh great okay I was if I remember correctly I was actually legitimately waiting for the show to ask Dan do you know why how life works now I think I had it spoiled for me yeah okay then don't say anything let's let Luke guess we can let chat help you because they don't know so anything they say is just complete profound can I give a can
I give Luke a hint I haven't even get you can maybe eventually but not before I've even started that's disrespectful like does he just does he have a very hint face I look do I very hint face just looks like he needs hints oh man U my first initial reaction action  Furrow my my first initial reaction was that it might have been something to do with uh needing to have like a a mask or something because you can't with beards  um I want to that's why a lot of firefighters have mustaches I want to
give my hint oh because the The Mask can I thought it was just so they could give rides I mean they probably do that a lot but no the uh yeah the mask can go along the the outside of your face and you can still have a mustache cuz it doesn't have to stick there got it makes sense uh just got tired of it ion what is Aon think I don't think you can ask questions I think you can just I think you can just ask reasons did did Avon suggest it no okay uh were you just tired of it nope
were you curious to see what it looked like because it's been too long it's been three long it's been three long three years yeah that that was a CO beard it's a really long time it feels yeah the the whole Co timeline thing is ruined my brain um no it's not Apple Vision Pro fitting no no no apple Vision Pro is totally ski goggles and this is totally neck warmer yeah all right Dan give my  um you know how we were talking about Linus's Porsche last week it's better than hitable face that is true okay uh my
understanding is it's very similar reasons to why he um modified his  wipers okay I can kind of see where you're going with this but I don't think that's going to help him very much I I didn't say it was a good hint but I thought you might find that funny it was like the the cheaper way of doing something but how does that make any sense uh lonus gets it lus gets it I love this there's thousands of people experiencing this and only two of them get the joke right now I feel special Dan you're special
you're a special boy can I get a another hint I I'm trying to think of like do I call in I might as well just tell you there's absolutely no way you're ever going to get it so I booked a Hydra facial I have no idea what that is it's basically just like a skin treatment for your face water on your face no is it water boarding no it's definitely not waterboarding okay um so I got a hydro facial and um I I contacted them ahead of time I was like so like how how does it work with the the hair and they were
like uh well it obviously doesn't work anywhere where you have facial hair and I was like okay well is the price different and they like obvious and they're like no the price is the same same and I was like okay so the price is the same regardless of how much face you treat like I got to get my value I respect that yeah I respect that are you going to grow it back you know what I didn't get my value though because what I realized after I shaved it was even though I had intended to do it anyway I
could have gotten debrand to pay like an enormous amount of money to have me shave my beard on wo or something especially if you left mustache for a certain period of time so stupid I can't I can't believe I can't believe it I am yeah that was kind of that that was SL is kind of surprising to me and one of the most like based takes I've seen so far was our own Mark wrath Burger wrath gber wrath gabber okay I realized I've never said his last name out loud right then F he gets that a lot
I know he's told told me wrath Burger he gets that all the time it's WRA Gaber I knew I grew up with someone with that with that last name so my brain just defaulted to it anyways uh he said if this is real why was wasn't it sponsored yeah that's fair it's a it's a fair take I'm actually very surprised it's air it's a fair take that you didn't combine those two things because the the The Wanted like you know what I'm going to get my full value out of this totally understand y but I'm surprised that your
brain didn't also go not only will I get full value but I will now make money off of this I mean we could have we we could have upgraded some workstations or whatever you know H it was a miss it was a Miss okay speaking of misses my wife no just kidding um let's talk about the Apple Vision Pro no no no no no what does she think oh oh oh oh uh she she liked the beard didn't she she likes the look of the beard but definitely prefers The Snuggle ability of not a beard so
for her it's kind of I think it's like a 55% beard 45% not beard got it but now that the beard has been a thing for a while and she's going back to not the beard it's kind of fun for a bit no oh no no not even a little it's I think it's when we went from this to that it was like oh yeah the beard looks a little better now that we go from beard to this it's like so you're growing it  right so are you growing it back then uh yeah but not yet oh soon why not yet um because the the hydrofacial is just a
lead up for like a pokey thing that they're that they're going to do yeah so it's like some Pokey thing it's supposed to um acupuncture it's supposed to stimulate like collagen production or something like that like basically I'm looking at it going okay I'm almost 40 um I'm not into I'm not into like oh I'm going to get a bunch of fillers and a nose job or whatever else but from a certain point of view um I have like never done anything other than just rub soap on my
face and I'm looking at it going okay so this is kind of like being 40 and never having gone to the dentist it's like yeah I brush my teeth but like like I so I'm like okay you know what little bit of Maintenance I'm going for it so I've got a couple things and then I'm going to grow my facial hair back okay and cover it all up yeah there you go that makes a ton of sense yeah sure all right you ready uh yeah I yeah I guess so all right you guys are going to see it here first guys raw raw
Impressions I'm like I'm like kind of nervous I don't know why well because if your take on it is wrong then you're going to have people calling you an idiot and if your take on it is right then you're going to have the other half of people calling you an idiot because this is an extremely divisive product yeah okay okay so first up first up it's a extremely divisive device here it is the Apple Vision professional professional not to be confused with the regular Apple are you
going to take it oh yeah not to be confused with the regular Apple vision is this just it's one size for everybody situation um okay so you do a facial scan thing but your nose kind of shape coming out of your face is like pretty not that far off mine I suspect this thing will probably be mostly okay for you maybe a little bit on the small side um cuz I'm like a small medium helmet and I think you're more like a large but the whatever the um uh I don't remember what the brand of that VR headset was I
tried at your house but that filled pretty well oh really so the big screen Beyond oh yeah that did fit you okay okay then you'll probably I was wondering about the so that has a dial size okay yep so you just play around with the dial and uh once you put it on it should basically turn on but before you do before you do let's get your impressions all right so it's got the it's got the protective cover on the front it comes with that you can just pop that off material wise feels premium I don't know the
headband really okay there's two options for the headband there's doesn't feel not premium to be clear there's one that has a a top there's the like a top strap as well diaper band well yeah I mean I wouldn't call it a diaper band but sure sure yep they could have made that one look a lot better they clearly want you to use this one yeah I can see that perspective there's like no promo material of that I don't think this is the one in all of it that's fair y That's they could have
done a better job with that one um I can already tell this is going to feel front heavy mhm just think of the uh the weight of the battery pack that's fine it's going to be in a pocket or something right like I'm not really worried about that I think yep what do you think of the fixed cable it's not it's only sort of fixed Yeah well yeah it's it's one length though so you can't just you can't just be like Oh I'm going to keep it in my shirt pocket today yeah cuz it's a it's a it's a
different type of lightning right it's like it's some kind of jumbo lightning so it's it's fixed that's not great for all intents and purposes today I would like to be able to have different lengths of cable sure you got some grease on those lenses mhm do I try it on now go for it do I keep the cover on I have long eyelashes I it's actually a problem for me is my eyelashes just coat the inside of any VR headset that I use with like grease oh yeah yeah you're going to want to loosen
that a touch y yeah yeah oh are you going to take off the front cover sure also I mean any Impressions on the uh yeah okay yeah he found it so that's how the Pieces come apart uh you're going to show the people you're just going to hold it under the desk so I tried to take off the front cover by gripping this portion and pulling both sides and then this came out and I was very temporarily don't forget about the other piece that comes off of that oh wow so that piece also
comes off of the assembly that you just disconnected all right I don't need that though right no no that's just this is the not thicker one this is the thinner version got it of the face face thing I'm going to try again okay here we go  that right there is a man who's going skiing this is less comfortable than I expected to be honest well remember to the face thing is not you know your size does it do these parts rest on your face um it depends so if I use that band it pulls
in hard on my forehead yeah me too and if I use the other band it hangs hard my cheeks okay it's like barely even touching my cheeks all of it is right on my forehead remember to though take all of this for what it is Luke didn't do a facial scan this is not the correct size for him however um I will say that one of my bits of feedback is going to be that I find the comfort of it extremely difficult to deal with it's definitely a lot more front heavy than other VR devices I've used is it on yet uh no
okay hold the button on the left on the top top left there's should be a button hold it down that's the right good job okay did it fire up no uh I hope I didn't let it die you found the button though right yeah this one yeah okay it's not turning on no okay one moment please you can just plug the battery pack into something right I think so oh yeah oh yeah yeah that's no problem that's no problem we've got a solution the solution is the cable supposed to go up like this uh yeah that's where the cable
goes so it goes like they're trying to get it around your ear I guess it doesn't actually go around my ear yeah it I don't have that problem but that's interesting feedback yeah it like touches right at the top the bigger issue for me and a lot of this is is just going to be stuff that I'm going to talk about in the review uh all right you should be able to turn it on now it's it's charging now okay wow this whole everything on the forehead thing is not great the bigger issue for
me is that on both straps the attachment mechanism here I'm just going to go to Linus cam here the attachment mechanism is an ovular shape you can see that it's an oval um and what that means is that there's absolutely zero play whatsoever so if you're the kind of person who goes oh yeah you know I really prefer to wear a a back ponytail instead of a nape ponytail or a high ponytail I would really like to adjust this to sit you know more this way or more this no now you get to not do that so if you look at
the way that Luke's wearing it right now Luke can you turn to the side a little bit if he was like oh I would really strongly prefer you know to have this kind of more up here the answer is no apple says no speaking of Apple saying no it won't turn on still yeah I mean it's definitely charging uh here can can I borrow it for a sec maybe this is just user error or instructional error could also be  convenient all right you want to stall for me uh sure it's run interference uh
yeah the whole forehead thing I saw him take it off once and I saw a very pronounced red mark along his forehead and then slightly along the sides and I was a little bit surprised by that and now I am no longer surprised at all uh for me again it's not scaned for my face so it's probably not already read on you yeah I'm not surprised um it's not scanned for my face at all this is probably not useful information like straight up but no weight at all was distributed anywhere
other than just my forehead and all the weight for the device is in the front so the entire weight of the device was just sitting right there where the other strap I could I could try that the bigger issue for me is that my choices so the reason you probably saw it so red on my forehead was cuz I had I was wearing it really I was wearing it really tight and the reason for that is if I wear it at a reasonable tightness um it just mashes the bridge of my nose so this is actually the point where
it's most uncomfortable so you were cranking onto your forehead to save your nose this is not turning on for me either the light is red it's usually green so I guess it um needs a minimum charge yeah maybe it needs a minimum charge level which I find a little bit have you spent time with this should we swap straps I have spent time with that um like I was saying earlier it basically takes the it takes the load off of here and puts it here and on my nose and it also just kind of feels like
it's going to come flying forward on me because I would wear it further back I would wear it more like back here instead of like like here and here instead of right here and right here yeah uh it's like it's not deep enough yeah this band seems yeah I'm not I'm not surprised that's the one they put in all the promo footage that seems kind of a little lame maybe um well this is not working this is little anticlimactic yeah this was supposed to be our first topic of the week I guess we're going to have to
Pivot to another topic this is embarassing we come back to it sure we'll come back to we'll let it charge for a bit yeah all right good luck buddy want to pick one try the other button people are saying no I tried it yeah okay uh sure okay apparently there is a Google doc of uh people reacting to you shaving and we're supposed to react to that really yes oh I didn't know about this okay shave memes there's a segment if you scroll down there's a section called segment okay reactionist to Linus's new
face all right uh I guess we'll just uh screen share for this okay uh I'll go full screen sure uh few slideshow button there we go okay I saw this that skipped way in that's the seventh slide what oh well okay well there you happy yes all right initial reactions classic so baddy no um okay now that's F that's felt what I don't understand the Opera one considering he has a beard Opera GX not the uh okay I uh we're covering up the caption okay oh Mr Mr besser's on it  case all right we good yeah oh wow Dan
so you're just going to move it around on the Fly okay y glad to see her back at ncx love it by the way this piece see turned out amazing is it still having problems nope no it's running perfect now uh I think it ended up just being a motherboard issue or like PCI ER Riser plug unplug it's fine now yeah it's 100% Rock Solid now that's awesome Run's cool uh yeah it's amazing there's the my favorite one I've [Laughter] seen that's valid that's a good question but you shaving brought the world
together okay I saw this yeah on the community post on YouTube and I thought I just thought I was like oh this must be a new meme format that's popping off right now it's actually an extremely old meme format that is only partially related oh interesting yeah cuz I was going to send this to the social team I was like okay yeah we should probably find something to like piggyback on top of this and then I forgot and that's good because then I would have looked like a yeah at as a citizen of basically anything
thing we this is amazing want the thing  [Laughter] yeah oh man okay very good that's actually pry that's actually pretty good nice oh no okay uh I really don't think I'm going to go blonde again why I what do it what what complete the look why are you why are you being so aggressive right now you you dyeing your hair blonde and wearing CED polo shirts would be that'd be amazing a wild throwback no we could get a really old camera and then do an LTT hold on what is this
clip we can't hear it is there sound on this it looks like there here you go they should be able to hear that give me one second okay thank you for that all right again Alex wolski says my girlfriend says you look like a daddy with that beard except I don't have a girlfriend   okay all right thank you again for for that I completely forgot about that but that's pretty funny wow future remains unclear I mean unless you have Vision hey I doubt I'll be able to take anything he says seriously go come on
I'm still a serious person oh come on that's pretty funny okay all right thank you for that this must have been the social team okay that's pretty funny let's see if the Apple vision Pro is working there's an accelerometer in the battery bank and it's supposed to yeah supposed to light up when you when you move it but it's not doing it right now is this thing broken that seems like a more expensive solution to the just like press the button to check method yeah also I mean did I mention this
battery bank is just useless unless you happen to want to power Vision Pro because just Apple things isn't it also like not that big uh I don't know um Apple Vision Pro it's uh 3166 milliamp hours yeah like wait what uh it's it's over under provision it's whatever the provisioning is where there's more capacity in here than what they display by about 20% I think it was even and I think the idea there is that they really don't want this thing to just be used every day be charged multiple times a
day be kept out a full charge and then have people have it just like dying in a year no they would like it to take at least a few years because that's how apple rolls but then they'll have something better to sell you it's not 5vt 12 volts yeah it's a super random random voltage um like it's something they absolutely could have done with PD 13 volts 13 it's one of those things where it's like I'm sure there's some reason that it runs at 13 volts um but I'm also sure that they could have found
a way to make it not run at 133 volts and run at like a standard USB PD voltage as well soor is it working now or I I don't know I'm checking okay um keep running interference okay sure yeah yeah yeah uh yes it's working okay never mind okay here we go all right run no interference all right Luke will be experiencing the Apple Vision Pro for oh yeah sorry sorry sorry dragging the battery back ground is already annoying do you kind of get used to it I  I'm so over this thing oh I can't wait
until I'm finished my review and I can just put it back in the box or like give it to horse to cover on macad dress or something wow I I'm I'm over it oh my goodness uh there are things that I love about it and I and I mean that with a capital l love but there are things about it that uh just make it the kind of thing that I love the idea of and I don't need to have on my face like one thing to explain my problem and again I want to say it again this one is not face scanned for me to make it so that the
face shield thing is actually touching my face I can make that happen by pulling it completely off and getting a like I can see lonus right now through the device like it that's weird are you sure that's clicked on properly it's magnetic oh oh yeah there you go that's why I'm taking it off to make it touch my face so so the problem you have is the same one I have then like okay without the headband on could you make the whole thing go against your face by changing the angle almost certainly yeah
absolutely this right here is a is actually a like a oh wow yeah I need to have the headband on like the upper crown of my head that's really okay so are you good now then yeah that's way better oh okay cool it just has to be like way up here I can't move it enough for it to be comfortable because it doesn't rotate it's not it's not swivel I Ely this this fixed pretty much everything it's very uncomfortable on the back of my head I don't like it being up here it feels like it's going
to slip off yep um but it's now resting on my face like way better have the exact same problem with this one it feels like it's going to come off at any moment yeah I don't but it's more comfortable than that bend for me oh yeah this like this is immeasurably better okay so uh is it prompting you for a pin or anything it wants me to press this button to align okay yeah yeah hold it yep press and hold motorized motorized uh ipd adjustment pretty cool okay wow that's pretty good
whoa what the heck is it actually right there how's that pass through wow that's weird pretty good huh that is actually really good can you toss me something yeah absolutely here I'll uh I'll toss you o I'll toss you a prototype LTT sock nice yeah that was very easy yeah yeah no problem on the short circuit um dbrand bet me that I couldn't Dodge all the things that Belle threw at me so if I was able to dodge them all they said they'd pay double for the sponsorship did you dodge them all and if I wasn't
able to Dodge I got nothing oh so obviously I took that bet because I was extremely confident that I could Dodge anything Belle could throw I mean if you played softball with him no he's is actually pretty good but uh yes I successfully dodged everything so I'm pretty sure dbrand had to pay double there's interesting stuff like right here this visually is way closer to me than it actually is it's that's that's kind of odd but most things once it gets far enough away it's
pretty good the 3D mapping is I would say an extremely extremely strong point yeah it's it's very good there's just like normally you're not going to have an object statically that close to your face so like it's it's fine I can't read text on the laptop but I can very easily read all the keys yep um and if you on the on the stream deck perfectly fine I mean do you want it do you want it oh shoot do I have I have the pin thing up and I uh yeah yeah you can you can uh enter it Center it over
there so use the crown which is on the right yeah yeah Center it looking at the wall so that you're just like mashing off screen and then just obfuscate what you're doing somehow is the PIN over there now yeah yeah it should be okay so oh oh are you using just your gaze tracking and and um yeah oh yeah so just just go like this in front of it in front yeah just in front of it beneath it just kind of anywhere yeah you're way off you're way off screen now and remember they can't see what you're
looking at anyway so it doesn't matter so your your fingers can be anywhere they can be close it doesn't matter if the people can see your fingers is that registering he got oh wow that was weird to get used to Apple Vision Pro guys all it costs is uh okay I'm in he's in he's in The Matrix uh okay maybe CER looks fantastic maybe Center it over here so we can see you wow nice okay that's cool and that looks insanely good right that's wild see any screen door effect no it's
there's some I don't know if it's the the the eyelash grease or because it's not fit my for my face there's a there's little imperfections here or there um but especially oh I'm like doing things and it's reacting to it that's pretty funny oh I got to stop I want to look at stuff and I got to just move my eyes yeah it's pretty cool come on there we go wow this is very cool I understand why people are reacting to this so heavily cuz this is actually quite novel this is more novel than I
expected yep having used pass through before and stuff like this before this is much more novel than I expected do you have any of the photos p iic photos uh if you just go to photos and videos yeah I'm sure there's some stuff in there like there's a there's a a 3D video that I recorded of just walking around this this thing where they they put the screen up looks incredibly good I I I don't know if it's just because of the screen door or because of something else that they're doing but it
just looks fantastic y the lenses are incredible they're pancake lenses so they're they're super low profile but they have so much less internal reflection compared to the big screen beyond that I just cannot fathom how they are this far ahead of what others are doing at this stage that's pretty sweet I can put it behind the wall yep and then if you glance toward the bottom right or bottom left corner then you can grab that and you can resize the window once you've positioned it where you like it ah yeah
yeah SP he's spatial he's spatially Computing folks I am spatially Computing and like I've seen videos people doing this but it's actually way different when you're actually just doing yourself interesting you kind of have to trust it to work for a while there I was like trying to like scope it out if you just look at the thing and do it it seems to happen if you try to finesse it it doesn't happen as well I don't know that's not a great way of saying that no that's fine I that's fine I get 
Impressions ignore the the Comfort yeah how what is what is my what is my what am what what is the thing that I'm rating display it display is extremely good interaction display has got to be for everything that I've experienced the display is a 10 it's pretty incredible guys the interaction is extremely good especially considering I'm not holding something that's doing that um I'm still having some problems with it like detecting where I'm looking now I didn't put it in guest mode for you I'm sorry I
probably should have say that's probably because of it not being scanned for my face I didn't really care about setting up the ipd thing properly it's not in guest mode that I didn't even know existed Etc it's probably those things more than anything because I've watched people use it and they haven't had these types of problems so I'm not actually worried about that um and when it does work it feels like insanely good and I don't really see anyone having problems so I think it's probably just a a
settings thing um so honestly the interact ability that I've done so far is probably also like like a 10 do you want to see dinosaurs yeah so just click the crown and go to the go to the dinosaur experience yeah I think it's on the second homepage um so just just pinch in front of you and swipe to the side to get no you got to pinch so a pinch is like a touch okay there you go yeah yeah and then okay encounter dinosaurs Yep this takes a little while so I'm going to I'm going to do a topic real quick while
Luke sits here and um experiences dinosaurs I guess right now I'm just experiencing the room so with music good for him oh it's over there can I move it I don't know can you no cool so I'm just going to stare at you the whole time wow which uh with my own eyes through the Vision Pro definitely a little creepy is it weird yeah um it's not very good so that's part of it and then the other part is  swed oh no this is hilarious cuz the word and on my side the words encounter
dinosaurs is just behind Linus's head yeah but because it's behind your head the top of your head is like translucent so I can still read the word yeah so I have it set to um recognize when other people are around and create a little translucent window and whatever it is you're doing kind of like rubbing a rubbing a french fry on a piece of paper you know like make it makes a little kind of kind of Clear Window where you can see other people there's now a butterfly flying around your head I feel
like in like you know that uh depiction in old movies of someone who just got like a concussion and you just like start seeing weird things like that feels like what's happening right now all right cool um oh wow okay okay are we am I even going to try and do a topic or are you just going to you can go for it are you just going to do stuff okay okay we've got a quick jobs announcement uh we're looking for a procurement coordinator UH responsibilities include fostering positive relationships
streamlining procurement processes uh tracking product releases and collaborating with the content creation team on trending Tech uh it's linusmediagroup tocom jobs head over there if that sounds like you or anyone you know you can always uh direct someone else there see the little dinosaur now is a c cute little dinosaur he's squeaking all right you enjoy that little dinosaur Luke oh one thing I didn't even think about is yeah audio quality seems okay we're hiring some positions
right now there they are see you later it lacks base the speakers are not amazing yeah  around the spatial mapping yeah is I'm I'm noticing that as the dinosaurs sniffing your head mindblowing yeah it's   all right uh I guess I will also talk about how oh we've added some new stuff on LTT store do you want to talk about what you're experiencing at all or should I just keep going uh no I think you're good keep going all right cool um we are launching our black polo shirt yep that's right it's a black
polo shirt it's part of our 9 to5 collection smart Fabrics easy fits good looks uh it's super soft and breathable with snaps rather than buttons on the collar so convenient great for work or play 96% cotton 4% elastine and we've got a couple of new graphic T's that's right we are finally launching some new graphic T's uh planetaries in oh this isn't planetary uh Intergalactic was inspired by our digital Journeys into other galaxies through AR and VR uh starting with the AR video that Lloyd
did with Mac address and then planetary was inspired by putting Tech internals like hard drives and Chi Chargers out into the Galaxy so you can check these out at LTT store.com both were inspired by kind of bitpixel art styles and uh speaking of Intergalactic and traveling into other galaxies Luke you're in the same galaxy same Planet Galactic planetary very far back in time you know a black polo is perfect time for you to dye your hair thank you for that that's um really helpful yeah this is crazy I can
understand why you're probably tired of it but it's crazy it's very cool I don't  like how long ago was that I was at Oculus forever ago I think 2016 2017 around there and I had a conversation with someone where I I I bet 10 years was the time frame it was going to be until we had like actual real Mass adoption of VR right um and this is pretty close this is definitely I think not it but I think this is a huge amount of the way there I think we need a better better weight distribution better strap situation
maybe the screen quality is fantastic the audio quality seems good enough um the spatial audio stuff is wild how you control it seems is very smart I don't know it's good this wouldn't be a normal place you would want to run your cable um yeah I don't mind that I just hit it with my hand because I just wouldn't have it ran like this ever so that's fine yeah it's it's funny that Apple was the one to divorce us from headphone cables and now they've brought back a far thicker I do
far more obnoxious far less sort of readjustable and manageable cable but that part I find interesting the fact that there's no routing along the band or anything that you could optionally run it through um we're going to get thirdparty headbands for this and they're going to be infinitely better than the garbage that Apple sh point because these are detachable so someone could actually easily make their own that might solve a lot of my problems with it yep yep almost certainly I think
if it was scanned for my face and thus fit better I would be much more happy with it um unfortunately I don't think  so I've been I've been dailying a Macbook ever since I started my review of The Vision Pro which uh admittedly has contributed to some of my impatience with it there's definitely still things that I find very frustrating about Mac OS U to be clear there's things I find very frustrating about Windows things I find very frustrating about Linux I I but there's there's things I find very
frustrating about Mac OS um like unless you go completely full screen on your app how little of your actual screen you get to use between the menu at the top and then the dock at the bottom like okay sure that's that's great just I'll just use this part of my screen while I'm browsing the internet um I'm not really a I'm not really a full screen I'm not really a full screen app guy but uh let me let me go ahead and see if I can get this signed in and then you'll be able to use the MacBook
with the Vision Pro and we can kind of get your impression of that have you done the IMAX thing sorry IMAX yeah um there's an IMAX app with a 46 minute long free video of a beautiful planet in collaboration with NASA uh I just installed that oh yeah I installed that last night I was having trouble getting access to the app store because I am Canadian yeah yes so even if you get your hands on a Vision Pro you will need to have a US register Apple ID and then especially difficult if you want to
actually buy anything or subscribe to anything on the App Store you will need a US based credit card not a US dollar credit card oh that's always so frustrating the billing address must be in the United States so that was pretty frustrating when I figured that out uh this is going to take me a minute because I need to log out of the account that I am in now and then I need to log into a different account and that's going to be that's going to be a second so another addition that I would add to
my obviously not enough time spent with it oh I'm in a theater I didn't even realize that oh you can adjust the immersion uh in your environment by turning the crown which    oh neat huh that is pretty neat uh so yeah something that I would say is this is good enough that I would want one I will not get one because it's "$3,500 oh I see uh I was I was I yeah" you you had me for a second there I I I thought you I said want one not we'll get one um yeah I thought you were
legitimately like considering one all of a sudden there no but this is novel enough that like this is very cool this feels like a leap um this is pretty sweet are you in the IMAX experience right now yes if you're doing something and it's requesting you to close it obviously you can close it nope no I am not doing anything I'm trying to figure out how to sign out and I finally figured it out this feels like something that existed and this is an app that you can uh you know you can
just play like this is this is an IMAX Whatever video thing and you happen to be able to play it in this headset if this video was wow yeah I wasn't expecting to see my hands there they are uh if this video was all around me in a more panoramic scene I think it would be better I'm looking at a big box which is cool so that's going to be the case for a lot of things uh I have a couple I have a couple of iPad apps that are compatible like in compatibility mode but I definitely understanding why
developers don't necessarily want to didn't necessarily want to preemptively make things for a very questionable uh user base for a very yeah for a very questionable experience yeah yeah totally get that um that's one of the reasons why I think with the it seems like a lot of people are getting it reviews seem to be pretty positive Maybe if a bunch of users actually get this um and a version two comes out eventually and whatnot that might be the time I don't know unless you're into
specifically into early adoption of tech stuff uh I don't know if this is going to be a thing for you but if you are into early adoption of tech stuff this  cool sorry this is this is going to take me a little while still  apologies Dan run interference yeah merch message oh yeah yeah hit us with a merch message actually it's pretty much the perfect time for that anyway so excellent um let's see hey Dan and the others what's the story behind lonus cat tips where did it come from and what
happened to it oh it came from the idea that in the early days of of the company um I was thinking hey with how long it takes to shoot LTT which is just was unboxings at the time uh we could easily shoot the entire week's worth of content in a day so nothing would prevent us then from having five different channels Each of which we shoot all the content for in a day and one of the things that you know I'm I'm pretty passionate about is cats um oh shoot the while you do whatever
you're doing um the the whole mixed reality portion of this is awesome it like it knows that Linus is a thing that I might want to see right now so like if I look to my left I don't see this wall at all I see an IMAX theater I see all the different levels of it Etc even looking over there there's like the door to the IMAX theater the the front oh whatever the water ball I can't see that um the like guard rail in the front I see all that kind of stuff I look over towards lonus and I see exactly lonus in
the area around him I look here there's IMAX theater this is you could sit at home and interact with the people around you fully and properly while also engaging in media which is pretty fantastic oh my God what is is this um whatever this is there's like error messages are tiled over top of my whole  now uh syn failed okay I I can't deal with that right now I just need you to move I just need you to move and get out  way okay let's try uh let's try the other one send a new code come on come
on H this is not working maybe it's the other one okay I'm having a great time well that's good I'm really glad you are I'm really stressed out this is really engaging content guys I'm sure this is fantastic for you guys to watch it's great for me this is this is Luke watching a different show I still wouldn't want to spend 3500 bucks on it um and I don't know how much how how required it is it feels like being the Apple ecosystem it would be quite required um I don't I genuinely have no
knowledge of how required it is to have a Macbook but I don't have one of those either so this would end up being a very very expensive overall purchase um which I will not do because I am too cheap but I am definitely starting to understand why people would and some of the people that I know personally that have bought one I I get it it's cool it's very cool yeah but I mean you're you're just kind of like looking at stuff like I don't know what's wrong with a what's wrong with a
phone and and like a cardboard box if you're just going to watch like a movie this is cooler than a phone and a cardboard box yeah but like how much money is that worth like how old that's why I would bu how how much how much content uh is going to be created novel uh early adopter Tech experience you you're you're paying a massive tax is the dollar value matching what you're getting for a lot of people probably not but it is very cool and and the screen is good I think that's scen fantastic
that is a huge part of it I keep kind of slipping into like not even really realizing that this is what I'm doing because the video that I'm watching is fantastic um and like I look over at lonus and he's he's not there at all like it it completely removes him and then if I look directly at him he's there and it's very clear good I'm not it's not fuzzy I'm not seeing any screen door on it's it's very very good so I'm I'm like very very much immersed in this video that's in front of me but I don't
feel like I have like exited the room if that makes sense my ears are completely uncovered so while I can hear the the thing it's also very easy to hear you guys I'm not wearing my headphones you can still hear me yeah yeah yeah normally these make it easier to hear you especially um but despite there being audio blasted directly at my ears by the headset I can still hear you no problem I can still hear no problem closed in as like a traditional headset yeah yeah I I I that's nice that part is
really really cool um and pretty unique I've dealt with pass through before this is not the same thing not only because it's really fast like when lers threw me that sock it was second nature to catch it it wasn't difficult it wasn't it didn't feel more difficult than normal um but also just it's it's very smart like lonus walking away it was like yeah you might want to see this person walking in front of you so lonus was rendered in in front of the iMac screen as he walked away um but usually like
the the table is usually full deleted this mic right now because I'm in the IMAX view is usually being full deleted if I look right at it it shows up um but generally it's not there this is just it's very cool whatever they developed to uh intelligently detect what I would want to see mhm and decide when to show it and when not to show it is extremely good that is like very impressively good all right I've got a merch message for you to stall for time while Dan fixes something sure uh Stephen asks yo dll
the hardest choice of my childhood was who to sacrifice at the end of Fable 2 what was the toughest video game  H mine's going to be stupid so I'm going to go ahead and uh let you go first just in case I'm not even I'm not even just like losing myself in uh in the IMAX thing I'm trying to think um H I can do mine first if you need time sure for me it was my first playthrough of Final Fantasy Tactics I hadn't really understood by this stage in the game that like Perma death was a thing oh and I I was a kid
and I I played through a little bit more of the game thinking there's some there's got to be some get back yeah or something and I like get them back or something so you know how wait have you played Final Fantasy Tactics uh no but I believe it works functionally in in the perade death sense the same as XCOM I believe sure yeah yeah so um really where I was going with that was that each stage each level of the game is extremely timec consuming okay you you you go and you like do things in between
each stage you visit different you know locations and you micromanage your stupid equipment and all of your abilities and then you go and you do a fight and you might or might not win and then you do the whole thing again and you try again and like it's very boy is it ever timec consuming so when you've made it a few more stages in and you realize oh no and it it wasn't like it wasn't an important character because the important characters when they but it was it was not a random
either and I had gotten kind of attached and I was like oh my goodness they are dead forever um so for me it was less a decision of like who to sacrifice or who to not sacrifice and more a decision of do I want to invest all of this time into restoring a really long time ago like probably five plus hours of gameplay time ago save so that I can bring this person back to I did it I went back and got them I was like like I can't do this yeah there's there's a couple like I can think in I
think it's Mass Effect 2 I think there's a there's a part of the game where you have to decide basically I think one person has to stay back to like do something and the rest of the people can escape and you have to pick which person is going to stay back uh and the person who stays back definitely dies and you're you know that's going to be the result decisions like that uh I feel like a hello Dan you just showed up in the middle of the  um um but yeah the decisions like that I
can find difficult but I think the hardest one is going to be related to yours I'm pretty sure it was Fallout 3 uh my my dog died oh no and Fallout 3 was not as friendly with auto saves as some games are and I had been doing a lot of open world exploration and I had to lose like basically a day of gameplay um but you did it didn't you and the decision ended up basically being like I'm just going to quit for now because I don't think I can redo all of that this second but I'm getting my dog
back so I'm going just close the game and not save it so that I can like commit this decision and then I'm going to go move on and do something else for a while and then eventually I did go back to it um but yeah I obviously had to get my dog back that was required obviously yeah okay are you ready to rumble another interesting thing just came up oh all right fine so you're just not going to do the thing that I've spent this entire no I I I'm I'm ready and I will do it but I I want to this is
part of it actually half the show I Got a notification saying that a device was added oh yeah you better believe it it brought me out of the immersive experience and was like yo you should probably deal with this really quick and then the second I dealt with it it was like all right we're back that's pretty cool yeah all right um so here's a Macbook okay it's probably been a while uh yeah long time um I don't know where okay so basically what how do I close the thing that I'm in uh oh you can press the
crown I actually don't like how much I end up interacting with the crown uh it's not a ton but but the gesture navigation is so fluid and so I feel like there should be like a do this and it closes whatever you're in or something so much more natural that really does feel like and and you know what I I've been experiencing it pretty raw so far so in between me getting all of my own Impressions and writing the review I'm going to go Google a bunch of things so I'm going to Google every
complaint that I had and I'm going to I'm going to learn a bunch more I'm going to go oh yeah that's so much better that would have helped so much so I haven't done that yet but figuring out how to get rid of a full screen experience is something that um I need to do or it needs to be better because so far the crown is the the quickest easiest way to get out of it that I found so on that Mac you should see a little connect button that just floats above it yep all right so you just got
to look at it and pinch whoa I did it you are now screen projecting you can look down to the bottom Edge and there's a bar just pinch and you can move your screen projection resizing to wherever you want oh no not the bottom corner bottom Edge yeah there you go there we go I moved it I want to move it it's super cool and unless it's more than one display it's not good enough not good enough Yep this is this feels like another one of those like the V2 of this is going to be insane type of
things where like yeah I literally immediately already want another screen just like and and and I know some of this will be able to be solved with apps cuz as far as my understanding goes you can have this connected laptop screen and also other apps yes so like my if I'm in this ecosystem I guess Apple music or whatever could be up on the side or you could have the Safari browser running on the Vision Pro interesting if you just needed a web browser oh that's pretty help yeah I
don't think that completely solves the multiple monitor thing but that helps it a lot but your trackpad can go between those windows that's pretty big the projected Mac one and the browser one oh so that's a whole thing wow that's pretty good if if you can have Safari running on this not taking up the screen that honestly that takes care of probably 90% of wanting a second monitor for me not 100% I still want another screen at least one and there's a lot of little quality of life
things that obviously need to improve and are going to be improved like if you stop if if you pull it off for 1 second and put it back on no no don't don't do it it's a big waste of time time to reauthenticate which it can do with your eyes you don't actually have to enter a pin once you've done that good though but sort of like if you're just like scratch scratch and put it back time to re authenticate and then time to reset up all your stupid windows it can't it can't authenticate
through Iris scan no no it can okay no that's not the problem the problem is whatever workspace you had set up that's pretty annoying time to put it all back yeah no they'll fix that I'm sure they're going to fix that it would be nice if there was like a a a a modes or scenarios thing or something so you could be like this is my like lounging at home scenario so I want it to put my windows in these different places and stuff cuz needing to individually like all the time could be pretty annoying
but this is the the screen on this is like yeah just insane it's so good yeah um so yeah and and I I did not find like if you try to watch video you can really see it struggle a little bit like it's definitely Wireless and if there was a wired mode that would probably be smoother uh in Apple's Infinite Wisdom they have not implemented that functionality so you can get a developer strap that I believe can use a wire but no actually no if I recall correctly I don't think it can I think people are
still kind of figuring out exactly what that thing is but it's USB 2 only H it's like $300 it's either $200 or $300 and it's also required to reset your password like it's a whole thing just it's just Apple things very cool um anyway this is sweet yeah very cool it's pretty cool yeah the fact that it has a cable though and has absolutely no way to just plug in to a computer and transfer files off of it is deranged though yeah that one blows me away I was trying cuz I have more things
you want me to do no I think I think that's pretty cool I mean you've had you I think you've had a lot of the experience at this point I um I I have a lot of video yeah you look awful I have a lot of video and photos on this that I was that I need to get off in order to do the review like I've got a lot of screen recordings and stuff and I was trying to figure out what's a fast way that I can do that cuz you know oh yeah is there a is there a this to USBC or something or is there
like a you know if I pull this off is there is there USBC ports so no no it doesn't it's a computer with an M2 Chip which tells you that it definitely has a usb3 controller four that doesn't have a port because Apple figured well no you'll just do everything wirelessly um what if I don't want to what if I don't want to use airdrop yeah well then I guess you better buy more Apple products it's it's typical you got to be in the app tyal Apple I talked about this in the short circuit but you obviously haven't
watched it um because you told me you haven't watched it that's why it's obvious um I talked about this in the short circuit but probably the  Apple I love a lot of the things that they do they obviously innovate but they are so blatantly brazenly hostile towards their own users that I just I don't really understand why they put up with it and the point that I made was this look at what Apple includes on the  it it's a nice cover yeah yeah I mean that's it's a pretty nice cover isn't it yeah so at $34.99 or
36.99 or 3899 that's included that's great because it means that oh God yeah 3500 bucks that's USD isn't it yeah this is a "$5,000 Canadian device okay but like" that's great right because it means if you you know this is not this is not something that fits in your pocket right this is something you would have to actively carry around with with intent with purpose to use and given that the battery life is in the couple of hours to I think up to up to three or 4 hours range um I haven't sat in it long enough
to run out of battery so I I was going to rely on just like doing a benchmark or something to kind of figure that out um but it's but it's in that that fuse one hand of hours range if you are going any anywhere with it for any meaningful amount of time you will also be carrying a charger but it's great includes this because you would hate for this to get  yeah guess what's not included some type  lenses Apple doesn't do anything by accident why Luke why did they include
this cover but not this cover because if the front of the device got super scratched up and everything that's what other people other potential buyers are going to see that will bother other people more well what are you going to do what are you  lenses the new ones I guess well Apple sells a travel case oh that one will protect the inside lenses got it that makes sense so for everyone else we need to make sure the product looks its best and we will take care of that we will
make sure of that for you the person who actually bought it you just scared Dan sorry I'm not mad at you um for you the person who actually bought it Go yourself buy  is it is something that I don't understand how anyone cannot see it's so transparent in their product design in their  and how do you tolerate it how do you accept it um wow I don't have my airpods on me that's actually very unusual I um there's a couple of fulling comments  pros think about how they look in your ears what color are
they white yeah how how describe the white pearly white it's perfect sure it's pristine yeah what do they look like when you open it up to use them I don't have Pros okay well they have like they have white silicone things that go into your ear canal so tell me what color you think they are yeah those are going to get discolored real quick yelly yeah every time you the user go to look at the product that you paid $250 us for it  disgusting put in the ear looks great again the only reason as far as I can
tell that black airpods don't exist is because F you the user who paid for them the white I'm sorry but I actually thing in your ear looks very iconic like I cannot because Apple has absolutely done products in other colors they have the whole that whole red thing that they've done phones have come in various colors for a long time sure of course of course Apple has done Black Max before um they they they they absolutely are willing to make things in other colors I think the
white looks good the white looks great yeah for 3 days what if they had uh like the like black or any other color of the Silicon tip thing what if they did they don't would that make you happy though uh yeah pretty much okay yeah yeah yeah I I would settle for that yeah cool yeah but it's one of those things that users have complained about for years you know like the the charger on the bottom of the mouse and they just don't care um or positioning icons on the home screen the fact that they just so so
brazenly just so transparently give zero FS whatsoever it's just it's just it's bizarre and the fact that they they do not immediately get called out on this by absolutely everyone is baffling you have a protector thing the quest doesn't cost $3 3500 dollars that's fair and the quest Again Luke doesn't come with the cover for the part that Apple cares about it's not about you the person who actually paid for it it's about Apple's priorities I don't know man I'm not I've
decided at this point I've talked about it on W show I've talked about it in the short circuit I'm not going to really spend a lot of time on that in the review but it's just one of those things people ask why do you hate apple I don't hate Apple I like lots of their products what I hate is their attitude I hate how they just they are so openly hostile towards their users they are they are the they're and and the is this one of those situations though where it's like the
the open hostility that you don't like because I think there's a lot of stuff that other companies are doing in less communicative ways it's also it's also the hypocrisy just as or more evil it's also the hypocrisy oh there's no doubt in my mind lots of companies that are far more evil than Apple let's talk Nestle right like you don't have to go competing companies like which which one's the one that um that basically was like yeah we yeah people were murdered it was basically by us but it wasn't in
the United States it's outside of the jurisdiction like that was their defense they never even claimed that they didn't have people kill well let's not get this one wrong that's a yeah that's a good   uh I want to say it was some kind of um Beverage Company I thought it was a beverage company uh it looks like it was uh it looks like it was um it looks like it was Coca-Cola uh found an article from the guardian yeah and they they they uh try to push like that that isn't an admittance that we
actually did this that was just a way to get it thrown out of court but it's like yeah yeah right but like if you didn't do it maybe that would have been the better defense you know it might have been worth it just from a PR standpoint if you didn't do it to fight that case yeah that you didn't do it so sure I'm not going to say that Apple's the evilest company um but what I will say is that apple is the company that doesn't respect us enough to tell a believable lie and I just don't understand why we
tolerate that m just tell me that you're not going to ship a charger in the Box because you don't want to just tell me that you want the box to be smaller because the logistics cost at the volume that you're doing the number of iPhones that you're shipping every year just tell me that it's a huge savings don't tell me you're saving the Earth you're not saving the Earth you make decisions actively on every product cycle to destroy the Earth faster you go out of your way to make it so that your
products are less repairable so that they don't last as long as cost effectively so then just don't say you do that that's the other thing that just drives me absolutely up the wall so how openly hostile they are how hard their users ride them in spite of that and how just how how not believable at all the lie that they tell me is at least have a good story pretend give me something we can all kind of get on board with and go okay yeah sure maybe even if I don't believe
it 100% at least there's some grains of Truth here just say we didn't want to spend you know $13 on a power brick for every iPhone just say that and you can even you can even win that like the I want the box to be smaller thing you can even win that with the logistics side because you're like we're trying to spend you know less fuel mov or I mean this is a good one so with the with the charger one okay just just play play along a little bit if they had said okay we're not
including a charger this generation and dro the price by 20 bucks and then the next Generation just like put it back in you know at least at least give us some time to forget or something but they didn't they they took out the charger and they increased the price anyway like it did there was never a benefit yeah um there there's two comments in philppine that I want to talk about before I forget them um zero transform this is more something for you he said make sure to check out the Apple TV plus immersive
videos it's mind-blowing how well they did 3D 180 no weird distortions in the scale is Flawless sure check that out and then handyman uh has said about 47 times um you should try Quest three at $500 it offers much more albeit not that great display but at $500 it does a lot more than the Vision Pro it does a lot more depending on what you're trying to do if you play Fitness games yeah you buy one of these what are you an idiot yeah that's not what it's for whereas if you buy a quest three and
what you want is to watch immersive video in extremely high quality and be  Mac yeah right like it's it's it's horses for courses that feels like from my experience so far the correct take uh uh what was that thing that saying no nobody's wearing a quest 3 in public oh the thing uh Apple TV plus immersive video or something I I scrolled away from the I've got that on my list of experiences that I've also got like someone apparently got um steam link working and so like there's a handful of things that
are still on my list of stuff that I need to try but I'm I'm definitely done with it I'm especially done interacting with other people with this thing on like yeah the pass through is great and you've got the the eyes and you know whatever but you know Apple has stated that their vision for this product was that it wouldn't isolate you and that's just that's a complete swing and a miss it is utterly isolating um conducting an in-person meeting with somebody is just not cool with this thing you can you
absolutely can but it serves no purpose for the interaction with other people for one thing I feel like that's almost like you're you're taking it too far like are they suggesting conducting an inperson meeting they can't do anything that I'm doing they can't see anything that I'm seeing and it has no benefit for me because unless I have some kind of supplemental material that for whatever reason nobody else needs to see like I I might as well just look at what everyone
else is looking at I I want to address this really quick uh handyman is I think very upset about someone like The Vision Pro I I might be projecting I'm not sure but he said productivity is not good though uh I don't think you can say that um because if someone's like I'm going to measure my productivity uh at my desk using my laptop versus at my desk using my laptop with my Vision Pro like yeah no who cares the thing that people are talking about is when you're if if you're out
and about if you're on a train if you're on a plane if you're in an automobile um and you're able to you're able to make the the screen bigger and then still use your your keyboard and trackpad I can absolutely see this being a benefit for people in scenarios there's like no way that it isn't that would actually be mind-blowingly ridiculous in my opinion if it wasn't in some scenarios but is it a productivity Boon when you're sitting at your desk yeah probably not and it all depends on what
your desk setup looks like sure at my desk I have a gigantic monitor already and you know what so back to my point where like I I've conducted a couple of script reviews using the Vision Pro which you remember how script review works we pull up the script um I drive but we have a lot of conversations about you know how can we tweak this to make this the best script that we possibly can well did you notice that your MacBook goes black yeah when you this is what I'm though where like it it feels
like an inappropriate scenario like I just wouldn't use it then you can't duplicate it yeah that's ridiculous you actually can't I we've talked about this before you you should it should absolutely default and I think it should default every time time yes uh to screen completely blanked out I don't even think there should be a setting to change the default but you should be able to override it in the moment and be like no I want to have both of them showing so you know how we did script
view I had my computer in front of me and I was using my keyboard the do open on another and then I had a teams call and I was sharing the window with someone sitting next to me on their laptop so we were essentially conducting a virtual meeting in person yeah you can a battery bank or some kind or you can just plug it into your laptop yeah I I feel like people are are making up shortcomings because it's really expensive but you have to understand that it being really
expensive is enough of a shortcoming and you have to understand that it being really expensive is a feature for certain people also that yeah it is an attention getter far more than probably any piece of technology that I have touched in the last 10 years like the folding phone that was that's a convers starter huge conversation starter the second you walk up and unfold your phone and start doing something people are like w less now but especially in the first couple of years
it was just something that people hadn't seen um and I think it was also aided by the fact that it wasn't Apple so nobody had even seen Samsung's marketing for it they just had no idea this was a thing that existed um this immediate attention get it you go anywhere you do anything with it people are going to hate it people are going to love it people are going to have feelings about it 100% And for a lot of people the fact that it's exclusive the fact that it's expensive that's a good thing lot people
like that that makes them stand out even more look at luxury goods it's what Apple's been trying to be luxury luxury goods this whole time right so like just look at the luxury goods space the entire thing about it is exclusivity I have it you don't therefore I am cool it's not about how many the company will sell it's about how few of them people can afford to buy and then like apple you you know because they're actually a technology company a consumer electronics company not a luxury goods
company they they always get kind of torn right because they they they create these these things but then they are subject to the same pressures as the rest of the consumer electronics Industry so the pricing does have to make its way into you know somewhat affordable consumer land at some point but this one's not there this is very much a statement piece I mean it's the first new category they've actually introduced under Tim Cook's leadership I think like has he airpods I'd say
airpods are a Tim Cook era Smash Hit um the watch is doing okay the watch is doing pretty solid feels like it's doing better than the other watch but I don't think either of those are as big no as big of a swing as this this a big deal "he said what there's 5,000 patents to" bring this thing over the line or something like that and this is this is something I've ended up getting into it with a couple people in the comments already is people saying it's overpriced it's not overpriced do you have any idea
how much this thing cost to develop what does overpriced mean this this is this is the same this is the exact same problem with the whole streaming debate that we've had uh over the last little bit where streaming debate yeah because everyone's like uh streaming like you should pay creators more and and companies should be super flush with money and it's like no they're all broke um like twitch doesn't make any money uh what was what was what was even the one Microsoft had I don't
even remember anymore a mixer mixer like died hard cuz they were like yeah we brought in a bunch of big streamers people still didn't care and it just cost us a bunch of money let's get rid of it um and meta just like has been deleting like billions have they not yeah trying to work on VR they're not making money they're not making money at all uh yeah I don't know it doesn't mean that it has to be like oh that knowing that automatically makes it worth it for you no that doesn't mean that at all but it
does mean that like yeah it might make sense that it's actually pretty expensive yeah I mean it's it's not bomb cost is not everything you have to include R&amp;D R&amp;D costs money yeah support costs money yeah marketing costs money paying developers to adopt their apps to this thing which might be something that happens I don't know maybe with some really major developers not with us and believe it or not you have to pay for the marketing that makes it so more other people will buy it so that they
can amortize the development costs over more units because at the end of the day the cost is all all of the costs it's it's it's all of them it can't just you can't just look at bomb cost it's not that simple and it never will be yeah but guess what there's good news if you don't like the price you can just not buy one yes absolutely and this is another thing that I was just going to get into and I've talked about this a lot on W show I'm going to bring it up again uh but you should criticize things
for the right reasons and not for the wrong reasons because when you criticize things for the wrong reasons it makes that thing look better not worse it's actually super important people screw this up all the time it's very easy to uh go after things that don't matter and then when you go after things that don't matter the people that are trying to defend it uh Will Ham on that and then you you're not winning the game basically look so criticize legitimate things about it and don't just try to
make stuff up I know math is hard when you're an idiot but look if you're a broke boy just say so it's the Pokemon I know I know oh man wow you're not a broke boy if you can't afford a Vision Pro uh most people shouldn't just be able to like magically "afford a Vision Pro $3,500 is a lot of" money especially American five grand that's roughly five grand right gets it which is which is nice I it probably also helps that this is not my product and I'm not defending it I'm telling you
guys I can't wait to stop using it yeah so this is $ 4720 Canadian I know like close to no one that just has that in like oh I could just go randomly SP what did you enter in the in the calculator 3500 USD to CAD oh well I mean don't you want any storage on it oh my goodness that's the 128 gig what really it comes with at $3500 yeah look at his face at $3500 it comes with 128 GB do you know how of storage I bought a I bought a one wait wait wait hold on people are saying 256 hold on
hold on hold on I bought a 2 terab m.2 drive like on Tuesday or Monday for $100 I think L 256 it's 256 I'm sorry that's still ridiculous that's still ridiculous that's a lot better I was stunned that 128 could even like exist yeah I'm sorry sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry 256 is still bad that is 256 gigs do you want to know how much another 256 gbes of storage will cost you did they bump you to like four grand no not quite okay it will cost you $200 yeah and another another 512 will cost
you another $200 so that's how you get to your 4K I was like there's got to be "a $4,000 device here there's a $4,000" device oh the old Apple ladder yep so we have a video coming soon where we built a PC Pro because the I everyone knows the the current Mac Pro is a meme it's a Mac Studio in a giant chassis for thousands of dollars more like it's  ridiculous so we did a video building a PC Pro to compete with it where we take the same budget and we just absolutely sh wreck it like it's it's not even
funny uh last time we did a PC Pro it was tough the Mac Pro came out ahead in some cases because it was a really powerful machine and like apple has some good soft you know blah blah blah right this time around the thing's a joke like you can build such an overpowered monster that it just has absolutely no chance whatsoever and one of the problems is that the storage costs so much Elijah and I did the math guess what costs more per per unit  Apple Storage apple nand  gold it isn't
close is gold the cheapest one gold is [Laughter] cheaper that's fantastic that's a that's a yikes uh so wait sorry so how how much is the lens protector the travel case thing so we grab a chunk of the gold controller that I didn't end up using cuz I needed an opening for wireless communication and we like weigh it next to an SSD that's like the same capacity and it's it's in the video I think we uh we played around with it a little bit like we uh 200 US um like the carrot of the gold that we
were using what didn't match something so we like we put a couple weights under the SSD to make our point but then we we we adjust we we account for it basically uh but they are they're they're similar or I shouldn't have said it wasn't close they're similar or uh or the gold is cheaper um what was I what was I going to say there was another thing real quick here uh and yeah the gold the Gold's a better investment um shoot I was about to say something ah I missed it sorry no you were G to say something
yeah I'm trying to Total together like if if you wanted to trick yours out cuz I mean you're you know you're spending 3500 us on it anyway oh that's right it's a couple hundred bucks so yeah someone someone I I haven't found this to corroborate but somebody said uh it so it's it's $38.99 to get the one tbte version yep "$3,900 baby compared to" $34.99 uh and then you throw on $499 Apple Care y so I mean you just spent four grand on a device you might as well protect it oh there's a
deductible by the way for accident damage on this one Apple Care is not Apple Care on this one and then and then you want to get your travel case cuz the best use case scenario as we've been saying isn't just sitting at your desk it's when you're out and about so you also need the travel case which is what 250 bucks USD don't forget that if you have any need any kind of corrective lenses you'll need to pay extra for the corrective lens insert so you could get "to 4,000 just for the headset itself you"
one terab with corrective lenses let's say you've got some corrective lenses and you go for one terab and it's 4 grand uh then it's $475 to honestly like properly set up your one tbte with corrective lenses Vision Pro because the travel case maybe there's going to be third party ones almost certainly there's going to be third party ones that you can get uh but you like should I don't know yeah maybe if Apple Care isn't as good as it normally is maybe oh does Apple Care all have deductibles oh has
that always been the case I don't think so I didn't think it used to when did that's hilarious I've never got Apple care because I haven't bought any expensive Apple devices um but people that are into Apple stuff all tell me that it's really good has that always been a thing oh for accidental damage there's always been a deductible okay all right that's good to know yeah I've personally damage that makes sense I've personally never bought Apple Care before but it's uh but it's cheaper so
only for accidental damage or loss okay yep that's good to know thank you very much guys I also want a a laptop to go with mine I don't have a Macbook oh yeah okay but that's a that's a dangerous argument and that's one that I actually I strongly object to I mean we talked about this Dan optimistically just trying to move the show along with his little signs we haven't even done merch messages yet D take that away take that we'll do sponsors later we did we did no no we
didn't we didn't explain them and stuff yeah we I was just stalling for time um so to bring up a previous controversy when I talked about the PS portal I had people saying well the price is so much because to even use it you need a PlayStation I don't think Sony ever positioned the PS portal as a device for people who don't already own a PlayStation and in much the same way I don't think apple is positioning this device as something for people who don't already have a Mac I don't think they are explicitly
saying unless you have a Mac you might as well not buy it but the fact that they have a facial scan that requires you to have a relatively recent iPhone  checkout I think they've made their point clearly enough if you don't have a Mac and you want to jump into this ecosystem you need corrective lenses you want the one ter version you're going to get the travel case and you're going to get apple care if you if if all these things line up uh you're you're a cool "$7,250 in the whole"
yeah that's one heck of a trip to the Apple Store and that's going to happen oh yeah 100% I guarantee it 100% I mean on a payment plan but make sure you get your Apple credit card yeah I I saw the numbers recently the the number of transactions going through on Apple's credit card are H they're apparently doing okay I think whatever bank they collaborated with wanted out of it or something I've been sort of only barely peripherally following it but interesting people have Apple credit
cards apparently so that's a [Laughter] thing oh did they dissolve the credit card okay there you go apparently it's dead um cool what Goldman Sachs wants out Goldman oh okay there you go okay so I I think they still have Apple pay though no they definitely still have Apple pay uh someone says no it's not dead I still have no yeah it's not dead there on the Vision Pro there's a thing Finance Apple card monthly payments yeah Goldman wants out though I guess I guess whatever deal
Apple negotiated with them is not doing it well for them and I think Goldman also wants to go back to being more uh like Investment Bank and un L like consumer business or something like that I don't know it was a while back got it um they're leaving retail banking entirely they just want to deal with rich people yeah fair enough all right I think this is the point in the show where we're supposed to explain merch messages and do a couple the way to interact with the show
is not to buy a Vision Pro we actually get none of that that goes all straight to Apple um if you get one though you should watch the show using it yeah yeah and then apparently you're a baller so you should probably buy some merch yeah so the way to interact with the show is through a merch message all you got to do is go to LTT store.com check out our new black 9 to5 Polo or a couple of our new graphic T's a screwdriver a backpack whatever it is you're into hey did I mention the backpack has lots of space
in the compartment of holding for your Apple Vision Pro as well as your MacBook and your iPad and all that it's actually like unironically kind of awesome for carrying around the Vision Pro and all the accessories that you need for it it's got pockets for everything we were way ahead of the curve on this one oh this is even better check this out Luke um here we go so with the with the Vision Pro our cargo pants our upcoming cargo pants have a perfect pocket for the battery
bank that's pretty sick anyway um what was I talking about right merch messages in the cart you will see a little box yes cart right checkout crap I don't know somewhere just go through the checkout in the cart you'll see a little box when we're live you can leave a merch message it'll go to our producer Dan there he is he will either reply to it forward to it forward it to someone who can help you or he will curate it for me and Luke to talk about on the show Dan do you want to show them how it
works couple curated ones yeah I got lots here let's do it yo dll the hardest choice of my childhood was who to sacrifice at the end we did oh I must have been out of the room I'm so sorry you got to you got to Archive them what else sorry I forgot I was really busy trying to trouble you something no I did oh yep we're good this is not how it normally works uh yo D I work for an MSP doing tier one and voice over IP I love coding and automation as a hobby but when I try to make some work related the
higher ups seem to uh kind of prefer the hard or long way around any suggestions oh I mean oh man I'm going to sound so jaded and cynical right now but like dude yeah man I one of the conversations that drove me out of NC was when I popped into the president and CEO's office who was not ter and it was a different different person I had three bosses there and what I've realized over the years is that in the interest of keeping them semi-anonymous I've always just said my boss at ncx
whenever I talk about any of them so I'll tell a story or someone will encounter an old story that I told about my boss at NC and like a super stupid thing they did they'll be like why' you hire him then okay multiple different people so this particular boss um did a lot of things right I did a lot of things like I'm about to tell you um I think my way of describing this to people at the time um when I was talking about how frustrated I was was um it felt like arguing with someone who was
using Moon logic um because we had an issue some new graphics card had launched uh I want to say it was 5770 or something like that I don't know whatever it doesn't matter some AMD graphics card launched and 5 570 no I I don't remember it doesn't matter the point is um that part number okay that or that string of digits happened to have an issue where it was extremely common in UPC codes for PCs and electronics um in particular some graphics cards especially XFX so when you searched for it you would
get one or two Real Results that happen to be XFX radio on cards that happened to also that happen to be in the UPC code as well as as in the model number and part number and then you'd get some other random graphics cards and then a bunch of other random stuff because the way that our search engine worked on nc.com it would not prioritize it would not prioritize product description this was so annoying or part number over UPC so annoying for a partial match yeah cuz it was only a
partial match of the UPC but it was a full match of the description and also a partial match but a more complete partial match of the part number right so I pop my head into the office and I was like hey we need to seriously I like if you want to return a search result for a UPC like by all means someone might have a barcode scanner at a at a replenishment station or something and they scan a UPC and they might expect a result um no problem but we need to stop returning results for partial
upcs and he like grabs something on his desk and go goes well what if I would want to buy one of these and I looked at this and I typed part of it and I pressed enter and I'm like why the would anyone do that no one on the planet I I I bet you that happened less than five times that one person probably just to prove a point did it at least once or twice and no one else ever did it again and he basically goes and I'm like right but no one does that and he's like well how do you know and I go because
that doesn't make any sense human nobody would ever do that yeah you're partial you know product name sure partial partial part number I mean God maybe maybe you would want to return a result for every EVGA GPU that has a lifetime warranty so you would do a search for asterisk d a you know which which was the suffix like I could come up with some conceivable reason someone might do that with a part number maybe with a up C are you kidding me absolutely not they're unique
identifiers for every product yeah and I was basically sent out of the office and told go put together a presentation go do research on how everyone else's search engines work and whether they do or do not return results a course they don't because it's stupid and I have to put together like a presentation for this I'm like this is utter waste of my time why do I why exactly do I work here that was that was one of the the big pivotal moments that and the other story that I tell the time
were like the two huge ones that I kind of went how do I how do I do this anymore I I can't be putting together a common sense presentation for people who  me so I guess what I'm trying to say is it never ends because when you start your own company and you have a whole bunch of people working for you if you know anything about leadership and empowerment you are going to empower people to do things and going to do it moonway anyway in spite of the fact that supposedly they work for you or whatever
and you're going to have to explain it and reach a consensus because if you just come in and be a dictator then well you're just a dick um so it never ends and you probably don't have any ters either no I I got lots of ters oh nice yeah we've got the potato PC coming oh yeah it's pretty funny okay so I'm so  I for until you said that I forgot this was even a merch message yeah hello L cool L and D as a cyber security professional I have seen people disregard security too much what has
been the worst you've seen so far also remember to audit sharing links in teams well I think uh I think when we uh you know had Justine and Wendell on the the Perpetual wow dock that's the worst thing ever that's that's such a security today what if you guys missed the pre-show you're you're telling a story that most people don't have context for so we we figured out that I Justine and level one Tex Wendell Justine from I Justine and Wendell from level one Tex um are shared on the Perpetual wow doc
uh and some people were like oh my God you have to fix that it's a security hole and I'm like it doesn't matter if they change something and then someone brought up a much more decent point which is like what if their account gets compromised and then someone could access this and I'm like yeah it still doesn't matter it's just it's just a w show Doc we can restore it to its previous state instantaneously and they're going to secretly find some tech news yeah it doesn't matter it should be
fine most egregious thing I don't know people take pictures of their keys and post on social media all the time even techie people it's crazy okay Devil's Advocate by the time someone's at your front door the key doesn't fcking matter uh it still totally does why no evidence  that yeah I mean I I I I feel like I feel like that's a really like CSI is real kind of answer because realistically every keyhole on Earth is so is completely scuffed anyway you're not going to be able to look at it and be like oh it
looks like somebody mine's in good State sure I home drunk you live in an apartment building though I mean come on like yeah I I think it I think it depends on the intent of did I detect some judgin so you're saying you don't come  that oh my goodness um no I I think I think it depends on the intent on the the person who's trying to get into your house sure um if they're attempting something violent like yeah it doesn't make a difference break the door down uh if they're attempting to steal all your
stuff yeah it probably doesn't make a difference but if they're trying uh something sneaky decky like then planting a Tracker or a microphone in your house camera or whatever else yeah okay but then you know let's come let's come back to if somebody wanted to do that badly enough what is actually probably easier social engineering or or like just just casually like Reverse Pick pocketing whatever that's called where they just like drop something in your purse or in your pocket I don't
know name it either like like or I mean realistically at in this day and age couldn't couldn't they just grab a drone and drop a microphone down your chimney like Honestly though seriously though there how do people have open chimneys I mean it's a thing okay it's a totally a thing all right you wouldn't even have to put it down the chimney I mean there's listening devices that you can get at freaking The Spy Store on Broadway that you could just aim at someone's house and basically hear anything anyone's
saying in there like it's just it does get pretty brutal I I think that the picture of the key is an active motivator so you're saying it's kind of like opening the door yes um you're going like oh here's something you could do you could 3D print this and break it in my house ha and I think people will do it because of that yeah but if they have a malicious intent I I think that will like genuinely give people malicious I don't know man it's it's less work to get a gun in many states
than it is to go 3D print a key if you don't know anything about for some people it's going to be less work to get a gun and if you do know a lot about 3D printing then you could just 3D print a gun like that's my point is I just I don't think that this barrier of this to acquire ammunition of this lock is I I don't think it's particularly meaningful yeah especially when you have Windows I I just like yeah if if you had a Mac on the other hand you'd be fine but everyone sad
Bell sad Bell um just covered in cables you can just just cut a key once you have the picture that's my whole point yeah that's what Luke is saying I'm just saying it doesn't really matter cuz if you wanted to get through someone's door like lockpicking kits are legal and practically free yeah yeah like I kind of want to learn how to  fun I have all the stuff yeah that doesn't surprise me I have a range of practice locks I I'm sure you do whatever pcks you'd want to use nothing nothing you're saying
nothing you're saying surprises me at all so yeah no problem whenever you want to you want to figure it out yep for sure uh uh Dan do you want to give us one more sure should come to our team building exercise that be fun yeah we did that you guys did lockpicking yeah we did so I buried the B I mean the held the shovel buried the shovel we do we do ours are ours are skills themed so we hang out in the workshop okay and people bring in different projects that they might have
or or things that they could teach each other and we just do that do those things so Dan was like painting something yeah I got a high-end airbrush for the first time and Sean and I were working on lockpicking and next time Sean wants to do something with Lego and I'm probably going to build one of tinan CO2 sensors and yeah I'll teach you how to solder properly that would be sweet that Beck I've done it before but I'm going to I'm almost certainly terrible sold yeah you're terrible you're worse
than me and I'm terrible yeah make you good one evening and go great yeah yeah that would be it would be nice to learn yes hello. D it was brought up in a pre-show but why does lmg utilize Microsoft's business ecosystem not Google's where's Apple in this market how would it be different I think I kind of wanted the end of this like how would Apple's bu I don't think yeah I don't think that we could have scripted this any better good good job Dan that was the perfect merch message to finish up
our conversation about Apple so first I guess Luke should go on his thing for anyone who wasn't on the pre-show talking about why it ex why exactly it is that we subscribe to three different business ecosystems and pay for all of that yeah so this was this was a long long rant that I went on in the pre- show so if you're subscribed to flow plane or uh there there's other roads to get it but I don't have to tell you um yeah you can just find it on Twitch wait no there's no VA on Twitch
right yeah get wrecked um but essentially the the short form is that Microsoft covers everything in the workspace more or less but it kind of has like B tier versions of all of it for the most part some of some of them are are the best I I will give them that but for a lot of it it's mostly like BC tier versions of it um I don't think teams is the best team communication app um I think slack leaves a lot to be desired but I think it's better than teams um I don't think one drive is the
best like company Drive app the SharePoint exist I know I think Google Drive is easier to use um I also think that the one drive like apps like the uh web versions of like Word and Excel and stuff like that are not as good as like Google Docs Google Sheets stuff like that Google collaboration has gotten really good in the last very very I can't find anything in my drive but once I find it men can I ever collaborate yeah yeah so like if you want the best collaborative word doc edit you want G
Suite um and it's probably going to cost you more in like annoyance dealing with Microsoft Word online whatever one drive stuff than it would be to have G Suite so then you just have G Suite but then our whole we have all three of them situation is we don't have slack for the whole company we just have slack for the developers uh and then teams is for the rest of the company because teams is is just getting the entire Microsoft Suite is like cheaper than getting slack basically so we have
we have Microsoft for the rest of it because we get teams and we also get you know local apps for like Word and Excel and stuff and there's people on the team that absolutely need the the power the massive Powerhouse that is local Excel um and there's some other good things in the Microsoft 365 business license um so we have that and then for developers we also have slack and the whole thing is just ridiculous and it's very annoying um if if Google could get could figure
it out and start making things that they don't abandon um and could actually make a business chat app which I I have no idea and i' I I even know people that work there and I haven't asked any of them I bet you they have their own internal system for communications and they just like don't share it with other people I bet you that's a thing they have so many internal tools it's insane I bet you they have a chat one and I wish they would just include it with Google workspace because Google Chat is not a
acceptable there's a reason why like basically no one uses it um cuz it's not acceptable ridiculous it's been so annoying the way they've been like kind of shoving it down my throat like anytime I want to share something on Android I click on Gmail like do you want to use no I don't want to use chat no you guys told me you kept you told me you were going to deprecate this like eight times yeah and so I switched off of it yeah we used Hangouts yes as a company we used Hangouts and it was like
kind of weird but it worked it well the best thing about it was that when you searched it searched everything yes it searched your drive your email and your chats and so once we switched off of it we kind of adapted to the inconvenience of having to search you know these various places and now there's no way that we'd go back to it because apparently they do use Google Chat says karate one yeah there's going to be some people but it's like they almost like the developers almost certainly would
use like slack or something right I haven't used Google chat in a long time but I strongly believe so yeah um I mean I mean who knows Google meet uh is like excellent Google meet is great just works I mean I don't know what version of it I'm using but it seems to be mostly good we we have switched to using teams for all of our meetings because the calendar invites were getting confusing for people and people wanted to use teams because they're saying that the transcription is better and stuff I
haven't tested them against each other I will say having switched to using teams for meetings more often it is definitely clunkier overall than meat it might still be worth using for a variety of reasons I'm not sure I don't know um but yeah so here's why I wanted to talk about this one of the realizations that I've had in my admittedly just dropped it uh admittedly limited time with the Apple Vision Pro so far is that Apple needs to figure out what the heck they want to do they are hardware company there a
services company but they don't want to build their services to the point where it compromises their ability to be a hardware company but they're clearly making a transition and the thing that made this stand out to me was in the Apple marketing for the Vision Pro I I keep coming back to this they've got that lady that's packing for a trip right and she gets a call on FaceTime and the whole thing is so seamless and so cool and it's like right but there is one person in my entire life who uses
FaceTime absolutely every single other person that I interact with is via WhatsApp Facebook Messenger Microsoft teams Discord quite literally anything other than FaceTime and so what I what I realized as I was sitting in the Apple Vision Pro thinking about how on Earth I interact with anybody outside of this thing was Apple's going to have to decide at some point are they they actually cuz this is not a consumer product it is but it also the how can go to that price point it
also isn't yeah this is a this is a professional tier product I mean it has Pro right in the name which admittedly is pretty meaningless yeah um at this point especially for Apple but it really is but it really is most useful for me so far as a as a productivity tool or at least I can see the most clear path to using it every day at work not not in not in not in my my leisure time um and what I realized was the biggest thing holding back apple is the Apple ecosystem which is sort of an ironic thing to
say but imagine for a second true imagine for a second I don't know you're right if FaceTime was crossplatform would that make a difference difference to your willingness to use this for work every day if people could just call you via like corporate coms I mean FaceTime but but it can just call you with teams maybe as long as there's a teams app and as long as it's not a garage I was using teams on my laptop so I was using teams on my laptop and projecting my laptop screen to someone else while also
projecting it in front of my MacBook it's super clunky no it's awful it's a terrible experience but if I could just with how seamless FaceTime is just have you know people on my call Stack Up and the whole thing just worked man that would be amazing all of a sudden I'd be like okay let's all just get MacBooks not quite you know we're  thing but I think I and you know what people there's going to be a lot of people who don't agree yeah I think have you tried to invite someone who doesn't
have an Apple device to FaceTime you uh no you can invite anyone to join you in a FaceTime call even people who don't have an Apple device they can join you in a one-on-one and group FaceTime calls from their browser no login is necessary they need to have the latest version of either Chrome or Edge so tell me something would you roll out slack if that was how it worked if you could only if you could invite people but they like couldn't call you like come on oh I see so that's
how it would have to work okay okay okay yeah so that's so that's what that's what I'm saying is I think that's lame I think there's an opportunity there though because nobody hates FaceTime nobody hates iMessage Yep this is clearly a piece of Hardware that could be just awesome for that kind of use I think there are plenty of workspaces that just only have Max though I'm sure there are but what about all of the other ones yeah yeah yeah I don't know I would seriously consider I would seriously
consider paying apple as a Services Company even though I don't necessarily have a ton of interest in deploying their Hardware we already do which is sick but would you would you would you consider FaceTime iMessage they had a little bit of genuinely zero experience with imessage I have never used it it's fine the way that it hand it be fine for corporate Communications it would be fine there channels and stuff the way it handles group chats is pretty good there's definitely some things that it would
that it would need oh just like even mentioning group chats you're just like triggering me about how frustrating teams is to use we we have this infrastructure call that we do every Monday and Thursday at 11: whatever doesn't matter um multiple myself and Sean we can't join it it'll it'll show up like AJ will start the call it'll show up and say the call has ended and there's no there isn't even an option to join like slack sometimes there might be some problem with the notification or whatever but you can
just click the join button anyways the Huddle button and even if there's nothing there it shows that no one's in the call it'll put you in the call and then it'll detect all the people so you can like force your way in even if it's acting weird uh but for teams it just no you just can't join so you have to completely closed teams and loaded again for it to work I I hate how communicating in teams teams within teams another very annoying naming thing but in the teams side it's very frustrating um so almost
all communication that I end up having ends up happening in group chats anyways it's like what's the point I I don't know teams is very frustrating I don't know I don't know it was just it was kind of a random thought that I had I haven't articulated it particularly well I think Apple's standing in their own way by tying their software to their Hardware I also think though that one of the reasons why they have so many di hard users that are going to buy stuff like this is because they have this wall
ecosystem sure but they could also have the experience be enhanced by their own Hardware they could they could create extra value for their users through their Hardware not an acceptable solution for people that keep rather than have a gun to their user's head buy our Hardware or you get nothing it's just it's a very very different philosophy it's a very different approach and I think that it's one that requires some serious thought over there do we want to be a hardware company
forever or do we want to be a Solutions provider Microsoft is growing like crazy right now oh yeah Microsoft is absolutely winning absolutely winning wild in like everything they're doing basically except maybe Xbox even Xbox I think they're playing a pretty long game game here yeah like all the acquisition stuff apparently they're in hot water right now over how many Activision Blizzard people were let go after the acquisition I mean obviously they were going to do that but I guess
they were like they said it was already planned and honestly a lot of those IPS have been floundering pretty hard for a long time so it's not too surprising um I I kind of buy it to a certain degree why is Discord not acceptable oh boy oh boy oh boy oh boy oh boy oh boy do do you want to be here all night guys just just IGN don't ask  no all right Luke it's just it's just not okay I like it's there are things that Discord does extremely well and this is one of the reasons why I'm so
frustrated about how expensive slack is because slack has a lot of the same features but is really expensive and discord's free um but the the calling on Discord is fantastic uh the channel organization is honestly really good I the how permissions are handled awful everything you've said so far is Arguments for it I say we switch you know what sure let's do it no it's a terrible idea um uh how permissions are handled I understand it's very convoluted but it's really powerful um and considering in slack
something that you would hate about slack so much slack is entirely voluntary with how you join channels for the most part uh so you can put people in groups which is terribly handled but you can put people in groups to give them default channels but they can just join any open Channel that they want and anyone can  channel so you can't make it so people can't make channels uh that might be a permission I don't know I have in forever okay because if you just have like a bazillion private random channels
no but the the main way that this manifests in in a bad way is that organization of those channels is on the user there you go the other ones like people are saying you can sure whatever cool that's fine that part I don't actually care about the part that I actually care about is that the organization of it is on the user cannot be trusted to do that insane and I pretty much guarantee like no one has really done it I I've done it to a certain degree but I'm sure mine could
be better I would care a lot more about doing it really well if I knew it would positively impact other people in the team as well whatever um anyways Discord does that extremely well um there's a lot of things that it does really well it's authentication and sign into to the server is like not cool on a company level uh it it's like there's a lot of different things about how you use it and how it flows this all sounds like vague posty nonsense really designed around very social gamery type of
communication and not very business communication uh there's too much stuff  there's how do we keep people from joining like weird servers uh how do you audit things you can't audit anything like at all the the user control for it is like really not great because it's designed for these open networks of people like it's just it's not designed for company stuff it's really good it would probably be the best one if it was corporate focused or if they had a corporate Focus mode I
honestly believe that Discord could be the best company communication right uh because the fundamentals are really really strong but then they just don't have some of the business busy things like can can we have single sign on with Microsoft or Google so that everyone can have one unified login no that's actually very very important for a lot of businesses there are business business out there that will not use a service unless it has SSO which isir it's just straight up a
thing yep uh managing credentials across dumb Dum users is such a nightmare yeah like it it it actually totally yeah people in chat are saying like my my company's one of them SSO is huge yeah so like not having these these fairly fundamental extremely corporate busy things which it doesn't need at all for what its actual main goal is as as a piece of software but not having them makes it not really work for businesses very well um yeah there you go good job what are we supposed to be doing

61% what a random discount quantity yes I don't get it 61% no no no not that well the kind the unedit ability is like oh there's so many ways around that so many ways Luke sometimes things weren't made for you did you ever stop to consider that no everything should be made for me it's like a zip file but if it was a Word document yeah why is that helpful cuz it it has a picture in it and you can look at the picture uh but it's a Word document and not a zip file y it's l it's like I want
to I want to share a lossless image it's like it's like a printer yeah it's a digital printer there there there you go all right yeah and it's like just like a  it's I just I think I think they're massively overused I think people using them uh in the name of security are massively overestimating uh the amount of security and I think as humans do they'll be like ah yes I use thing for security therefore thing secure right and it ends up just being security theater Elijah is
all concerned that updf isn't going to sponsor us anymore cuz Luke's ripping into PDFs no no no his attitude towards PDFs is exactly why they exist because dealing with PDFs sucks yeah no I I've heard great things about you PDF I I were the sponsor segment is done and he does the readings anyways so I don't need to say this Luke gets paid the same regardless 100% uh but I I've heard great things about them I just they're  pain all right what do you want to talk about how about Canada Banning The
Flipper sure Canadian minister of  Industry Fran Philip champag announced a ban on consumer hacking devices including the flipper zero in response to concerns over car theft the ban is likely in response to recent online videos purporting to show cars being stolen using flippers and similar devices however it's worth noting that these videos are in often are often staged to get views yeah according to the maker of the flipper zero the device can't be used to hijack cars produced
after the 1990s because their security systems have rolling codes that can only be used once a wannabe Thief would not only need to be close enough to the fob to capture the code they would also have to block the code from reaching the car because it would immediately expire The Flipper zero lacks the hardware capacity to block such a signal notoriously young car thieves known as the Kia boys were able to steal cars using information found in viral videos because some us
manufacturers didn't install standard anti- theft immobilization devices and thus their cars could be started with a USB cord or a screwdriver but that is nothing to do with the flipper zero yeah Canada likes to do this we just like ban stuff cuz something happened and it's often the wrong thing it's like it's like if I pushed lonus and lonus was like ah Dan is banned like what finally finally okay I don't think it's quite like that when was I going to get cancelled the point is that
our our politicians are just like your politicians yeah unqualified unsupervised yeah it's it's basically the same everywhere yep our this is our minister of innovation Science and Industry and look it's not not like I don't understand why we might have um you know a discomfort with devices that market themselves as hacking devices sure I mean I think hacking has a pretty  flipper wanted to not be banned you know they would have been wise to stay more underground um and more you know only
for people in the know but obviously they sell a lot more more flipper zeros this way so it's a it's a balancing act and clearly they they they've their notoriety has has gotten too great and someone you know had to do something please think of the children but on the other hand you've got to understand what you're doing when you're the minister of innovation Science and Industry you just banned a computer yeah yeah like actually uh especially cuz doesn't the wording get like super
rough too it's like electronic device with like Wireless signals or something like isn't it like every every cell phone ever like at that point any Android phone that you can install side loaded apps on is like is a hacking device what the you better not have a laptop with Linux installed How Could You ban Arch yeah um yeah so I think it's still legal for me to have mine but it's not legal to sell buy or use them so I can no longer use my flipper zero you can you just have the device
put on a shelf even though I could a little case even though I could literally do anything that I could do with a flipper zero with something else if someone gets arrested just for having Cali Linux installed on their laptop like do we do we protest what I suspect what I ECT is this is the kind of thing where they've made it illegal so that if the cops cat thing on catch someone doing something nefarious with it it's really quick and easy for them to take it um and prosecute it um I think that there's
a lot of plausible deniability in the kind of pranks that people are pulling with flipper zeros you know you're walking past Teslas popping open charging covers it's like I don't know that could have been caused by anything you know whereas now they can just take it so I I kind of I do understand the convenience but I also think that there's a lot of potential for overreach if I'm walking around with a Raspberry Pi plugged into a battery Bank in my pocket do do they take
that I if I remember correctly under the way that the law is written like they totally could they could also just take your phone and anything else I I I need to look it up what about pentesting do I can I get a license to carry one yeah it's actually very likely that um Canada in general is just going to become less secure because of this and in informed actors are always going to have a way to get the thing that they want well yeah I mean it's not freaking hard you can man
you can buy like you can buy freaking cell phone Jammers on AliExpress they're they're just openly available yeah they're very illegal to buy and own and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah it's not like you can't get them it's not like I can't get firecrackers in Canada are you kidding me yeah like oh no what is Jake talking about disclaimer very illegal what is he talking about oh he's probably just talking about Jammers yeah yeah IE I know I'm going to tell them it's illegal
I know they're illegal yeah um the point easy to get the point is if I wanted one if I wanted if I wanted nighttime at our house to mean cell phones off nighttime don't use your cell phone then I could do that I would get a call that's illegal I mean once I turned it off I make one what are they going to do like ban soldering irons man my phone's like flipping hot and my battery just died yeah it was doing something yeah I was doing something anyway whatever it was I was probably probably trying to
get a signal from the Jammer that Dan turned on or maybe some maybe he was using a flipper zero to hack my phone I don't really know what else to say about this other than this is spectacularly stupid it does absolutely nothing add you need you need to find the problem the problem is that device security is not being taken seriously Enough by the companies that make them that is the problem if you wanted to ban any device that doesn't support rolling codes or uh a certain level of
encryption or you know what whatever feature it is that we all use devices like The Flipper zero to I identify um you know things that work versus things that are vulnerabilities like if you wanted to ban anything that doesn't meet a certain standard for security sure yeah i' yeah I'd be totally down that I get behind that 100% but this is like man I don't even I don't even know what to compare this to this is It's just dumb it's also it's not going to solve the problem it's like Banning hammers
because somebody used them to break into a house like no hammers have lots of legitimate uses and the fact that someone can use it to break into a house doesn't mean that they couldn't just use a Mallet next time like there's no point Banning the hammer yeah we still need to drive nails and they could just use a chainsaw it doesn't matter they could throw anything through a window yeah ban rocks no rocks allowed excavate the whole country yeah so anyway I I know that our our poor friends in America you
know probably feel like punching bags the the number of times we've talked about American politicians and how spectacularly stupid they are on this show oh there's so many dumb Canadian things um but guys you know we uh we we patriotically criticize our country too don't worry we are just as stupid L interesting most of the time yeah EU though Chads doing good I mean they do bad stuff too apparently flip Aero is banned in I know they're not part of the EU anymore but they're in
Europe uh apparently flipper zero is banned in the UK okay yeah but like the UK has made one terrible decision after another for quite quite a period of time I mean when was the last time that the sun didn't set on the British Empire how's that going for you guys and that's how Wars are started right oh man um yeah I don't know this is this is just ridiculous anyone that actually wants to use them for nefarious things will still be able to get or make them uh no problem even with them banned
that's been proved with things forever drugs alcohol guns whatever you want to ban whatever want to modulate however you want to do it people that want it are still going to get it um if you were going to use this to steal a car you were already committing Grand Theft Auto I don't think you really care about I happen to have electronic device law um so yeah way to go you're just hurting people that are curious about technology and not accomplishing anything do we have better news is there
good news I don't know maybe uh uh well not that uh Sony back button oh yeah correction from last week I criticize Sony for not having uh the ability to move the back button on their Android skin to the right side like Samsung uh this doesn't appear to be entirely Sony's fault although they could definitely fix it if they really wanted to as pointed out by Michelle Ramen it appears that Sony Engineers submitted a change that would add support for swapping the recent and back
button positions to the Android open source project in January 2023 it just hasn't been done but Sony could also do it themselves so correction um it's not in the AOSP but not correction Sony I will not use your phones until you deal with this and I don't care whose fault it is it's not on your phone another correction apparently the person who said it earlier was incorrect it is not banned in the UK it was just confiscated at an airport which is a completely different thing and there's some debate
over whether it might be illegal oh like U yeah I found a thing um yeah there's some debate over whether it might be illegal CU it might just fall under like things that were already illegal to be in a gray area got it Mak sense this is  way that's awesome any who let's go I don't know how to play guitar at all but yeah what else do you want to talk about oh my God everything's wow why is it all terrible news this week oh oh the Florida Senate might be booting kids off social media speaking of speaking of
American politicians and being stupid this is like not stupid actually I actually am complet complely down with this I understand there's people that will aggressively disagree with me but I'm down the Florida Senate has taken up a bill for discussion that would ban all children under the age of 16 from social media on the grounds that it has addictive features similar to gambling absolutely that are damaging to children's mental health extremely actually how is this Florida so sick the
bill doesn't specify any social media platform but any platform that tracks user activity allows user generated content and uses potentially addictive features such as infinite scrolling would be required to enact third party age verification I knew they were going to up yep there it is dang it  thing all right and a swing in a Miss Florida's house has already passed a similar bill with overwhelming support if supported by the Senate it would still require a vote from Florida's
governor who has expressed some concern that the bill is overly Broad some critics have suggested that requiring ID in order to participate in social media might be a freedom of  think what a wamp wamp dude I was so excited about this I was genuinely on board I wasn't making that up I just hadn't read that line neither oh man yeah that was really close to being not completely fled but they then they  up according to a modder by the name of emus Nvidia has been working on
extending its RTX video HDR feature to also convert SDR games to HDR in real time emus has created and published a mod to enable this in progress feature though only on Windows 11 even as a still in progress feature this gaming HDR converter reportedly creates better visuals in some cases than Windows 11's Auto HDR um that's about all I have to say about that I just thought that was really cool it's on Nexus mods and if you want to check it out I still haven't tried the HDR video AIO Auto converter
but I really want to I just haven't gotten around to it dude I've been so busy we did we did an AMD ultimate Tech upgrade yesterday that went for somewhere between 10 and 11  for I'll just tell you Belle Kyle from Creator Warehouse engineering oh he has been working on this video since since  upgrade and it's basically 3 hours sorry three hours it's basically 10 hours of me Elijah and Kyle trying not to kill each other it's going to be great I feel like this is going to be one of those things
like man we have had some absolute Banger float plane exclusives lately if you are not on float plane I'm sorry it's been really good I'm sorry to hear that um you know it's not for everyone you know it's it's extra money at a time when hey not everybody has extra money kicking around things things are things are tight for a lot of people but dude we've got extras from Linus's kids build Luca computer we've got uh extras from the uh medic collab uh we've got uh oh yeah we've got the um the CEO interview
with Taran that's an hour and a half long dude we've got we've got some stuff we've got a lot of really great behind the scenes it's been it's been a riot lately and I feel like that video alone is going to have extras like probably on the level of the Cal me Chris collab build oh wow yeah yeah it's it's hilarious we're going to have to cut some stuff cuz there's definitely some stuff that's going to need to be cut but Kyle's hilarious as you probably know Elijah's hilarious as you probably know
um and I'm all right pretty funny I think I can be I think I can be pretty funny I actually I actually had one of what I think is my best on camera jokes I'm not going to spoil it but I'll watch for it I like the tech upgrades I watched pretty much all of them I destroyed Elijah destroyed him he couldn't even talk you tell him to do a backflip no no no no absolutely not not it work uh man oh man okay this one's worth recounting I actually had one of my best in a meeting jokes this week too I was
on fire earlier this week I I've slowed down a little bit I'm really tired from that Tech upgrade but uh we were having a meeting about um visual data visualizations for uh power supply related content for short circuit and for the lab's website because power supply testing is one of the ones that we're going to be ready to roll out in volume soonest yeah uh compared to all the other categories and um and Lucas from the lab basically had uh so Lucas and Sammy put together this
visualization That was supposed to characterize for the for the viewer a brown out and the drop in voltages and recovery of their of their um of their rail voltages of the the 12volt 5volt 3.3 volt and V USB vs USB something uh some some four fourth Rail and basically the idea is that within the ATX specification uh you're supposed to be able to lose power for a very very short period of time like a a dozen or so milliseconds or a couple dozen milliseconds I forget exactly what it is
it's a very very short period of time a few tens of of thousands of a second um and the system should recover without actually losing power as long as those rails bounce back fast enough your computer will not actually lose power in the event of a brown out so he had the he had the incoming AC represented like this and then it goes like this and then it comes back and then during that brown out phase we had like a like a highlighted section and then you see all the other rails go down
and then come back and it had lines all over it pretty much we had kind of gone through all the other visualizations in the meeting pretty quickly and we were stuck on this one for probably somewhere between 5 and 10 minutes and one of the things that we were really stuck on was how to symbolize uh a brown out in a way that might declutter the the the graph and um Taran and I kind of disagreed on what we thought was was a good approach for this and at the at at the end of it like we
were basically getting to the end of our time and there were a couple more things that we need to talk about I'm like look here's the situation I know that this is very clear and very easy to understand for Lucas and honestly for Sammy for that matter because even if she doesn't know everything about electrical engineering and electronics engineering uh cuz that's not her field she does know a lot about data visualization so for you the labs folks this is probably crystal clear but
between me and Taran we have over 35 years of experience in this industry we're pretty technical we're enthusiasts we're passionate we read a lot of Articles um we are not able to fully understand it and are not able to agree on what the best way to visualize this is and that's  sign yeah yeah yeah I got it yeah yeah so I was I just I I think I just about killed Gary he didn't laugh he just looked like  anyway I was very proud I was like so proud of myself I was too proud of myself Dan's
dead is he even here yeah he's here yeah he's here he's just he doesn't want to talk anymore anyway I'm very happy oh that's rough yeah that was uh that look guys if you were there it was very funny cuz it's a bad sign just got to get it off the graph it's too hard understand it would be more top of mind when you're in that meeting too like if it took you a sec to get it it would probably yeah yeah sine wave sine wave yeah um anyway death by smugness look okay I have to do
so many meetings you guys it's yeah like if I meetings are getting a little much like I I'm just basically in meetings if I if I can't have fun man I gota man I got you know I gota I got to make my jokes I gotta have my fun like managing a business and like yes yes I have a lot of people that to help me manage the business but it's not like I don't still have to do things um something I think we I my fun a little better as an organization and I'm working on this with the ones that I run
as well is having laid out objectives before the call and then when you complete them ending the call immediately yeah there's a lot of like yeah this has been good convers I is there anything else anyone needs I'm going to start having a counter for how many times I hear that ask yeah does anyone else have anything to and then it just doesn't end nobody says anything but then the meeting sits there and then you're like uh it's like man I I I have I haven't been doing it consistently but
I've done it a couple times in the last couple weeks where I'm just like okay well if no one needs me bye and I just leave if it's really important they'll message you you can join again when it's when it's pretty obvious that the messages is over or the message that the that the call is over yeah non-agenda meetings I think is like super not the way okay here's one that I'm not 100% sure how you're going to react to oh boy Google has blocked side loading in Singapore of certain apps so as part of
a Crackdown on financial scams Google will be preventing Singaporean users from sideloading some apps allegedly these apps misuse andro Android permissions in order to intercept onetime passwords that a user receives via notification or text according to google over 95% of these apps were installed through sideloading now when a user attempts to install one of these apps they will instead receive a popup that says this app can request access to sensitive data this can increase the risk of identity
theft or financial fraud Google has developed this pilot program in collaboration with the Singapore government's uh cyber security agency the company announced a similar real-time scanning protection initiative in October which is supposed to roll out first in India discussion question is it a slippery slope absolutely Google deciding which apps you can or cannot s side load absolutely is that is that is it really being blocked though or are they just popping up a notification warning
you it sounds like they will be blocked are you sure because the the like the the title is that it blocks side I know but I I've read other articles other than the summary okay it sounds like it  knows they will instead receive a popup that says this app can request I get it but this summary here is not the only one that I've read it sounds like it will be blocked yeah um this seems bad however we're going to transition to another topic where somebody got scammed out to $25 million because the world's
crazy right now how' you know I was going to do that uh because it just makes way too much sense all right uh things are nuts and you you cannot expect users to understand fully all the different and be constantly aware of all the different currently available attack vectors to the point where like I I almost feel like there's no point in attempting to educate people on it because even educated people are going to screw up because the sophistication level of certain uh things currently is just kind
of too high people are saying yeah users aren't Tech experts even Tech experts are going to get dunked on right now um with the ability to like the the the topic we're going to get into is insane but like this yeah this is rough um what I wish it was y was like really aggressive popup things that are like you should not do this so if it is then you're good I think so yeah but I mean I would even be H put like five but like Microsoft tried this with UAC put put it doesn't prevent people from just
clicking it and then they also have to authenticate through an email thing or or something like make it like really annoying and put a lot of steps in the way I'm totally okay with that that's a slippery slope too because they could also do that if you try to install a third party browser now and I know I'm I I know that I'm making a bit of a disingenuous argument here but they could hold on apparently  sources okay does that help then I think so because there's still a ro around it
yeah therefore it's okay to me personally so as long as there's there should be a way yeah there should be a way to force a side load um okay and I I don't even care it could be like super annoying you have to plug it into a computer I don't know about that you have to like do something that's very Advanced wouldn't the real solution to this though just be system antivirus that just doesn't let anything intercept a onetime pass password should should anything be allowed to read your text
messages as they come in yeah why does anything need to read your text messages as they come in I feel like there's pretty much always going to be a way though it could be screen reading grab it that way sure but anything that continuously records your screen maybe that just like it might be able to detect an event of a text message coming in and start screen recording for COD time like I I would never trust that thing to actually cover those Sol says uh Hey 15 years in I'll take any sort of Android
protection yeah Elijah even if you're joking don't  it I'm trying I don't know how oh um it's not working I thought I'm yeah why can't I click that I can't click that it doesn't it it's text commands why uh because you and I both didn't want us to spend time on that but I can click all the other ones what do  look oh yeah yeah yeah okay anyway um do you want us to spend time on that no yeah there we go uh Lenovo made a transparent laptop so that's useless that's cool we should
talk about the topic we were going to talk about though yeah let's talk about the 25 million dollar that got scammed via deep fake Luke you want to do this one I feel like I've done a lot of them yeah someone also said uh laerth legitimate accessibility features need to read your texts yeah like there's things like that too like I I don't know it just I don't think that's a solution that'll work anyways deep fake scam uh $25 million stolen this is genuinely wild this makes me think
Oceans 11 level like crazy there was probably multiple people behind this a lot of planning a lot of prep all that type of stuff and this is one of the reasons why I think you're honestly not going to be able to fully train people to be prepared for this stuff you're going to have to have procedures in place instead um that that layer up protections on these types of things like maybe requiring even if you're on a video call with someone require requiring you to call their cell phone
phone to confirm as a form of two-factor authentication or something I don't know this is crazy though according to Hong Kong police a finance worker at an unnamed multinational firm was convinced to transfer 25.6 million USD big money to scammers through a video call where everyone else in attendance including the company's CFO were actually audiovisual deep fakes whoa the worker was initially suspicious when he was contacted by the scammers through email but his concerns were
assuaged by the fact assuaged by the fact that the video call was attended by several people who looked and sounded like his colleagues Hong Kong police likewise indicated that they have seen a large amount of recent fraud cases using deep fakes alongside stolen IDs which totally makes sense I hate to bring this up but I contacted a financial institution that I no longer use very recently and because I no longer use them I don't remember my PIN or like access were you able to like get back in
I was able to reactivate my account with information that I could Google about myself y the fact that that is possible and and to be clear it's not just because I'm like a YouTube personality or something it's the kind of thing that I could easily Google about you if all I knew was your Facebook profile like it was shockingly easy um what the are we going to do cuz you and I laughed both both of us completely without pre-planning it laughed when we saw that Florida's plan
for Banning Social Media use for 16y olds was a third-party database because that's just a gold mine that someone's waiting to break into in mine I don't think I would trust our government or any other government to do it any better than the third party no what the crap are we supposed to do to authenticate it to secure anything you like can't really  um yep I don't know with things like soci media networks uh like there's examples of this on Twitch and and other places
as well what just look who it is made a really good point things are going to get really up when stuff like the Apple Vision Pro goes mainstream oh yeah because you become the person you'll be no no not just that not just that no no no no no no no because you won't be expecting the video feed to even quite look like them if it was a Vision Pro Avatar or whatever and it was a little off so what it wouldn't even raise any alarm Bells yeah now all you have to do is get the voice mostly
right oh no which people are getting really good at oh no yeah I heard it um an AI generated voice machine learning voice I keep I keep doing it I keep saying AI it's not AI it does okay whatever I heard an AI voice Recreation of myself hosting power supply a power supply video I've heard that too it's it's by far the best one I've heard it's gotten a lot better the whole like you having a Boston accent for no apparent reason thing is gone yeah it's not perfect for sure but it's oh I wonder if I can I
wonder if I can dig that up uh for the people to hear so we are uh one of the things that we're working on for um for the future of short circuit and to to dramatic Ally widen our production pipe  video we are going to take all the testing data plunk it into a template for the script which was written by humans very smart humans uh Lucas has done a lot of work on it uh to to get it down to the point where it says everything you need to know about a power supply with you know variables um
that are altered depending on the results of the power supply and then is read and edited by automated tools with humans involved for uh quality checks and for fact checking um so what you guys are going to see or here I guess rather is a very very early version of what that would look like um let me see  it oh I have audio playing uh I will fix that it is now fixed uh let me see if I  it document shared with you um you know what I'm going to search for Lucas because we don't actually talk about
that many things by email oh oh shoot I found a draft email I  okay okay uh can you run interference for me for a minute here Luke I uh someone just linked me that someone apparently made a uh Titanic uh My Heart Will Go On cover with me singing it so that's horrifying and I'll have to watch that later but um okay I don't know I could do another topic do you need that much time yeah do do another topic and I'll try and find this okay what's what's left South Korea jails pubg player South Korea Supreme
Court has upheld the prison sentence uh of a conscientious objector to a year and a half in prison for refusing mandatory military service in part because he is an avid player of pubg according to Korean prosecutors the man's participa participation in violent video games and his lack of effort to spread his beliefs is evidence that his morals his moral objection to violence and war is insincere the man reportedly refused to join the military on the grounds that it disregards human rights
and gives rampant unfair orders to enlisted soldiers discussion question why do we treat playing video games as indicating a tolerance for real world violence is it because players participate in the fictional violence in a way uh that a movie goer doesn't I have no idea um yeah that's wild hey I think this was more one we were just kind of reacting to just say it and not really discuss some real actual person is actually going to jail because the fact that they play pubg means that they don't object to
violence that is up dude I wonder how many video games what's going on over in South Korea right now I play that I would just be super not down to do in real life probably a lot youever play Doom yeah well you're killing demons though yeah but that might be a little a little isn't there like a whole thing where like even uh people who have like strong religious objections to killing are like no Doom is cool or whatever oh yeah yeah doom doom has some really really interesting
religion lore behind it um it's if I  um Doom guy is canonically Catholic okay yeah sure I mean that makes perfect sense yeah Doom was actually a pretty bad example because it's I guess it's the morality of the actions not the danger so I don't know G GTA a you don't want to be a criminal why would you play criminal game yeah I don't know man kind of rough I'll look for another one if you still need more time I don't want to I've got one I don't want to bug Lucas I'll you
know what I'll bug Gary I mean Google rebrands bard to Gemini launches paid tier and mobile app Google rebranded its Bard chatbot to Gemini the name of the uh language model the company introduced back in December with a demo that grossly exagger red its speed and capabilities uh and we'll be rebranding duet AI for workspace to Gemini for workspace uh hey Gary you are  show oh good sounds about right um I'm glad you survived my sine wave   okay uh I wanted to show the people the
um the early version of the audio of Linus reading um that uh that power supply overview uh script from Lucas uh do you do you know do you know the one I'm talking about where it's the Linus AI voice yes sir uh do you mind do you mind linking actually do you mind emailing that to me in some form that I could play it for the people okay all right thank you so much all right you're qu welcome all right chat wishing you a speedy recovery from whatever it is that you're suffering from right now yeah L not
us I was gonna say I think that's you all right okay all right thanks Gary all right take care okaye oh God that's funny um okay yeah I'm going to keep going Google's following in the footsteps of Microsoft who have finally made it clear that uh literally every AI product they make is called co-pilot Gemini Advanced is a paid version uh paid version powered by the more powerful Gemini Ultra 1.0 model accessible through the new Google one AI Premium plan that's a that's a name uh
it's $20 a month the same price as chat GPT Plus but it also includes the benefits of Google one in general uh which I think is going to be listed if I click on this link But it includes like expanded drive storage um yeah you get expanded drive storage if you have the AI premium one you have two terabytes of drive storage so that's a ton um Google Store rewards I've never even heard of that before Google meet premium video calling features Google Calendar enhanced appointment scheduling uh stuff
like that so you get other things instead of just just um the Gemini AI stuff Gemini is available on the web in 150 countries but more interestingly as a standad Android app in the US only also accessible through the Google app on iOS Android users in the US uh can select Gemini as their device assistant instead of Google Assistant which is actually probably a massive Improvement considering it doesn't feel like Google Assistant has gotten better in potentially ever uh has it has an
overlay that can be drawn up over any app to read your screen and do stuff which assistant used to do but doesn't now uh early feedback has confirmed that Google overhyped Gemini most Impressions uh that Riley has seen claim that chat gp4 is still better but we don't know right now I guess discussion question I'm I'm saying it I'm saying it no matter what uh why does Canada suck and then Dash sorry this isn't a  go oh that's great um uh thanks Riley I don't know we just get stuff
after America it's fine it's not a big deal yeah like The Vision Pro everywhere sucks yeah especially Canada um South Park got it right floppy heads blame Canada yeah one road uh did you get the file I'm working on it okay I'm running Gary's working on it I mean we could just do an show after dark I think we actually got a surprising number of merch messages given that we launched a t-shirt with a collar um so we might want to get  point no there's also the planetary shirt yeah yeah yeah yeah no I I I know
it's just and and the store screwdriver bit sets are just going to fly fly off the shelves y realistically they're going to fly off the shelves regardless um but I wanted to give people a lot of warning before we make any adjustments yeah um all right is there anything else okay is there anything else in here that we want to talk about oh we didn't even talk about the FUNimation libraries being deleted this is like a huge deal yeah FUNimation or so sorry Sony which has
owned FUNimation since 2017 and crunchy roll since 2021 will be merging the two Serv keeping the name crunchy roll as well as deleting digital copies of content that users purchased through FUNimation owning something digitally doesn't mean crap at all codes for these digital copies were included with physical Blu-rays or DVDs of anime dubbed and released by FUNimation as a way of ensuring that customers would always have access to the content that they purchased even if they were away from
home or they lost their physical copy crunchy roll will also be increasing in price from $80 to  annually so basically um Sony go yourself for this yeah that sucks um why don't they just offer it through crunchy rooll if I had to guess I would say that this was not actually a super simple decision and it's possible that whatever FUNimation licensing was for these Perpetual copies that many rights holders are pretty Cy about blah blah blah blah blah blah blah non-transferable something something
something there's probably a reason but it sucks and I just don't really care anymore I don't care what the really good reason was for or what the really good reason was it doesn't matter when someone buys something I get it they're only buying a license to use it but they bought a license to use it in the way that in good faith they understood that it was for and I think you understood too and that should continue like it's the uh yeah gev Dev in fing chat said crunch world doesn't have the
infrastructure for it from the sound of it the FUNimation site is shutting down I don't care build it if you're going to just like delete all this stuff that people bought you you need to provide a  just shoot uh Gary is um has not sent that um and now I'm sort of wondering if there's anyone else who might know where it is cuz maybe he's having a hard time finding it I do you know where it is y well why why didn't you just tell oh I found it can you message Gary real quick and
tell him I found it why don't you uh because I'm going to bring it up okay I have to email it to myself this way we're working in parallel Luke it's efficient you wouldn't understand usually I'm the only one who works while actively live on the show um well yeah cuz someone has to talk to the people we'll just let Dan do it okay uh Dan  on hey how you doing Jesus Dan okay forget it okay is my is my audio working uh no no it's not you were so you were so Lively last show uh I become all tired
at the moment you fired up I'm sorry guys okay will Luke be able to hear this I'm trying to be swaave I've heard it before I know but like just you know so we can all experience it together Luke it's is this your first podcast come on man get it together yeah okay Dan are we good in a way I'm not hearing anything uh well I'm not playing anything okay then then give it we're firing on so many cylinders right now it's m is my turn with a brain cell I worked so many hours
yesterday okay but Kyle's upgrade video is going to be amazing and the behind the scenes on float plane are going to be amazing just go subscribe to float plane okay let's do this thing this is the 1000 watt Focus gx1000 manufactured by cic with a current MSRP of $250 it is a fully modular ATX 3.0 power supply with an additional hybrid fan mode the power supply comes in sturdy packaging and measures 150x 86x 140 mm considering cable flexibility it has an effective depth of 190 mm the modul
cables are plastic insulated of good quality and are really flexible this should cause no problems while building and cable managing your computer the providing cable set includes a single 12 vaporware cable allowing it to power all types of high wattage gpus the focus GX is a all right how do you feel about it how do you I I I don't mean the the quality of or whatever how does hearing  feel my first it's like I feel like I should remember saying it yeah I should remember saying it a really weird
disjointed not how I would say it way the way that I describe this to other people that have heard it is to me it feels like you just had your wisdom teeth taken out you're on a little bit of meds and you've got cotton in your mouth yeah and it's a bad mic the ination like the the the timber of the voice is surprisingly close yeah the timing's way off the Cadence is there's certain ways that you say things that don't line up like I I can tell it's not you but if I for example was the one
recording it cuz this is purely generated I don't think so I do think so I don't think so I do think so I'm rather certain it's not I know the person who did the project and they told me it was voiced by someone and then uh edited how sure are you I mean I can show you the messages no no no it doesn't sound like someone voiced it okay whoever voiced it clearly wasn't um is know how we did the Spanish trans one my things that I sent to Ed is like yeah it seems like a Linus who has cotton
balls in his mouth but isn't very techsavvy and he's like uh yeah all right well at any rate um okay so then no no I believe you I believe you no what okay so it's not Luke I believe you this is such a was time he to work on his phone more oh my goodness no it doesn't matter okay I I I don't care who it was the point is that with someone who was a little more techsavvy who had even the tiniest amount of practice imitating my Cadence yeah like this this is this is the same thing that made me think about
you know that like $25 million Heist whatever it was it's like yeah it with with more practice time yeah because someone just like listens to you talk about a thing enough times figures out how you're going to say $250 figures out how uh is is more familiar with the subject matter this is very likely the first time they did a read through um all this other type of stuff um yeah I think you could basically nail it there are some problems it sounds like it's on a really bad mic the like quality of the
audio is really low um but I mean we're close enough now that it's like you can kind of you can make it out yes absolutely and it's scary yeah with that said I mean it's going to be really convenient if we wanted if we wanted the entire you know power supply channel to be hosted by lonus I don't know if we should I don't know I don't know either but maybe we genuinely don't know maybe one out of every four would be hosted by L I don't know whatever we figure whatever strategy we settle on is though
digus we could scale it just like that vtuber vtuber hosted I mean I've I've been talking for years about how the best way for us to to safeguard this company against you know my untimely demise or eventual you know actual retirement or whatever it is not having Hydro facials could be exactly could be V tuing yeah our most recognizable personalities figuring out you know what that looks like in terms of compensation and Licensing and and Technology whatever right um and
building a scalable business around that I mean there's companies that only exist as as virtual influencers already today it's not like this is some kind of weird sci-fi that I'm imagining this is this this is a real thing right now and it's winning right now the only difference is that we would you know yeah when's the fillian collab I don't know I think Elijah is in contact oh so so it's moving I think does back flips God damn Luke okay you actually need to stop baiting him and doing a
back flip I don't want him to get hurt yeah showed me a video of him doing one and I was like yeah you shouldn't that's fine yeah don't yeah just stop baiting him yeah um maybe we should do that when you guys are remote somebody just becomes a vtuber like for wancho yeah cuz I can I can intersperse that into the actual set Reagan stuff I don't know anything about it we can figure it out yeah it's very doable okay um I I know like genuinely nothing about it anyway FUNimation chat
zero transform dude I run a vtuber studio with AAA motion capture Hardware yeah it's it's today it's it's right now it's right now yep all right is there anything that is left before we no I don't think so I think it's time for w show after dark all right let's do this thing did we do the jobs thing we did yeah um we did very early on the show I'll get it I'll get it all right maybe hit hit Luke first yeah yeah did it mission  what it's okay Dad you're goingon to be all right I take my headphones off for
one second oh man actually I need to PP I'll be right back okay all right I hope  hey uh you wanted you want me to give Luke one right yeah dad are you good I'm looking for it uh what's up boys Luke when and if you have a what boys what's up boys uh boy Luke when and if you have a cheat day or cheat meal during your exercise Journey what do you eat and why uh it's it's usually because I'll be uh like eating out with people um and I'll I'll usually try to get like you know somewhat of a safer option
but I I let myself go a little bit more then something that I'll like to have is like Indian food uh there's an Indian food plate I don't want to name it cuz I don't want to just run it over completely but there's an incredibly good Indian food place locally that I really like going to for lunch um and if I'm having a lunch meeting for some reason I will often suggest going there cuz it's incredibly good uh there's also a place that I like going for fa so I'll have Indian food f um I think I know the
place you're talking about that place is you probably know both of them to be honest and they're extremely good the one good one and it's so good for for which uh for the Indian I'm not sure I know the F do we should go sometime do you like f yeah we'll go sometime um I think that's also local too I might have gone there with a couple other people yeah maybe maybe it's a it's both of those are very common haunts for people that work here um yeah so like I I won't but but I'm not also not going to just
like you know oh I'm getting a cheesecake with whatever and like I I don't I don't really like go off but um I'm no longer like my my like Diet right now is if the if the food is planned it's very structured um but if I'm like out with people or whatever I I'll get stuff it doesn't matter but I try not to go too nuts that's all yeah sorry I didn't really like specify anything but yeah you're you're not like a person who goes like I'm going to eat an entire cake on my cheat
day no like I I don't I don't know I'm not I also I don't even desire that like I don't I don't even think cheat days are a good idea no no who who you cheating on it's just yourself can you believe we made it this far into the show and neither of you has made a joke about me getting a facial that would be crass Linus it felt like it was like actually too low bar it was like too easy that's too low bro yeah no no I'm okay with it being really low bro it was just too easy plus we know
you well enough that you get those all  him hello and the beard makes it a lot harder to clean up oh I know I  glassy hello dll as a business why wouldn't steam create steam plus gaming service is is it just small potatoes compared to their 30% or too complicated for such a large platform I hope they never do I think the licensing is extremely complicated if it was only for valve games yeah it would be no problem for them to just have a a valve subscription to their games in fact I
don't know I I I suspect that Hardware as a subscription is going to become even more prevalent I mean there's that TV that's free as long as you look at ads or whatever like I I mean in a way you know Finance ing is just Hardware as a as a subscription it's not like they can't repo it if you fail to pay for it it's just it's it's a it's a rent to own whereas at some point I could totally see a steam deck for steam deck is $10 a month it's not $400 it's $10 a month and
they just assume that be more expensive than that you know or whatever it is but I think I think you kind of get my point right like the the the point is that as long as it's first party nothing would prevent valve from doing things however it is that they want to do it um but when it comes to third party games I mean they can't even they can't even manage to get guys like uh you know EA to not require you to also install origin on your stupid computer let alone agreeing to um you know participate in
this in in this you know games P Game Pass competitor or whatever it is um I I think it's I would actually be kind of into it to be honest with you yeah I mean what if I just I I'd like to see valve innovate I'd like to see how was that innovation who wo well it's not Innovation if they just do what everyone else is doing so that's why I was going to suggest a way that maybe they could innovate right so here's something that would be kind of cool like if I could buy uh a steam pass subscription and it
entitles me to you know x amount of dollar value of games in my library at any given time but I could return games and take them out kind of like a library system or something like that I don't know that's just that's completely off the top of my head but I could see something like that being an innovation yes because you could go back and rebor a game at your discretion if it's still there so you're kind of you're kind of creating know well I would expect valve to innovate that too so I could curate
my own Library potentially that'd be kind of neat if I wanted to keep something instead of it just being like Netflix where that show just like disappears and you can't watch it anymore I could decide you know what yeah I want to I want to just keep I want to keep my old you know steam plus Library I don't want any of the new stuff and I can just like keep it forever keep it in perpetuity or I could be like oh yeah you know what no I I want to try something new and I just
like return one of my games like oh yeah okay like I and my family share group can't play this G that game what if it's been removed off of steam you wouldn't be able to get it again that's what I was saying maybe there was a miscommunication that's what I me oh okay sure I just mean I I could see there being room to innovate in that space um and if there was anyone who was going to do it in a not anti-consumer way maybe it would be Val I hope they don't do it because I don't think there is one and maybe
that's the not anti-consumer Innovation we need is valve just not doing it but I would be total like if if if inside a valve they were like hey let's like try to thought experiment this thing and figure out if there is a way that's totally cool with that sometimes you got to you know peer Into Darkness um I don't think there is a way if they prove me wrong great but I I don't I don't think there's a way because because of all the things that I've talked about on R show before of like if you if you end
up going subscription Services there's there's literally actors and and directors and stuff talking about this publicly right now but with everything being Subscription Service uh the only things that get made are safe uh there's no all that type of stuff all right Mr subscription services are evil what's that I didn't say subscription Services were evil oh okay okay ni little hot dog hamburger you got going on what if they did this did what what if everything that you got through your subscription
service you had like you can download these videos can you let me finish okay it's a terrible comparison just clean your is dog your comparison is dog I got some paper towels over here so my point is my point is what if it worked like that what if whenever something is in your library you could you you you got it permanently and it was more like a uh just hold on oh my gosh this is one of those things where it's like all I'm saying is consider a possibility I just I don't like if if if it's going that
far then you have it you own it so then like what H how is how is valve going to get any developers all they asked was What About Steam plus they didn't say it had to be exactly the way it is now so I'm saying that I just don't think what you're talking about is even possible well hold on can I finish talking about it sure so what if it was like float plane where through the subscription you are getting new content so it's kind of it's almost more like a uh it's almost more like what what are they called
those uh those mail subscriptions something boxes yeah uh I know what you're talking about help me help me chat uh something boxes it's not no boxes not loot crates no it's a thing Loot Crate was a brand crack boxes oh my God subscription boxes sure subscription boxes mystery boxes I don't know I thought there was another name the point is but like subscription boxes so developers would sign up so you get new things valve curates the new games that you're going to try with their Subscription Service
you own the games afterward you can go back and you can reopen that crate anytime you feel like it just like on float plane you can and when you are subscribed you can download any video we have no cap you can download the entire back catalog of anything you want exclusives different channels all the infrastructure people listening right now are going like oh goodness and yeah it it sucks on our end but but you but you can do that and then the only difference once you cancel your
subscription is you just don't get the new you don't get the new content and you can't come download it again I mean that's something that I could see being a not EV you know Innovation that that valve could valve they could even have they could even have gambling mechanics some of them so maybe you get two games out of out of there there's eight and you'll get one will be a random one but you can pick one of them or something like that like I'm just saying let's be open-minded I just think that's a
completely different thing now you've gone so far away that it's just humble bundles subscription version um which is like fine hold on well hold on what was the question question though uh something something steam plus gaming service I mean yeah I just the original question is open enough that this is legit I'm not saying that sure yeah sure I just I just mean I think there's ways to do subscription gaming and have it not be totally toxic I think that is not totally toxic
I just also think that that sort of doesn't matter like I I don't think that would actually catch on um there might be ways to do it maybe maybe I think a lot of them will have the same problems as as standard subscription stuff like I said though like if Al if alve wanted to sit in a room and try to figure this out and they did find out a way then that's great I just I struggle to see how it can be really possible because in this version like yeah maybe they do maybe it is very
similar to what you're saying maybe it's a monthly thing that you get just like with those old subscription boxes that were popular for a while maybe it's a monthly thing you log into steam on the first and you have a new thing that you click on and it's like hey you have these new games uh maybe they're even partially curated because they know some of your interest based on games you've played and stuff so maybe they'll go like oh we noticed last month you played a games that are a bunch of games that
are like that are like this we thought you might want to try these things you played slay the Spire maybe you'll enjoy across the Obelisk something like that um we included that in the thing that could be kind of cool I don't think that would take off as much as an all access pass yeah apparently PSN plus does something kind of like this as well so anyway I do think to your question though uh it would be pretty small potatoes for valve compared to the kind of money that they print on um an annual
basis just taking 30% of every game that sells on Steam so and not just game sales right um so it's a cool idea but I I I doubt that it has any kind of serious momentum over there at least for the time being I think you're also going to run into a problem where it's going to be a lot of the same games a lot of the same developers and probably older games unless valve starts pumping tons of money into the creation of them at which point they might want some amount of um creative controller
input and then we start running into the same problem with gaming subscription Services where the uh company that runs the subscription service ends up uh pushing in for Creative control because they want things that are going to guaranteed  problem would you like another one yeah no I just wants to go home I'm good hi wo I recently took a trip to Europe and my LTT backpack was St with my MacBook DSLR lenses and some miscellaneous Tech what's the most heartbreaking loss of tech you've
experienced I think I've told this story before so I'm not going to go through the whole story but when I left my my pocket PC at the ice rink like it had my calendars and everything on it and there was no Cloud sync back then so I had to like set everything up manually again yeah that that sucked that really sucked I haven't lost much I left a phone on a plane that's probably it oh yeah there was the time I left my laptop on the car and drove o yeah I remember that um I very recently a I have this one of
the 64 ounce water bottles that I've sticker bombed um and it's my like I have it in my car I bring it into work and I bring it into the gym uh but it like stays remote like I don't bring it home home and then I have another 64 Oz water bottle at home and I have my airpods that I work out with and the water bottle and the airpods are missing can't find them anywhere I checked lost and found here I checked the lost and found at the gym it's not at home it's not in my car the fact that it's both of
them I'm pretty sure they were taken my biggest thing is like why' you take the water bottle like it's it's sticker bombed with a bunch of stickers I can't get again it it's a good water bottle water bottle and you mean why they take it it's an awesome water no no can you stop disrespecting the hard work of the Creator Warehouse team I get that and especially at the gym because everyone wants the really big water bottles when you're at the gym I'll actually go through like half or more of that in one
gym session like it's perfect for at the gym I love that water bottle it's just like ah like the the dollar value was in the airpods leave me my water bottle that is custom sticker bombed like I I I literally can't get a lot of these again it's kind of annoying I really liked how it looked it's like when someone steals your wallet and you're just like could you have just taken the cash and left it there exactly like this is actually just really really annoying like I'm going to
cancel every one of those credit cards before you do anything yeah just the credit card compan is going to go for go after their money like you're not like just any chance it's newer airpods no um because it's me so I have replacement ones now and they're also the old cheap ones because it's me um it's just it just sucks it's very annoying but the main thing that I'm annoyed about is not the tech product that someone took my water bottle cuz I  bottle I know where you can get a new
one I know I can get a new one I just H headed to the end of the Earth nuha for diving any places on your bucket list animals you're chasing seems to be island in the French Polynesia wow cool I still want to I still want to scuba dive in Australia that'd be sweet yeah that that's on my list I have recently gone on a few dates with someone and I could use Luke's 100% success chicken recipe in the near future when will we get that video I've been told I need to film it for a float
plane exclusive it's coming yeah so it's going to be a thing don't don't don't look at his eyes don't look at his eyes hey D we stuck in your beard no hey D recently heard about a long range 1 km Wi-Fi with enough bandwidth for video calls have y'all heard about this and is it even real I have heard about it I am so excited to try it oh I haven't gotten my hands on it yet I want to um I've already flagged it for the writing team I missed rers meeting today cuz I was busy filming our PS5 killer oh $500 PC
that's pretty strong interesting that you're calling it a PS5 killer not a console killer the PS5 just win that hard what what games would we play on an  killer get get owned um oh man any who uh so hopefully we're getting in touch I totally want to try it it sounds amazing it's different from what we've shown in the past with ubiquity uh dish-based long range Wi-Fi Solutions and that it seems to be more just uh non-directional you just everything's just connected it seems
super cool I'm really looking forward to trying it out sweet hi lonus fellow Tech Dad here any advice on long distance parenting I work overseas away from my child and kids and uh sorry my wife and kids most of the year is there anything other than video calls to alleviate missing them that sounds horrible um I don't think I could do it I uh the only advice that I have is uh stay strong brother I uh aren't there like uh I wonder how old their kids are did they say in the thing did it say no I think
there's these like presentence pillow things that like glow the the other one will glow when there's weight on the one of them oh okay and I've been told that it helps like if you're feeling really homesick or whatever it helps to like know I don't know I haven't experienced this so I have no idea but I've heard that's a thing and like people say it's  know hey lldd I will be in Japan this summer for an internship doing data analysis with field programmable Gat arays fpgas what do you think the most
interesting use case for fpgas are uh also Luke what should I avoid in Japan fpg are one of those things where I wouldn't even begin to tell you what I think the most interesting thing they're used for is because they're used for everything everything they're either used in final deployments and that's why a lot of things are really expensive um so one example is those usb3 extenders that I have if that wasn't Asic it would cost a fraction of what it does but it's an fpga so it's really really expensive
cuz you're buying fully programmable processors for both sides these sounds really expensive yeah USB to fiber boxes right and they're handling high bandwidth low latency so that's what they cost right um and so it's either in mass production or mass is or it's in the prototyping of basically everything so I don't know everything fpga are sick there I said it check out analog analog. yep they make wicked cool stuff check out check out alibaba.com oh yeah yeah this show up the subreddit
this week dare me to order one I was going to say are you guys going to get one unfortunately I would have to order 500 pieces oh my goodness I love that the number of people that don't understand how our screwdriver ever works yeah this isn't the same drives me absolutely crazy this isn't like a third shift situation guys there is no Chinese Factory to run a third shift how the many times do I have to say this before people will somehow process that the LT screwdriver is not some made in China rebadge it
just isn't  of whatever it is that you're doing over there is going to change the actual reality that it just isn't we collaborated with mega Pro licensed their bit storage licensed their ratchet heavily modified their ratchet design at this point with the stubby screwdriver we have actually modified their bit storage enough that we are no longer dependent on the patent for it um the ratchets are produced in China the shafts are produced in China the Plastics are all produced in Pit Meadows
British Columbia the assembly is done here in the Greater Vancouver area there is no third shift just sit the down it's incredible uh anyway uh this  um yeah a sample is apparently about the cost of these guys buying one of our screwdrivers so if you order a sample what's very likely is they will simply buy one of our screwdrivers and send it to you they've ripped the photos directly off of our site oh nice other than it seems like attempting maybe or maybe not like blur it out a little bit
to blur our logo a little bit they've even included our like crusty rusted bits that we use to demonstrate that you can install standard size bits in it um I would I would totally order one to see if it's if it's uh even a a somewhat close copy but the issue is that they want you to order 500 pieces and there's no way I'm going to order a sample to see what they can make CU they're just going to send me one of my screwdrivers if I wanted one of my screwdrivers I would just walk into the warehouse and
grab one yeah um is the listing a scam though yeah the listing is in all likelihood a scam so there's a lot of so there's a lot of different takes on this you know one of the takes is see I told you it's just it was a matter of time there's a lot of like oh LTD better watch out for this is the third shift and then there's a lot of people that actually understand what's going on here and that is that this manufacturer is fraudulently claiming that they make this screwdriver it is possible that you will get
something in the mail that resembles our screwdriver but I promise you it will not be ours um and the attention to detail that it would take to get it to be RS would not be put in by this manufacturer there is absolutely no way because even though it's a seemingly relatively simple mechanical device the devil's in the details it's easy for them to make one actually it would be relatively easy for them to make one screwdriver that pretty much is pretty similar to the LTD
screwdriver to mass produce it with the kind of quality that we do would be really difficult and that's what took so  um yeah so so that's the thing yeah is that trickle down economics thanks twitch chat I can always count on you Dan I want to make another facial joke lldd how would you suggest verifying a user's child's age on social media without age verification just do it the old mostly ineffective way yeah there's honestly I don't I just don't see how you're going
to do it no database should contain that information about anyone least of all a child kids yeah no uh just yeah I'm sorry I don't have a solution to this uh and and lean on the services a little bit to ban users um if they're detected to you know not be a kid hey dll how far away do you think AMD is from catching up to Nvidia on raid tracing do you think they will sure and then Nvidia will move again um the only real hope for AMD is that Invidia gets distracted kind of like what
happened with uh Logitech and gaming mice in like The Late Late 2000s um and like I guess the early 20 late late 2000s early 2010s Logitech owned gaming mice and then they were just like oh a webcam butterfly holy crap what what the heck  Razor that that is a that is an accurate Recreation actually quite accurate exactly what happened I'm I'm a little frustrated with Logitech right now um my my mouse died again I've had a lot of this one Mouse um me find Logitech g i I have been uh I think it's
maybe fair to say a Logitech Fanboy for most of my life their their forms for their mice just work for my hands and their support is or at least has been legendary fantastic and it's pretty easy to win me over with really really good support and I've really really really liked their mice now they released a thing called the power play yeah I love my power play oh my goodness the power play is amazing okay the fact that more people don't use it drives me nuts it's really expensive
Luke it is very you probably didn't pay for it I did actually oh yeah I'm surprised yeah did you pay for the most that went on it I paid for the most recent one that's going to go on it I don't know about all the previous ones I I paid for the most recent one and the previous one before that I just mean your Tech life gets kind of subsidized so when you splurge on a thing I'm a little impressed that you bought anything but then I'm I'm less impressed because the total cost of
your entire setup is like maybe a grand or two and it's worth like you know 5 grand or whatever yeah yeah yeah so that that's that's totally fair it is it is very expensive I just really really like the power me too I really like it too it's just F really expensive for what it is like the the thing the problem it solves in your life is that every couple  this but it's awesome I know it's awesome I don't it doesn't even it doesn't even increase the amount of USBS cuz you can connect your mouse through
the power play which is like thank you of that argument is it doesn't even reduce the number of cables on your desk because you still have to run a cable to the power play like it's just I'm just I'm just happy they thought of that you know it's just it's just actually a waste of money yeah that I love and you love and we can love it even though it's a waste of money it's like children or my employment oh my goodness um right now if I go to gaming mous pads on Logitech G the photo is for a power
play mhm where you going with this I don't see it oh because it isn't a mouse pad it's probably something else you're also in the Canadian store I don't believe you're allowed to buy avilable in Canada can't buy it in Canada oh yeah so you can only have it because you are a special snowflake wait is that the reason why I ran into this I hope not okay I love that you can sort by power play compatibility yeah okay so here's my whole point Pro X super light 2 right right right right power play
compatibility no well try power play in instead of power play compatibility go up there's a power play what four down yeah well it's just the same thing as power play compatibility that's hilarious what but yeah no you can't you can't buy it in Canada I don't think I mean Canada doesn't exist anyway it doesn't say it works with power play though you can probably buy it on like amazon.co.uk and like get it imported or whatever but no I don't think you can buy it in Canada I'm so upset I know I bought a to
be fair I didn't look into reviews of the super light 2 but I bought a prox superlite because the super light 2 was  compatibility I already opened the box it's on my desk I'm [Laughter] screwed at least it's not me who's an idiot on the show for a change man you know it's refreshing actually that sucks why doesn't it show up on her power play compati ility why is there two power play buttons I don't know that isn't even the thing I wanted to be upset about I'm actually more happy with them
about this cuz that's easy to fix I thought they dropped power play compatibility from new devices and I was like wow that sucks a lot no power play is great and power play is not going anywhere as far as I can tell that's great I updated with a bigger mat and maybe USBC or you know something or yeah that'd be cool man people saying I didn't do the research I I went on the official website and clicked power play compatibility and it disappeared I I  research I really like the mouse I think it's okay to be
honest but yeah I had I've had three g903 now and the left click has broken on every single one of them it's almost like all of those switches just come from a commodity Factory and Logitech are not special yeah people game pretty hard these days too like I don't know man I feel feel like uh I feel like we go a little harder on our gaming peripherals that might be true like when I was a kid I played a lot of video games but I think by today's standards it's like not a lot not much yeah all right it might it
might be reasonable lifespan I haven't looked into like the expected clicks and stuff like that um but yeah and I'm not ditching them because it's still my favorite Mouse like I'll go I'll go try I did get a different Logitech most this time but I like this one too their forms just work so much better for me and I mean it feels great so like I don't I mean I regret not knowing that the two works with it but I'm happy with it anyways so that's fine yeah hello w. dll Luke other than the
difficulty of building a kickass streaming platform what is an interesting challenge as CTO for lmg that we haven't heard you talk about before oh you've heard it all before um okay entering entering as that role into the hell Nest that was the setup was a wild experience that I would not want to do again um and is still like a giant problem um the the the constant battle between trying to decide whether or not to fix the current fires or build a thing that will help reduce
new fires is is difficult to deal with because there's so many like massive projects that you would have expected to be done a really long time ago that we're never done um that we need to do but there's a lot of current fires so balancing those two problems can be difficult y y y y it's all a thing but it's getting better Sean's been doing fantastic it's been cool seeing him in videos now um working with Dan and a team too yeah I think so yeah um so yeah it's getting better we'll get there it's
okay but it's it it it's been a ride I'll say that much the super late 2 appears to be on amazon.ca I bought a mouse it's on my my desk I'm not going  expensive I'm not I'm not buying another mouse right now straight up uh I'm responding to a merch message that hasn't been read yet um Thomas C says hey LT I wish that more people would talk about accessibility with VR I have one eye there are some VR games where I physically can't get past the tutorial can you try the Vision Pro with one eye
um interesting the scanning didn't work but I wonder if part of the reason for that is that I trained it with two eyes so I'm going to see if I can find the thing to try it again uh I don't know I can never remember is it privacy and security or is it optic ID and passcode I don't know why would security why would your passcode be under security that's is stupid um gaze tracking Works which sounds like an entirely different thing um well you keep screwing around with that geek person man in chat said power
play compatible means the most requires a power core module to be installed in the most and power play means it's just built in cool all right I'm setting up optic ID The Gaze tracking is definitely a  though makes sense nope won't do it oh no optic ID with just one eye yep can confirm definitely works with two eyes um all right so apparently the Apple Vision Pro has accessibility options maybe there's something you need to turn on accessibility eye input both eyes oh left eye only right eye
only all right there it is I still don't know if that works with optic idid but it definitely um does at least have an option for it so that's pretty cool uh good guy Apple that's it for that for now I find it makes my eyes really tired using that yeah I'm back I haven't used it for the CU you were using it for like whole days right I've used it for as much as um like 3 hours at a time and that was a lot yeah that makes really a lot like I I didn't have it on for that long
realistically um and I didn't run into those problems but I suspect you're hitting more around the like hour hour and a half mark where it starts to get pretty old y yeah even at like half an hour I'm kind of over it I'd rather just you know what one of the one of the things that really bugs me is seems like a really stupid little thing it seems like such an obvious fix but um I actually hate that I can only pin apps in 3D space I want to pin apps in relative to me space Oh you can't do that not as far
as I can tell but this is yet another thing that I I haven't spent a ton of time looking up how to do things yet I'm thinking on on like what I've seen online in videos people say you can you can so then okay then that's something that will help a lot because yeah sorry keep going uh travel mode apparently is what it's called so yeah I'm going to play around with that um it's not going to fix every issue that I have with it because realistically most of my problems are
just caused by that I just don't really want this thing on my face right now um it would be nice if you could do both like I would want to have some that were fixed in 3D space and some that floated with me uh you I could I would imagine that you could probably do that maybe oh wait not yet travel mode is only really made for airplane usage Etc speaking of airplane usage I was sitting sorry don't walk with travel mode though okay well then that's not really okay then that's not really what I'm talking
about okay I'm going to insert now so oh I've seen a video of someone walking down the street with Google Maps pinned okay I'll have to figure it out um but yeah that's not what I'm talking about I'm talking about that I want to move around and I want it to just stay fixed to me rather than fixed to the environment and it sounds like what you're talking about is travel mode um figures out where something is based on its proximity to the Head rather than based on the map the headset builds of
the world around you because of low light so I noticed that I was sitting in um my computer room at home and you know how our lights are automated and just turn off um so in what would be probably like cabin cabin brightness on an overnight flight it was not able to handle tracking very well it would it would often lose tracking and have connection issues and and and hand tracking issues so that makes a ton of sense that travel mode would be for like that that's what travel mode is
is a way to not have it reliant on that outside map that it's building but that's not what I was asking for so I'm just going to I'm just going to have to do a little bit more figuring out I'm sure I mean unless that video is just fake but I I've definitely seen could be person was walking the yeah absolutely I've seen a person walking down the street and the the I'm assuming Apple Maps are whatever but some form of map application was fixed on the left hand side of their view no problem Captain
Cosmo hit me Dan hey dll speaking of AI fakes how do you expect the world to adapt to combat this we all know laws mean nothing especially when millions are at play should we be going back to carrier pigeons I think there's not a bad suggestion in person yeah someone made a comment earlier about our handshake deals back back I had a conversation about this $25 million thing with my roommate a day or two ago and we were both talking about how like yeah if you needed to transfer $25 million should
someone just fly there and like do the deal or or even like if you if you need to get a confirmation like oh this the CFO was on the call or whatever like it's $ 25 million maybe you should go to the cfo's office yeah and like see them in person just to be like hey just confirming you know and like you're going to have to work at a place where that doesn't seem weird so you'll have to like inform people around that you need this extra layer I mentioned maybe you have to call them on their cell
phone as well as like a form of two factor for communication uh so okay you have you have like uh someone on teams tells you to transfer 25 million or someone in a uh video call tells you to transfer 25 million okay well you call them as well and you might see them on the video like answer their cell phone and be like hey uh but if someone has their team's account and they have their cell phone like that's that's another fairly significant step  yeah yeah yeah go for it so apparently
uh Ryan Tran did it but he had to pinch on the app to hold it there while he was like walking oh yeah that's not what I'm asking for I'm aware of that I've done that that probably explains the video I saw though that yep that explains it so the fact that that workaround is necessary and the fact that this made it to actual release with no one being like Oh yeah that's the thing we should obviously do is just sort of baffling to me especially if they have this travel mode where they
map relative to the headset rather than relative to the map created of the environment around you I sure fake pinched finger  genius could like sucker it onto your chest terrible I love it I love it uh lus question why are you still running the damaged note 9 I honestly was expecting you to have moved to the Samsung 24 Ultra by now mostly curious um once again the answer is going to be a lot less cool than what you might imagine it is a ton of work with all of my like setting up my notification
settings in every app so that the things I need get to me and the things I don't need don't bother me and authenticating all the bajillion things that I have to sign into uh it's just it's a ton of work for me to switch phones and I had intended to switch over to the fair phone so I for that review man I put in the work so that I wouldn't have to carry my note 9 with me at all with the LG Wing I carried the note 9 for like 2fa like I I didn't really use it but I like I knew I
wasn't seriously switching to the LG Wing I made myself use it but I didn't I didn't put my whole life on it with the fairphone 5 I did I was like I am switching to this phone they're going to support this thing for seven years or whatever it is so this will be like even if I move on to another phone after this this will be the one that'll like have all my stuff you know like that that social media uh or that um that messaging app that I only use to communicate with people I play badminton
with in Taiwan like I'm going install that one on there and migrate all my  crap I don't like going through that so upgrading phones for me is actually a hassle and maybe part of it is just like like PTSD from doing it so many times back when I would be reviewing a different phone every month or two like I think a lot of people were like oh line is so lucky he gets to use new phones all the time I freaking hated it it sucks it's so it's not a good experience no it actually sucks
um so I gave up on it and I switched to the note 9 so it has my whole life on it and I I did that with the fairphone 5 and it ended up being a complete waste of time because spoiler alert is  5 yeah I'm done the review yeah so I don't know I'll switch to something else at some point I I I I would consider an s24 Ultra I I just nothing has sung to me I like I liked the folding phones though that was cool I I switched over to the fold three actually Dan I still owe you that fold
three uh I need to get my pictures off of it and then as far as I'm concerned you can do whatever you want with it I told him if he if he fixed it fixed it then he could use it uh I've just been really slow sorry Dan it's sitting on my desk at home I will deal you don't you don't have to I mean I hate all phones now because you ruined the last one that I loved well Dan that's no no no no no that's not the way it works once I say something then I have to it's it's not up to you you to decide if I have to I
have said I'm doing it therefore all right I'll do it that that I just don't want you to feel forced by social convention no I'm forced by me I'm forced by because I said I was going to do something okay um very very simple to me a verbal contract is a contract um anywh who the point is that I I just um don't like doing it and to me the three extra seconds or actually on this thing in some cases 30 extra seconds that I might wait for an app to install on the rare occasion that I bother to install
an app on my phone uh is just not worth the tradeoff of the 3 hours that I'm going to spend migrating everything and then the occasional you know 3 to 30 minutes that it's going to cost me down the road when I realized there was something I missed and I need to go back  pain hello W wo and winess does float plane give you any interest in Cross statistics with YouTube for example are there any similarities or differences for video retention original float plane invoice 314 yeah Luke um tell me what
kind of analytics does float plane provide and how do they compare to the YouTube analytics very fantastic analy we have the best my friends tell me that  analytics yeah so that's how you know it was the biggest lie of the show we have basically none uh there's certain things that we can ask AJ to like manually pull up or ask Jonathan to manually pull up uh but there's yeah there's pretty much nothing um I don't think it's you know they don't use Firefox yeah like there's there's stuff
we can check um we have nothing we don't even know how many views we're getting I know AJ's here we can guess but like basic it's it's a basically all guessing so it's just like I don't know what yeah YouTube's guessing they just have the best guessing they are extremely good at it um but like that's taken a lot of effort so I don't know we would have to have an entire team that is much larger than the entire float plane team that just did that if we wanted to even approach I mean we we
could get pretty accurate probably but like ad ad blockers block a lot of stuff that aren't ads um and a lot of you guys run ad blockers so it makes certain things unnecessarily hard to be clear when you're on float plane running an ad blocker we don't care there's no ads on float plane it actually has zero impact other than that we can't build analytics we do care though because there's there's more than there's more than just like views analytics that we can't capture we also can't it also muddies
the Waters of capturing a lot of other things like well what would they care about though I have to go back over it again oh what would they care about nothing oh okay yeah it just affects us and our ability to know how the site's being used uh to to see infrastructure and like okay I understand like that I it's been a long time since I've had this conversation so I might be saying things that are slightly off but it's like it's definitely not helpful troubleshooting info for us yeah exactly like it it
blocks us being able to figure out troubleshooting stuff I understand there are sites out there that are pulling information to like sell by doing those types of things so I get it and I'm not telling anyone to whatever this isn't this isn't that conversation um but it is annoying when you're like actually just trying to do good things and it becomes inaccurate or you can't or whatever else because of that stuff um okay Q qos info for isps yeah that makes figuring out routing problems really
hard when you can't figure out routing problems got it um like it's yeah it's it's super annoying um but again I get it um it's just yeah if you're someone like Google you can find workarounds you can do various things you can improve it um at our scale it's like oh man is there  sick love it Duke Linux and Don good evening Duke uh Final Fantasy Tactics you should play it Linux if you had to choose Final Fantasy 6 remake or tactics remake or  2 that's a pretty good question 26 years 
fft well Final Fantasy Tactics has a sequel so I'm not going to ask for that um if you're asking if I would want like a worthy sequel like as good or better in every  remake I think I'd find it easier to find the time to play that I tactics game would just completely absorb my life and so that's a very selfish reason for choosing that but you asked me so I guess it that's fair it can be a me reason if I got like a like a real reimagining of six I think but then would I like hate it because it's not
what I like and remember no I I think I I would love to I would love to hear tera's story retold yeah I'm going to go with that yeah odd question about the business side as you build out your merchandise for sale how do you figure out the wait hold on I'm done with that yet though have you played any more six oh sorry uh no but I probably will be this weekend all right forget it sorry Dan go ahead sorry I even said anything odd question about the business side as you build out your merchandise
for sale how do you figure out the design labor handling costs behind the product itself so to stay profitable uh until Taran joined we just didn't we uh we eyeballed it uh that's that's on brand see this is why we have to take away their EXL cuz they're not even using it yeah um well they're still using it there there are people who use it down uh but like yeah we we knew approximately what our handling was from our 3pl because we know how much we pay them every month and we know how many
orders they handled but we don't know a lot of the fine details around um especially like product development costs like I have no idea yvon might know how much we spend on samples for clothing for example I doubt it um like she could maybe look it up it would be somewhat challenging um we uh Nick says we didn't eyeball uh we didn't eyeball everything the only thing we didn't Factor was OPC on a per unit basis uh I I am pretty sure that there are other things that we did not
fully um fully map out but I know that we I know that we knew okay so just to be clear we weren't completely Flying Blind I noidea I know what our income we knew what our incoming costs were approximately for like uh shipping and handling um okay but there's okay here's something that here's something that we just had no idea about was uh what our returns were costing we were just like oh uh we we think it's like within this range and it was somewhere pretty close to that range
once we drilled into it a bit more but were clearly some things that were just like oh yeah we'll we'll we kind of we kicking the Ken down the road and like in fairness to the team I'm not throwing them under the bus they were busy building new products and growing the the growing the revenue and uh you know figuring out how to how to keep up with shipments and there were some things that fell through the cracks there's some stuff that we've definitely got to clean up now though um and so  
see hi dlll if AI becomes proficient at extracting Benchmark datas uh Benchmark detail from videos through speech or image recognition would that change your lab's data plan and use it in LTD videos no at this point we really want people to have the data and so we are we're still full steam ahead with testing and and Publishing data um you know whether the full Suite will be available to non-paid account and things like that that's TBD um like how we publish it is to be
determined but we we want to test it we  it hey dll cable management whenn but more importantly what are your thoughts on digital identity SSI self Sovereign identity to combat AI impersonation I mean I think Luke and I have talked about that a fair bit on the  the only real solution is a decentralized one um Good Luck yeah good luck AI identity on the blockchain is that what I'm hearing yeah it's web 3's back boys hell yeah Cable Management though very soon speaking of
the team being hard at work on things uh it's a surprisingly complicated product for us to bring to Market it's it's it's not the kind of thing that I think is obvious to some who's never tried to launch a product before but you can't just you can't just sell cable Arch at price um because the back to the the question of handling costs that the handling cost of cable Arch would make it completely unsustainable for us to sell at a price that would make any sense for you so we have to make bundles
of cable Arch or bundles of multiple different cable Arch es in configurations that maybe make sense we have to find a way to communicate that uh we have to find a way to Market it um we have to find a way to present all of that on the website oh we're running into a problem there oh yeah that doesn't surprise me yeah it's like it's a lot of options uh and like visually explaining what it is and also having all the options and making it so that all the option combinations are not confusing
thing and all of that all at once is is it's a lot right now and I I don't think we have a fantastic current solution but we are working on it um had a call with a bunch of people um and there was some good ideas people were bringing up and we're going to try to figure it out I won't do much all I've got left is uh potentials Luke there's a lot in here for you sick oh wow it's just Luke for days I'm going to go get some more snackies Okay I uh I should have prompted you to had a read through of
these uh do you want to parse them first  yeah just give you a second here you very confused I just I one of them I just really I don't understand how it starts but I'll I'll feel the question anyways  I think maybe is it yeah sure uh we'll start with this one Whatever uh Luke how do you select data centers for float plane I just started looking into collocation and there are so many options at wildly varying price points uh this is a much better question for AJ if you're in if you're in float
plane chat AJ is hanging out in float plane chat right now um but uh my my thing that I'll add on is uh a very frustrating uh task that I've given AJ over the years is that you know we don't we don't have a VC budget so things need to be pretty cheap uh so so generally it's been like what's the cheapest possible way we can get this thing um and then we use a lot of ovh uh we're fairly in their kind of like ecosystem at this point and they're  I'm surprised to hear you talking about
that you're usually so Cy about uh o what sort of services we use and what specifically we use them for for certain things yeah but ovh is very easy to figure out that we use it yeah you used to you used to be you used to not want to acknowledge it so I'm just oh yeah I think I've always been pretty open about ovh specifically oh oh no I remember specifically you were just like don't give them anything I'm like okay oh yeah it sounds like me U but yeah over VH we we use and we
use a lot um and it's it's been pretty good for us uh there's been there's been times where there's been bumps in the road but like but ovh if you wanted to sponsor us and the reads were just we talk about our experience overall really good it'd be pretty chill really good and really cheap like very cost effective for what we get um and honestly talking to other people that are in other data centers and being in other Data Center sometimes ourselves as well there's bumps in the
road everywhere so like I don't had some we've had some doozies yeah but like I don't know Cloud flare went down not that long ago Google has gone down in some amount a disaster two weeks ago teams was like wck this happens to everybody um so it it kind of just is what it is overall the uptime through ovh has been super good um I don't know yeah ovh has been good it's been a proven good strategy the entire time we've been there that was an AJ thing from back in the day and a jake
thing actually both of them um so yeah we've sort of stuck there and then we've also worked with other ones as well but yeah hi bad colesterol LDL low density lipoprotein question for Luke have you heard of or tried the Skyrim companion mod where NPCs talk conversationally with you I have heard of it uh they all sound like AI so I I am not interested Luke Outlook lets you have different email handles for the same account and chooses which ones can be used for login isn't only using handles that can't be
used for login the most secure system I think that is super cool I didn't actually know that that's neat I feel like you can do the same thing with Google workspace I'm not sure though um I know you can do the plus Alias thing which is super cool but I don't know if you can completely change it I think you can  degree but I I don't I don't know if you can use it in that exact way uh but I I know you can to a certain degree because uh I have that so if you only emailed out of one that wasn't the core login I
feel like that would work so yeah I think so I think it works on both effectively and I think that is pretty smart yeah AJ saying you can have a primary domain ID and then your email is different yeah so that that seems like a good idea smart idea heyo W.D question for lonus as a fellow XR Enthusiast bullish on the monitor replacement use case is the immersed visor On Your Horizon I think AP but onethird the  cost I uh this this is the first I'm hearing of it never heard of this it
sounds pretty cool it looks like what they have they have apps for this Colors theme makes me think I like why what do you like is this just a link to Apple's website yep uh what the interesting uh it's on my radar now  potentials well I need to email this to myself so so I will not be helping Luke got him I'll curate this one go Luke Luke you come across as putting a lot of thought and Research into purchases what sealed the deal for you when it came to athletic greens this is a weird one
they're sponsor kind of sponsored the show today so uh do you want me to I absolve you of any responsibility for getting the sponsorship canceled okay cool sounds good uh um I'm just going to talk completely candidly but I think it's mostly good stuff to be honest so it should be okay um I gained a ton of weight over Co I was not eating very good things and I was extremely inactive when actually before that was kind of over I hit a certain point where I was like all right I need to figure this out
so I started getting a lot more active and I started eating a lot better but one of the ways that I started eating better was I started eating very regimented and I started eating a lot of the same things all the time um and by restricting my diet to a certain degree I wasn't getting as much of a range of different things so I was worried about um not having good nutrient coverage essentially I looked into a bunch of different solutions um I tried a few different solutions um I thinkal Solutions yeah
actually uh I think ag1 doesn't taste too bad um wow what an endorsement I'm I'm not like Dennis I don't think it tastes like pineapple and vanilla or whatever he says I don't get that at all but it tastes all right um where where does where is it between pineapple and banana and ass pineapple and vanilla I think is what he says probably somewhere in the middle like I don't I don't think it tastes great but I also have had a bunch of other ones worse it's got a half ass taste I I've had ones that are a lot
worse so like I I wouldn't want to dog on it for its taste and I Dennis isn't the only person that I know that has mentioned pineapple specifically and he's not the only person that I know that think it tastes legitimately good so I like actually don't want a dog on it for its taste um yeah and anything that is in the  super it's an interesting area I don't really want to mess with it um ag1 is seems to be fairly reputable as far as I can tell um they seem to be pretty legit and I go with it for that
that reason mostly I did I did quite a bit of research there's a there's a bunch of people saying that there's like uh equivalent Alternatives that are cheaper but then I when I was looking into those I would often find not always but I would often find threads of people talking about how um oh the way that they make some thing or whatever is not up to whatever whatever I don't know blah blah blah stuff that I don't understand enough about and it seemed to be more legit
more trustworthy to me I don't know I'm not saying that you should take my research and be like well I'll just get it then this is not part of the ad at all I have no idea I am not an expert on this I know nothing um but it seemed legit and I understand it was a bunch more money but it's uh I'm not I'm not I'm a little sketched out by supplementation in general but it's something that I did want to do so I went with that one cuz it seemed the safest I don't know that's it and last one I've got here got my
13-in framework in last week and I'm loving it do you have any updated thoughts on future GPU upgrades for the now 16 for the new 16 coming out uh PS unpopular opinion no beard is better that is an unpopular opinion um the hell's wrong with you I don't have any updated thoughts other than that hopefully framework can find Partners who will continue to develop GPU modules for it and we will get some in gpus I mean hopefully we just get some choice in GPU options that don't
suck in general and that would benefit framework and and that's it for the wship we'll see you again next week same bad time same bad Channel   bye
