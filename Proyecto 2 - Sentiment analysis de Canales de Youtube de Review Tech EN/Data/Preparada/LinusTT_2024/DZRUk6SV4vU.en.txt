congratulations Apple you finally done it there may have been a ton of fluff at this year's iPhone launch event but those nuggets of goodness in between have taken me from H as a tech reviewer I'm probably overdue to daily and iPhone for a bit to I want the new iPhone now all I have to do is figure out whether I want to spend a kidney on a 16 or give up my liver for the 16 Pro Max and while I'm at it whether the airpods fours with ANC are worth the extra 50 bucks over the regular one actually the new watch
looks kind of of compelling too so let's dive into everything that Apple announced and I'll let you guys know what parts of the ecosystem I'm excited about and which ones are going to have me missing my trusty note 9 and I'm going to dive into the segue to today's sponsor paper like transform your iPad with paperlike 2.1 enjoy the feel and stroke resistance of paper without sacrificing screen Clarity thanks to their microe technology called Nano dots check them out in the link in the 
let's kick things off with a product they didn't launch the airpods pro 2os these are my daily drivers and while they are expensive I got to say it is both cool and very appreciated to see software updates that enhance a product I already own and the best part is one of the new features could save a lot of people a lot of money not only are hearing aids Limited in their functionality I mean they're the definition of a one-trick pony they're often prohibitively expensive for no
apparent reason now Apple's interest in Health Products has been clear for quite a while and now that hearing aids are available over the counter and I mean hey Tim Cook ain't getting any younger it looks like they finally pulled the trigger taking the airpods pro 2os from being one of the most expensive wireless earphones to one of the most affordable hearing aids well done apple and if you wanted the opposite they are claiming to offer built-in active hearing protection
now as well now it's not professional grade I wouldn't expect to go target shooting with a pair of these in but prevel ANC should at least take the edge off of lighter activities with up to two times more noise cancelling power and the coolest part is they'll be blending these Technologies together I often use ANC to tone down the environment around me and I'll never forget the time that I got a DM from someone in our audience who had sensory overload issues as well who told me how happy they were with my
recommendation now that they can finally enjoy being in crowded spaces except it can still be kind of awkward when you bump into someone that you want to talk to and you have to give them the old sorry uh one sec well no more with adaptive audio Apple claims that they can automatically prioritize The Sounds you need lowering your music on Q then they can crank your media and your ANC back up whether you're an Apple fan or not that's pretty awesome oh and I guess there was also some new hardware the
airpods 4 non-pros are getting an a andc option if you want to pay a little bit extra I mean personally I think if you're already moving up from 130 to 180 I'd rather have the pro tws with their silicone ear tips for probably better noise isolation but it's nice to have ANC available in the regular lineup and the regular 4S are also getting some other minor upgrades including USBC charging oh and I guess the airpods max is getting USBC charging in some new colors for the dozens of people who care
about those now let's talk about the iPhone just like we saw on the new iPad Pro Apple skipped a chip generation on the base iPhone going from the a16 bionic all the way to the new second gen 3 Nom a18 this puts this entire iPhone generation in a great position to support Apple's new AI or apple intelligence features they're claiming it is up to 30% faster for CPU tasks and up to 40% faster on the GPU of course though that is compared to the older a16 which is in the nonpr 15 range and it's
still a 2p core 4E Core Design but that's still a really nice uplift now all I have to hope for is that the Mac rumors rumor is right and that it has 8 gigs of their new faster memory instead of Apple cheaping out as usual they didn't mention how much RAM the new phones have in the presentation and the text speex page is annoyingly devoid of Minor Details like how much RAM my pocket computer has even so it's definitely looking like time to make the switch at least for a bit the action
button now comes standard I love that the display can get super bright up to "2,000 nits but more importantly for me" it can now come down to a shockingly dim one knit guys don't underestimate how important that is if you're using the phone in the dark next to a sleeping partner and this is cool if the third party app support can let me unlock my car dude I might make the change permanent I mean seriously Porche this key really does make it look like I am compensating for something anyway the
iPhone 16 can shoot spatial images now for those Vision Pro users out there and the new macro photography option looks great honestly the biggest Factor pushing me toward a new iPhone though is IOS 18 it genuinely looks like the absolute bomb and sure whether the neural engine and apple intelligence is going to change my day-to-day life is yet to be determined you can't Overlook Apple's execution here they have recognized the AI boom and all the pressure that's on them to be a leader
and they are just plowing head first into it so if they can bring some serious Hardware to the table I mean I never even mentioned the juicy camera upgrades the out of this world screen durability claims or the new colors and they can manage to make their contrived AI demos actually translate to real world use the rest of the market needs to be figuring out how to react to this announcement I'd say the only thing seriously missing for the nonpr Pro Models is any mention of a 120 HZ
display I mean you can get high refresh rate screens on like several hundred Android devices now and I hate seeing this kind of Penny pitching on what are still premium devices I do get that they want to push power users to the pro but I kind of hate that here because all of the pros other advantages most people don't need them and in some cases they seem really small like for one thing Apple specifically avoided comparing the premium A8 Pro chip to the regular a18 well that's probably because if we look
at Apple's math 30% better than a16 and 15% better than a17 Pro appear to be pretty much the same thing I guess the new encoding capabilities that allow the Pro Models to shoot 4K 120 FPS is kind of cool the screen is also a touch bigger on the pro lineup with smaller bezels you get faster USB always on display okay that's pretty cool and they're made of titanium instead of aluminum but even with the new image processor I just don't see professional work environments ever swapping over to
shooting on a phone versus using a proper camera that is unless they're working in extremely tight spaces just like you can use our new Precision screwdriver for tiny electronics and tight spaces LTT store.com Apple says that the new iPhone 16 Pro is like having Seven Pro lenses in your pocket but is it really maybe for travel vloggers and that bit where they shot the weekend's music video was legitimately very cool props to those guys but without proper support for interchangeable lenses it's just never
going to be above hobbiest grade coincidentally guys we just shot an entire video with the iPhone 15 Pro Max and our Shooters made it work it's a pretty good-looking video but they really missed the larger sensor of a proper camera and it took some doing to get the lighting to make it look that good I'm getting some nods from my camera guy right now the new audio mix feature is actually super cool looking "though at $11,000 for the pro and ,200" for the pro Max it's hard to justify
when most of the new hotness like the action button and the camera control features are on the base models as well and I think I'm probably going to go with a non-pro plus changing here like we saw with the airpods pro 2os Apple has decided that the Apple watch Ultra 2 it's good enough already so it's just getting a software update and now comes in satin black and has a new band very nice but that's an $800 watch and while it is great to see ongoing software support it's even better to see Hardware
improvements for everyone else in the form of the Apple Watch series 10 it's nearly 10% thinner than its predecessor while sporting a bigger display and their new S10 processor with a four core neural engine they've also got this Nifty new wide-angle OLED that supposedly increases brightness by up to 40% when viewing it off axis which to be fair it's probably a pretty common use case for a watch if you want to do a quick sneaky sneak what time is it it do I need to go and there's more the display promises
faster refresh rates and always on mode and the series 10 also charges faster allegedly 80% battery in just 30 minutes which is great for those of you who use it for sleep tracking also the antenna is built into the back making it one solid piece and you can get it in titanium which should be 20% lighter than the old stainless steel versions and leave your wallet over 20% lighter while it's at it the series 10 can now also play audio from the speaker I don't know how important it is to me to use my
Watch as a Bluetooth speaker but hey maybe if you take calls from your watch a lot maybe the audio quality is also better I don't know they've also got cool background noise suppression working though so people should be able to hear you loud and clear when you're speaking into your wrist and that could actually be crucial say for example if you've fallen in a noisy environment and the watch is your lifeline for help because it's not an Apple watch this is illustrative Apple continues to Brand
their watches as not just Tech and lifestyle but as a way forward to a better life with all of their health and uh vital zap updates is detecting indicators for sleep apnea cool actually yeah that's super cool especially given how many people have undiagnosed sleep apnea but as an outsider I really don't think that adopting the Apple ecosystem is going to magically change my life I'm going to miss things like side loing apps and I may just have to maintain a cheap Android device on the side for the
handful of apps that I use that aren't available in my region there were a bunch of other smaller features that they mentioned like new watch band Partnerships and colorway there's some rehashing of the Siri updates that we saw at WWDC and they mentioned again how they're moving to 100% renewable energy and becoming carbon neutral by 2030 does this mean they will stop hiring contractors to shred perfectly functional devices who knows they also boasted of their supposedly verifiable privacy promise to
go along with all of this AI processing and to that I say really tell that to China and the Apple data centers that are allegedly able to be accessed by the CCP clearly Apple's going to bend the knee when they're faced with the prospect of being booted out of a Major Market but with that said it's not like I've seen evidence that they're any worse than the rest of our big Tech overlords and overall I'm super impressed with everything I saw today especially how long they continue to
support their older products Google finally offers 7 years of software support for their new pixels but they're only doing that going forward meanwhile Apple today is bringing iOS 18 to phones all the way back to the iPhone 10s a device from six years ago so there's a lot to like from what we saw today but I don't blame you guys who are watching this just to see what you're going to hate this year because as great as those devices may be it still is a very closed ecosystem and that's not for everybody
for the people who do like the ecosystem though including myself I'm going to give it a shot we're going to have all the new devices linked down below now I just need to decide what color of iPhone 16 I want and how I'm going to segue to our sponsor delete me what does delete me and a certain baldheaded action movie star have in common they're all about the families delete me's family plans make sharing and caring simple and affordable keep an eye out for everyone thanks to a central dashboard that lets
