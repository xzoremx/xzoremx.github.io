what's up everyone welcome to the WAN show Luke I can't believe it finally happened I'm in the news for something positive for a good reason yay I will say reading just the beginning of the sentence when I learned that it happened of like lonus is in the news again I was like Luke It's Not Me Under Fire this week but no it was good it's everyone else you know we've both been in the news for the same reason in the same country yeah with you it was the hotel thing anyway we're going to be talking
about the aftermath of the random Taiwanese Mall PC including apparently there have been interviews with the shopkeeper and with the kid who won it that's pretty cool I've been sequestering myself so I haven't heard too much about it but we're going to be looking at some of the information about it on the show this week what else we got this week uh o there were some major departures from donut media which um I figured there I figured there was some stuff we could talk about there there's
a lot of parallels between our our journey and donut media's Journey what else we got uh I I I I I definitely have two things that are ready to go uh live service games use fake Randomness and fake Facebook friends and fake other friends to manipulate players into spending money literally they put their like gullibility crosshairs on you literally they're like wow that person's profitable they'll buy anything yeah speaking of which we've got a really important LTT store.com present it that
way oh um okay we'll get to it later they'll buy anything and then okay but this is really cool my goodness you don't even know what it is yet if you want something that isn't cool the internet archive lost in court and Paramount deletes two decades of Internet history oh yeah yeah   oh the show is brought to you by ag1 HRS and updf also uh don't forget about our chair partner secret lab hey nice you still can't read mine but you can read his yeah nice yeah okay why don't we jump right into our first topic
that was so much fun shooting that video two weeks ago or whenever it was when I was over in Taiwan uh where where is our oh do we not is it not like in the dock the video itself yeah no oh no no I don't mean the video I mean oh yeah there we go okay Taiwanese media appears to have picked up in a big way the video that we recorded in guanga digital Plaza um super cool place we visited a random if you haven't seen it we visited just a random computer shop in the mall we made our decision based on who had the
coolest PC in front of it it was pretty cool so it's a good choice and we asked them to build us a PC for "$5,000 to see what they would come back" with and how it compared to an equally priced system from main gear also with Hardline liquid cooling the system they gave us was absolutely sick like the Builder freaking nailed it in pretty much every way the only thing that I would say that they didn't quite get right was the memory configuration and I'm very disappointed about this because Gary
from the lab pointed out that in the video when I'm troubleshooting the uh the memory speed that it won't apply Expo we apparently cut out the part where I said hey AMD has trouble running four dims at maximum speed so I doubt Expo is going to work so a number of people thought that I didn't understand what the issue was um I did but it wasn't really the point of the video the point of the video was that the solution was to pull out two sticks or ideally the solution would have been to
configure the system if you really want 64 gigs of memory with a 2X 32 gig kit in the first place so I stand by everything I said in the video I still dock some marks for that because I would not want to run a ryzen 7000 system at 3600 megat transfers per second but it's also it's it's not that it was broken it's just just that there was a performance penalty to configuring it that way everything else about the system dude did you watch the video by any chance I watched the whole thing
actually it was great did you see how he packed the GPU original cooler he put every screw back in exactly the place it would need to be so that when it's time to reassemble that thing easy I'm ready to do it I have never seen that before in fact I'm trying to think back cuz we secret shopped some competitors like way back in the day when I was at NC um and we got some water cooled systems in I don't even think they included the original coolers like yeah I doubt it even even
like all the accessories and manuals and stuff like that you can't take that for granted when you buy a fully integrated system necessarily but he included everything just like the system would have been if I was an Enthusiast custom builder and I built the system myself and I had all the pieces that came with it I was so so impressed by the build uh rather than trying to bring the PC back to Canada though which would have been a chore uh we decided to give it away to the first person that recognized us on
the street which wound up being a Taiwanese Junior High student at least one media Source did interview him and he said that in addition to gaming he wants to use the new computer to edit videos and experiment with llms uh this wasn't in the video because we had wrapped by that point uh but we went to the bakery that we were headed to and then on our way back he was still on the corner and his mom was there and she made an offhand remark about how he better use it for studying
which I thought was the funniest thing ever not just gaming you also better use it for so good of course it's a classic mom comment one of the Shop's social media accounts posted about video saying it was around 2 a.m. so I got him back that's okay if you watch the video that's actually a fun close to Loop right there he uh because there was such a high level of personalized service and I don't know what it is but like here in the Western in in in Western culture I don't actually like giving my phone
number to people when they ask for it cuz hotels will ask for your phone number and then they'll like text you incessantly and like I'm worried they'll send me offers and stuff yeah whereas with this guy I didn't even mind he's like yeah I'll add you online which means he doesn't need to have my phone number it's just like a social social media you could just delete them yeah it's just it's just like a messaging app and the the conversation was so smooth smooth and just I really for transaction
yeah it didn't feel skey it just felt like it didn't feel like he was collecting my data he asked you if you opened it and set it up because he's probably curious like are you happy with it does it work those types of things that's what I was getting to because he had me on on an instant messaging app he messaged me at 2:30 in the morning the night that I took the night that I took delivery of the system being like hey like is it going great and I'm like brother it's 2:30 in the morning to be
fair and I think you pointed this out in the video as well if I bought that system on that day I would probably still be up at 2:30 and I did tell him I don't know if this made it into the cut but I did tell him I have had like a gaming event this weekend and that's why I like needed it this weekend like he put on the he put on the gas to get that system to me because I mean Ivon asked him I don't know if this made it into the cut either but yeah he's building like three four five systems a day in
there and that system is not the kind of system that you build four of them in a day I don't I don't care what kind of PC Building God you are like that that takes time you could build maybe a couple of those in a day if you're really good um any anyway so I got him back because uh this is this is from the shops post it was around 2 a.m. and suddenly I was bombarded with phone notifications I wondered what Earth shattering event had happened oh God it turns out that guy I met is a huge deal
I even apologized to him and said I didn't recognize him oh did he send you another message online yeah yeah I'll bring it up I'll bring it up it's so funny I didn't know this part that's funny yeah know here's what uh here's what he said I mean I mean I don't I don't care man like it doesn't I I don't I don't I don't need the ego stroking well part of part of it is that video wouldn't have worked if he did recognize you oh I'm so glad so it's actually great that he didn't recognize you yeah
no I I and again that didn't make it into the cut but I I talked about that I talked about how important it was and how much fun it was being able to go in cognito again for a change like it is it ruins everything yeah when any of this type of content that we try to do is rough because if people are just like hey lonus well then you're not seeing what the shopping experience is supposed to be you're seeing how that doesn't mean to hide it by the way yeah you're because often we can tell anyways yeah
and it's it's the whole point is that it's supposed to be an authentic shopping experience yes and so it was it was really fun to be able to go Incognito man it was great um anyway hold on uh so so oh yeah so I I did message him after I took delivery and I said um uh the system's great I made a review video and I'm going to upload it in a week or two but I didn't tell him who I was I didn't give him any context for it he goes oh really can you send it to me I want to post it on my Facebook
um for and the number of like conspiracy theories in the comments about how like oh fake fake fake fake your bull your your detector is not working so you need to recalibrate the I think there was that many of those comments there was there there's there's enough and I'm speaking to those people just chill you know just relax um so I go okay I'll send it when I'm done he goes thanks dude I go my video's ready I send it to him he go he goes dude dude 100 people is telling me this sorry that I really
didn't recognize you and I go no it's better that way thanks for the amazing system you made the young man who won it very happy everyone is saying WTF man  him and he said thanks for your trust which I thought was really cool because he really did in good faith build me the best system for my money it K you know I didn't even compare to like what I could have gotten just buying the parts on new EG and assembling it myself because I don't even really feel like I have to knowing sort of approximate no that
was a good value it was a good value and if they took a little bit of profit margin then they should I know a few people that live in Taiwan and I've heard that it's actually pretty common to have people like that build your system because they they warranty it really well right and he even said in his video like yeah my warranty is a year or whatever but you have problems in two or three years just talk to me awesome aome super cool trust me bro guarantee and you know what I actually
trust him yeah because I've said I've said a hundred times a warranty is only as good as the willingness to fulfill it that is just a fact and even though he seemed legitimately confused when I asked for an invoice I'm not even kidding he's like oh yeah I gu he literally pulled out a pen in paper and just like wrote it to write me an invoice for the system like it wasn't even itemized or anything I'm like you obviously have no system for this and this is like not a thing you do very
clearly um but frankly just based on the interaction my level of trust with him is extremely high and I believe that if that young man who won the system were to show up there and like say hey there's a problem with this I'm sure he would deal with it yeah 100% uh chewy by the way said that he did follow through he posted on his Facebook nice and um Buddy says okay yeah um okay I hope you get some really great business from this he goes thanks so much I hope it isn't too late to subscribe to you
now yeah of course not have a good night he goes keep in touch if you need me I'll be here trust me bro by the way can I cut part of your video I was thinking to post on Tik Tok so oh you guys have to go check out his Tik Tok I guess he's he's going to do that I forgot about that yeah what is it I basically just said sure just add some of your own thoughts you know reaction video go for it um and then he goes yeah hey the news wants to wants to put it in on TV is that okay and I'm like yeah sure so um
anyway I apologize to him after watching the video I'm grateful he agreed with me on how particular I am about the product I did agree and man I don't think I I have built some good systems myself I've seen some really nice showcase builds at trade shows and stuff like that I've hung out with he could absolutely do trade show quality builds I've hung out with very experienced you know like uh like B and Rob from BS mods and stuff like that did I say bod and Rob I don't know Bob and Rod from BS
mods I think that his Bend Precision was on par or better than the best that I've ever seen and it was it's little details that end crazy was Peak probably the only person that I would say hands down could probably do better would be Charles from murderbox um and Charles would probably take four days to do the one bit no offense Charles if you're watching this I love you man but you know that what I'm saying is true so I just I just have so much respect but yeah he goes the P the pipes
must be neat and tidy uh Taiwanese media described the video as an excellent representation of the country and its dedication to the world of technology and I mean honestly speaking I it's not like I've actually lived in Taiwan but I've definitely spent a not insignificant amount of time there like overall I've been there for probably like somewhere between a month and a couple of months uh and I just have nothing negative to say I I I just I I love the people I I I just I love
Taiwan it's a it's a beautiful country um super super awesome and it was because of my past experiences in Taiwan do you remember the first year we went  restaurant yeah and didn't didn't they try to give it back to you because they thought you forgot it or something they didn't just try to give it back the lady in this just hole in the wall mom and po restaurant that we had no idea what it was and it was not a significant amount honestly if I'd realized how cuz it was my first year there and I we had a lot
going on if ID realized how little I was leaving this was our first foreign trip we weren't that used to currency conversion stuff and and and and like we know but like just weren't thinking about it if ID realized how little I was leaving I would have left more like it was it was an insignificant amount of money and like really just like keep the change kind of thing like it wasn't it wasn't a big tip or anything but we just left it and we were like okay thanks bye dude she ran I don't know if you
remember this but she ran I think I do she ran a block out of her store to return it to us and would not keep it and you look you know you encounter one nice person somewhere that doesn't tell you anything about about a culture right but it's just been so consistent and being in Taiwan I believed like I I I didn't want to make a video about getting ripped off by a little shop right like if I'm trying to if I'm trying to set a video up for success that's not the narrative people want
that's not the outcome that I that I want of course I would report honestly on whatever outcome I got but I like to I like to stack the deck in my favor right like if I have a pretty good idea that a mega corporation that has a history of skey behavior is going to rip me off then I know what the framing for my video is going to be and I know that people aren't going to be too upset about that whereas if I'm in this and Pop shop and I think they're probably going to rip me off I don't I don't want
to set that up yeah there's a chance it can happen I think Keith could have given me a better deal on some things anyway there's a there's a chance that that can happen but that's not that's not the narrative that I would write for the video if if I could write it um so with all my experience in Taiwan before I had so much confidence that I was going to get an awesome system that I wrote that intro comparing it to main gear with a pretty good idea in my mind what the result that they were going to
cream them i' I've spent a little over three months in Taiwan I just did a quick little notepad math calculation um I feel safer in Taiwan than here Taiwan is actually ranked the third safest country in the world it feels safe completely believe it anyone anyone old man young vulnerable lady I mean we've walked sometimes like an hour in a given Direction just like going out for noodles through Alleyways at 2 in the morning I never feel unsafe and it's not like they don't it's not like they don't
have societal challenges like anywhere it's not like they don't have people with substance abuse or mental health problems or whatever the case may be but I never felt unsafe there no everyone feels like they're on the same team and everyone's like and sorry to my point like old men young women they're out all times day and night just just and you go down an Alleyway and you end up just finding like cool coffee shops and stuff instead of getting sketched out like it's a totally different VI
that's the whole thing apparently they like work really hard to make it so that little shops uh make sense yeah yeah it's it's it results in a really cool Vibe because no part of the city really feels the same and you don't have like oh this one store takes up like an entire city block it's it's like all these little ones it I in my opinion it results in shops like the one that you're talking about where you have this really specialized expertise like I I remember going through that mall in I
think it was 2013 and finding like a a store that just specialized in discs nice like CDs and DVDs and whatever else and it's like the heck and to be clear it's not like they don't have chains I mean you can literally hakal Lugi from one Family Mart to the next Family Mart to the next Family Mart to the next one and you'll run out of lugies before you ran out of family Mars same with 7eleven and then they have another one I don't remember the name of it that's more common in the
South they're just everywhere oh which I don't remember the name it's like a red and blue got it logo whatever yeah basically the same thing uh anyway uh it was really cool to see the news media pick up on it I had a ton of fun making that video I I would love to do more stuff like that I just I need to find a way those ideas you can't flow them every single day yeah I know be sick if you could I mean with that said I think we've had some videos lately that kind of deserved a little
bit more attention but didn't necessarily get it I think we've had we've had some we've definitely had some challenges kind of breaking out recently but you know the way I see it is when everyone kind of you know Clues back in and is like oh yeah let's like watch LTT again there's going to be a ton of really great videos to watch so the my Wi-Fi is better than yours video maybe the title in the thumbnail could have been different or something I don't know but that video was really good yeah
that one's actually doing pretty solid uh we just had some some ones before that that uh kind of struggled a little bit uh I think that factory tour in Taipei deserves twice as many views that was freaking awesome the way that they gave us access to everything GPU Factory like yeah you really saw how a GPU gets manufactured it was really cool um and they they held back nothing I I love that kind of stuff that's really cool yep yeah Power color tour uh all right do we want to move on to our next topic yes
no because instead I have been so excited about this for so long Luke we have quite possibly yeah I don't know what this is the highest impact launch that we have ever had on LT store okay because this product is going to drop like no other product okay I'm pretty sure I know what it is go ahead and open it up impact and drop being fairly key words here okay you want to be on the other side what oh well there's no word for me to  little you guys are probably wondering why I don't just do it myself because
it's way more fun to give it to Luke to   it yeah okay okay can I say what it what do you call yeah yeah do you want to set it up let's play sure how do you get it out of here without smashing uh oh turn it yeah yeah yeah yeah okay well he's he's figuring it out folks he's figuring it out okay this my friends is a no no do not use that J word do not use that J word in my chat this is GPU crash Tower game it sounds like a mobile game knockoff you can buy more blocks for $4.99 it's definitely a knockoff of
something but it's not a mobile game GPU crash Tower game Clash of gpus is fun  GPU six Unique Designs has one of six Unique Designs that get this cover all six sides dude wow dude wow our cost is ridiculous yeah I'm sure look at the Quality look at the quality of the laser engraving I definitely know that's not how you that's not how you pull a brick out I was trying to inspect the quality that's not how you pull a brick out pull a brick out all right okay pull a brick
out properly I don't know the rules of Jenga excuse me the rules of GPU crash Tower game Clash of GPU Tower game um people are saying one hand also once you touch it you're committed okay wow what a what takes out a middle block take out your middle block AO [Laughter] oh wow all right I was going to leave that how it is no what oh I put put on the top well you're supposed to look at it first but now you've put it on the top so now we have to you can't take it back off I just did what are you going
to do about it what is wrong with this guy what is your problem also you're not holding it where the people can see oh my goodness can you even how's the quality though what do you think why do you have eyes on the side of your head zoom in a it seems nice Dan's giving you some Zoom is that all the zoom you got Dan all right well the quality is outstanding there I'll just say it yeah I don't know how to evaluate like that quality but it seems nice you my life easy by putting that there I 
right GPU crash Tower game folks man we have been working on this one for way too long we went through so many suppliers to try to find someone who could not just achieve this level of um brick quality but was willing to do it because we engaged with at least it was one or two I can't remember we engaged with for sure  it how did it stay up what the heck that sounds like a you problem we engaged with at least one supplier probably two that were just like no no I'm actually not interested in making this
product really yeah well yeah it's like such a pain in the butt to do the printing on every side to do the printing to make sure that how much worse was it to do printing on like I I I I feel like if you had a similar H how do I say this the the the long faces versus the sides you just did the long faces instead of the sides like adding the sides I feel like probably added a lot is that true yeah maybe some of them it looks like don't have anything on the side I think that's probably cuz that
GPU cooler design doesn't really have anything on that side um but yeah Lloyd Lloyd did the designs for all these uh completely completely non-infringing designs not based on any real gpus oh wait sorry I'm not allowed to check things which one was the first one that I hit Clash of you I don't remember anymore say this  is this the most like anti-all um Clash of GPU game ever what does that mean what does that mean what does that mean what do we do no way I don't know I guess I got two what 
mean I feel like the rules are being bent here I feel like that's a you  all right all right no problem that's fine I got this boom wow boom wow indeed wow right there right there buddy I have no idea how this is uh Still Standing yeah exactly how can I break the rules of a game RK literally you know only exists on LTT store.com I I make the rules you there's no rules Tower crash the rule is so it's completely house ruled it's your turn quit stalling there are no rules in the Box it's
completely house rulle got him myus plays this like a bull in a china shop well yeah that's the thing right as long as you don't knock it down it's actually advantageous for it to be as precarious as possible oh oh my   um well I mean yeah can I just do the Linus maneuver and just pick up any extra ones that come out and just put them on the top and that might have been a that might have been a structural block there here I'm just doing Linus things  it  that oh man man all right I have lost
uh gpus hope you guys uh hope you guys check that out on the store it's uh appropriately $69.99 yes I know this is very expensive for a tower Tower crash wood block game but the quality of them really is outstanding we really did put they are actually like now that I look at multiple of them they are quite identifiable yeah I I mean I know what card this is  oh they're totally um designs that we came up with yes yes extremely unique yeah extremely unique I definitely have
no idea I mean I doubt anyone would get mad at us about it but um we definitely took some inspiration no anyway it comes with a really nice wooden box and it's lots of fun because you know it's that very similar to another mobile game that you've probably played before made of Beachwood um highdefinition laser engraving on every piece like guys look at this detail look at this level of detail this is Real World Graphics right here I was going to say that's probably actually better than the camera zoom in
we did cuz that's what it looks like in real life all right so if you guys are looking for something to pick up on the store to send a merch message this week uh that would probably be a good bet all right very satisf what you want to do what do you want to talk about next uh donut sure so major departures from donut media this week two major hosts Jeremiah Burton and Zack job have left the brand to form their own channel Big Time Great Name by the way how did they get that
well they how did no one have they did and didn't oh so like their website is bigtimebig time.com oh yeah and their Instagram I think is it three times big time Big Time big time but how did they get the YouTube channel big time um cuz the website like who cares I don't know that many people that uh manually navigate to websites these days that's fair I don't think short URLs like matter anymore I think it's a great name yeah I think it's an awesome name fantastic name anyway um in their
explanation about their departure Jeremiah and Zach said that a turning point in their relationship with donut was its increasingly corporate attitude its gradual move away from Passion projects and its emphasis on growth Above All Else particularly after donut was bought out by private Equity Firm recurrent Ventures who also own several other Automotive channels they expressed feeling disheartened by pitching creative ideas and getting constantly turned down by their business focused
leadership likewise according to Jeremiah and Zach they were promised equity and donut at some point but received no Financial remuneration from the sale to recurrent their departure was featured at the end of a recent it says 2 million view video I think it's up till almost three now uh where they mentioned that they will still be seen Sor I'm talking about that's my notes oh that was on Donut's Channel that's on Donut's Channel got it got it so it was at it was donut themselves not so
obviously there's the there's the announcement video on big time but at the end of a video on donut they let um Zach and joob actually talk about the announcement of their Channel and they linked it in the description that's actually pretty classy yeah yeah that's why I wanted to include it because it sounded like uh it was all like it like that also they also linked to Big time's first video in the description um I do have to wonder and I'm not accusing anyone of anything but
I do have to wonder a little bit if perhaps um in order to maintain in order to maintain an you know amicable relationship um Big Time pulled some punches on their departure video I feel like it didn't really feel like it but I got to wonder I guess what I'm saying is I wonder if there's like even more they could say cuz it seems I don't know because there there's still like another thing that in the notes but I I watched the video um at the end of the donut video not the Big Time video at the end of the
donut video when they're announcing that they're making big time they also point out that they're still going to be hosting on donut um I thought that was just because they like oh they'll still be seen as some is that just stuff that's not edited yet though I don't think so so based on how they said it um it sounded like hey yeah there's some things that aren't edited yet that are going to come out that include us and the video after the next video features at least one of
them uh but I think both and then I I just don't remember I haven't watched the whole thing um oh they're they're they're finishing out their contract okay there you go ah that makes sense so it's clear that it's clear that both sides are are potentially still trying to play ball to a certain still trying to play ball with each other which I think is I think is a good thing but I do I I got to say this is something that I've I've wondered about a lot um because as you guys know there was an
offer to purchase our channel from a a very uh let's say uh a private Equity Firm let's say that clash of Clash of what basically they they specialized in in acquiring media media companies um both you know website and uh YouTube um and you know I got a lot of assurances that nothing would change and and you know all that all that stuff right and as far as I as far as I knew things were still going great at donut until all of a sudden things super weren't going great and basically I was
reading about this so it really makes me wonder if it was as if it was as if it was as simple as I'm not able to pitch my you know my ideas that I think are really good or if this has been brewing a little heavier for for longer cuz when when did the acquisition happen was it 2 years years ago 3 years ago it's been a while and that's something that's been pretty interesting to me is that a lot of the what is happening did we have extra blocks here yes oh um a lot of the fan reaction that I've been seeing is
like okay so just to be you know right on the nose about it they released a video immediately after the video that they announced okay things get weird because it happened on both channels the video that they announced that they were splitting off on the donut channel was "called we put an $88,000 bought a kid on" our $500 Ranger that video with 2 million views at the very end of it they announc that they're leaving then it links in the description to the other channel the next video on Donut's
channel is the is America ready for Chinese cars video yeah that video is covered in I guess this is the influence of the company stuff which you know what it definitely might be but we've seen this happen with the internet a lot we've seen this happen on our Channel a lot they hear something happened and then they're like oh this change that happened today is because of this thing for sure and it's like guys they were bought out a long time ago like like we said probably about 2 years or something ago
like this isn't this isn't new and like yes that uh that video might be because of contacts or whatever that this company has and they they got some sponsorship deal for it I have no idea I don't have Don was acquired over 3 years ago over 3 years ago yeah so the change that happened the next upload that's like that jump the one video to the next video is not what happened there's apparently another video from a behind the scenes editor who worked at donut that was more critical um you pass me the
front there you go yeah November November 2021 and yeah like I I'm not surprised it's uh it's not going necessarily perfectly and I'm I'm not saying that the hosts in the video cuz people were saying like they're delivery seemed kind of flat like they seemed uninterested in in this Chinese car um that they were that they were doing like a sponsored video on um and I'm not saying that they were super enthusiastic it's quite possible that they weren't especially enthusiastic about it um I'm just saying
that I I doubt that um I doubt that this change is occurring overnight in the same way that uh it might feel like it is because the news is breaking right now uh I don't know I just I know enough to know that we don't know enough if that makes sense 100% like there is it is very clear to me that people's the stories we're getting are part of the story what I know for I don't mean that in like that they're being dishonest or that they're like misleading us or that that's a bad thing
that it reflects negatively on their character that I'm not saying any of that I'm just saying it's very clear that okay kind of like when we left NC yeah and we still had a contra ual obligation I didn't have an NDA that said I can't say or I didn't have a a non-disparagement agreement is more like what it would be which is also an NDA I didn't have a non-disparagement agreement um or anything like that but obviously it wouldn't be in my best interest to be like yeah n cix
sucks and like their leadership is super dumb um and I didn't really talk about the structural issues with the leadership until they were dissolved as an entity and I no longer feared any legal repercussions right um so I do kind of wonder if we're going to hear a deeper version of this story at some point in the future is all I was trying to say earlier yeah another thing that I want to point not is that personally I believe that the comments that people are making under the videos uh condemning donut
basically is not helpful if you want if you would want to see this type of thing again uh because donut was actually very cool about letting them have that shout out in the end of that other video and linking to another channel that is not under donut in their own video like allowing that to happen was very cool and I think the coolness of that is being significantly overshadowed by people just crapping all of her donut um which is unfortunate I'm also super excited about big time
their first video Big Time excited yeah true their first video is sick um the fixing my abandoned project car Big Time awesome video there's there's some stuff like uh man what is it called it was like 100 hours in Brazil donut this video the I spent 100 hours in Brazil's underground car scene that video is sick and then the I spent 100 hours in Australia is underr car scene was also sick and that feels like the type of content that they were describing that they want to keep making
so like I'm I'm very excited about the Big Time stuff I just think you you should be aware of the impact of audience comments on the relationship that they still have and the possibility of this type of thing happening in the future if this is something that you liked and wanted I have another thing to say to the big time folks yeah you need to Big Time reply to your emails yeah I reached out to to I want to sponsor I want to sponsor Big Time nice yeah I'm going to send over some screwdrivers uh sponsor
sponsor a video maybe a couple videos maybe series dude I'm so excited about big time let's go the the second I heard this announcement I was like yes yes please I'm very excited let's go yeah so uh I I want to hear back from you guys um go go go check check your inbox make sure that your website contact form works it's it's one of those things where like you know you set up like a Squarespace site or what what whoever's powering in this first video from Big Time which I'm sure you haven't
seen cuz it launched like today uh at one point in time uh he's like the camera guy looks at looks at one of them he's like what are you doing and he's like oh trying to save the business basically he's just on his laptop like I think they I think this is legitimately very fresh yeah oh yeah 100% And and they're in like we got to make this work mode so and honestly two massive personalities start a new channel that already has a million subscribers like they probably have a
lot of emails right now yeah so yeah but  to all right cool going to be sick though I'm I'm really excited I Think They Came Out Swinging with their first video um apparently it's number three on trending right now so they're killing it big time I am glad we didn't take the acquisition offer yeah it's been an extremely turbulent period uh since the acquisition offer um there's been times that I've looked at it and I've gone like I would be I would be out at this point you know but that doesn't help
anyone else in the team um that doesn't help the audience um I don't think that is helpful to the Tech Community as a whole so I'm I'm at peace with it now seeing this especially I think this was uh trying to think if there have been cases donut was honestly like the case of corporate acquisition not being the end of a channel that I thought about when I was thinking about whether to accept the offer or not and uh I think may maybe maybe the conclusion just is  possible maybe it's not possible for our
channel to keep it Soul C can you guys think of an example of one that survived a corporate acquisition and I mean we haven't seen it's been 3 years they're still dropping 2 million view videos they survived they survived I'm not saying everything's peachy we don't know what's going on behind the scenes to me sounds like it's not perfect to at least be a a writer host there I wouldn't I haven't seen the editor's video I don't know what else is going on yeah it's man it's tough cuz like someone pointed out
smos they didn't survive the first one but they survived the second one yeah but they also weren't corporate B great on the third one they were botle by mythical yeah that helps a lot like come on that's not like yes mythical mythical is a corporation sure but it's also it's it's yeah they're okay theorists that's still too fresh for me super recent yeah yeah it's super fresh I um I don't I don't know and when I say survive I guess I'm talking about like the soul surviving um
I don't know if the soul is dead from donut I feel like people might be going in too hard um again it's been going on for three years people weren't really pointing this out until now um I'm sure on the writer side I wouldn't be surprised at all if it's gotten worse on the writer side more sponsored content more of your passion projects not being able to go through all that type of stuff what what they said in their video resonated a lot made a ton of sense but the channel itself I'm not talking about
the experience of working on the team I'm not talking the channel itself has been doing well the whole 3 years that's fair that's fair and and you know it's tough sometimes too because sometimes you'll have someone pitch a project and and I'm speaking from personal experience as as an owner of a YouTube media organization right you'll have someone pitch a project and you're looking at it going like guys that that doesn't make sense we can't do that and on their side they
might feel like well this is something the audience would love and something that I'm really passionate about and and and all of these things that you know I can hear these guys saying and I'm kind of sitting here going okay well yeah but that might make sense when you're doing it on your own channel and you're working 14 hours a day and you know understanding that you're not going to be paid for a lot of those hours but you know within within an organization that has to have you
know a proper overtime policy and has to have proper you know paid time off and has to have you know all of this all of this overhead and all of this admin administrative burden you know what it wouldn't have made sense because while you're looking at it going well this is a great idea and I could do this in two days it's like yeah sure if you spend those two days in a fever feverish working State and do and see absolutely nothing else yeah sure that could make sense but that's like 28 hours and I
can't afford to have you out of commission for you know that period of time not working on other things like it doesn't make any sense um we can't we can't have a operator following you around like that um all hours of the day like think about some of the stuff that we used to do back in the day like that Fallout bomb build where you and Brandon were here after midnight two days in a row getting that video done it was sick I do it again I know brother let's go but part of growing up as a company is
not asking that of people anymore right you didn't I I know but I totally did it behind your back yes I know sorry I'm just messing with you but also not expecting of people right so I'm I'm really excited I'm really excited to see how big time does I'm I'm just generally really excited about you know people in the YouTube space like starting cool stuff and this just seems like there's a lot of really good energy around it and I want to support it there that's that's all I really have to say there's been
there's been a bunch of comments in flow plan chat um trying to point out to me that the Channel's still doing well doesn't mean that the culture behind it and stuff is still great I just want to make it super clear that that's why I drew the line between the two I already knew that I have I just like you have really no idea what it's like there yeah that's what I'm trying to point out and one employee is not enough for me to go yes that is the 100% truth two is still honestly not enough you don't you don't
know the whole picture how many people work there uh I think it's like 40ish yeah so the the only way that I think I would be able to really tell what it really is like would be to work there yeah I mean that's the thing I know for sure is I'm super excited about big time everything else honestly I have no ability to impact and it doesn't matter just go watch big time enjoy the content it's going to be great yeah more is more is not more better or more is more is not more worse is what I
was going to say just more car content can't complain I mean it's uh there's there's there's a whole sea of viewers out there there's enough of them for both big time and donut to continue to exist yeah uh Kettle Kettle or no not Kettle Kettle uh long Linus says humble PC would not happen on bot LTT I don't think I don't think that's true we have been humble PC yeah yeah that was that like crazy build we did with the like "$5,000 worth of fittings or whatever it" was oh that one p just like just
ridiculous you know just just meing um and no no I no humble PC would happen on on bot LT that one we didn't we didn't lose money on that um however excuse me sorry however Kettle kettle's response uh I don't know about humble PC but April fools definitely wouldn't April fools wouldn't we lost so much money on our April Fool no chance also just time opportunity cost oh my goodness dude huge absolutely huge once there's shareholders the SCH is dead shareholders exist this company has
shareholders this is what I'm saying is like a lot of people I don't think a lot of people know what they're talking about when it comes to this which is fine but just be careful about the the anger that you're projecting because it might hurt things that you don't want to hurt that's all I'm necessarily saying unless you know what you're talking about um and pretty much none of us do I'm including myself which is why I'm saying all I know is I'm excited about big time because I don't really know
what's going on but I'm excited about big time because I watched two the two of their videos which is the videos that they have and they're both great and I'm excited about more that's it that's all oh we're supposed to explain merch messages and if you know what if it blows up completely and everyone quits in two three weeks or something then we'll know that'll be a solid indicator but I don't know right now we might know real soon or we won't I have no idea that's it I think that'll
be a solid solid indicator yeah and it could happen who knows we've seen this type of thing happened before didn't it happen with um SourceFed uh SourceFed imploded more slowly okay it was yeah it was a it was a very very slow self-destruction they basically just lost momentum lost momentum and kind of death spiraled and everybody bumped out yeah uh there there was there was a a pretty major Exodus of their primary onscreen talent that did happen pretty close together but I don't think there
were really any allegations of of it being like an awful workplace or anything like that I think it was just one of those cases is where what exactly was it about SourceFed that made them have to be on that channel mhm nothing so they just didn't and they went and did something else um if if it does go down something I would be interested to see is if like other people try to join big time or if it turns into like a bunch of smaller car channels or if some people just exit
the scene like seeing how it goes down would be very interesting um but it also so just might not or it might who knows I don't think uh speculating on that right now is all that interesting I'd rather just watch Big Time nice yeah all right Birch messages are the way to interact with the show uh merch messages all you got to do is go to LTT store.com put pretty much anything in your cart and there'll be a little box that pops up whenever we're live you can leave a merch message it'll
come up like this at the bottom of the screen where Dan will either reply to you he'll just pop your message up there he will curate it for someone internally to respond to you later or he'll curate it for me and Luke to reply to you so we're going to show you a couple of those to give you some idea of how it works and Dan hit me sure thing let's see I've got a couple here for you any status on the Lux backpack or original batch it's several weeks past the original Shipping estimate but haven't
seen an update on any W shows for a while uh as you can probably imagine from the Dual layer and failed Carabiner um fiascos our relationship with our backpack supplier is a little fraught um how with that said you should absolutely be getting a an update and I will I will um find that out for you or uh Dan if if your workload is not too heavy could you maybe fire an email over to Nick and see if uh we could get an update for next show can do okay perfect  okay and do you want another one yes
please all right uh cat. dll uh have you always been a materials snob quote unquote thoughts on why I didn't have much when I was young but now that I'm doing well I hate wasting time or money on subpar but now I get analysis paralysis I don't know that material snob is the way that I would describe it but but I do definitely appreciate something that costs twice as much and lasts five times as long so if that's what you're saying then yeah I I I I think part of it is not having much when
you're young when you don't have much and the thing that you have like breaks or doesn't last um it's so much more memorable and it's so much more impactful whereas I think you can tell really easily um when something is built with an eye toward uh longevity and I I can see how that can become something that you appreciate it's definitely something that I appreciate um one of the early revisions of this packaging for uh GPU Tower crash game um had an had a problem where if you actually look
at the top corner there do you see how there's a spot where there could be a little nubbin yeah right there um so there was a little nub in there that would break off too easily and so we actually redesigned it to not have the nub in and then have the top have like a different shape so that there's there's no nubb in there and the nubbin was cool because I forget it allowed it to wait I think yeah it was cuz the top would go in and then the front slid down and held the top in and
that was cool but then we did it the other way because it was more durable and so you have to really you have to really give thought to things to make them last a long time and it's just something that I that I appreciate um and yeah I I think part of that is from growing up and not having a ton yeah you  yeah one more Dan sure why not let's see um hi w.d. xe. r.z I've recently been checking out new cars and ensuring they support comma AI open pilot driving assistance what are your thoughts on
open- Source self-driving or assistance devices I've want ah man what keeps happening I've wanted to do a video on comma AI a couple of times and we just haven't gotten momentum for it a couple of times um I don't know M matter matter of matter of time I think what was what was one of the delays yeah we were going to we were going to install it in my van but it wasn't compatible cuz it doesn't have like a lan keep camera and then I think we had actually discussed doing it in
Andy's van at some point but and he didn't end up keeping his Minivan and then I I don't know we've we've kicked it around at least three times and then have ultimately decided not to make a video about it but it's absolutely something that I would like to do maybe I'll just I I'll re I'll ref flag it for myself to bring up in in writer meeting and and maybe we'll get that going okay all right you want to pick a topic Luke sure what else we have in the main topics um oh yeah live service games use
fake Randomness and fake Facebook friends to manipulate players into spending money this is wild and also the most expected thing ever oh yeah according to a recent article by Indie developer Adrien Laurent predatory live service games have developed a suite of Insidious tactics meant to manipulate players into making purchases that go even Beyond dark patterns and aggressive microtransactions these games are collecting information on player behavior and then algorithmically
adjusting the game's difficulty Loot drop odds and microtransaction pricing in order to extract as much money as possible by keeping players within the frustration Zone frustration zone is a thing that we heard recently about uh tarov as well for example if a player not that tarov does exactly this but they use it for other means for example if a player is advancing faster than expected they will get worse odds for random drops and the game will become more difficult than it is for other
players if the player is a habitual big spender they are less likely to be offered deals on microtransactions and may even have the difficulty and prices jacked up specifically for them in some cases the price of the same value microtransaction can be several times more expensive for certain players it feels like like Geo blocking prices which is normally done so that countries that don't have as strong of currency and and and GDP and stuff can still afford to like buy and play your
game is being used in the opposite to just make it worse for everyone which is kind of Epic uh Lauren points to Nexon the Korean MMO Dev that was fined $9 million from manipulating loot box odds to optimize player spending earlier this year but he likewise says that manipulation of Randomness to coers more money out of players isn't a problem specific to Nexon but rather a normal practice within the live service gaming industry which I'm adding this here this is not what what this person said but
which is probably why when you see live service games fail and they feel like they failed because they were a live service the company makes the next game a live service anyways is cuz they're they're looking for that that loot box of their own at the end of the rainbow uh while this practice is extremely common the sheer number of variables in a typical live service game make it extremely difficult for a player to tell whether they're being manipulated or simply the victim
of bad luck it also makes it incredibly difficult to prove given that many Publishers are not transparent about their drop odds or even lie about those odds yeah man it reminds me of the uh the gambling websites that sponsor streamers and literally give them money to gamble and then manipulate it so they win yeah wild uh further Lauren says that some live service games are using Bots posing as real players or even falsely posting a Facebook friend as the player of in the high score board both to make
Facebook friend of the player in the high scoreboard yeah both to make the player believe that they're performing surprisingly well before jacking up the difficulty and to create fake rivalries which is going to push people more especially to spend money naturally because you want to be better or at least competitive with your friends if you feel like you're falling behind uh and you're trying as hard as you can you might be more incentivized to spend  yeah it's rough uh Mr Lawrence suggested
solutions for the problem what can we do about it as a player be aware understand that Randomness in games is often manipulated and personalized investing money might not give you as much of Advantage as you think and be aware that your game experience can differ significantly from other players two if a game Studio you once cherish starts using predatory tactics don't expect it to revert to its previous ethical standards the developers who oppose such tactics have left or lost their
influence fluence if a studio backtracks due to backlash they may often just try to hide their tactics better some people also might not have left or lost their influence they might just care more about money now um support ethical Studios choose to support game studios that align with your values and stay true to your own values as a developer advocate for transparency transparency is crucial for healthy Studios and games manipulating Randomness to include elements players would disapprove of is
a slippery slope and two challenge unethical practices monetization stakeholders do not have a monopoly on ethics if a tactic conflicts with your values it is fair to openly challenge it there's a lot more in terms of like legislative Solutions but yeah um I mean that's it's rough I'm super not surprised yeah this is often we often go pretty hard in the paint on on the whole microtransactions thing and some people don't like it this is a large part of why though um like you are just straight 
yeah if it's a free game you played a bunch you want to support it you buy some skins that's one thing um this is just soy completely different level yeah and you know what I I do wonder sometimes if part of my well just don't buy it attitude is that I that I grew up at in a different time right when when this wasn't normal and now that this seems normal people are are more easily susceptible to it yeah the amount of dude the amount of money some of these mobile games are printing is
crazy unfathomable yeah it's it's it's unbelievable sometimes um also didn't understand how popular mobile games were and then uh trying to take public transit more often has revealed how popular mobile games are it's it's all over the place it's  Candy Crush as of September 2023 had  Revenue that's a with a B billion Candy Crush specifically not King yeah just Candy Crush Candy Crush Saga why are we making YouTube videos yeah really Dan we're making YouTube videos because we didn't think of that oh
Luke this is your fault that is true this is your fault is true I'll take the blame for that yeah yep that's true also we have integrity Integrity Farms let's go um how could we have integrity I mean I don't know I waste of time as soon as you say you have integrity you've you've already lost the game I think but now everyone lost the game would oh not that game you can't do that publicly oh why did you do that I got so many people right there what a low Integrity thing to do that might be one of the
biggest that that's pretty big PR bigway the reason that we don't use I got you all the reason we don't manipulate people in this way is because we don't believe it's right there that's the answer to that question the reason we don't sell anybody's data that we have plenty of people's data you know through the Forum um through the store the reason we don't sell any of that is because we don't think it's right there  simple you know the other reason why it's not necessary yeah we're
doing good you can make plenty of money we're doing good operating an ethical business yeah like seriously I'm fine we got a hundred employees more than that yeah I I've lost track that's why I just say 100 yeah just keep it simple yeah you just say over 100 yeah yeah I don't know sure it doesn't really matter much the point the point is the point is that you don't have to so that's what saddens me about this kind of thing is that they don't have  why I mean cuz it's quick probably
I suspect a lot of these it's really hard to make a game that actually uh like catches on and people actually play and then once you do if you were never in it in the first place for the art of creating a game which I think a lot of people are but if you if you weren't in it for that reason you're just trying to cash out you know and like people work at those types of companies for a reason they want the money I want the dollars man Cory is the name says at Linus as a small business owner
with Integrity I can affirm that I'm nearly out of debt heck yeah nice good job keep going Do It Go Hard pre congrats for when it happens yeah that's big heck yeah I'm not yet but working on it yeah  fault I have been multiple times and then every time I'm just a giant lab and a Adon Center at the same time let's go let's go all in again boys it's just kind of my thing my goodness yeah I know I'm not there yet come on uh all right uh what are we supposed to be talking about oh oh sponsor

about but AI Watermark removal is a super cool thing that exists very cool man can I can I just talk about how frustrating it is to me the the policies that photographers will have around not giving you the original files when you hire them like for a specific photo shoot really it it actually makes me legitimately Furious and what is that about why is that a thing it's a thing so I can tell you I can tell you the artistic reason what is there yeah so the the justification that will be
provided is that that's not the completed work um that that it needs to be retouched before you know it's suitable to be looked at and it's a reflection on their artwork if people ever see the the raw file that's been you know done in a way that they wouldn't have approved of then it's it's not their real art and therefore they don't but obviously it has to do with that they don't want you to have the raw file and do it how you would like to do it you'd have to pay for any touchups is that why um any
changes and stuff I I just why so that you don't have them but what if they just charged you for the the modified version the modified version whatever the the edited version the touch up version because I'm assuming they're shooting in like whatever those should in raw yeah typically um well no they they charge you for that but even paying for that I've I've offered to pay an additional fee to just give me the raw files and I've I've been turned down almost every time yeah I'm I just I have 
um yeah evulsion says my senior pictures for high school had the saturation and sharpness absolutely blasted by the photographer and I was like please just give me the raw yeah I uh I just it makes me extremely extremely angry it's art you're wrong it started with them selling prints yeah so so it's basically them controlling the final product that you get um and and putting you in a position where I can I could totally understand them saying uh like you have to buy the edited version if you want the
raw copyright the photographer owns the copyright so what I don't care it's a picture of me it's a it's a it's a picture of me like if you if you want to and literally I'm hiring you to do it so write a new contract where I own the copyright of it because I hired you to take this picture like he's saying he'll pay an increased amount of money yeah it's it's it's not really something that I think is is reasonable um and if you if you don't want to do it then yeah like by all means I just don't really
understand how this has become a norm um and if you want to if you if you want to you know take a picture on your own time and own the copyright for that that you aren't being compensated for then by all means if I want to buy it from you I guess I have to I guess I have to pay you for a print I have to pay you every single time I want a copy of it but you didn't and the rate at which you are charged for a private photography shoot is such that no I I I think you on the pictures like
no man right you got to be kidding me um I've definitely run into chill ones um so people are saying yeah raw files are proof of copyright to the photos okay well then yeah then charge me more and give me a contract where I own the photos that I paid you to take of me like I'm not I'm not talking about I'm not talking about you know photos that you took on your own time of some artistic subject or whatever about not compensating them for the work yeah neither of those things are being
discussed it's just it's it's like my  no anyway um yeah also that doesn't make sense 666 says a raw file does not establish copyright that's not how copyright law works I could see it being used as evidence um but if you just both have it RGB 86 says just because you paid for them to be taken doesn't mean you own the copyright that's not how it works that's why I said write a new contract where I do own it that's why I say things that I say in the way that I say them uh it's really important to pay
attention Chad's been rough today I know they're trying they're trying really hard okay should we do another topic um yeah what do you want to talk about what about this Korean Telecom thing cuz I saw this in the news and then immediately knew it was going to be in wow and didn't read it on purpose but it's interesting sure it's intriguing green Telecom uh intentionally uploads malware onto its customers computers KT Corporation one of South Korea's largest telecom companies has reportedly
"intentionally infected over 600,000" internet users with malware in retaliation for their use of Torrance the problem was first noted in May of 2020 when web hard a Korean cloud service provider that uses peer-to-peer file sharing began receiving sorry the name's just amazing uh began receiving a wave of user complaints that web hard's program wasn't working and in some cases their PC had shut down entirely web hard determined that every affected user was a KT customer web hard reported that the
matter to police who determined that this was the result of a malware attack originating from K data center so far 13 individuals have been criminally charged in relation to the affair though the investigation is ongoing KT and webhard have had past legal disputes over the latter's use of peer-to-peer file sharing which saves webhard a lot of money and server costs yeah uh which KT claims causes additional strain on its Network KT was previously caught throttling torrent traffic including web
hard which resulted in a court case that was decided in favor of KT on the grounds that web hard didn't pay KT Network usage fees for its peer-to-peer system and didn't explain to its users how the grid service Works in detail therefore the court determined that it wasn't unreasonable for KT to block web hard's Network traffic interesting one thing I will say before people start jumping on different things um as has been discussed a couple times this stream there's going to be
things about this that we don't necessarily understand clearly there's people that have been criminally charged can't just put malware on customers computers but uh the part that I'm talking about is this this whole like maybe web hard should have to pay KT for uh Network usage fees if I remember correctly South Korea does work that way right um so like that might sound weird and I'm not saying it's good but I I do think that is actually how certain deals work with different companies in South
Korea yeah Scrappy DP said that's why twitch left Korea yeah so like this is a thing that's not that's not completely out of nowhere this is a thing I don't know exactly how it works I don't know in what cases in what situations different companies have to pay each other for whatever but uh yeah it's weird only works that way for overseas companies okay so maybe it doesn't in this case I don't know all I'm saying is that that part is not like that odd but yeah uh infecting
"600,000 computers with malware because" you don't like that their torrenting is  response I just can't believe how angry people are in the chat about the photographer discussion what are they angry about oh all kinds of things you  um the crew's new crew wants to build their own servers a group of five modders has begun building their own servers in order to make the crew play able once more after the game's official servers were shut down by Ubisoft earlier this year the crew had solo play
but all game modes nonetheless required a server connection the mod team points to this capacity for solo play as an important difference between the crew and many other games that died with the closing of their servers the game likewise had the unusual feature of allowing players to drive across a contiguous open world scale model of the entire continental US according to whammy 4 a member of the crew Revival project if the industry's trend toward artificial Online requirements continues
then in a decade we'll have tons of unplayable Dead games that people once loved and played the cruise Community should absolutely not let Ubisoft keep getting away with such horrendous practices otherwise it will just keep happening to more and more games including the creu sequels and history will just keep repeating itself I couldn't have said it better myself thanks whammy for um our discussion question here is what would it mean if communities building their own servers
became the standard response to these kinds of shutdowns how do you think game companies would  I I don't know on the one hand you know I I look at it and I go like surely they wouldn't be like if people are just going to do all the work on their own surely they wouldn't be stupid enough to go and and stomp on these people but then on the other hand um it's happened yeah and there's legitimate potential liability for people firing up this game that they licensed from the game developer cuz
technically it's a license firing up this game that they licensed from the game developer and potentially something malicious happening because we're seeing good groups work to you know put servers back up to help people play these always online games but nothing would prevent a malicious group from doing something like that or a bad actor from interfering with the work of a good group um and man driving games are really complicated just because anything I I don't know if the crew had licensed um
had licensed car models and stuff like that but that can be that can be a big problem that can be very challenging licensed music can be can be a big challenge all certainly has licensed music in it and there can be an obligation for the game developer to go after like that can be something they're contractually obligated to do I think there's going to and remember but we're not just talking about the crew in particular right now we're talking about this more broadly uh will this trend of
of user groups putting servers online in order to keep these games alive continue I I I doubt it will be feasible if this is not something that is baked into the plan for the game I don't see it being something that can happen a ton of work so you can't expect it to happen right people aren't being compensated for this you you can't expect it to happen every time and if this was expected to happen for every game every time it's too much work you're leaning on the community too hard it's
unreasonable do you want to keep talking about the photos thing because someone linked an article from fstoppers how to explain why you don't provide your Raw photos no I'm bored of it points okay yeah it's basically everything that's already been said yeah and I I don't know someone made a particularly asinine comparison to it's like if you license software and to get the source code no it isn't it's like if you hire a contract developer to do a job for you and you expect to get the
source code you're literally hiring them to do the work there's also like one of the points in here is uh you already have an agreement for a set number of images if they're asking for it after the fact sure by all means say no yeah all he was saying was I would like an option to like have a different contract that I potentially pay more for where I can get them yeah I don't think people understand the well this feels a lot like the articles that we saw criticizing um our videos on Apple's
refusal to repair our iMac where they would they would glom on to something I never said uh and say he expected warranty coverage for it and apple wouldn't of course do that and guys go go look like wanted to pay to legitimate supposed news organizations had that take on it like that never happened yeah I wanted to pay Apple to repair my computer I bought from them that's not an unreasonable take if your agreement is that this person is getting edited photos like but you're getting four
edited photos out of this and then they ask for the Ros and you say no of course your agreement was for four edited photos not Ross he's talking about  different SL S I think I know what one you just read anyway he said SL s yeah no no no no no no no no it wasn't it's just okay um pyro pinky asks would you allow a sponsor to request all raw files from the shoot no I wouldn't but the shoot is of me that's a big difference if I was working as as a as a as a gun for hire right and if I was if I was shooting
like a like a corporate video for them to to make some thing and I'm just in there you know shooting interview footage of their Executives for example then they would expect to have the raw footage so that it can be edited in the manner they deem best and I would expect to provide it yeah these are these are not parallel right guys like these are these are not parallels um oh we're supposed to do three more merch messages now apparently hit me Dan oh yeah sure yeah I mean you can go
whatever order you like let's see uh my friend Joe teaches kids at the Boys and Girls Club recently he let the kids tear down a dead Alienware laptop do y'all have any other activities around fifth grade uh students would like that's super cool that's very cool um man fifth grade fifth grade activities so they're yeah so these kids are 11 like 10 10 to  um is it based around computer hardware because they mentioned the laptop thing cuz like scratch is cool and I think 11-year-old is around you know scratch
is probably a good idea I mean I know that this is sort of the same thing but also isn't older LCD monitors are super cool because you can actually see the different layers like you can see the polarization layer like you can actually like take it out and hold them up and and you could talk about what it's doing and light and and stuff like that this might be tough uh they would need to help the kids with this but if you did that experiment where you take the polarization layer off the Monitor and
then you make like glasses out of it so that you can the monitor looks white but if you're wearing the glasses you can see what's on the monitor that would probably be like a very mind expanding that would blow the kids Minds that's sick yeah great idea that would be cool you might be able to do the process of removing the layer yourself but then just like place it on it so that you can still see properly but then tell them that you already removed it and then peel it off and then make the glasses
with them uh because the the process of removing it is is a lot harder might be a little above what else would be kind of cool to to kind of dissect I I mean I don't want to recommend you know taking apart anything that's super valuable anymore um so that's that's something that can make things a little bit challenging but maybe if there was a way to for anything you do to remain usable like for future lessons like I could see it being kind of cool to remember remember that like onetime sponsor we had and
they had those little shadow box things with all the components removed from game consoles and stuff like that so if as a class project you kind of like made something that you could kind of hang on the wall and and continue to use um then I'd feel a little less bad about sort of just like taking something apart like  um yeah trying to think of something other than disassembling stuff I mean 10 11 year olds are sort of getting reasonably competent but I wouldn't expect any electronic device to survive
their treatment with Tools around either so taking things apart is probably your best best bet definitely not power supplies don't take apart any power supplies yeah don't do that don't do  um yeah cuz like my my high school teacher Mr tradle did a super cool thing um high scho high school computers teacher to be clear um where he he got us a bunch of like end of life desktops and pile them all up in a room and we had to like tear them all apart and then figure out what pieces of Hardware in
that pile were known good and like identifying even a few pieces of known good things was like super valuable because then you could use those things to test other things that you weren't sure about um so like it started really slow because we had to try to find some stuff that worked at all but then over time it got faster and faster and then we built a computer lab out of what was effectively two computer labs worth of computers um that was incredibly satisfying and also I would say that um
it increased my like pride in the school if that makes sense because now there was something in the school that was like built by me had my work in it so like you would see you would see people in the computer labs uh mess with the computers all the time people would put things in the optical drive Bays people would stuff garbage in the side panels they would do stupid annoying things like that and it already annoyed me cuz I liked the computers now they were they were computers that I built you know what
made me the most most angry about just senseless destruction of school property when I was a student was people being like yeah but this school sucks yeah it's like you're making it worse why do you think it sucks yeah this is why we can't have nice things now they have to spend their extremely limited budget on fixing your garbage um but yeah so like I don't know that that had a lot of personal value to me for like a a billion different reasons but  okay do you think ignorance is bliss
when it comes to Tech uh because you'll be more happy if you don't know what you're missing for example uh just enjoying 30fps console games versus now always wanting 120 frames a second I think in some ways ignorance can be Bliss but in other ways it can be ignorance um like if you're blissfully ignorant about oh I don't know okay here's something I came across recently did you know that if you download your Google photos backup on mass all the metadata is gone like the the shooting date the
location all of that is stripped out if you just select all and download it and it just Zips the whole thing up and and you just download the whole thing you download individually it's still there I downloaded like 14 I'm I'm actually not sure I didn't try that cuz that would be extremely tedious so apparently there's a work around uh but if you just do it the way that any Norm user would do it all the metad gets stripped out of everything and it's it's one of those things that I look at I just go like why
like why why why I also think that knowing things like having experienced 120 FPS with a proper Monitor and stuff like that is great doesn't mean that you have to be pained when you don't have it um understand like I think I think you can hold both of those ideas in your head I don't know you can understand that it's like a worse experience but um I think being okay with what you have but knowing that there's more is a state  impossible as someone who's quite cheap it's quite
possible apparently uh Google takeout works but saves the metadata in a separate Json file well that's annoying uh and then you have to use a tool to merge it back in and so yeah I came across that workflow and I was like well that's something for me to figure fig out another day yep but I just also would have found it super cool if they just didn't do that and that would have been better for me yeah I'm sure there's a I'm sure there's an optimization reason that they do that but if it's as
simple as you know merging that Json file with uh or the entries in that that database file with all of the um the various individual files then I really wish they would just do that for me when I downloaded it because it's just moving text around so it probably isn't that demanding compared to all the like AI crap that they're doing these days H quick someone tell the EU oh yeah didn't the EU do something interesting this week I don't think they'd be able to do anything about that they're not
it's not like they're not giving you the data it's just not in a super easy format I don't I don't know they had an uncommon l a little while ago and then I thought they had a couple W's this week but I don't see it in the dock so I can't remember I really did think they did something all right oh Dan is that right are we apparently are we supposed to do another merch message I think that was two we can do one more all right hit me with one more a local Australian major TV
channel had their YouTube channel taken over like yours did any followup on how YouTube is working to protect channels like yours honestly no I haven't heard buo and I can see that it's obviously still happening uh I mean we have we have definitely you know talked about fishing and and and the dangers around it here but the reality of it is that social engineering is the most effective way to to penetrate an organization oh yeah and and and like Google can't solve your browser session getting hijacked yeah
um especially I mean if you're not using their own browser but that's that's not an advertisement for using Chrome I've been using Firefox lately random little sidebar thing and it's been okay it hasn't been perfect but I'm happy to just not be on Chrome so it works I still use Chrome for work stuff and then I use Firefox  us I wanted to join the 70% of users firef which is now obviously truth yeah they were never lying I was wrong I'm sorry okay I was wrong when I used chrome all right I'm no longer ever
wrong because I use Firefox let's talk about let's talk about the the continued attitude shift um over at Apple that I've been observing now that they're finally under some regulatory scrutiny um okay they're adding RCS support which I think we've talked about uh it is currently live for iOS 18 beta 2 users the feature can be feature can be toggled on or off but it is on by default allowing Android and iPhone users to send each other highquality media start group chats and see typing
indicators and read receipts however Android users will still have green bubbles I will be interested to see how long a culture of you green bubble lasts now that it really doesn't matter at all unless you want to use sort of features that I don't think anyone cares about that are Apple exclusive what I've seen on the internet so far is people being better about it cool like oh this is cool we can finally like communicate together properly because for some reason we still use text
messaging Apple likewise published a white paper this week with the title of longevity by Design where it announced that its self-service diagnostic tool is now available in 32 European countries and that both its true tone color balancing screen feature and battery statistics will soon be available with third-party Parts Apple likewise says that used Apple parts will be as easy to transfer between devices as it is to install a new part for select devices sometime later this year further users
will be able to order parts for most repairs from Apple's self-service repair program without a device serial number a apple further stated that Beyond repairability it is even more important to provide durable reliable products that won't need substantial repairs to begin with okay hold on I don't really see how that last bit sort of fits in with any of this no I completely disagree but the point is that this small amount of progress um should not be ignored it is good that they are
making progress but it also isn't enough uh most of this stuff should never have happened in the first place serial part or serial number pairing and all of that nonsense um and if apple is so worried I mean I saw this image they they published a little while back um of like a burned up third party battery if Apple's so worried about that there's an easy solution Apple sell a first-party battery at a reasonable price to anyone  whoa whoa It's a wild I I'm without having read through all this myself I am
extremely sus because it seems like every time Apple does something like this there's like weird loopholes that make it horrible anyways and also the longevity by Design thing just pisses me off that drives me insane that that's the most like double speak BS crap just immediately makes me angry cuz like a lot of these problems yeah are caused by them yes if if I just full believe that all of this is good and there's no loopholes and there's no actual bad things attached to it which
is extremely questionable but if I do believe that there's still it's just like a couple steps forward compared to the few miles backwards that they've taken making repairability so bad so like what are you talking about you don't get to say longevity by Design until you actually properly Embrace that and they haven't yet so that's that drives me nuts but anyways also Apple further stated that Beyond repairability it is even more important to provide durable reliable products no I know that won't need
sustainable repairs to begin with shut up what a stupid statement like yeah it's great that you're going to make durable stuff that won't need to be repaired that's fantastic except stuff is still going to break and it should be highly repairable when it does and and to be clear like I'll give Apple Credit whenever they do something good the length of time that they provide software support for their products has put significant pressure on their competitors to match or try to beat it
like the reason that we are getting pixels with what is it seven years or eight years or something of software updates now well maybe I promise you the only reason Google even even entertained the idea yeah is because of Apple we'll see in in seven or eight years yeah we'll see if you even want to use it in seven or eight years I mean my note 9 is uh going on five I guess or six five or six and it's it's pretty rough it's pretty have you replaced battery it's getting pretty
bad I haven't but the batter the main problem it's just really slow installing apps is like painful now it takes a really long time did it take that long when you first started though no but apps were smaller I do wonder how much of this stuff is artificial but it's really hard to prove so I don't know yeah it's impossible to prove and I I I don't know if I'm convinced I don't think my conspiracy theory hat goes that big well they did the battery thing for iPhones right slow your phone down to
save the battery yes but eventually they they backed down on that I think you are you like it's it's transparent I don't mind yeah I don't mind that as an option y sure 100% I like the idea of there being an option to save my battery by slowing it down for sure I just don't like it being forced anyways should we talk about a cool thing yeah let's talk about something cool Labs scanned a processor Labs has used the CT scanner to take a look inside uh of a deleted 13900 K processor Lucas did a 45-minute
scan followed by an 8 Hour scan for additional detail though the two scans wound up achieving similar results the scans allow us to see the inner structure of the Chip And the connections through it and these are super cool man that CT scanner is so awesome it's so cool also you can see the scans for different products on the lab's website wow can I uh oh that's like if that was in desktop background format that's a thing that I would have had as a desktop background back when I did that oh yeah
100% man it's so sick okay that's super cool I'm surprised that we can get this level of  you there's the Vias so neat that's super cool uh chip structure slice even if I don't fully understand what's going on hold on no no there's a there's an alternate view where they uh they show us exactly what we're looking at so here we can compare and contrast our own scan with Intel's own oh die awesome actually yeah buddy very gpus on the right hand side uh hold on hold on hold on yeah okay so
here's this uh well yeah but ours is the other way around so you can see these pees correspond to these right yeah yeah yeah so here's our here's our e cor clusters one two three four in each of them see there you go and then uh yeah here's the igpu over here M and then this is the the uncore uh the part that is that is not core your qpi links and and the like I'm sorry I sorry I said qpi links um I don't know if they they don't still use qpi but that was when the term uncore
first um was popularized by Intel uh to describe the the non- compute parts of the core that would be where your memory controller would be and stuff like that though it's it's anything that's not computer cache such a cool look at how complicated those things are okay um what else do we have I feel like we blew through a lot of the topics today yeah um we've got some announcements well the internet archive lost in court okay yep all right the internet archive loses in court
Paramount deletes two decades of web history is this like two things combined yeah a a district judge has ruled in favor of a group of major book publishers in their copyright lawsuit against the internet archive over whether or not the archives digital lending program falls under Fair fair use because the archive likes to look at itself as a library I'm adding that in U while the internet archive says that it uh it plans to appeal the decision around half a million ebooks have been
delisted from the open Library project in the meantime if the ruling stands this could be a devastating precedent for many American libraries whose digital lending programs depend on the same interpretation of us copyright law pioneered by the internet archive controlled digital lending or CDL argues that libraries should be allowed to digitized physical books that they have lawfully purchased and to lend out DRM protected digital copies in direct proportion to the physical copies that
they have in storage this is one way that libraries skirt restrictive and prohibitively expensive digital licenses however the internet archives lawyers seemed optimistic about the appeal and is typically the and it is typically the lower courts who make decisions about the facts of the case while the upper courts make decisions about the interpretation of the law and the need to ensure that it serves the public interest in other notable losses of public information access Paramount
Global has deleted several websites including ComEd Comedy Central they deleted comedy Central's website  no what no the website is still wait hold on a second yeah keep watching learn more you yeah no you just yeah well whoa watch now Paramount plus Comedy Central yeah but it just everything just  Plus on Pluto TV it redirects you to yeah this just it just redirects you somewhere else the whole website is just redirects now whoa well also also that was never available in Canada Get Wrecked uh so
they've deleted I'm going to say in quotes because they're probably all just redirects uh not technically deleted but effectively deleted um Comedy Central CMT Paramount Network TV Land MTV MTV News uh MTV News while defunct had a useful Archive of over two decades of Journalism Paramount stated as part of a broader website as part of broader website changes across Paramount we have introduced more streamlined versions of our sites driving fans to Paramount plus to watch their favorite shows Paramount
plus has the has only the two most recent seasons of The Daily Show while The Daily Show YouTube only goes back to 2016 so basically there's a lot of content that's just so there's a ton of content removal along with the site consolidation I feel like if it was just the site consolidation people wouldn't mind that much yeah this is brutal also I feel like a sign significantly easier way to do this is just make it so that every single one of those websites requires a Paramount
Plus subscription yeah just has the same login just have the same login and payment process and just let you go to whatever website you want and you could have like a little thing uh like Reddit does if you view it in a browser you could have a little thing that's like you know you could just access all your content if you went to the Paramount plus actual website but you know it is what it is Trick Killa says I remember when Comedy Central used to just let you stream all the South Park episodes for
free I could be wrong about this so you guys will have to jump in but my understanding is that was actually down to Trey Parker and Matt Stone's negotiation with them I believe that that was a requirement on their side um for the contract so let let me know guys that that's what I recall but  100% H Wild I'm I'm seems like a strange move I'm reminded of uh when Phil def Franco removed all his old videos do you remember that we talked about it on Wow and it just I feel less like that that feels to
me more like an individual removing their own content yes but I guess the reason I'm reminded is that we think of things on the internet as having permanence but they absolutely do not super don't and as hosting costs continue to grow some ways in some ways they are still shrinking at a very Moes Lawes rate um but in other ways are going down we have lost an insane amount of like web one web two type of websites and content tons of them because forever gone even though the costs have gone
down the ability to monetize that content has also gone down uh you you can't you can't monetize a simple text page with a simple Banner ad anymore so now that that even though the hosting cost goes down if that ad pays zero then eventually that page is going to be taken down it's not sustainable anymore and in the case of of Phil def Franco my assumption is that it's just because some of his old content would have been embarrassing for him at this point with the the image that he's um that he's created for
himself now sure um but the reason that I thought about it was a um this sort of removal of all of this old media and B I was looking for an example of like a a cringe like dark dark times thumbnail to to refer to back when the main YouTubers were just basically putting giant boobies in all their thumbnails in order to get people to click on them because YouTube had no systems in place to disincentivize that behavior and I was like oh yeah Phil de Franco used to do that back in the day and I went looking
for it and I was like oh yeah he like removed all those videos yeah and not only was I not able to find anything on YouTube I wasn't able to find any screenshot of any of his old thumbnails so I ended up going with um Peter Chow instead what was that weite like picture bucket or something um photo bucket photo bucket yeah photo bucket like I don't they might still be around but uh a lot of their old hosting is gone like if you go through old forums and people link to yeah so photo bucket
is still around sure but you have to like pay for it now and stuff I think there might have been free hosting through uh photo bucket back in the day and um oh apparently he removed them because all the content belonged to um whoever owned his channel before it was a stipulation of buying back the channel that makes sense that's brutal that's that sucks such garbage yeah yeah photo bucket destroyed so many Forum tutorials yeah but like I mean so true just is what the video is or what
the what the internet is someone linked um sorry I lost who linked it because it was so long ago that you linked it I apologize but someone linked PC cables.com and this website's awesome this is not I don't I don't know if the cables are good or anything like I I've known nothing about this I never used it but uh clearly up toate and online 1996 it's very straightforward and easy that's like the fastest shopping experience ever it looks like an order form it sure does you need that's true
perect if you're just buying some cables then then sweet yeah yeah the pictures are great that's what I need to know these are the ends thank you that's it 10 out of 10 yep like I'm assuming these are mostly just lengths yep sweet length price views that's interesting either way cool s hey Funk fpv included our magnetic Cable Management as part of a Roundup of magnetic organization tools he specifically talked about how well they work for his purposes as a mechanic and
Creator this is super cool oh dude yeah I know this guy I've seen a bunch of his shorts nice that's super cool here let's have a look uh so he apparently talks about them here you guys oh wow you got the big one uh you guys are going to have to you guys are going to have to go check out the video If you want to get his full thoughts I'm not going to oh is he like checking oh wow this is like detail dude yeah jump to whenever you are done looking at that bit jump to  minutes oh man he brought out the force
meter yeah let's see how much force Luke can use wait what yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah no no me yeah I don't know I'm just it's just the force don't worry about it oh I see nice this is awesome that's cool wow what a detailed  video what is he doing here that's something else that's someone else's product oh I see anyway yeah cool love it guys go go check it out I am I am amazed to see someone spend that long talking about magnetic Cable Management products but that's kind of the beauty of YouTube
right like that's so cool that people can that people can get that far into the Weeds on something that you know "might only matter to 19,000 other people" but matters a lot really appreciate it yeah he apparently plans to use the extra large arches to keep his extension cord and jumper cables in his truck in place so they don't get buried and lost um he found that the magnetic power bar keys are also very useful for battery charges for tools yes that's something we didn't talk about at all I was
thinking Network switches routers Power Bars but no there's all kinds of things that have those little those little uh Keyhole shapes on the back of them and you can use our magnetic things to just Mount them anywhere you want the IT team recently moved within the office and and somebody did a very cool solution with the power bar on that middle dask stand oh how it's completely removable and you can move it around and do whatever you need and then you can put it back where
it was and it's on top of the desk it's nice so you have like plugs on the desk where you would often want to use them if you're t testing something at that desk but then you can also just pick up the power bar and move it somewhere else temporarily if you need it which is nice oh yeah love that it's cool he found that our magnets were very strong uh hitting about 27 lbs for the extra large arches and 9 lb for the small arches when pulled upward I thought it showed kilograms uh I'm not sure maybe someone
converted them in other news go watch this video I want you guys to watch his video do that uh in other news we are hosting a garage sale next Saturday July 6th from 10:00 a.m. to 2 p.m. at the LTT Labs building there will be 400 plus items good Lord a variety of keyboards mice headsets speakers and some computer components uh LTD store.com items will not be available for purchase you must find street parking somewhere or take transit or something there will not be parking
in the parking lot and it is credit and debit only all right should we uh switch to wo after dark yes let's do it Dan you've got a button for it now right   mood do not fly to Canada for this garage sale it will not be worth it and maybe find a merch message for Luke real quick I drank this whole water bottle one sec yeah I've got one for Luke here somewhere I do specifically remember a couple uh sure let's go with this one hey LDL buying gift cards until I have enough for a backpack Luke if you could
keep any type of bird as a pet what bird would it be and why is it an owl uh it'd probably still be a Budgy the the the main downsides of budgies in my opinion is that they're like incredibly fragile and scared of everything all the time um so if you get two of them which I would recommend if you're not full-time work from home uh because they are they are flock animals pack animals whatever I don't know um so they they need they need something to bond with and if nobody's home and
they're by themselves that's sad and and just very sad I would say um so if you're going to be away from home a lot then you should get another one but if you get another one they won't bond with you directly as much um which will result in it being much more difficult for them to uh get used to like your hands and you like they they might be very obvious viously happier when you are there uh happy with your presence happy when you talk to them all of those types of things um but they're they're
going to be more you know uh interested in their their buddy if you have only one and your full-time work from home uh they'll be more interested in in landing on your hands landing on your shoulder doing all that type of stuff but they they're absolutely fock animals so in my opinion you shouldn't get one work out of your house and not have another one you should have two if you're not going to to be there basically all the time um and the the the big downside is that they're they're so fragile they're
like on the line of dying all the time they weigh 30 Gams they're almost entirely like humans are mostly made of water they're almost entirely made of air uh pollutant in the air can take them up really quickly they don't have the like Mass to deal with anything long term so it's like scary that way but oh God they talk to him about birds big birds have enormous slimy gross poops and if you're gonna have a flying animal in my opinion you should probably let it fly around so its poop should probably
be very easy to deal with um so not a not an owl you just want budgies pretty much an owl someone said why not an owl basically I don't know a ton about owls in particular but yeah they probably  nice uh let's see we already got that one uh here's a here's a fun one uh what's keeping you from moving LT to Taiwan I know you've got this before I I have a whole team of people who work here honestly you have a cult of people that work here there are we come with there are things that I would probably
like better about it one of the major criticism that we get is around the sloppiness of our work sometimes so we had we had a thread on Reddit recently about how um we had m.2 sizes so 2230 2260 2280 right I saw this labeled megahertz in just a chart um it didn't really interfere with the meaning of the video it wouldn't have misled anyone into purchasing the wrong product in any way or anything like that but it could have been confusing and it could have and it certainly was
sloppy and one of the things that I was thinking about as I was over in Taipei just like walking around during computex this year is if we had done what Luke asked and if we had just you know been like forget it let's just you know run the company out of Taiwan now finding a video editor who is a a super techie would probably be easy a lot easier right like there's there's challenges that are just inherent to scaling Beyond just people who live and breath Tech because this might surprise
you but the person who spends their life mastering video editing or the person who spends their life mastering cinematography or the person who spends their life mastering accounting didn't necessarily spend their life mastering PC Hardware they might have but probably not but they might not have and I would say that you know one single person can only reasonably be expected to be deeply knowledgeable about a a handful of subjects you know probably somewhere between three and and
eight is is probably the most subjects that a single person could really have any any level of of Mastery of or Mastery yeah um and so I would say that in a more Tech focused culture it might be more likely that we would find people that have the overlapping masteries that we happen to need here yeah not 100% but more likely and and so as you as you grow as a company you hire people who have masteries that are absolutely valuable and and respectable but are not necessarily PCB layout you know and and
it's been it's been a major it's been a major growing pain for us and it's something that you know there yeah there might be there might be uh there might be ways around like you know I don't know uh yeah sure like being located in somewhere somewhere like Taiwan where there's just a ton of really really Tech Centric people um with that said you know I think that it's fair to say that we'd probably have more spelling and punctuation errors in our videos at that point if we have people whose whose
Mastery whose first you language Mastery wasn't English right so there's no Silver Bullet for anything like when it comes to to growing a company I mean I think Jim Keller said it really well when he said that you could have a team of 10 Geniuses I'm paraphrasing a little bit but he said you could have a team of 10 Geniuses uh 100 above average performers and by the time you get to a th people just it's like a law of the universe that everyone's going to be like kind of
mediocre um and and I think that that's just something that we've kind of come up against and that you it's really easy to build a team uh that that's all just like hyperfocused on one thing and it's really hard to develop a broader set of capabilities as a company while maintaining that hyper Focus because of course you can't because all those people know and do other things right yeah um I forget what the question was what's stopping you from moving to Taiwan oh yeah um yeah our team is here
uh For Better or For Worse I am I am probably I am probably too we're too established now yeah and originally it was family now it's probably family and we're too establish now I probably worry too much about that sort of thing though a lot of companies just move if there's like a tax advantage um I I don't really like to disrupt people's lives um we've we've been looking at other at Luke there's not enough money in it for the shareholders it's not all just you let's do it the shareholders would save money
Dan the shareh are inredible amounts of money yeah it it definitely isn't to do with that it's not enough money I also have family here um a lot of the team has family here we're we're pretty rooted at this point and if we were going to move we'd go to Seattle Washington you know I've talked about this or Seattle Washington we'd go to Vancouver Washington we've already talked about this that is quite the move oh that's like to be clear I don't mean as in it's far it's just like that's a very
tactical move oh yeah Vancouver Washington would be a sick place to Y Vancouver Washington no no state income tax and uh you crossb shop in Oregon where there's no sales tax and you're right next to Seattle which is like a huge Tech Hub yeah you have you have quick access to the Seattle Convention Center if you were trying to run a convention and you know wanted the country or province that you're in or in this case state to support you in any way what so shape or form uh that would have been really cool
um yeah I don't know seems like place yes Washington also has a Vancouver it turns out that that particular dead white guy hung around like the whole Pacific Northwest imagine imagine that you know being like you know that influential that you have a city in like two  you goals hey D my my 8-year-old son what's what's we call what we colonize like Mars it's just all these cities called this one's called Dan and then we we drive for an hour and I'm going to call this one Dan too I'm going
to Dan which Dan the one with is no  tax let's be real every Dan would have no tax that's true yeah that's that's  dude uh yeah okay let's see hey dll my 8-year-old son has been playing first person shooter games and likes to One V One One V one me I don't go easy on him uh to teach him and set expectations of the real world what is your opinion on this do you go easy on your kids I would never go easy on my kids I have strong opinions on this I would I would I would maybe let them make it
interesting but I would never allow them to win if that makes sense I wouldn't even but I think you could put like artificial limitations on yourself uh is this like Mario Kart again basically yeah crushing that little girl yeah good life lesson you know what I've changed my sense I don't feel bad anymore good Get Wrecked no I skill issue um because it wasn't like I don't know I don't know that person so there's no value of it to me but one you got to prepare yourself cuz eventually they're going to
win and you have to be ready for that that's an important part of this whole whole process oh yeah my son's legit beat me at games at this point yeah yeah like and like I I would also heavily encourage you to play co-op as well you're not just against each other right but so like the one V ones should be like motivating to get better basically and then the co-op should be like yo we're on the same team like and I and to be clear maybe I just care less about video games but uh in badminton
with my son I'm approaching this as like I won't let him have a point he didn't earn yeah yeah not one I'm not I'm not necessarily pushing this just as video games I'm like any form of competition I guess yeah I think the last time I played him he got like five points yeah and like I don't care those are five next time earned points okay you don't have to be that way no you do strive for improvement life is a competition get good you don't just have to get better you have to get better RAR than the rate
at which I'm getting better otherwise you're not really better honestly you playing at a high level important where you are don't hit the player hit the game playing at a high levela love badminton I want to play with you my boy you being at a high level playing against your kid would probably get them up to your level even more yeah right yeah and if you go easy on them you're not helping yeah if you want them to be good you need to not do that you can also help and do coaching and stuff as
well though well of course I want him to be better I'm not I'm just not going to let him oh okay yeah I'm just not going to let him think that he's any better  bet he doesn't use artificially infl that can also actually be really bad it can it can really Nerf like the it's the whole like gifted kid thing where like if everyone tells you that you're really good at everything um it makes it really hard to establish uh like good study habits it makes it hard to establish like really trying at
something before you internalize how good you are at it like if you it makes it so that when they grow up if they try something once and they're not amazing at it then they're going to be super demotivated and not want to do it instead of someone who's going to like actually pour effort into something  important okay hey D I love the show uh sorry that one moved hi when. dll watch The Minis Forum V3 unbox seem like the tablet I always dreamed for a quick question though can I use the keyboard with other
devices so I can use it as a KVM on a  rack oh that one oh I don't remember I thought didn't it use the didn't it have a proprietary interface I feel like this question could be answered in the video um but yeah I don't see any Bluetooth yeah no no no no no I don't see any Bluetooth pairing anything on here and that's that's a little Pogo Pogo pin thing it does not appear to work I'm just going based on what I can see here because that also looks like an airplane mode button right there
so your guess is as good as mine right now I have not tried that what experiment would you conduct if you had your own Fallout vault okay so I never played Fallout so I'm relying on Luke here you haven't played any dude do you know the concept before I didn't play games for a whole period of time one is from what Fallout 1 2 and three are all from before that period of time wait when did Fallout 1 come out Fallout 1 is quite old 1997 yeah like what are you talking about oh
well in 1997 I had a Pentium 1 90 MHz no 166 mahz processor okay Fallout two when did Fallout two come out uh 1998 okay I still had a Pentium 166 MHz I really hoping it was going to be later than that and then Fallout three okay that that was like my first year un 2008 yeah I was in school so I wasted my time in Counter Strike okay yeah I was going to say we all know yeah no I was gaming at that point but I didn't get into Fallout okay uh well all the Fallout vaults have like
generally horrendous experiments ran in them um I'm assuming they're not suggesting that we run a horrendous experiment so the idea would be that there's a vault so a sealed location um where there's a bunch of people you're can to have multiple generations of them and you want to like change something to  people are we talking about Eugenics you could try that if you want it there's a whole bunch of uh really really messed up ones that are actually horrifying yeah there's really terrible
ones I think somebody did like one woman 99 men one man 99 women uh there was one that it was like a live kodo Dragon um they had an incredible store of say weapons uh there's mind altering drugs what if we just irradiated everybody all the time uh one of my favor be ones where they they really really really limit certain supplies every year you have to kill another Vault dweller otherwise they'll kill the entire Colony um I you don't have to you don't have to do horrendous things I don't
like any of this it could be a good one okay sure so in My Vault um it would continuously play Friday by Rebecca Black forever oh you so you're just going straight to psychological torture you should like get rid of any reference to any days of the week except for Friday and just make them number the Friday so it's like Friday 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and you got to get down Friday one comes after Friday 7even he's coming around they would form a religion what is this mythical Saturday
Saturday was coming for all of us for salvation at the end of The Vault Saturday will open the door and we will all be birthed into the real world the like the like underground Rebellion religion person yeah the it's prise be to cereal you must have to have a full bowl  Soul oh my are you sure you didn't run a cult at some point uh you're too good at  uh all yeah do we need a t-shirt for that to have a full bowl is to have a full soul and just a picture of a bowl of cereal I'm sure Sarah would do it
yeah probably if we let her make the cereal little little Dino uh like little Dino o yeah you got her on board now she would do it she would 100% do it love that man I have wanted to do this visual gag forever we still haven't done it um just like I we haven't had an opportunity to like dish out a giant a giant L but I want to do like a like a photoshopped bowl of cereal and they're all L's and they're cheery L's and just like take your cheery L's like here's a here's a here's a bowl of cheeri L's I
don't know it just popped into my head at some point you should do it over the   more I could wait for you know some streamer downfall I gu said missed my most recent  L Sor I do the next one get me out of here D sure hey D I love the show as you recently mentioned giving the iPhone a try would be interested uh in a video for that if you make the switch would you iron unironically wear the Apple watch again um Apple watch is super cool I don't need any of the health tracking
stuff I don't really care about any of that so that's uh a major a major drawback or not a drawback I just don't really care I I get in and out of the habit of wearing watches I'm just kind of out of it right now I tried this OnePlus One recently and it was fine I guess I just then I forgot to put it on one day and then I just stopped um I don't know yeah I guess I I'd consider trying it but I also just don't it was not something that occurred to me when I was like oh yeah I'm going
to have to go back to the iPhone I'm going to get Apple watch I don't I don't really care also I'm apparently not going back to the iPhone yet because I forgot that we had I had committed to someone to do this experiment but I've been criticized for my takes on various phones a lot of times because some of the things that I'll criticize are just stock Android things um and because I'm so used to Samsung so people are like you're not really an Android guy you're a Samsung guy and I'm like okay I mean
yeah maybe that's true so internally we talked about this and the next phone  8 unlocked running AOSP oh and the title's going to be do I just plain hate Android oo I like that yeah so that's my next phone and it turns out so far I really do it's kind of a piece of um the modifications that the oems used to make back in the day made everything worse and now I think it's pretty clear that AOSP has not kept up no there's there's a I think we talked about this maybe even last week
I'm not in the market for a new phone right now my phone is way too new for me to be in the market for a new phone next time it comes round it's probably going to be Xperia versus iPhone the stuff iPhone has been doing is killer the the ability to shoot in log is really cool like actually very very cool and then just don't give it to  they being able to move well I mean if it's not in the original contract then screw that I mean that is true yeah I have never argued that point yeah yep
yep um but yeah being able to move the icon I know it probably shouldn't matter that much but it matters to me a lot also it's really weird to me I the the neighbor's computer that I was fixing the printer on yesterday uh it's a Mac Mini I said this earlier in the show uh it's a Mac Mini the icons are all like they don't have the best desktop organization the icons are like stacked on top of each other and like partially off the screen and all this kind like they let you do that on desktop but then
you can't you previously weren't even able to move them around at all on your phone like what I know the the disc the fact that there's there's they just kind of go wherever on the desktop is so weird I know so weird anyway so far it's terrible um I had a I had a an event for one of my children and I wanted to take some pictures at it and I was like oh right I've got that pixel I'm going to I'm going to use the pixel instead of my ancient note 9 and I opened up the camera app I was like what is this it's
the worst thing I've ever seen so is that that's not the same one that I have though is it no because I'm running AOSP yeah but like it's bad no no the pixel  like you will be amazed I still don't know if this is conclusive on Android though you will be amazed how bad it is no because but but that's the question is do I actually like Android or do I  UI h ah and and if my criticisms of these things whether it's on a fair phone or it's on some other random phone are my criticisms of these things are they
really any less valid if it's part of stock Android If part of the job of a phone manufacturer these days is building a version of Android that doesn't suck donkey balls so I'll make my argument in the video it's going to be great it's going to be exciting no bleep on that one what donkey balls yeah I don't know you don't bleep donkey balls I wouldn't bleep donkey dingdong either huh there's nothing wrong with that that's fair how about penis okay you don't bleep penis
it's a medical term I think some people would I wouldn't that's stupid cuz I agree with you I mean cocking balls I might have you ever played the penis game the penis game do you know that game so one person like Whispers it to the other person and then the game is that the other person has to say it louder and then you just loop back and forth until you like get in trouble cuz someone's yelling you're in the middle of the mall just screaming it see this is do you know about it yeah okay I'm not crazy
I'm very happy but thank you Dan you do it you do it in public you do it in school it's it's it starts usually in like middle school high school yeah yeah lunchroom kind of yeah childish games yes by Middle School I was um more cultured and sophisticated than that I was not I wasn't that was a lie that was a  okay okay yeah let's see what else purchasing a house soon anything you'd recommend doing with all the drywall and flooring off other than conduit that's a must I mean you're already aced here if
you're putting in conduit that's smart because putting in conduit is like putting in everything it's just unlimited future success for you conduit is awesome dude I had to rerun a display port cable to one of the PCS in the land room downstairs and it sucked it took like an hour but you could do it and if I had had to do it without conduit wasn't contractors I would have had to rip off drywall and like oh it would have been a nightmare it was awesome yeah yeah conduit do it yeah nothing else matters
I was just going to say I don't have any other notes just do that um no no no hold on hold on so one thing I would do is if you've got really old thermostats for example I would make sure that you have a decent number of conductors running to your thermostat sites um some of the newer thermostats require like her five conductors six cond I I don't even know but more than more than two like our house just had two conductor like Mercury tilt thermostats um so that's one to watch
out for in seiling and in wall speakers now is a good time to do it if you've got the drywall off people are also saying acoustic paneling and soundproofing um yeah yeah is that a little bit more external to the wall though putting in better insulation a bit Yeah putting in better instulation it it actually doesn't cost much more than the more basic stuff so that can be really worthwhile especially for like you know the main  example I almost just yelled out penis okay it went along with the theme it
would have been playing the game it would have been a demonstration of what I was talking about earlier it might have worked but then I don't know if anyone else is still here I don't think  that that would be a weird relationship yeah just pointing I mean maybe maybe  surprise yes yes honey I know oh my goodness oh man okay oh I want to make a joke so bad I'm I'm not going oh okay moving on uh let's see W.D have you ever have you guys ever thought about putting the ABCs of gaming in libraries or do I
need to buy another copy and donate it  library I'll tell you what any library that contacts us that wants a copy I'll send to based like I I don't know sure I they can only have so many books though like do people really put board books in libraries I have no idea probably sure libraries are quite uh wide reaching they kind of want to be there for everybody yeah for sure super down just if you work at a library you know someone who works at a library just you send an email just
requisition it no problem um maybe in the email include this time stamp because our team probably has no idea that I said this there's a thread on r/ libraries from a year ago talking about organizing board books so apparently they've got some cool you just you can just do it as a as an ebook that'd be fine for lonus you recently committed to using big screen Beyond VR how are you feeling about that and would you recommend for longtime VR users the non-self contained of it kind
of sucks I think they have a new headphone strap but I don't think I've seen it if they've sent it to us I haven't seen it yet so I still need to try that it's really cool but my new thing that I've been trying to try recently is that wireless adapter for the valve index I've spent so far a grand total of about three and a half hours trying to get it to work which is a bad sign um I've seen a lot of complaints about the device but I was sort of determined to try to do it myself and
then I was I signed up for one of their they actually have a signup sheet on their website for um like a technical support session so I signed up for one but then my sister passed away and I was dealing with that instead of uh dealing with setting up that wireless no no noio noo whatever it is that's what it's called um and so I haven't dealt with it but that's my new VR thing that I'm  now sorry I closed the tab instead of switching to it uh competent uh hey Dan Luke and the short one have you guys
heard about the cdk hack I'm an automotive technician and it has uh in quotes put it put us back to the Stone Age and we have to write everything down yeah so cdk Global is a company that makes software for auto dealerships as far as my understanding goes uh and there's been like ransomware attacks going off on them like crazy um and yeah I mean I don't know a ton about it uh as I often say with like hacker content there's a bunch of creators out there actually quite a few
that cover this stuff really well so I would recommend going and and checking one of them but it's really interesting it's been incredibly disruptive to that industry I'm not I I think him saying by like it's put us back an incredible amount we're writing things down that does not sound like a fabrication from what I've heard as far as I know a lot of dealerships are going back to like very old school methods to try to make sure that they can actually keep functioning as a business um um so yeah
it's been pretty intense a lot of people are asking no it wasn't Bella who was featured in the video it was my older sister um she was by far the one that I have been closest to as an adult and it  yes okay let's see one of the last ones I've got here hi LL and D I currently Fly for a commercial airline in the states and the CRT screens are starting to become problematic as they dim but replacing them for LCDs isn't easy any similar examples in tech oh man where you can't really retrofit the new one
because the form factor SL power delivery just is is so far off um I mean I I'd say one interesting example in Tech was when we moved from like token ring um and all the old like coaxial cable just didn't work and you basically had to rip all the cabling out of buildings in order to to support new networking technology like that was a that was a big deal like no one talks about it anymore because we're able to use all the way back to what like cat three don't don't quote me on this
what's the what's the oldest still usable category um cable these days uh which ones have which ones have four pairs or um at least two pairs I think is what you have to have oh this this makes more sense to me honestly uh papaka no cat four was token ring hold on cat no you had yeah capat five oh no hold on people say hold on no no no I'm on I'm on Eaton's site right now cap 5 introduced in 1995 up to 100 proba IBM token ring networks I thought token ring was coax I didn't know cat three had four 
pairs I think token ring is just a concept right cuz I know a token ring done with coax but maybe you could also do it with yeah I didn't I didn't know that remember redoing it was a big deal but I wasn't a part of it so I don't know a lot about it I didn't know of uh token ring networks being done on category cable but token ring had two types of cable saying we that makes sense to me it's before my time like I wasn't really I just know that the whole was a big deal so Category 3 is as far
back as you'd have to go to still like have it be usable um with an RJ45 termination I guess weird like a backwards compatibility maybe interesting super cool token ring was big with coax but it never required it got it okay so there you go anyway that was that was a big deal because you basically had to rip out you had to like gut all the networking infrastructure and these buildings in order to in order to bring them up to speed people are saying contradictor things now I I don't
know I know at least one large institution around where I grew up that had coax token ring stuff if I remember correctly and there was a really big deal to replace but I don't know I also might be remembering it properly this is very very much before my time and trying to think if there was like if there's something else like that like uh in any situation where you'd have like uh like a proprietary keyboard or something like that that used PS2 like you can use USB to PS2 adapters but they're not always
100% especially if you have like a random weirdo keyboard oh I lost it but somebody in the chat said uh the biggest problem is getting them approved for that like airplane PCI retrofitting anything on an airplane is kind of a problem anything where like a license is tied to like a PCI card or something like that like getting a new machine that that card Works in can be really challenging although that's like more down to drivers than the actual physical compatibility I don't know there's lots
of there's lots of situations where yeah poo do poo Daka certification is a major uh certification is Major no it has to be certified for flight in the craft and that is the main issue oh okay that makes more sense to me to be honest and like paying to have it certif it's like what so you can sell a few hundred units like yeah who's going to want to do that yeah rough last one I got for you I haven't seen much coverage of this or talk online but anyone think the whole
Snapdragon Microsoft thing might be part of their strategy for launching an Xbox handheld device no interesting idea but yeah I don't think so no I think this is part of their strategy for competing better in laptops right now and anything that happens in the future it's like very common perception across the industry that Windows laptop searches worse yep and this is a this is a really really important um perception for Microsoft right now to try to address yeah and you know it's important for me
to say hey thanks for tuning in to the W show we'll see you guys again next week same bad time same bad Channel bye
