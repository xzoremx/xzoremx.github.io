we have roasted your worst setups our best setups and everything in between but today we're taking aim squarely at those who have been Obsessed the most over their computers excuse me computers these computers have actually transcended being workstations or gaming computers today we're looking at Battle Stations roasting the folks with the most that is the most money and the most pride in their computational Creations yes oh yeah here we go oh no I don't believe this photo not wanting to only
highlight those of you that have remortgaged your house for RGB lighting we'll also be looking at battle stations that are priced down a little bit and we'll be doing all of it from this incredibly tiny battle station from red magic huge thanks to Red magic for sponsoring this video to show off their new Nova gaming tablet its 144 HZ display is fed frames by the new Snapdragon 8 gen 3 leading version that isn't just fast when you boot up a game but continues to be fast thanks to this
sick cooling system on the back that features a fan that spins it up to "20,000 RPM now I know you're thinking" that's probably hecking loud you got you got this but even at Max Speed you can barely hear it from the distance that you hold a tablet as a bonus the fan helps keep the tablet cool during fast charging so you can get the most out of the included 80 wat fast charger check out the red magic Nova gaming tablet at the link down below to start we're going to be taking a look at the absolute best
battle station of all time as decided by the community dual 75 in 4K TV Computing what that chair does not look comfortable this is the opposite of r/ TV too high bro is sitting on the floor no actually the TV's mounted really low but he's sitting on the floor this probably is cross posted on like male Living Spaces I was just going to say this is that post that it's like it doesn't take much to make a man happy yeah there's no way that buddy is reading text from that distance also did
clear a conference room to fill it with his battle station what is this space you know what this actually reminds me of I made this setup 13 years AG oh my gosh it's the same room like what is this if his head is near the top of that chair it's probably in line with around the ergonomics of this are actually may be somewhat okay other than the fact that his feet are just permanently out in front of him probably sits cross- leg oh that's kind of sick actually all right in second place the completely
reasonable apartment setup oh hell yes that honestly just looks like some of the employee setup reviews that we've done I don't know what's better the full ceiling height Rack or the slippers that are just vibing there I like that he spent so much money on that server rack and so little on the monitors balance out what you're spending your money on this table is trashed here and then their desktop speakers were like value bin the top comment is great idea my wife would love this this in the living
room yeah also the couch right next to it are you really going to be enjoying whatever it is you're doing on the couch with a server rack next to you I was going to say like you know you can put your server Rack in like another room like L but it's like no that's clearly what they're into they want to work on that they want to spend time on it I think it's sick Windows mixed reality ladies and gentlemen we found him the one person who invested in a Windows mixed reality headset all right you want
"to look at the number one yes 68,000 up" votes over 7 years oh yeah yeah that's the stuff I love it that's awesome that's actually kind of sick this is deserving of the number one spot you're making it work do you think the ratchets are holding the desk together or just the hardware down I think they're holding down the back of the monitor to ensure that it doesn't just vibrate off of that desk when he's driving and I think they might also be holding the table together although it's hard to say
plays truck Sim is the top comment please don't do you think you could live on the road if you had an amazing gaming setup in a truck younger not married no kids obviously 7 years ago no today with starlink maybe maybe this is a sick setup this is very good for you all right here's a couple top up vaded ones from this month it looks like a render I am slightly suspicious of this being real it's too perfect do you like any color in your life by the way holy crap it's really nice as long as nobody ever
touches it nobody ever uses it the thing I don't like is that there's stuff in this photo that is like placed but is not usable in that position like that switch can't be charged there that start menu can't be touched there easily what does it look like tomorrow the one thing that I've got to take a bunch of points off for here is the monitor lamp I freaking hate them Andy I don't want to talk about it right now our next one my piece I like the the theme over the last few years of people having separate
racing Sim setups instead of just like temporarily bolting on the Wheel to your own desk I do think it's better that way if you're already going to go the mile to like buy a seat and a wheel you might as well just and if you've got the space all that kind of stuff yeah for sure damn look at that Chrome American flag I suspect they made it themselves too which is like pretty cool I think a lot of what makes a good battle station is the space that it's in so having the windows with the trees right there adds
a lot of atmosphere I love that monitor arm solution just clipping it to the side of the desk that's really smart what monor oh that monor arm I thought you were talking about the monitor sitting on top of a motherboard box oh and I was like okay that's a Katan box oh yeah In fairness that's probably about the best use of a Katan box who what what do you have against Katan he's lost too many times how dare you see through me like that absolutely fantastic setup yeah all right dark blade 420
wa this is awesome oh my my god oh I love this those speakers are crazy those are nuts on a computer setup those are insane they have the huge Tower speakers and they have the little ones right beside it you can configure them in stereo surround and so they'll just add more sound volume yeah there's just a lot going on here but nothing feels out of place like I like the 3D printing corner and from across from it there's looks like a so solding iron so he has enough table space to actually do
projects yeah he's got some retro collection going on record player as well sick you collect things but like very Tastefully yeah set super cool here oh you need a headphone holder 3D print it get a head yeah literally print yourself a headphone holder now a work in progress forever I've never related to a sentence more in my entire life hold on did you buy two of those light bars it doesn't look as bad to me because it covers the entire monitor it feels more integrated like proportional
color matching here is crazy the the white to the wood and that almost matching in every area is really cool I love the separate 10 key should put on the right side though I do think it should go on the right side I love this under desk mounted headphone amp that is so cool I really like the wall of succulents in the back it tells everyone around you I'm a functioning human being who can remember to put water in something once in a while that's why I don't have any now I know what at least
some of you are thinking those were pretty nice setups but were they really Battle Stations and you're not the only one which is why the elitist of the mostest Elite created their own subreddit called ultimate battle stations oh no sometimes these poor folks even get made fun of for their opulence with ramill saying I get [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] for having more than three displays they say it's Overkill my goodness whoa now this is what I'm talking about that's a battle station okay well I'm not even mad at
the displays how many [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] keyboards do you have this one feels to me like he wants a monitor for each of his tasks instead of realizing that uh you can actually use monitors for multiple tasks probably a Mac guy part of me wants to think like is this a day trader that's the only time I've seen monitor setups like this that Mak sense the problem for me though is they didn't go very vertical In fairness if you're going to go full opulence these days monitors not
that opulent you can get a 27in monitor for like 40 50 bucks on Facebook Marketplace these days the color matching on them is horrendous to me so you got your main gaming in the middle Subway Surfers on the right Subway Surfers on the left Minecraft Parkour on the top left okay bottom left is Family Guy Clips top post ever on r/ ultimate battle stations here we go it's kind of gorgeous yeah very staged though those headphones are not plugged in that is like building the cleanest computer and not having your
front iio hooked up W this is just sick oh that's like a 42 in or a 48 in by the way that's big on the side the wallpaper is a great choice for that background like overall the aesthetic is very strong very clean why did these textured wall panels go out of fashion I thought they were super cool I think it's just too many people did them so they became kind of overdone and everyone's like I don't I want to be unique brother in Christ you have that monitor and then you have a Logitech C920 it looks
comically small nice setup yeah it's just clean there's not much to roast on that other than the camera why don't we have a look at some more practical setups from r/ average Battle Stations okay well wallpaper 10 out of 10 okay this is a little more average than I was expecting that uh that power strip on the floor brother if the button is up and your feet are coming down you're going to have a bad time oh yeah this is cute this is nice this is yeah I really like you know you don't have the biggest
desk you want two monitors you have one just hang over the side very cool yeah you make it work right yeah yeah oh not the dental pick oh that's the only thing worse than the nail clipper for me you know those are disposable right this post I'd like to think it's at least average I predict that Luke is going to be ripping on this guy for only having one Monitor and daring to call this a battle station everyone deserves a second monitor you can get them for $10 sell me on two monitors if I'm someone
who only has one once you have two monitors I feel like it's difficult to go back because you lose so so much if you're someone who games even if you're in borderless window your game will fill the one monitor that you have I know very few gamers in this generation sir uh that are down with doing just one thing so you're probably watching you know Subway Surfers or whatever on your side ramping up in hostility as we go imagine I said sell me and now you're threatening me if you don't get a one
creative speakers those look not great wa it looks really sick at night time that's actually really clean my latest setup oh my gosh I love this is that an actual car seat with an actual towel over the butt just like people put in their cars scrap wood for the frame oh they did the same for their computer though oh the customade wooden Cable Management under the desk oh yeah I very much enjoy the the handyman aspects of this app I'll say that controller Mount love the controller
mount with two screws into a piece of wood oh my God I'm on their desktop wallpaper is that Jay's it kind of looks like but like a very young AI beautified J got him after using laptops for about 20 years it's been so much fun building a gaming PC and flushing out my setup it's fleshing out but that's okay this is just like an average setup magic cards on Deck ready to go just in case a challenger approaches at any time they tried with cable management they have like cable management sleeves the
power work hanging out of it not my favorite thing but man of culture I love the footrest I'm not a big fan of the clear monitor holder yeah get another monitor overall it's a good setup though that being said your computer looks cool oh yeah here we go oh no our next section is we go lower welcome to r/ shitty Battle Stations yes have you never been here you can't say you've never been here I don't think I've ever been there really I've absolutely been there yeah yeah oh no where is that cable coming
out of is that a sprinkler oh gosh it is what am I looking at I do appreciate that looking at this setup they were like ah yes I need the ergonomics of the screen being higher um what are the pliers on the ground for and the slippers you took them off to take the photo and you thought it fit the space better I don't know been using this setup for years that's not good go get some free furniture you've got a $200 Bluetooth speaker dude he's got like a $150 Mouse we should do a whole series of videos on
budget allocation I would never shame someone for not having money but I would shame someone for not having a lot of money and blowing all of it on a fancy Bluetooth speaker when you don't even have a desk get a free keyboard yeah get a table you can put your knees under yeah and you're doing fine just moved into a new house see like this one at least they were like I should be able to put put my knees under the thing I give a little bit of Grace to people that have moved it takes a little while to
get set up and like you don't want to buy temporary Furniture so you kind of make what you have work they had raid night it's gameing night with the boys sure they were in the middle of moving in and they were like crap it's an hour until I got to be online I'm going to throw something together I'm going to use these saw horses I'm going to put this here I'm going to do that blah blah blah blah I am not liking this chair situation though what chair situation you'd be like sinking into this thing it
looks more like a hammock oh my God okay I don't believe this photo this looks staged cuz the house is super clean yeah all the products are super clean that's like a very solid small form factor PC down there this looks thoughtful enough that it might just not be fake I think it's real but temporary buddy reinforced the Box though if he was just taking the picture he could have just put out these little side flaps to hold up the main flap but see there's a second non lawnmower box
inside to keep it from buckling oh uh there's do armrest on the left side that's one of those things where like it's not actually missing the arm it's missing 3 seconds of work to put the arm back on that mouse pad sucks get a better one yeah LTC store.com yeah Home garage setup oh the bong right there front and center baby you went to massive bong I went to feet yeah yeah yeah that's the first thing I saw oh got the gun 1911 probably Airsoft if it's not store it properly please who are
these names that are crossed out now Alicia oh oh uh no notes keep sending it oh do you see the second B whoa no I didn't wow wait that's a laptop it is dude it's just taped on that's crazy tell me it's mounted more than that there's no way I love that this is permanent enough that they put an RGB strip across the back of the monitor for bias lighting I also love that they clearly are okay with taping things to back of their monitor but just dangled that USB off behold my carpal tunnel
syndrome inducing setup wow reward Yourself by getting a free table that you can put your legs under literally games like this and it's not like you don't have the space it has to be a joke it has to we need to do a better job with things like promoting scrap red Wars we got a better chair for free I think this has potential I like the idea of portable gaming setups yeah but you really need to make it that your legs have somewhere to go and that there is more mousing area you're never too old to be a
game it's kind of sick that's crazy I don't think they're doing a ton of gaming on the all-in-one Fujitsu computer and that Mouse and that Mouse space you have enough to go up and down also I love that we can tell that you're actually a boomer because you not only have paper you got a printer someone in the comments mentioning no IV bags imagine dropping the mouse and it falls down the stairs all right the last one  belongs yeah I can't find a pattern with you so I like janky ingenious Solutions
and this is a great way to have one of those things this just your knees are constantly shooing against that drawer I would give them the benefit of the doubt if the whole thing had equivalent patina but like this bottom shelf is almost pristine oh yeah and this is disgusting is disgusting so I think it's food and bod things oh that's gross all right too many fake ones we got to get back to stuff that's you know maybe an actual battle station and not just Karma farming so these are people that weren't
confident enough to post on r/b stations but do think that their setups are good how many of these subreddits exist there are there are too many of these sub what are you talking about this is sick the grass wall dude dude this is sick why were you not confident on Battle Stations this is probably one of the cooler ones we've seen I quite like this idea they just need to commit to the plant wall and have other fake plants in it as far as couple setups go I actually really like the vibe here they even took
the time to like clearly tuck something along the edge there Back to Basics that's not a basic Mouse though Colton you're here this is your mouse well it looks like it yeah Basics my butt wow you spent a lot of money on arms the mic arm I totally understand the monitor one I really don't feel like he got a lot of height out of it I don't like the texture of the paint but that's not something I was just going to say uh your paint job sucks who do you think you are Colton is this Colton they
Colton's Mouse and got Colton's paint quality leave me alone I was sent here too ridiculous for average battle stations not enough Nano leafes for  Stations I like it yep the curtains could go oh gosh they can they ever bro is that a handbrake on the right that's crazy in general I actually I give you respect I like this setup all right apparently we're going back to actual r/ Battle Stations oh dang look at the view out of this place I mean you just doxed yourself but like that is a beautiful clock too
that's a sick place to store that though that's crazy assuming you're like left-handed as well phase one more Decor to come yeah please get more Decor this Wall's pretty boring really good start though you can see the vision the one cable I just wrote that along the monitor arm and I don't like that desk pad I don't like the texture of it but I also don't like that it's curling up at the back left corner all right moving on this person's asking how can I improve my station I'm sure we'll have some
thoughts there's lots to like here and I love this frog in the rocking chair this is some of the most tasteful vinyl figurin that I think I have ever seen that's a fairly tall keyboard I would get a wrist rest and I would get a better mouse pad um other than that I honestly think this is pretty sick oh you just named yourself you should delete this we did find something to improve after all Greenery oh cuz they used like the flares on r/ Battle station yeah that's cool that is
wow is that what is that one of those Elgato that's the Elgato stream deck plus I think got the a really cool place to that that's great I could hang out in this space Dual Purpose art SL acoustic treatment super into that I thought that was Markiplier for a hi I like the vibe I think the computer space does nothing for me yeah why can be mad that you don't have two monitors there's nowhere to put it this is fine it's also I think an ultra wide leave me alone stop it that wasn't going to say
anything you literally just projected bro holy took your advice uh-oh Whose advice did you take you're automatically going to win over David with The Last of Us wallpaper I like it I'm a fan I wish I I have the Thor's hammer from God of War Ragnarok but I wish I had the ax it's way cooler what's with this trend of people having clocks under their monitors that would be a nice way I don't have to check my phone cuz if I check my phone I'm going to have messages and I have to reply and then
all of a sudden I'm outside of my game whereas this I can just quickly look and be back back gaming I like the the storage situation you have on the top left I think that's really cool this is great very good Stu good job taking whoever's advice you took jury still out but man you can't deny that view what view oh did they and I will say again the PlayStation looks good I'm tired of these boring people just being like Oh the Xbox is black normal box is the best looking console that's why no
one bought it I'm not saying that the Xbox is better the PlayStation sucks ass it looks horrible no it looks good you didn't even notice it right away because it fits so well in the setup yeah but now it sticks out like a godamn sore thumb nope looks great yeah it's pretty tasteful honestly I don't feel like this is the best use of the space though like they've got all this extra space over here on the left but everything's kind of kind of crammed in here dude you have
an Overkill camera that's crazy Leica I think you's got two leas I'm talking about their webcam I like a you a lot another sub genre is Ikea oh boy I like this this used to be a cool thing that everyone did you put up the boxes for your Hardware why you need two gpus I don't know doesn't matter to me yeah I like the peg board yeah I like the controller holders over on the left what is that I think that's the stand so reflective third monitor uh yeah in general sick yeah switch foot dude that
a signed that's pretty cool look at this lens oh yeah who are you creeping on boy 100 to 400 I think like we'll sign your record if you stop taking photos of us there's like a little bit of like you know just shove that keyboard cable down the back there a little bit more RGB free is a tag so like no RGB is just having a laptop is that cheating it probably has an RGB keyboard so that's why it's closed please please include me I'm pretty sure I see a backlight on this keyboard I could be wrong I I think it's
just the light ew are those overlapping desk pads I think that's what that is am I it just goes to show you left-handed people can't be trusted Light Side developer setup I enjoy this just because you are a rare Shiny Pikachu because all the developers are into dark mode everything I was just going to say I love the strategically positioned chair so that you can't see any of the cables by the computer funny I was going to I thought you were going to point out the garbage
can right in front of the plug nice yeah that too you're one of those grown-up people I've heard so much about like this is the most responsible adult that I will probably ever have any form of interaction nice to meet you see you later I like the desk pad oh not this is that Bloody desk pad again I know who wants felt desk pad ew I get it looks F good but it feels awful or even if it does feel good to you it's not the best for tracking don't do that um custom  exciting W what what's that I'm
overwhelmed Luke I love it it is not what I want but you go and you go hard I am a big fan of anything like kind of UV glow looking and this is For Better or For Worse kind of my vibe that mic is not where that know also I'm not a huge fan of the just like ugly random boxes under it what is it game on the only monitor that's eye Lev is the laptop is this even for gaming or is this a Hardcore Audio setup it might be a music setup cuz they've got that keyboard they have speakers like crazy and that's a
wall mount Case by the way that they have not wall mounted icy cool with the external radiator no no no put your radiator somewhere else to hide it six set up pretty cool to have an external radi get a second monitor please God this is such a great computer that's beautiful got the pre-bent metal tubes I actually really dig those uh CPU runs the traditional would be to do the the right angles but I actually really like the just like they look like make me think of like lightning bolts like because
they also did both of them like I think if they had one that was diagonal it would look way out of place but they were just like you know what I'm going to do both of them like this finishing this off here are some of Alex's personal favorites I live in a van and this is my battle station the puppy boy even though that's like pose he's like I need people to know I play the guitar yeah is it there when you sleep like that's a night elf Mohawk nerd he's not going to understand he
I've never played wow oh yeah oh for sure and I think those are real plants you think so they look too branchy to be fake they might not be alive my mom needed to use my computer for her weekly book Club Zoom I don't think I'm getting it back that's sick that actually looks awesome I love how you can clearly see little bro setup in the mirror and he's he's just gameing G hard like he is unfazed by the the craziest Redstone setup ever don't forget about the VR controllers for book
club are those pedals or are they just footrests oh it's a flight Sim cuz look they have flight stem sticks so it's clearly like foot pedal to help with steering and whatever maybe a bit different than the norm here I like this one I'm just a fan of people that have their tools organized dude you got a Pog perfectly organized garage I always really enjoy it when people have like the craft areas next to their computer and this one is their computer is next to their craft area it's like it's like
the inversion which is actually really cool they clearly are like a Hands-On do stuff and then okay I got time to game oh the whole thing looks like it's on Wheels oh yeah yeah paint your wall though brother you put the work into taping it and mudding it and sanding it last land before I'm a dad I've actually seen this one before this one's wholesome I love the just like making it work like this dude's most pad is just like some picture from something these people look like they could work here
yeah this looks like a fun time and even just the idea of like the last land party before having a kid I love it I'm a big fan of this wholesome just like this wholesome segue to our sponsor throughout this whole video red Magic's Nova gaming tablet didn't complain once as we screen record reported locally thanks to its Snapdragon 8 gen 3 leading version as well as its 16 gigs of lpddr 5x Ram with a high resolution High refresh rate display you can dominate all your favorite mobile Arenas
especially if you get extra sweaty and take advantage of the Native mouse and keyboard support to get into the game quickly there's fingerprint and facial unlocking and dtsx Ultra audio with vibration effects to add an extra layer "of immersion it has a 10,100 mAh battery" and comes with an 80 W fast charger and you can check it out at the link down below if you guys enjoyed this video May me go check out the time that the staff roasted the bosses did you participate in that I was the writer so I watched it
is it funny it's very funny how bad do you guys go after me your setups are so average how dare you
