what if we could have a screen the size of the entire wall that looks amazing okay okay last time we were here at the land gaming center badminton Hall we tried to make the biggest possible gaming display on this 190 Ft white wall but we ran into a limitation our weak sauce consumer projector with its fixed lens would have me traveling through the wall in order to get the image big enough not to mention it's pretty DM so there was only one thing to do we brought in the big
guns so With a Little Help from our friends at Clark's Audi visual we are going to be building the largest possible gaming display I'm talking something worthy of Weird Al Yankovic over "2,000 in diagonally from all the way" over there to the very far end  tricky I want to quickly shout out co-pilot who sponsored this video more on those guys later but first let's take a look at the Beast this is the Epson Pro l505 uh a commercial grade projector that makes the ls 12000 look like an
absolute toy fundamentally they're based on very very similar technology it uses oh my God hey Ry get ahe okay it uses a three chip laser projection system giving it amazing contrast and in this one's case spectacular brightness and color performance this thing is rated to "Output 12,000 lumens and that is in" color you can kind of cheat your Peak brightness rating if it's just white but they didn't it weighs over 50 lb but when you consider the performance it's actually not that much bigger than a
home Cinema projector and it's got some major benefits for an application like this the biggest one is support for interchangeable lenses this right here is an Epson short throw monster that is able to achieve A8 throw ratio meaning that we could get a 100t wide image being only 80 ft away from the wall that because there's another wall in the way was incredibly important for our application because otherwise we'd have to have this thing somewhere outside of the building over there shining through
a window uh what's one of these worth if "I damage it about 3,000 actually you" know in the world of Cinema lenses not that bad I mean I'm not going to but oh my oh my God just in case nice the rest of the pretty much boil down to ease of deployment since companies like Clarks operate out of travel cases like these they roll up to a show or an event they unpack in a matter of hours they expect everything to run perfectly and they need to pack it all the way again in a matter of
hours so at the front of this unit we've got what Epson calls their pixeline camera system this allows the unit assuming all of the projectors have it unfortunately we won't be using it today to take a picture of the wall compensate for any Oddities or overlaps and help you align all of your projectors into a giant video wall pretty much automatically and coming around to the back look at those professional grade inputs I mean come on you can't have an HDMI cable just coming unplugged in the
middle of a show unacceptable that's why we've got BNC and this particular unit has support for both control 4 which is present on the ls2000 and Crestron which is a home automation system but realistically is so baller that it's the kind of thing that you would find at stadiums and houses of worship and things like that but enough Yik Yak you guys want to see it in action right to make the deployment a little bit simpler well at least in some ways we grabbed a few of the scissor lifts that they
happened to already have here on the construction site and we strapped our three projectors for the massive video wall that we're building to the railings which I guess makes sense the reason I have to move it is because in order for us to have an Apples to Apples comparison of brightness we're going to have to put this a lot closer to the wall than the LS1 12000 because of the short throw lens you're going to have to move back Adam he's back atam the uh less impressive superhero give that blue
scissor lift a little kiss uh oh no not quite we're good I felt like I moved a lot but this is still enormous uh we can zoom out a little bit but Adam you're going to have to move really far away in  size can we hit the lights and that my friends is the difference between a 2700 Len projector just great for your home theater you know 120 150 in screen and a "12,000 Lumen display that uh did I" "mention consumes 1,700 Watts meaning" each of these requires its own power
circuit what you're looking at right now is about give or take a 40t screen and it still looks awesome the consumer version looks like a toy in comparison do you want to compare white to white that's white that's now all I need is to fix my alignment and a game controller oh my God it looks like a giant TV wait does this not support HDR no do you see anything about HDR support on the site I can't find anything with HDR well we'll just have to try to enjoy it without HDR I guess what a downer you
know I think I'd probably get over it "what's one of these worth 15,000 $15,000" I think we can use the consumer one  land man that's sick but if one's cool then three must be better there it is guys we're about to show you guys how we're doing it but first we need to talk about our sponsor co-pilot Adam's on a little hike over there so while he approaches I'll talk about what it is you get a fully featured workout app with video instructions and exercise descriptions you also get access to your
own personal trainer because one of the hardest parts of sticking to your fitness plan is accountability it is so easy to ignore an app notification and having a real person looking out for you can make a huge difference I was a Bonafide gym rat during the pandemic and I struggled with getting back into the gym in the recent years but my co-pilot coach Nate has brought extra fun and variety to my workouts that make me want to get back into the gym and even helps me by adjusting my workouts for times
when I'm traveling so I can still make progress even when I don't have access to my usual gym the app allows me to sync my health data and my workout data from other apps to give me and my coach a fuller picture of my health and my progress and the beauty is I get to think as much or as little about my workouts as I want I can discuss changes with my programming with my coach or I can just show up Pump iron and Trust trust that my workout will be designed to help me achieve my goals in fact
there's evidence that people who have access to a personal trainer have improved training outcomes versus those that are going it alone with a compatible Smartwatch you can use motion tracking to analyze your sets form and pacing with live feedback and this comes at a price that is all way way lower than your typical personal trainer and if you don't gel well with your coach you can always switch to a new one and find somebody who fits your needs and unlike many gyms there's no hidden cancellation fees or
desperate sales people trying to get you to upgrade your membership how long have you been using it uh like 3 months now oh cool okay yeah so you can check out co-pilot at the link in the video description once you've got all three projectors in place what is the first step in your process yeah so the first thing we do is we get them all aligned by eyeball so we just look at them and we use the lens shift built into the projectors to get them all looking roughly the same huh I mean these two
look pretty darn good you've done this before yeah once or twice with that out of the way what can you tell me about the little black box that we've got all three of them linked into here uh the black magic box is the data path FX4 it's a video wall controller so basically what you can do is take one input source whether it's a laptop or a game console or whatever you want it to be and split it amongst a bunch of different screens or projectors and does this support the same kind of blending
that we did with our commercial Quadro output that we used last time we did something like this or better it's a little bit better uh basically what it does is it offloads that from the PC so you're taking that and you're putting it on a Standalone piece of Hardware got it but latency latency is awesome couple of milliseconds at best I guess we'll find out I guess we will the next thing we're doing is getting all of the projectors focused then it's time to put up the grid a test pattern that helps them
check their focus and check and refine the alignment between the three projectors oh my gosh that's so cool that's a couch for scale take that maxl ad do you see how small his TV was I mean look if we used Weird Al's song would he forgive us I mean he's a pretty   us it is so far beyond the edges of my peripheral vision so where's the middle but we're not ready to game yet the next step is Corner adjustment so Clarks has finished up this side and you can see actually man that is that is
bang on we've got a straight line right across the floor right into that corner straight up to the top and straight over there and now they're going to go projector by projector and try to align them with the first one you can't imagine something like this you can look at a big blank wall and you can kind of go yeah that would be cool but oh my God while these gentle folk finish aligning the last one I thought I'd take my TV for a walk just want to kind of see how long it takes to make it all the way
from one Edge to the other good gravy I haven't even made it past one projector yet we're going to get there though hey Adam how's it going setting up the audio what it it's great good stuff you look comfortable Oh I'm great yeah I love this inflatable couch I'm on projector number two   soon oh man I'm not going to need a personal trainer after all sorry sponsor okay trying one come on come on come on come on come on come on come on come on come on come on come on come on come
on behold the world's widest start  that world record that's not a world record it's a Linus world record behold the much smaller troubleshooting display just like that and now we have our one two and three projectors okay oh oh that's something wait for it wait for it wait for it yes cease waiting new plan forget the video wall controller we're going back to Envy surround the diagonal is 173 ft which wait what yeah it doesn't make any sense it's only 3 ft longer than the width
yeah cuz it's such a acute diagonal even only 3 ft that's it we we've tried it on multiple different calculators that's what checks out 32 ft tall 170 ft wide did we let down Frank that's 276 in yeah Frank still got it here we freaking  let's go Dan's got it no Dan Dan you do the honors I don't think we've ever actually seen Dan game your pad sir thank you all right spider solitire oh come on do we have sound I don't know if this website has sound Dan tried to change the
volume hold on let me go let me go tell you what it's at  then yeah I think I can hear every bass note about six times I been to some weird parties but this is definitely the weirdest I'm kidding I haven't been to any parties but it's weird oh my God we can see the whole level hold on wait wait wait wait wait wait no go back go back go back all  Boys I Get Wrecked you suck you're dead already what are you guys even doing this is not like the original oh  God this is extremely the
mouse the mouse is awful skill issue I could just sit and watch a complete novice play video games on this you know how I [Laughter] know I'm just kidding Dan you're doing great I'm amazed at how the like the pillars just have disappeared for me oh yeah they don't even matter like it's just we're staring directly at one it's so immersive though okay Dan let's see how well you can drive there is definitely going to be some float plane extras from this video so lmg Dogg flat
plane I'll see you guys over there it's about to  woo oh man that is wild look I've seen a lot of really cool Tech I have never seen this okay i' I've seen displays like this but they're always Out Of Reach at the top of buildings or whatever I don't actually get to game on them oh my God you could actually drive like this though you can see so much of the road in front of you car is bigger than an actual car that's hilarious look at the scenery though yeah like it's freaking Scenic it's like
looking out a massive window it's just like it's like it expands your horizons man yeah fors of Horizons five I'm going  bar oh shoot who wins now humans or machines this is by far the most immersive experience I've had in flight  simulator it freaking feels like you're being dragged on a Shute behind the   yeah oh God oh God no not the people no not there Dan oh my God no no no no no at least at least he biffed in the who so back to the title is it the world's biggest
TV if high sense can call theirs a laser TV then I say we're in the clear there did we build it with help kind of but do those details really matter we have it we gamed on it and it was so freaking cool I just want to shout out Clarks again these guys were freaking awesome and Shout out our sponsor if you're looking for an easier way to start being active or you're looking to enrich your current training co-pilot's team of personal trainers and robust workout app can help check out our co-pilot link go.my
