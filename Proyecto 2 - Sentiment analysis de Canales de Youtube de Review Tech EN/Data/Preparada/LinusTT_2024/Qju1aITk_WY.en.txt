displays performance battery life and so much more laptops are one of the most complicated product categories to test because until you can evaluate every individual part you can never hope to see the whole picture which is why it's taking us two years to nail down a comprehensive test Suite so strap in with some help from our sponsor MSI Who provided some test subjects for this run through and by the time we're done you're going to know how our Labs team can help you avoid the trp tops and find
yourself a slap top shipments typically arrive in the afternoon which leaves us only a few hours to kick things off we start with a quick physical to make sure that what we got matches what it says on the tin and to clean out any pre-installed garbage like McAfee or Norton we went back and forth on this practice quite a bit and ultimately what we decided was that it was best for us to test the hardware without it being influenced by a performance sapping bloat and huh also sometimes it would
falsely identify our mark bench automation software as a virus so now in a perfect world these are fresh from the factory but every now and then we'll get a review sample that's been passed around so we'll do a full system reset then we'll write down the default power profile before changing it to the most battery economical mode in this case super battery then we Chuck it into our 20Â° environmental test chamber fully charged and we go go home to rejuvenate our mortal shells endurance
testing typically needs to run overnight because it can take a very long time depending on the system we use 720p YouTube video playback at a usable but fairly dim 200 nits with 100% display scaling and we make sure to turn off any keyboard RGB for our endurance test Hardware info is used for logging which we found is lightweight enough to only  then we pull it out dead as a door nail man this stealth 18 AI studio is smaller than its name especially when you factor in the core Ultra 9 185h and RTX 480 in
here sheesh now these sponsored MSI laptops are just for demonstration purposes for this video we're going to be publishing our independent non-sponsored test results at LTT labs.com the reason we test like this isn't because don't trust manufacturers I mean we don't but not necessarily because we think they're all liars sometimes they are but even the best intentioned manufacturers rarely agree with each other on how to test their devices and if you dig into the fine print you'll find all kinds of
interesting choices like nigh unusable brightness levels disabled wireless connectivity or a battery life test where they do nothing but display a desktop background that's why we create created our own set of criteria that we feel the average person would agree represents sure economical but actual realworld use of the device we also have a second test to give you guys a range that looks at how well it'll handle a full stress situation on top of our maximum endurance test by the way in the
future once we get our Pam or power analysis module we'd like to incorporate charge times as well as discharge times speaking of charging while it's getting reenergize we determine what sort of weight class our laptop sits in you'd think that we could do this with just specs but without going on a 2hour rant we can't so what we do is we pop it back into the Ed box performance mode and make sure that the windows power mode is set to best performance for consistency sake after that we run a quick 1080p
Total War Warhammer 3 Benchmark which uses a good mix of CPU and GPU that we can use to determine what tests we should bother with for example if we're looking at Netbook that's scores under 20 FPS or just straight up dnfs will focus on lighter Esports titles rather than wasting time on cyberpunk in the case of the Titan 18hx with an Intel Core i 94900 HX 128 GB of ddr5 memory and an RTX 4090 mobile GPU will be looking at numbers so high we can assume that Dota 2 runs fine and move on to
other things it also lets us know if something appears to be faulty for instance we test a laptop that we think should be somewhere in the heavyweight or middleweight tier but ends up performing more like a featherweight then before we do any more rigorous testing we'll dig around and find the roote cost sometimes they're from storefronts like Ali Express and they just plain suck sometimes it's old stock with dried out thermal paste and then sometimes it's just a really slow laptop
either way it gives us a really good idea of what to expect once the unit's recharged we'll do a couple of quick battery stress tests before moving on to gaming Max brightness refresh rate keyboard RGB on full blast you know whatever the maxed out power mode is the whites we'll hit it with prime 95 for CPU only devices as well as a combuster workload for a simulated gaming load on our gaming laptops then comes our suite of gaming benchmarks courtesy of mark bench this automated system runs what we
call harnesses which are created on a perame basis using either canned benchmarks that are built into the game or our own custom playthroughs it gives us reliable easily graph data and what's cool is it can even handle some productivity tests like cinebench 2024 and Puget benches Premier Pro and Photoshop benchmarks 3D marks storage test and UL proon office productivity aren't in mark bench yet but we are working on them and together all of these numbers give us a clear picture of
the machine's performance both in gaming and in general usability this is all done with the fans running in whatever profile they're set to out of the box and the goal here is to record the typical non- tinker and user experience now we have observed cases where we might get a few more FPS with the cooling system cranked 211 but what we suspect is that most people want their laptop to stay firmly planted on the table instead of taking off and hovering though if the fans happen to creep up to
uncomfortable levels on their own well hey that's just part of the manufacturer's design it's worth mentioning here that non-battery performance testing is currently performed out in the open in the lab not in the environmental chamber it's not as strictly managed but it is still a controlled thermal environment thanks to our Central HVAC system and it sits around 21 de C for an example of what some of our testing data might look like here's some runs on our Titan 18hx from MSI at 1080P 1440p and
2400px at least in part to msi's over boost Ultra which unlocks a whopping 270 watts of total system power and things get even more interesting if you look at CPU only tasks like cine bench 2024 without the GPU sucking up valuable resources our CPU rocketed up to 200 100 watts of power consumption giving this machine very respectable numbers for a laptop chip I mean it's hard to quite achieve desktop performance in a portable form factor but this shows about how close we can get at what cost
though let's head back to the environmental chamber and talk about heat back at the chamber after fighting with Lucas on who gets to use it for the day we make sure that our machine under test is plugged in for maximum performance and then we run it through a series of stress tests with 10-minute braks in between so it can cool off currently we use a set of 15minute thermal load tests using cinnam bench for raw CPU furmark for raw GPU and then both a f-120 3 loop as well as combuster
GL msi2 physx CPU set to medium for both a real world as well as synthetic combined load test with that said we are still experimenting to determine the ideal methodology here we know that there are power viruses that can run the components harder but no one in the right mind is finding new prime numbers of a laptop so leave a like if you think that the current system is good or a comment if you think you have other ideas looking at our results modern core I9 mobile chips can get hot and our
Titan 18hx is no exception even with its Vapor chamber cooling design however in modern devices that are basically designed to throttle the more important metric to look at is sustained clock speed which we report on a graph that looks like this for gamers a combined workload like our f123 Loop is a better representation of how the cooling system is going to handle a typical gaming load now one step that we'd love to add in the future is a set of thermal imaging shots from a Fleer camera while any
device is at its peak thermal load this would tell us whether all the heat is SA sailing comfortably out of the vents at the back or whether it's being conducted through your poor delicate fies give us time though um another two years who knows any who speaking of with all the design delays not to mention permit delays our full-fledged anoa chamber is going to be a while so we built this quiet room as a placeholder now you guys know from experience that some devices can practically scream in pain as they
try to stay cool so we're going to be using this to both test devices and speakers and what's cool is even in its current temporary State it's so quiet nobody can hear me scream oh that's not how it works lonus it is not how it works you told me I could scream in here yeah but I can hear you just fine uh uh look Gary Arc go my Ark my Ark there are still a few more things that we need to do to get our noise flow lower but we're currently measuring about 23 DB in this bad boy which is low
enough that we can comfortably evaluate underload Acoustics for all but the quietest of devices our mic sits roughly 2 feet from the screen which is about where someone would be using a laptop and then we look at as much of the fan noise curve as we can depending on the available operating modes we're not going to be actually publishing numbers from here yet this foam is just some temporary crap that we ordered from Amazon on this is garbage we're going to be replacing it and we have some work to
do on our methodology but we're going to make an announcement once we change out to both the finished version of this chamber and the full one moving on to speakers our stelle studio here has a six- speaker surround sound system that's tuned by Dine Audio with two pairs of dual Force cancelling woofers that's a fancy way of saying that it should look pretty good on our testing mic speaking of looking good that's why our team here wears only the best merch from LTT store.com like these new Labs phase
hoodies next up is my favorite part display testing for laptops it's almost exactly the same as testing any other display so we hook up our stealth 18 AI Studio to the network in a darkened room like this one and launch calman client 3 while another laptop right here runs calman ultimate from portrait displays we then carefully position our cr300 and CR 100 colorimeters these guys measure 10% window sized color swatches to check for accuracy color gamut capabilities and brightness by the way you might have
heard us say this display has an average Delta e2000 of two or three or something along those lines well while that's great for measuring SDR content more and more displays are featuring proper HDR or high dynamic range so we're in the middle of transitioning over to Delta eitp to paint a better picture of what that experience looks like anyway that whole conversation is well beyond the scope of this video for now testing is done in this office upstairs is where we've hung some black dutin and blocked
the automatic light sensor with paper and tape this is what it looks like without any of our lights turned on eventually the plan is to have a full media room where we'll test displays and put some couches a big projector for some subjective audio evaluation as well Rome wasn't built in a day beyond color accuracy gamut and brightness we use an lat as well as an osrt to measure response time and latency whenever supported we take Pursuit motion photos using smooth frog to check for ghosting
or inverse ghosting for subjective analysis and if there are local dimming zones most common on mini LED displays or an OLED where every pixel is a dimming Zone we calculate how many there are and take a look at how much Bloom they cause once the testing is complete we're able to spit out indecipherable numbers like these that some of you have asked us to explain let's use the 4K 120hz mini LED that's on both of our demo machines to explore brightness our "stealth 18 AI studio hit around 1,00"
nits of peak brightness in a 10% window in game gamer mode that means that you can expect a high contrast and Poppy HDR experience as dimming zones light up for flashes of light and explosions while other zones in darker parts of the scene stay dim the total nits value indicates how bright those spots are with a higher value meaning A Brighter Image it goes deeper than that just like color accuracy goes deeper than smaller number better but to learn more you're just going to have to stay tuned for a tech
quickie MSI also wanted us to test the ultra low profile mechanical keyboard on the Titan 18hx but due to some setbacks we can't quite test laptop keyboards yet we can get an accurate scan and our robot works great now that's like 90% of the battle but our logging software runs on a separate device so that's great for Standalone keyboards but we still need to develop a way to set up low latency input pass through Rome built etc etc stay tuned same goes for our EMC Chamber
from Raymond EMC we expect to be able to test Wi-Fi sometime in about Q3 but with that said Wi-Fi 6 and 6c have already been a substantial improvement over previous versions with stable and fast connections being pretty affordable these days and seven is even stronger so it's relatively safe to say that if you're buying a device with Wi-Fi 6 and above you're probably going to be okay for typical web browsing and video call use uh barring any annoying driver issues mediate Tech excuse me sorry
I know this whole thing has been a long time coming and the videos on short circuit might not go into enough detail for some of you at least not yet but that is where LTT labs.com is going to come into play the site is up it's getting regular content updates now and the goal is to have every product that comes into our warehouse go through our lab for testing to determine whether it's worth your hard-earned money before it makes it any further massive thanks to MSI for sending over these guinea
pigs and for sponsoring our efforts to keep them honest we're going to have all the laptops that we showed off today Linked In the description down below as well as the LTT lab's website go check it out and leave some feedback for our team now based on msi's usual feedback they probably want some more screen time for their devices so here we go whether you need the ultimate gaming and Engineering laptop or a portable desktop replacement msi's Titan series devices have got you
covered a little too much power for you we look no further than their r gaming laptops or for something smaller that still packs on major punch try the stealth 18 AI Studio complete with the latest meteor Lake processors from Intel you can check out all of these at the link in the video description thanks for watching if you guys enjoyed this video and you want to know more about how the lab is being utilized maybe sign up on float plane we've got an hour plus long video that goes over exactly that
