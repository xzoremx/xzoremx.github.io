I spent the better part of two years renovating my house into the ultimate Tech house and while the super fast 10 gig networking ball and Wi-Fi and custom theater room are freaking awesome there's a couple of things that didn't exactly go according to plan you see it wouldn't be much of an ultimate Tech house if it wasn't smart and as a father of three the first thing that came to mind was automatic lights so like any sane person would I installed over 100 GE Jasco smart motion
switches only to discover that they were so buggy that they've rendered my entire Z-Wave smart home network pretty much inoperable not very smart which maybe wouldn't be so bad if even the dumb functionality like the integrated motion sensors worked freaking half decent come on hello luckily for me inavi another Smart Switch company heard my cries and decided to design a Smart Switch that would solve all of my problems using millimeter wave technology which can detect people even when they aren't
moving after raising nearly half a million dollars on Indiegogo and spending many painful months on R&amp;D I finally have one in my hands and today sponsored by homie and their homie Pro Smart Hub we're going to start fresh and we're going to try these out and hopefully see the beginning of the end of my smart at home troubles I really hope these work because I don't think my marriage is going to survive another pool party with the lights turning off every 5 minutes it won't before we get
too deep into the Cool Tech in these let's talk about the problems that inavi was trying to solve you guys already saw that the motion sensors are anything but senstive but there's a lot more for starters if you have a three-way switch so that's two switches controlling the same fixture you can only have a motion sensor on one of them and then a dummy on the other side which for stairs can be a downright safety issue because it'll automatically turn the lights on when you're going one way but not the
other this one drives me crazy I like to have the lights off when I go to bed but I want the motion sensors active in case I need to get up but by the time I can get away from them they activate again and you can't reconfigure that this one's been a real be in my Bonnet my old switches will only fade on and fade off which can be quite hard on Smart bulbs  not that they behave much better with dimable bulbs and you can see what I mean here in the gaming room this is one of the ones that still works the worst
part though is that they've gummed up my zwave network so much that I can't even adopt the last 20% or so of the switches and I'm even having issues with non Jasco devices like my baliy wave blinds the blinds have been a particularly sore spot for me because the switches are way up here and I'm well vertically challenged it's not like I want to replace my switches we managed to get Jasco to release the firmware for this product which wasn't previously available Unfortunately they never
updated it to fix any of this stuff and when I reached out to a Z-Wave wizard who offered to help me they basically said wow I've never  before In fairness to Jasco part of the problem is I have so many devices but like it's a smart home that's the idea and besides no amount of firmware updates is going to fix that infrared motion sensing it's kind of last millennium's technology let's talk about homie and first these new inabi switches inavi was actually one of the Front
Runners when we were sampling options for the house and they would have been my first choice they've got a sick LED bar that can help finding switches in the dark show the dimming level and even be programmed to display alerts and stuff like that they worked flawlessly on our testing the only problem is they didn't have a motion dimmer or any kind of presence detector at the time but now they do despite many delays this is a complicated product and they wanted to make this work it's finally here let's 
store.com well the switch Works what that's good so much more responsive well it works like a normal switch which is I'll never take for granted again but I couldn't help noticing that the motion sensing is not working it's not adopted yet I don't know what the default behavior is and this firmware is like very Alpha okay let's adopt it just testing to do that I could use my existing home assistant instance and Z-Wave stick but the problem with that idea is that I don't have these new
inell switches yet I need to rely on these Jasco ones for a while longer and if I unpair them and start fresh it is going to be a nightmare so instead I'm turning to our sponsor homie and we're going to be using the homie Pro to start over for the uninitiated zwave is a wireless low energy smart home communication standard that operates in the 900 MHz Bend which is great for me because I need to not interfere with my already also kind of mangled 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi that's why I didn't want to go
with zigg but the homie pro hub can do both without issue so we could try zigg later for now um that was the physical aspect of the setup so let's get it configured let's add a new homie homie Pro mhm mhm found homie Pro hey look at that changes color oh it supports 5 GHz Wi-Fi don't take that for granted with smart home stuff okay set up my home how many Flo does your home have a couple I'm setting up all the zones right now or at least I'm trying that this is seriously like a
pretty pretty clean interface well we're set up the whole process took about 4 minutes now what while we could add that switch as a generic Z-Wave device there is an inovi app just not officially it's still kind of in development so I got to just manually add it typically when you add one that has an app it'll pop up and be like you should use the app when you try to add it oh cool that doesn't work yet everything's very Alpha by the way shout out to homie for being absolute
homies and working within AI to get this going for us they were literally fixing things for me this morning actual Chads and what's the benefit of an app it just gives you specific customization stuff and then we go back to homie and in theory apps boom already there sweet okay now we can add a device now we can add a device we're going to have to go to the switch though let's do it did you add office yet yeah I mean that's the only reason it took me like four or five minutes to do this is
because adding on the rooms here we go office and then connect device no belly this is a smart present sensing dimmer I'm sure they'll have a catchier name for it at some point yeah uh do I need  quickly and then do it again again yeah twice more I mean let do just do it again trust me your house is pretty mangled in the 900 MHz range for whatever reason I think it's pretty mangled in every range right now and I imagine that switch right next to it it's probably not helping no probably
not we might need to move the Hub over here just to get it to comend you know that makes sense once you've got a whole bunch of devices paired to it they'll mesh up and that's not going to be a problem but just to make life simpler for ourselves he told me not to get these GE switches and he takes every possible opportunity to rub it I haven't said it today yeah not today I tried to get you to get the in ones and have different motion sensors and I understand why you didn't want to do
that but also I wanted it all clean and integrated if you could go back would you I think what I would have done is just left regular switches until inavi developed these but then inavi might have never developed these if I didn't make my video complaining that they didn't exist yeah so I would change nothing you know what's inside there it's actually a raspy compute module really yeah it's a cm4 oh cool yeah that means it's good and should actually be really well supported yeah that's a good
sign hey there we go hey look at that device completed perfect continue setup we are in the office i' already picked that up and then I guess we should just change this to like office switch like this whole thing is so beta still that they only made like 50 of this version and we got two of them to test out uh I mean it works as a light switch right now let's see if the motion's picking up oh look at that motion alarm yes oh and cool actually let's see so with the lights all the way
on it's 50 wats of power and we should see the light value the luminance go up in a little bit here probably let's see oh wow there's even like charts no data obviously cuz we just adopted it I do today no no day yet okay we're paired now which means in theory I should be able to turn it off probably it's a lot smarter than my old ones and it has a bit of a delay on this but I should be able to move oh it definitely disects you oh well for crying out loud okay well how do we make
it turn on with motion well I think we'd have to leave for a bit and then come back okay oh I can do that I actually I don't know what the timeout is like they didn't send me a list of parameters it seems that they match up with their old style switches for the other stuff but obviously the old style switches don't have a motion sensor cool okay I'm going to try it's still detecting motion what it still detects us like most smart home things it doesn't update all the time
because otherwise it' be way too much traffic so it probably updates like once a minute or something like that all right we'll give it a sec I don't know maybe we're in the reflection of something right now oh glass door you know uh okay stuff like this is part of the reason they're not actually going to be using that sensor that's in that switch in the production version there's a new sensor which uses I think 79 GHz instead of 24 GHz in that one and it has a bunch more configuration like you can
tell it to only track in a small section of the sensor and stuff like that actually now is a good time for us to explain this new sensor technology that they're using the big game changer here is millimeter wave the old ones use passive infrared sensors which measure radiation or heat from things like humans cats Etc the new Switch uses millimeter wave which is named after the wavelength of radio signals in the 3 to 300ish GHz range it uses those to detect presence and these sensors are so
accurate they can easily detect someone even if they're trying to stay still because just breathing is enough to trigger them that makes them useful not for just motion and being aware of something that's broadly in the vicinity but exactly how many things are in the vicinity where they are and potentially what doing it's like radar so cool a little big brothery but cool any luck oh I don't think it's working Jake oh no no oh it did work on the other one it showed on my side that when you walked
in that it was on but it wasn't on I love Alpha Testing should we try the other one they sent two of them who knows maybe this one's bunk the most important part for me is honestly not the turning on when I go near them I already got that I want them to not turn off when I'm just sitting still in the room while we're waiting why don't we pair some blinds cuz I was having a heck of a time getting any of those to pair with home assistant okay I mean realistically are you going to control
this area differently than those ones actually maybe yes yeah okay so we'll call this like the Nook yeah sure okay um I could put it under kitchen maybe y new Zone kitchen mil and we'll put it part of lovely connect device let's try it all right oh wait we got to add that the app perfect we can add the app new app I don't know why it opens in a web browser but it seems to work like beautifully so whatever uh Bali there's a new version of my blinds that has Bluetooth that makes them a
little easier to configure and stuff it would have been like you probably missed the cut off by like a couple months nice I had an absolute demon of a time trying to get these things to pair with my setup like they just wouldn't Nook middle blinds I guess okay I mean you're not going to need to address them individually but it would be good to have it set if you did have to do that okay and then I guess this one okay um how I mean I I don't need a I can read I'm fine I can't believe these are just
pairing yeah did you try them before I did but setup like did it work what do you mean like did you try them with my setup before with no no they don't work yeah I guess that's the issue with a mesh network if it's made up of devices that are just a mesh get it a mesh a mess anyway the point is windows are one of the main things you'd want to build automations for because you know Energy Efficiency and stuff like that and I just haven't been able to do it cuz I haven't been able to pair these bloody
things to my broken Z-Wave Network this is great and the homie hub's not even that close anymore now that we've got a couple light switches paired to it the mesh is happening fortunately homie is compatible with a ton of other products so if you don't already have Z-Wave blinds in your house you can use something like the rise Smart Shade system which can turn normal blinds into Smart Ones in order to control all these as a group I'm going to use something called a flow which is what homie calls
its automation system I went ahead and created one that says when this flow started that's something you would just like manually Trigger or trigger with another flow and then set all the positions to 100% which is to open all of them the opposite one close sets them all to 0% and then when we hit go hey there we go for those that want even more control they also have advanced flows in the web version of the homie app it's still easy to use everything is drag and drop but
it gives you a lot more flexibility for example I made an advanced flow that pulls our subscriber count from the YouTube API that way I can make it so Linus's home automations only work if the subscriber count goes up that day now we get to try the light switch what do you think Jake motion going to work doesn't seem like it they clearly weren't working are you kidding me what do you mean they clearly were working they weren't working yeah but we could have checked the thing to
see I already did and it detected it yeah it still says yes as of 20 minutes ago I think there's something in this room that moves enough that it's  still we might have to try it in a different room oh you know what lonus look what's right right in front of the light switch smart thermostat no turn around what the vines no those are fake yeah but they'll move they're not going to move like with the HV fact they might I reckon we try it in a bathroom or something where like nothing's going on
there's a reason they're changing the sensor and there is no tuning parameters right now it will be better credit to homie though their stuff has worked flawlessly so far I know this actually been great it it wait it just worked it worked it worked it it picked you up from under the door crack well like like I said it's really sensitive and this light switch is pointed at the door so even like walking over here could be enough of like an air pressure differential to move the door enough to
trigger that like it's not a great position to have a millimeter wave sensor you know what I mean but but with the other one we could set no zones for it right yeah over to here would be like detection and then here the door should we try one more different spot with the other light switch you just want me to zap myself I mean kind of we want to do another demo in the bathroom downstairs so I'm just throwing in one of in's red series switches so I at least have a working switch in this room it's been
driving us crazy while we've been trying to scrapbook yes I scrapbook there's nothing wrong with that in this bathroom there should not be anything that can move so hopefully we can get a good clean demo here I'm actually super excited though that these are so sensitive because that bathroom upstairs man if you sit and you know play mobile games or read something on the toilet you're stuck in the dark and I already showed you guys how hard it is to reactivate the motion sensors I have
now you're figuring out your business in the dark until you're all the way up when that happens so this is going to be awesome with proper presence detection those lights in there draw 25 WTS if you're wondering wa no wait they have power monitoring that's pretty cool they also have light sensors so if it's like really bright in a certain room and you don't want the lights to turn on automatically when it's bright you can set it up to do that how would that work with homie you could say like if it
turns on and this is too high then don't  okay okay it works you hadn't even walked in yet now the question is how sensitive is it well there's probably a timeout right I don't I don't think it will trigger again until the motion is like cleared for a little bit and then triggered again knowing in AI I'm sure there'll be configuration options for that too there just isn't right now or at least I don't know what they are it still knows I'm in here though right oh yeah cool why need you walk out for a
second and then try it again okay I'll walk out let's see I'm kind of stoked on how simple homie is it's really simple why did I do the whole home assistant thing again well I don't know hey look no it's clear okay so it's about a minute run in there again it might be exactly a minute I want to see just how sensitive it is you're going to sneak up on it yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah just just hold on dude the door is going to trigger this a l hold on I'm going to just I don't think it can see me down 
stuck okay well yeah oh that's why it couldn't see cuz of the molding dude dude the second I was clear of this occlusion here it was on I don't think we're going to fool it it still says motion buddy you're just wasting your time I give up there's no way I'm going to be able to hide from this thing which is a good thing you want a presence detection system to work like this so that's good now you can Doom scroll on the in peace I think the best thing about today is just how
painless everything was I'm used to having range issues that I need to sort out with like USB extensions on my zwave stick but instead the homie Pro just immediately worked cuz I can put it anywhere I want instead of it being stuck in my concrete basement they've got a ton of different solutions so while the homie Pro is a little on the pricier side for some they also have the homie Bridge which is a much cheaper Hub that can be used as an extension for the homie Pro or can be used Standalone with
their Cloud software in a subscription for myself I just like having everything running locally and fortunately homie does have that option and doesn't require subscription for that we'll have links to homie and the rest of the stuff that we showed off in the video description before we wrap up there's a couple other things we should highlight from homie their dashboards are in beta they provide a customizable visual interface to control and monitor your smart home devices there's a high degree
of personalization you can have real-time control and insights into things like temperature energy usage or security status it's available on the homey app for IOS and Android and we haven't even shown you some of the other really cool features like homie mve they allow you to quickly capture and set the lighting in your home by creating custom moods or choosing from pre-made ones and while Jake showed you guys homie flows there's a whole other level of customization with homie script
which I think is more for the Jakes of the world and I probably wouldn't touch what I will touch is those finished switches and then maybe between now and then we can figure out do I keep home assistant or do I just go with something simpler I don't know homies seems to work pretty good and they're homies if you guys enjoyed this video why not check out the one where we originally installed my Jasco switches it was kind of a nightmare but hey what do you mean it kind of a nightmare we're still
living in it sometimes that's fun for you guys
