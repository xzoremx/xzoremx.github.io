it's no surprise that the most popular controllers are first-party ones especially the modern Xbox controller and that makes a lot of sense it's a premium controller with a comfortable shape and it just works with all your modern PC games and even with other consoles like the Nintendo switch if you get the right dongle but what is a surprise is that in the dumpster fire of Cheaper alternative controllers are some downright excellent options with some of them going for less than
$30 so we answered the title's question already it's this because it's good but what we haven't answered is what you should be buying and that is a bit more complicated unlike this simple segue to our sponsor nexo whether it's niow bonjour or hola the hello cam Pro from nexo is a reliable upgrade to your webcam setup thanks to its 1080p resolution 60 FPS frame rate and windows hello facial recognition pick it up at  before we get to our Alternatives have you ever wondered why pretty much every
modern PC controller shares that same familiar Xbox layout it turns out it's for some good reasons one being it's pretty ergonomic especially compared to some of its ancestors but the bigger one is xinput the xinput API will automatically bind compatible controllers to the right in inputs in your favorite games and while it's less versatile than the older D input standard which is still used especially for complex flight and racing rigs its limitations because of the standard Xbox
layout allow it to be much more easily implemented strangely enough the second best-selling controller is the only D input controller that we're going to see today the ps5s Dual sense can it still be used for PC games short answer yes long answer yeah yes but it depends on how much tinkering you want to do four out of the five games that we tested needed some kind of manual remapping now there are wrappers like steam input or DS for Windows that will wrap the D input in an xinput container that should
fix these issues and in games where the developers build in Native support for the Dual Senses extra features it is one of our favorite controllers especially in games that heavily make use of the d-pad we're going to have it and every controller we recommended from this video linked down below but enough about controllers that cost almost a 100 loonies I said that there are great controllers you guys are buying for $30 or less and this next one is not one of them the Logitech f310 has remained
mostly unchanged since its release in 2010 making it probably our best fit for the title here because honestly guys why is every everyone still buying this controller it looks like a little brother Edition for the PS2 and honestly it feels like one too I mean is this really the best that Logitech can come up with I mean it's apparently kept at "least 25,000 of you reasonably happy but" look at the way the d-pad Jiggles and no they like that they love it I mean I guess if that's what you're
used to there's also the wireless variant the f710 which is also pretty fine if you like your controllers to feel like a Brick In fairness The Price is Right at just 20 and $40 respectively and logitech's established reputation for warranty service sets them apart from many other competitors in this price class I mean only the best will do for billionaires who need to visit the Titanic of course while we're combing The Depths it's probably worth seeing if we can find something a little better oh
here's a more recent top performer the 8bit do ultimate C has been sitting among Amazon's best sellers pretty consistently for months and is racking up four and a half star reviews at an incredible rate its MSRP is $30 with frequent discounts down to just 20 bucks and that is with a 2.4 GHz wireless dongle I mean that puts this whole package under the price of a Microsoft first-party dongle alone so it must be trash right I mean yeah Bo dude everything about it feels pretty good
the shape is very similar to a regular Xbox controller I mean the d-pads nothing special but the face buttons feel really good even the triggers have a pretty satisfying feel to them and it has an integrated battery for that price that's something to consider guys Microsoft does include batteries with their controller but they're disposables not rechargeables and this has USBC charging with an integrated battery right out of the box I'm not saying it's the right choice for from a
sustainability standpoint I'm just saying it is a value ad and wait what's this I'm getting reports of a brand new just released 8bit do ultimate 2C it comes in new multi-tone colorways and no "way two extra shoulder buttons 1,000 HZ" pulling rate and hall effect analog triggers and sticks meaning they should remain Snappy and precise long into the future guys this is a big upgrade so uh how much more is it going to cost it's the same price same price so wait why would I even buy that one the previous
generation 8-bit do controller that had Hall effects was twice the price of the regular one and the only other benefits are Bluetooth and a charging dock they kind of thought of everything the edges are more round and comfortable in the hand especially at the edge of the shoulder and Trigger buttons the grip texture is less abrasive and feels a little less likely to collect a detailed his hisory of every skin cell that ever rubbed against it and while this spot where the face meets the textured back
is a little bit on the sharp side that's not a part of the controller that you would ever naturally interact with the d-pad still not a star player but darn it they did put in some work to make it feel more tactile and even the face buttons feel just I don't know 8% more tactile oh the bumpers are clicky now dude I really like this thing it's even clicker than the regular Xbox controller which I may be bad or good depending on your preference but I like it of course I haven't actually played a game yet how
does it stack up for actual gaming whoops oh how does the controller feel oh right the controller controller feels good brother really like the thumb sticks like the thumb sticks a lot very little dead zone I can't blame the thumbsticks for everything that's happening right now this is just hard do you want to try same game with the Logitech huh oh you want me to try the other controllers that makes sense can't say I'm thrilled about it but uh yeah give me a sec dude I'm
still not that stoked on the uh on the face buttons okay that's good to know they're a little slow cuz in terms of input latency the 2C with the receiver was the lowest of everything we tested it's less the input latency and it's more how far they are to mash I just find that I I'm having a little bit of more difficulty with them of course this the only it's only the first one that I've looked at so maybe just side by side come on okay wait wait no we you've tried this a 100 times with this one
let's try the other controller all right  answer oh my God this analog stick wow controller design has really come a long way in the last 14 years years um maybe we just go d-pad here yeah test  say I me realistically I'm not doing any worse I think the cold hard truth is I'm just not that good at Super Meat Boy you might have a little extra trouble with this one this controller actually has the highest tested input latency nothing is too unusable this is 23.5 milliseconds so it's still within the
realm of that's okay yeah um but that's  2C come on come on come on come on oh no way no way is the answer the Logitech controller maybe it's the repetition of doing it 100 times oh what are you doing what are you doing occasionally things will register a little funny but no big complaints it's oh it's really heavy actually it's really heavy does it use dou battery yeah yeah okay let's try a different game okay try a different game while I wait to fire up a racing game I can talk
Comfort I do find the slightly more angled shape of the Xbox controller a little bit more comfortable for broader adult shoulders but if you like to kind of have your elbows tucked in I can see how this would actually be more comfortable for you everyone I talked to was really impressed at the build quality of this but people with big hands definitely find the Xbox controller more comfortable for I think the exact same reason you were saying the angle and they feel the same way
about the 40 oz water bottle at LT store.com it's just wider for bigger hands than the 21 Oz you're 64 o yeah yeah  triggers said drifty oo very small dead zones on the sticks do like isn't nice you're quite sensitive to dead zones hey I hate dead zones what's the point of moving a stick if it's not registered sir would you like a dead zone on your mouse no well then why do you accept it on your stick the thing is in racing games a lot of the times you don't want to over steer and having a big dead zone
can cause you to over steer and then over steer the other way and then over steer the other way any deficiency in my performance here is 100% down to me not being very good at racing games I cannot blame the controller here like this control is extremely fine go go on go on get woo oh shoot I screwed it up I screwed it up right at the end how could I do this to myself whatever I Podium you want to try briefly with the Xbox one yeah yeah yeah yeah let's hook up the Xbox controller long story short
we had an issue pairing with our dongle which normally is totally fine so I don't know exactly what happened here but I have a cable how do the sticks feel in this not as good they're sloppier triggers I honestly don't notice a huge difference with I've never been that sensitive to them but the dicks on the Xbox controller they're not terrible but they're not as good in my humble observation we did test uh some of the controllers for the circularity of their analog sticks and the series
one was actually one of the worst ones only the Logitech 310 was less circular but the labs didn't have a high degree of confidence cuz it might have just been that specific Xbox controller they tested question for you how many controllers does 8 bit do support off of a single dongle though I've never checked I think it's just one you can't repair them I don't believe oh just one controller to a dongle that's a bit of a drawback especially when you consider that the Xbox dongle supports up to
eight controllers off of a single dongle and has some extra quality of life features not to mention usually excellent pairing reliability though it should be noted that there is a latency cost there we actually found that the 8bit do 2C had the same latency on Bluetooth as the Xbox controller with its 2.4 GHz dongle and partially thanks to its 1000 HZ pulling rate absolutely obliterated the Xbox in a like for like test enough about the 2C though let's switch back to the 1C and see if the 2C
is worth the extra $10 cuz so often this can be had for just 20 bucks I'll be honest with you it feels pretty good I don't notice a big difference I'd say it's possible the sticks are a little bit looser but if they are it's not by much and the biggest difference for me that would make me still go with the 2C is the fact that it has bluetooth support it's just so convenient to not have to worry about dongles dang what an impressive controller but not everyone's going to feel the same way if you've got
much larger hands or if you have an Xbox and you want to move your controller between that and your PC wirelessly and seamlessly you might end up with a different option but I find this just a great balance of quality feeling d-pad quality face buttons great ergonomics I have a hard time imagining anyone who would hate this and realistically I could say the same about pretty much everything in front of me except for the f710 if you're looking at one of these no stop it it's time to retire old man
