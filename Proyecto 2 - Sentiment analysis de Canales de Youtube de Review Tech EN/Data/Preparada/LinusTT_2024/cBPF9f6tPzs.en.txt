the WAN show we've got a great show lined up for you guys today our big headline topic is of course that amd's numbers are bigger than Intel's therefore their products are better but AMD why do you have to follow Intel's naming scheme it's the worst thing their company does and Intel has done some pretty terrible stuff in other news this week there is of course the verdict in the big big big court case I'm talking of course about oh dang it I lost it here it is uh ah yes Bungie Bungie winning a decision
against cheat sellers so that's pretty exciting uh what else we got  delay uh Google uh had a leak of a document 2500 pages of internal documents that detail the inner workings of Google search uh and it's a little interesting CU it goes stuff that they've said in the past don't look at it yeah don't don't worry about it don't worry about it it's not important it might be out a date it might be out a date even though we said things in the past that contradicted it might be out a
date um also valve says you can't put your games in your will would you dieck all your games die   Today's Show is brought to you by rocket money ag1 and ridge along with our chair partner secret lab why don't we jump right into our big topic today and that is of course that no door Accord apparently just had a daughter in float plane chat okay sorry sorry sorry I'll move on I'll move on amd's numbers are bigger than Intel's according to multiple sources and leaks AMD has
decided to rename their upcoming ryzen 850 9050 apus in order to insert AI in the name resulting in the ryzen AI 100 series okay this I believe we already talked about ridiculous obnoxious I don't think anybody looked at Intel's core Ultra naming scheme and went wow that sure makes it easier to understand what your product line is and I just I can't really wrap my brain around this because on the one hand you look at a sort of misleading or confusing naming scheme and you go oh well that makes
sense so that they can sell you something not as good and make it sound good like something you would want but when it's just a random mumble jumble of numbers and letters how the am I supposed to know that I would want any of it I don't really understand what they're trying to achieve here so naturally AMD followed suit with this supposed ryzen AI 100 series no wait it gets better more recent leaks indicate that AMD has again internally rebranded these chips this time to ryzen AI 300
series so that they will not appear less numerically advanced than Intel's core Ultra 200 series which is following the core Ultra 100 series chip can I just say this AMD at some point you know you got the market share you've got the performance you've got the Mind share man you guys have got the engineering knoow at some point you've got to respect yourself at some point you've got to stop just calling your product Intel's naming scheme Plus right it goes all the way back to the pr
or the performance rating system from back in what that would have been late 90s early 2000s somewhere in that time frame when AMD had already abandoned the gigahertz race they had recognized that chasing more and more gigahertz was not the solution to gaining better performance and better efficiency and so it started out kind of valid enough right where they were saying look our processor doesn't run at the same frequency but we're going to have this PR rating system that's going to be
pretty much what Intel would have run at that kind of frequency but like better so they put Plus at the end and then AMD got kind of Loosey Goosey with the performance rating plus towards the end of the Athlon XP days in particular "where you could buy a 3,200 plus but uh" well here let me put it this way they released a 32 100 plus Athlon 64 product okay so that was their next Generation K8 compared to the K7 they released a 3200 plus that absolutely bulldozed the original Athlon XP 3200 plus it wasn't
even close Okay so AMD knew I'm I'm note I don't even have to bring an Intel chip into the comparison AMD clearly knew that uh if this is 3200 plus this can't be and they've pulled this kind of time and time and time again man I'm trying to think of uh I'm trying to think of one of the ones recently where they they changed the naming of their chipset so that um so that when Intel released their new chipset it would be it would be the same number or something like that guys guys let me
know in the chat let me know which one it was I'm trying to remember uh yeah hit me hit me with that x370 versus z370 yeah that might have been one of them the point is they've done this over and over and over again it is so obnoxious just be your own company with your own product line Comm communicate your own value ad and stop trying to confuse consumers we understand why you're doing it you want to make your generation of product seem like it's a generation ahead of Intel but this is
such a stupid game and if you play it you're just going to win stupid prizes because now now what's oh man I'm trying to wrap my head so so what so what so Intel's going to skip a generation now and then they're going to have 400 and then AMD is just going to have what odd numbers and Intel's going to have even number like no one's going to be able to understand what they're buying I hate it they're end up changing naming schemes entirely because like Intel is not going to be happy with
being leap frogged all the time so they're going to like have to change some which I'm completely for honestly because I've never liked the core branding um the core man the fact like ryzen 5 ryzen 7 stuff was good well yeah but that was just copying Intel too like tell me tell me something AMD has done branding wise that has been an original thought in the last five years give me something five years yeah I know I I I got nothing I got nothing I was like I was trying to dig deep and be like I
think there's some ideas there but no no you know what okay nh4 by4 tracker says x3d yeah I love that it's so clear AMD had an engineering Advantage their 3D vcash they had an engineering advantage and they put that in the product name they clearly communicated the value ad of 3D vcash which is that it benefits gaming and certain applications and they put it in the product name I love it that's how you name a product you tell us what the it is okay okay hit me with a couple other
ones uh n thread Ripper not within the last five years yo sorry sorry I thought x3d was older too but I I appeared to be wrong yeah no x3d x3d is pretty recent okay uh yep yeah that's about it cool um all right ridiculous any who I yeah I hate it and apparently oh my God apparently they're skipping a number on the next motherboard chipset going straight from x670 to x870 uh which is most likely to launch at this year's computex which is also going to see the debut of Intel's Z8
90 it is not good for consum smaller number that and it's not good for consumers to see very similar numbers on the Shelf when they are shopping for a product especially when now even physically they don't appear that different like the socket in the middle of the motherboard kind of looks the same to the lay person just have a clear numbering and naming scheme of your own all right that's all I really want to say about that let's move on on to our next topic what do you want to talk about Luke what do we
got Google search Doc is real let's do that Google has confirmed the authenticity of a 2500 page uh leaked internal document detailing the inner workings of Google search a Google representative warned against making inaccurate assumptions based about uh sorry about search based out of uh out of oh wow I really you doing okay you jet leg buddy are you jet inaccurate I've been in the woods for a few days so I I haven't looked at a computer screen in like four days um making inaccurate
assumptions about search based on outof context outdated or incomplete information likely because they Market uh wow likely because many marketing and SEO experts have concluded that the documents directly contradict past public statements by Google Representatives about how search works nice Google employees have previously denied that search uses click Centric metrics to determine page rankings that it does not consider subdomains separately from domains and that it doesn't penalize new websites but these
claims are all directly contradicted by these technical API documents further spark Toro founder and marketing expert Rand fishkin says that the documents show a clear pattern of Google search increasingly prioritizing powerful Brands over all else even when smaller sites and companies are more authoritative trustworthy and relevant which is something that we've been talking about for a while now um and even I think we had a topic on Wan uh from house fresh about a month ago y few weeks ago about this exact
problem uh and now we see it in technical documents and they can say whatever they want uh they confirm the authenticity of the documents so yeah sure maybe it's out ofd sure doesn't feel like it maybe it's gotten worse maybe that's the out ofd part I'm not sure I mean it doesn't matter how out ofd it is if it's contemporary right like if it is is from the same time that they issued these denials that they are 100% that they're yeah that they're determining page rankings in these
manners um I think it's been very clear to anyone who's ever talked to a Google representative that they are not transparent uh about how their algorithms work and they will hide behind excuses like oh well you know we don't know it's a black box we are not sure uh no but the reality of it is that I have personally had experiences with Google Staff I mean obviously most of my experiences with YouTube not with Google search but I have personally had experiences with Google Staff where I've
basically said hey you guys tuned something here's what I think you tuned and they're like no no no no no no no no no no no no no and then 6 months a year later I go hey you know about that experiment a year ago uh I see you guys have kind of walked it back and they're like yeah it was kind of tuned too far for x I'm like right so yeah you never like acknowledged it to me at the time but if I just pretend that I knew about it then no problem um and to be clear these were not it's not as black and
white either as just an engineer going in and and and turning a dial right these are these are gigantic platforms so any experiment that they run would never be sitewide these days I mean you'll see this in things like the roll out of the new layout for example Le where a small handful of people see it and then more people see it and then they gather feedback and they gather user metrics and then and then they roll it out a little further and a little further and then they make some tweaks
and then they roll it out a little further so it's not usually as simple as just oh yeah we want to be able to respond better this the time that I noticed this in particular was uh when Tik Tok was really On The Rise what like five six years ago seven I I don't know would have been a number of years ago and it was kind of in the in the hot knife through object phase of YouTube where from what I could tell it was basically impossible to break out if you were anything other than how many M&amp;M's
you can flush down the fing toilet right like it was just just viral paum wall toall as far as the eye could see and I was like hey I understand that you guys are up against a platform that is very very on the ball very trendy but you guys got to make sure that YouTube doesn't lose its soul that YouTube doesn't forget what it is which is quality content which is elevating authoritative voices that are going to provide uh top tier entertainment or education or whatever the case may be
and obviously YouTube is full of garbage as well but in terms of what they were going out of their way to promote I always felt that it was Evergreen content that that has a lasting value um I don't think that they've stayed true to to that value I don't think they've stayed true to that uh that mission I think that things are are falling off um but I don't really have any I haven't really seen a stark change like a sudden change so I don't really have any any evidence to go by these days but it's
pretty clear from these leaked Google search documents that they absolutely do know what they're doing at least to a degree and they absolutely are not not transparent about what exactly um they are changing uh this is a really good comment from LOE over on float plane chat YouTube is the new TV uh yeah we attended a uh like a a Creator Workshop recently and apparently TV and we can see this in our metrics as well TV usage for YouTube is growing like crazy right now and that's
something that you may see reflected in changes to our content over the next little while because we we' got to make sure that we're capturing that I mean we we've made little changes um to respond to platform development over the years like I it's funny how few people bring it up these days compared to when we first did it but when mobile started to overtake desktop use and that was lot of years ago at this point but when mobile started to overtake desktop use and especially as mobile devices started to
abandon the 16x9 standard aspect ratio we actually changed the aspect ratio of our videos so it's not uh whatever it would have been like8 185 by9 or whatever was kind of becoming the standard I I forget exactly what it was but it was a little a little bit wider right it was not that but it also wasn't 16 by9 we kind of split the difference so that you end up with small black bars or small black bars uh vertically so letter boxing on the desktop and small black bars on the
side so pillar boxing on a mobile device that has a taller or wider screen um yeah so it's it's pretty darn good on the iPhone it's pretty darn good on the TV and and on your desktop but it's not really it's not really perfect for anything but you know that's something oh man maybe this should be a oh man this should be a conversation with YouTube it'd be kind of cool for us to be able to just build in safeties and uh what what are they called Dan you come from a production background the
safe safe zones are keep or uh yeah for for what for videos and things like that yeah what are they called again yeah safe zones safe zones yeah so if we could just upload in like almost like a square just like upload in a square aspect ratio and then just make sure all the content is within all the different safe zones and then it could just autoc crop that would actually be kind of sick that's very common yeah I have uh I have those for wo and all sorts of stuff yeah really how do you do that on W show
where we've got like text at the bottom oh all right he just put it up on my preview thing well that's cool no he showed everybody I think yeah everybody can see that all right he showed me hey but it cuts off the logo that logo was designed by the one and only edel Yago how dare you yeah that's why we can't put anything over there oh I mean the safe safe Zone The W Banner acts as its own safe Zone it's on all the time whatever way to be whatever just disconnect Again 
uh all right what's next Dan we're gonna have to keep things moving pretty quick because poor Luke It's the morning there and well let's get a couple merch messages in and he was in the woods or something I don't know what the  vacation uh yeah sure I got a couple of merch messages for on I should explain I should explain how they work then also we have a very exciting announcement for  oh oh oh you got me we are launching the Scribe driver hey there we go oh hold on see if I can kind of catch
that oh the Scribe driver it's a bolt action stainless steel pen available in I believe two different colorways yes yes yes yes yes uh bolt action stainless steel pen that is made out of upcycled SC screwdriver shafts so if you guys remember I was talking about how our original supplier for the screwdriver so there's the the gold accented one and then oh sorry that's the silver accented one and there's the uh the brass accented one so if you guys remember me talking about this before our original
supplier That was supposed to build our screwdriver shafts and Ratchet assemblies screwed up well got Acquired and then deprioritized their work and ended up taking forever and giving us extremely low quality output and one of the things that they built for us without ever getting the go-ahead to actually build them cuz we didn't approve the final samples but they built "for us 100,000 screwdriver shafts and" they basically were like well we made them so you're not getting a refund and
we said okay well if we're paying for them then you better darn well deliver them to us so we got pallets of screwdriver shafts that um honestly we couldn't use in any other way L if you want to show up oh oh I should go to the lote oh oh oh oh boy oh yeah there we go H hey okay there there's oh try to get oh there we go ah yeah so anyway so we got these pallets of screwdriver shafts and if you guys are good at time then you'll know that we've probably had them for a hot minute at this point because we got
these around the time that we were launching the original screwdriver so anyway we looked at them and we kind of went well it would be really cool if we could do something with these and the original plan was to just melt them down and turn them into something like I I had kind of pitched what about a what about a fail wrench um and it's just like a normal wrench there's nothing special about it but it's just made of failed screwdriver shafts or something like that just trying to trying to get
something out of it and then we kicked around a bunch of ideas and eventually I for forget who pitched it um it must have been Sebastian because this is absolutely his handiwork but he took one of the shafts and you can actually see this one has quite a bit more of a of a screwdriver shape to it still there you go no no it's good Dan uh it's got more of a screwdriver shape to it it hasn't been um it hasn't been uh lathed down to to make it here here we go here's the final profile there you go see like that
ah cool uh so it's got more of a screwdriver shape to it and then he just like frankensteined a regular like pen top onto it and was like H fail pen I'm like waa that's so cool so then in LTT store Fashion instead of just going for something basic we spent a bloody year developing a legitimately actually really great bolt action pen it's got a really nice feel great little fidget toy um it's compatible with hold on hold on I forget basically what I told them is look make sure it's whatever like the good
one is that oh lus laptop oh is unplugged well there's your problem right there I was basically like look make sure it's whatever the good one is that is broadly available so people aren't locked into whatever and so that we don't have to deal with Dum Dums on Reddit that talk about how oh the ink quality is bad literally someone already posted that I'm just going to get a big pen cuz the ink quality of the Scribe driver is not even good what are you what are you even talking about a you a
you don't know and B you can put in any uh hold on hold on let me find it any Parker G2 refill there are so many options you can put in basically anything you want so we didn't want to bit of a question here yeah go ahead if you can scroll through the photos and you see one where it's in like a p Holder have they been killing it on the product photos lately or what the photos look fantastic I I will also give them that absolutely theot I assum this is Maria uh yeah what can I do for you keep
scrolling I'm I'm they see me scroll you find the one where it's where it's mounted in a bag in a orange and black like LT backpack oh I'm I'm working on it oh yeah oh yeah laser laser let's go uh oh yeah it's it's like two down or something you're almost there uh that's in the tech sack oh okay he all right I have my backpack here and I was like where is that and I was like is this is this a leak is it did we leak a bag no okay no no it's a tech sack uh oh yeah show them
the bolt action got to love it anyway really oh sorry it's electrical discharge machined sorry not laser electrical discharge machine man we spent so much time on like how to make the logo I I saw laser versions I saw uh actual like machined versions um yeah we ended up settling on that so yeah quality sustainably built product uh it's 30 bucks which for these kinds of pens actually pretty competitive and it's a really it's a really great pen so hope you guys hope you guys enjoy it and
okay Dan oh right I'm explaining merch messages so if you want to interact with the show uh don't don't do a super chat or a twitch bed or whatever do a merch message all you got to do is go to LTT store go to the cart and if you have got something in your cart and we're live you can go ahead and leave a merch message and if you check out it'll go to producer danop there he is who will reply to it or pop it up down here on the bottom of the screen or forward it to someone internally who can respond to
it for you or he will send it to me and Luke who will address it as a merch message Dan do you want to show the folks how it works yeah sure I'm still going through all of them they seem to really really like pens uh yeah before we even talked about it on W show we had sold hundreds of them today so that's good because we've got "100,000" shafts now I believe each pen is made of two shafts I want to say I don't remember so I'm not you know what I'm not going to say anything oh that's
something you'll notice by the way speaking of which is there might be slight color mismatches between the two it's an upcycled product guys take it for what it is it's a unique piece of LT history the time that lonus got fing shafted there it is right there speaking of wish is this a forced limited edition product then like once "you sell the 100,000 would we would we" find a way to continue making them or um is that it I don't know I mean we haven't numbered them or anything like
that um we've kind of kicked it around I mean right now we're more concerned with developing other fail products than we "are with selling a 100,000 pens I mean" with that said I haven't looked at the sales num since um since we started the show so you you never know now that we've actually formally announced it things might go a little different so we'll see also I want to address this because I've heard a few people comment on it uh he's he's not like intentionally talking over me
there's there's I think over half a second of delay between us and that makes it actually ridiculously hard to communicate so it is what it is yeah I'm airing on the side I'm trying to time sorry I was just gonna say I'm I'm airing on the side of trying to fill voids um and trying to leave only very obvious gaps because not only is Luke a little bit delayed in terms of his internet connection but his brain seems to be pretty slow today so uh don't worry I'm here to carry it for you bro
I I'm also trying to time when I talk for just before lonus is done talking so that the delay isn't as no noticeable for the stream but that can be like difficult to do so I don't know it is what it is yeah we're going to do our best with it guys we're going to do our best with it all right uh why don't you hit me with a couple merch messages good Lord don't look at that it's fine I'll get through it uh uh let's see hey lldd if South Park were to parody you and LTT like they did with Logan Paul and lizo
how do you think they'd portray you what kind of wild storyline do you imagine they'd come up with oh man they've already done the episode that I would want to be in the one where they where they go to California and Kyle unplugs and plugs back in the giant lynxis wrt wireless router um if so there is no South Park episode that I would belong in but I would I would love to be the you know techie uh Canadian with my head all hey buddy um and and somehow I'm involved in that storyline but other 
okay and what else I got here lonus you work a lot do you ever wish you had more time to per pursue hobbies and interests you have outside of work I mean that's the thing about making your hobby your job I I kind of do my hobby every day to the point where sometimes I get kind of sick of it and I need other Hobbies I have kids which is kind of a big hobby um that was that was part of that conversation I think Ivon and I talked about that a couple weeks ago when she was on the show but that was part of
that conversation that we had where it was like look you know we don't she was basically upset cuz she was like you hear about couples that grow apart you know their their kids move out and and and all this stuff happens and they basically look at each other and they go who even are you like I don't know you anymore you know what what do we do together and I kind of went well we do raising kids together we do building a company together we do all of these things I think we just need a a
perspective adjustment so that we can recognize raising kids as our hobby I mean people absolutely treat having dogs as a hobby like taking care of their dogs and and and training them and and feeding them and grooming them and like all these things it's like well what difference is it they're just really smart dogs and eventually they move out it's great it has challenges but uh yeah to to me it's to me it's just a perspective thing right and so I have hob my hobbies are my job
um my hobbies are my kids I'm painting my motorbike right now I I game you know when I find time um I I like setting things up you know I like I find cable managing and organizing like kind of relaxing I was never that kind of person when I was young when I was a kid I was the kid that you couldn't walk across the floor without breaking something because all of my belongings were just strewn across it and like I was the the teenager with like all the plates and dishes in my room that needed to be
taken up to the kitchen and giant batches to be cleaned hopefully by someone else if they don't see me putting them all here like I was always that kind of person but I think having having a team um has made me really appreciate the importance of organization and value that to the point where I'll spend a Saturday afternoon like one of my few times legitimately to myself just like organizing my garage I complete an embarrassing small number of projects in my garage but I spend
probably more time than I do working on projects just like organizing it and going this is a space I can control I everything is where it's supposed to be  fine sure we can do another topic uh Luke do you want to you know what why don't I read a topic uh oh no no we're not no I got it I got it I got it I got it give me another chance put me in coach which one whichever what you want you could do  back yeah let me do that scrapyard Wars is back we're bringing back scrapyard Wars with the help of our partner
ja. they're a Marketplace for all things gaming full PCS piece of components peripherals even consoles all from verified sellers while the series won't be coming out until July we'll be shooting it soon and we need your help we'll be hunting for some of our components on Jawa so if you list your old Parts on there we might be able to buy them from you keep in mind that you'll be listing it for real so don't try to sell like a $490 for a dollar so that uh I can win or lonus can win or
something because someone else might just buy it so yeah and also keep an eye on java. G because they're going to be launching a massive giveaway to celebrate the return of scrapyard Wars I can't really tell you guys anything about what the what the gimmick will be this time but what I will say is that it will be both back to Roots classic awesome head-to-head and also you won't see it  away I don't even know what it is yeah no I'm I'm really excited about it there's no competitive Advantage for me
knowing and you not knowing it's just fun oh no I'm not yeah it's fine pure fun list listen to this guy listen to The Confidence yeah whatever I'm just gonna extend my winning streak you know what you Luke let's start the trash talk now I want the stare down I want the  down based on how you did that price guessing uh video we did together I don't know I might I might I might have a chance still I've been out of it for a while though it's going to be interesting once born a cheap skate always a cheap
skate yeah that it's a it's a good skill it's a good skill hopefully it'll continue to carry me um valve says you can't put your games in your will a customer support representative from Val has conf valve has confirmed that you cannot Beque your Steam account as property in your will because steam accounts and games are non-transferable in the event of death this means that the valve team would be unable to provide another person access to your account or to merge its contents with
another account even if that was laid out in a valid will account holders can obviously still transfer control of their account simply by giving another person their login information but who owns this collection of Perpetual game licenses would be legally ambiguous I think another way to help in this scenario would be to set up one of the the steam family things um yeah but that wouldn't stay valid forever because then you'd still because if you didn't log into an account for a certain amount of
time I suspect that eventually valve would close the account like if you don't log into a Gmail account for five years or whatever they close it I don't know what the number of years is so um your mileage may vary on that but no I would I would be very surprised if they don't eventually close accounts that are just inactive with that said a Gmail account um is not full of things that someone paid for right like they wouldn't close a Gmail account that's being actively renewed that has like an
extra storage subscription or whatever else so I don't think that's quite a perfect parallel to something like a steam account where yeah it's it's full of paid merchandise I I don't like this in general I think that valve is is a um is a Force for good in the gaming industry I think in general valve is a Force for good for consumer rights um at least relative to their competition but this is something that I see as a step backward in terms of consumer rights when it comes to games nothing
prevents me from bequeathing a retro game collection of SNES cartridges for example to uh you know my children or you know my my my friends or Co colleagues or whoever the case may be Dan you can have my Super Mario RPG okay yay I'm I'm kidding no no that's cool cart you know what no forget no forget it no forget it no I no no you know what  will me lonus all right all right you can have my Super Mario RPG if I first um but yeah so nothing prevented that and while technically I get it these are digital
licenses to use it these are these are our our Perpetual licenses to the licy which is a person I don't know it's um I I yeah I just think it I think it sucks but we're seeing this kind of thing all over the place so Luke I don't know if I talked to you about this but when I was when I spent the you know four to five years that I spent shopping for somewhere to to build a Badminton Center that's something that I've been passionate about for a very long time and something
that I spent years uh trying to find a location for uh one of the options that came up was a 99e lease um that was actually in kind of the the recreation center of of one of the one of the uh municipalities within the Lower Mainland within the Vancouver area and I basically was like okay so how does this work cuz this is just this is just bare land so do you guys build a building on it and then like what I just sign a lease until my death and then after I die um someone else is just going to
lease it or something and okay I I knew more about how they worked when I was having this conversation but what I'm laying out right now would be I think a pretty reasonable assumption for how something like that works no get this you want to know how it works you pay them market rate no discount you pay the market rate for the land as though you were buying it instead of getting the deed instead of holding that property as a private property owner you hold the right to lease it for 99 years or or
your own lifetime or some combination of which comes first or of the two and if you're a corporation for example you're a best buyer in Amazon or whatever then it would be tied to probably the the time and it would be tied to the corporate entity rather than a person but in in my case it would probably be a brand new corporation that would be spun up just for this badminton Enterprise so and I would probably be along with Yvonne the only shareholder and director so it would basically be tied to our
lives so you pay full price and I go okay but like do you guys contribute to the development of a building like this is this is just bare dirt like do you build the building and then I lease it they're like nah you build the building and I was like okay so I buy the land and then I build the building I pay the full cost for that and then when the lease expires you guys reimburse the asset that you've taken over in some way like the the the building cost or something like that to
my beneficiary or no no that's ours now and I'm kind of sitting here going what the like I I I'm generally I think that you know a lot of Americans would probably see see me as a filthy socialist I am I Am pro um you know Public Works um I I Am pro tax dollars being invested in in public programs uh swimming pools ice rinks libraries um Parks man I love that stuff that's great spend that money uh let's let's build it people should have access to Recreation and entertainment we shouldn't just be
seen as walking wallets that pay taxes right like I want services in return for my taxes all of that stuff sure no problem but to basically go okay yeah you know what private ownership bad idea we take it back um no no no um no no yeah I I looked into one of those a while ago um when I was I was shopping for for my own place to live and was actually pretty stunned at how bad of a deal it is um it's it's a pretty wicked deal if you're the one selling it um cuz you you get to sell a property
and then your inheritance down the line just get the property anyways which is kind of hilarious um I  weird so it's um so so anyway I forget where I was going with this oh right um so I am generally Pro if you pay for something it should belong to you and you should be able to do whatever you want with it and that should include beyond your own lifespan is it kind of irrational yeah I guess so like I can see that perspective realistically I paid for the game I got all the benefit
that I was possibly going to get from it the latest research shows I can't take it with me so what difference does it make I'm not there to you know see my kids enjoy my copy of stardew Valley like does it does it really matter could they just buy their own copy probably um but I am I'm torn is what I'm trying to say and I I would like to see I would like to see valve do better but I also would fully understand if this is an issue that they're basically going to studiously ignore and do absolutely
nothing about I mean valve has already done so much to make their licensing terms less um less of a burden on their users the fact that you can family share games digitally over the Internet compared to what everyone else was pushing for absolute industry Cher never mind game changer and I don't think they're going to win that battle again this time with bequeathing games um I also have no idea what the landscape's going to look like like you know 50 years from now when I drop dead you know
hopefully knock wood right 50 years from now when I drop dead are my kids going to want to play ano 1800 I suspect the the gaming Paradigm is going to have changed so much like that that's basically like my grandparents bequeathing me their original Atari whatever like the the one with the actual you know paddle controllers and that plays one game that just plays pong I'm sitting here going I mean that's that's sick and yeah but I'm not going to play it and this is digital I don't think it should be
valve I don't think it should be up to  decide and that's fair that's fair be up to valve it shouldn't be up to us either really like maybe they do find it interesting I see it both ways I definitely see it from both perspectives licensing is a complicated thing and you know we've seen time and time again that it's often not down to the publisher platform the publishing platform it's often not even down necess neily to the game publisher or to the game developer like we've seen games get shut down
after 10 years for example because they don't have the development Cycles to go and source and integrate new music and there was licensed music that they only had a finite license for man I remember learning about that where we wanted to do that Top Gun volleyball scene with um with the original music for channel super fun and they were basically like yeah you can buy a a six-month license for this this amount of money and then you take down the video after I'm sitting there going well that's stupid
nobody is listening to that song by watching this video over and over again we're not even playing the whole song like why why do you care if we just have a Perpetual license for it but it's just not how it works it's a Time Time limited license and man the music licensing industry is going to be is going to be doing some stuff the big rights holders in that industry are acquiring libraries like never before and they are going to be jacking the prices for any iconic music from Big
artists it's it's a whole thing um sorry that's a yeah that's a whole that's a whole Rabbit Hole any who what are we uh recently  about I think it's new topic time sure Luke do you want to pick a topic or do I get to pick a topic this time I'm going to keep going because I can't do a lot of the back and forth conversation afterwards so I'll just I'll I'll read out the topics um PayPal launches an ad Network PayPal has official that it will be launching an ad Network that will sell ads leveraging oh
no leveraging the data it collects on the purchase history and spending of its 400 million users PayPal claims that users will be able to opt out of their data being used in ad targeting however the only way to completely opt out of data collect users to delete their accounts this change would also likely affect users of PayPal subsidi are like venmo and honey and I believe there's more as well but I'm not surprised Honey's in there I know that credit card companies sort of do this as well they sell your
data in regards to purchase history uh or at least this is something that happened far in the past but I suspect this will be a little bit more direct I'm not sure nice this is like terrible um yeah I mean look let's be realistic PayPal was already probably selling this data to other AD networks so in terms of your personalized ads that are coming through on the side of the websites you use or when you're while you're waiting for your favorite live stream ah yeah yeah wo yeah uh or while you're waiting
for your favorite live stream to load you're probably not going to see a difference the only real difference is that PayPal is going to be profiting directly rather than by selling to another ad Network and I'm about to pitch you a controversial take on this Luke the ad Network space the ad the ad Network space actually needs more competition right now oh it is dominated by Google and Facebook and quite frankly PayPal may be one of the worsing companies on the planet 
evil yeah I really I really like wish it was pretty much anyone other than bayal um yeah but I think that is a decent take it's effectively a duopoly right now um I just I don't I don't see PayPal making that space any better that makesense I really don't I was kidding yeah yeah no this is this is just it's just going to turn into more of a piece of like this is not a good thing but look look I I look you got to let me have some fun with this if I if we can't laugh at the darkest of
times what do we have left Luke you know what they should do they should make it so that uh PayPal already has your payment information so they should just make it so that you to buy the thing in the ad just click on the ad and it just automatically does the entire transaction oh yeah oh yeah bud you just wait this clicks now like actually cost you money you just wait and oh what was that buy now pay later platform that was in the news recently that had a scandal cuz they were like oh
yeah we laid off like a ton of our marketing staff and we just use AI for it now uh I forget what they're called but if if PayPal owns like a buy now pay later platform or something like that then man not only could you buy something instantly Luke you could Finance it oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah finance that toothpaste finance a new F-150 simply by by clicking an ad heaven forbid you accidentally click an ad man I have accidentally clicked more ads than I have intentionally
clicked by probably several orders of magnitude like I don't know if I have ever intentionally clicked an ad but I've clicked ads hundreds and hundreds maybe thousands of times overall right like just you're scrolling on your phone or whatever man you got to imagine you know obviously legislation's going to come in that's going to make it IL for them to just you know one click have you just like buy and it arrives at your door but it's going to take a few years and in that few years it's going
to the internet's going to be one hell  ride if they they could make it so that like you have to you know press a confirm button but they can do the amazing thing that I love that modern websites are doing where they'll have buttons load before other page elements and those page elements will move the buttons so you go to try to click on something and then you end up clicking on something that like loads under it beautiful you can just move the confirm button to where the no confirm button is
perfect oh manless I don't know I mean look our degoogle your life video actually had some really cool options that I learned about as we were working on that video like you can buy you can subscribe to search products that you can configure your own page ranking and that use their own indices and um and that track nothing nothing and Target nothing um and I don't I don't think as a as a tech as a member of the tech media that I would ever switch over to it permanently because part of my job is
to use things the way that I expect people to use them um but it's tempting dude it's tempting like ever since watching that video I've ivly consider when I get back subscribing to a a paid search because I like with Google search to be honest okay would you pay more because you have a a YouTube premium subscription right so that includes YouTube music would you pay double if they just included Chrome integrated ad blocking and no no search ads no ads on the internet if they basically were like we'll eat
will pay the advertisers that otherwise would have been displayed here like here okay man here this would be what a wild would they pay it through yes I would what a wild 180 this would be if they basically created the YouTube Partner program okay if the whole manifest V3 thing was like a giant 4D chess game where they were like okay we're going to make ad blocking impossible because we're going to build our own ad blocking essentially you know kind of like uh kind of like Brave right where you can
view the ads and earn crypto tokens or whatever except there are no ads to view there are no crypto tokens you just pay for Chrome and you just have a completely clean internet experience but the page providers get paid kind of like the YouTube Partner program so it's like it's kind of like somewhere in between it's somewhere in between YouTube premium in the partner program and brave browser would you pay double for YouTube premium if it included that so it goes up to like 30 bucks a
month or whatever it would also be really cool if they worked out oh God his connection's bad Dan yeah I'm I'm getting a whole 35 kilobits a second uh okay I'm just going to jump in with what I think have become subscribed to everyone's just add any there okay I'm just going to jump in I think luk is talking about news providers uh money has been flooding out of Journalism for the last I mean realistically 10 20 years now and if this was a way for internet giants like Google to
contribute in a positive way to rebuilding The Newsroom um I agree with what I think Luke was saying uh that that would be absolutely incredible I think that was what he was talking about I'm not actually sure well wait for him to come back I am going okay perfect it's like do I even really need Luke to co-host the show not really hey speaking of which um I think we had a topic after you left last week probably not that um I I try it was a oh it was a merch message someone sent a
merch message for you and I tried to answer it it would be a lot of funny a lot of funny it would be a lot of fun if we could get that timestamp um someone in the chat maybe do you guys want to see if you can find that timestamp so we could send it to luk and he can watch it and then tell me how close I got cuz I really did my best in the meantime I'm going to run through our sponsors for the show today the show is brought to you by rocket money nobody wants to be surprised by a higher number on their

hat Pro and a screwdriver hey there you go we got some it's more of a suggestion yeah we got some Father's Day gift ideas oh that's smart whoever came up with this idea good job oh no the Jerry rig everything knife is sold out is it though oh yeah yeah it is that's funny I thought I saw some sales for it the other day well maybe we're out of it again it's a y yeah popular knife cool all right see you later uh okay uh why don't we jump into our next topic here uh I think I'm going to pick this one
since Luke's having some audio issues Microsoft says no screenshots at work Microsoft Edge for business is adding a feature that allows it managers to tag web pages as protected meaning they can't be screenshotted in the edge for business browser the browser will also be rolling out a feature that allows it admins to see which devices have Edge instances that are out of date and force them to restart and install updates um our discussion question here is they know we can take a photo of a screen
right also didn't they just I have a uh yeah go ahead I have a counter point to this a photo of the screen thing uh I don't think this is made for workplaces uh like ours I think this is made for Ultra secure workplaces where you might not have a phone on you or be able to have a phone on you okay all right I I suspect this is like for like military stuff like that I don't I don't think this is for like you know your your random job I now it's being rolled out to probably everybody so yeah uh a
little silly in some situations you're definitely going to have workplace places that are like we are very secure and we take security seriously and you can't take screenshots and Edge it's like man I remember when I first learned about Snapchat okay someone explained Snapchat to me I was like sorry what the is Snapchat and they're like yeah it's like it's like messages but they're like they they they disappear uh after a while and you can't screenshot them and I'm like
so it's WhatsApp and they're like no no it's Snapchat it's Snapchat it's you you can't so you could like send nudes and people can't and I'm sitting here going are you an idiot like we don't you sure can you sure you sure can um if it shows up on my screen I can decide to keep it forever no matter what you do like option this is absolutely ridiculous in most situations this this is hilarious um yeah this is a really good point for my work this is someone in float plan we absolutely need to be able to take
screenshots and mark them up and send them to people you are definitely going to have a well-intentioned IT department roll this thing out based on some Boomer boss directive and is going to cause absolute fing chaos absolute chaos within the work mark my words most non-technical people don't even know about like screenshotting or snipping tools and already just use their phones to to take pictures of screens so like who are you even stopping funny thing I uh often take a
picture of my screen because it's way more convenient like to send it to someone on what I might not be logged into WhatApp or Facebook Messenger like I mean I have like a dozen different messaging apps so depending on who I'm talking to it may be extremely inconvenient for me to get a screenshot from my computer onto my phone because I haven't done the like Android Windows l thing and I and I just it's so much easier the once every 3 months that I need to do that to just
take a picture of my screen I'm sorry Luke I've let you down no I do it I do it on the WAN laptop because I'm not logged into any of my personal stuff on that laptop so sending images off of it is a huge pain so I will take a picture of it and then send it to like the infer team or whatever else um so it it happens there are times where it is better it's just you know usually usually not and to to to kind of counter that point a little bit it is set up so that it's specific websites uh or so it can
be configured so that only specific websites can't be screenshotted so for example at NC NCIX was hilarious uh at NC our internal our internal system was accessed through a um a Windows remote desktop connection to one of you know many machines so everyone had a signed machines um and the only browser that we could access that in was IE which um it wasn't that long ago that was pretty bad already uh when I was there and so this is the kind of thing that an organization could try to prevent you
know screenshots of your your inventory or your sales from being quickly and easily gathered and and leaked to a competitor for example with that said we all worked in private offices anyway and nothing would have prevented us from just taking pictures of our screen or anything but hey sure cool any theater yeah what else we got today um oh no oh cheat sellers losing Court this is cool cheat mod providers lost two major decisions this week the first suit was a copyright infringement claim
launched by Bungie 3 years a go against Phoenix digital the owners of mod selling site aim junkies while some of Bungie's claims were settled in arbitration last year with Bungie being awarded 4.3 million a jury has now decided in Bungie's favor and awarded them "$63,000 that's not a lot of money um but" these cases have typically ended in settlements in the past and this decision will likely set a legal precedent for future cases in a second case a huge deal yes which is a huge
deal so we'll get to that in the discussion in a second case a judge has cited with Activision and ordered cheat maker engine owning to stop making and selling cheats to turn over its website and to pay Activision $4.4 million in Damages as well excuse me as well as covering their legal fees so our discussion question here is is it good that cheap providers are losing in court and I think uh I'll I'll let Luke I'll let Luke handle this one yeah I think it's super good that
cheat uh developers are and providers are losing in court it's it's honestly ruining a lot of modern gaming especially in the FPS scene uh but it's it's hitting a lot of other games as well uh it's it's never been worse you you get ads on I i' I've received ads on YouTube I've received ads on Twitter I received ads all over the place for cheats and back in the day you used to have to be at least somewhat um like technically competent to to know how to make it work and these days not even
sort of um yeah it it's just you you launch the program it runs a goey on your screen it it is automatically set up to actively protect you based on you know screen sharing problems and things like that so if it detects that you're streaming or something like that it'll try to hide itself like it's it's very conveniently built because this is a uh large industry with a significant customer base at this point in time um and that needs to be shut down if we want to have uh gaming online be
legitimate at all moving forward so I think it's actually a very important and very big deal that this president has been set and look I don't want to come across hypocritical because we've made very similar arguments in the past that the the difficulty of doing something is is not a a valid um or the ease of doing something is not a valid reason to Outlaw it for example I made the argument in our coverage of the flipper zero that no uh a a a a security a pentesting tool should not be banned
just for its capability of making these kinds of functions available to a lay person right so what's the difference here is is probably what you're asking and from my point of view a pentesting tool has legitimate purposes it has the ability to be used by gry hat and wh hat people to achieve better security overall and so the argument that it is it is not okay yes it is allowing some folks that otherwise wouldn't have the technical means to engage in in technological Mischief but it is generally broadening
the uh understanding I would say of the general public about the threats that are out there and that were already accessible at a very very low price of entry for people who want to cause trouble or for people who are realistically doing something a lot more nefarious than changing the numbers on a on a you know gas station sign or um okay unlocking people's cars is pretty bad there definitely bad things that you can do with not just the flipper zero but with these kind of like mainstream hacking
tools uh but the difference here is that these game cheats serve absolutely no purpose whatsoever other than to degrade the experience of using this product for absolutely everyone other than the person who buys the cheat it's it's it's pay to win except it's not even endorsed by the game developer it's not even available to the other player that wants to play legit so that to me is the difference between these things but you know Allen asks in the float plane chat do you even think the courts can make
such a nuanced uh nuanced okay this word is not correct but distinction do do they do they have that capability honestly I I don't know that they do but generally I am supportive of companies that try to degrade or destroy the functionality of someone else's product um being penalized for it but hold on a second okay we're in a super gray area here Luke okay what about a company that's selling uh Tesla hacks so you can unlock your heated seats or unlock additional performance or range are they are
they're not degrading the experience of using the product for the customer but they are certainly degrading Tesla's ability to charge money for that product are they in the same isue is that with cheats you are raing the experience of other people sure but Tesla other people enable yourself uh they're another company not a a corporation is an indiv you if you I don't I don't I think that's the stupidest thing ever I don't care but that's but that's a legal thing that's a
legal thing I don't make the rules we have to consider it uh other users I would say other users TLA is not a user so if you made it so that by enabling heated seats for you the the seats of other people in the lanes around you while you're driving have to be on active cooling for some reason then yeah that would be stupid and I wouldn't want that to be allowed um it's the the the issue is that it it significantly degrades the experience of of other people um and in a lot of situations these are competitive
environments where people could be potentially pursuing careers or directly pursuing ranking positions that could lead them into the money um so this is actually a a financial problem absolutely yes um karate Swan asks a great question could this set a precedent that affects the modding community and I think that by Luke's definition where we only care if it degrades the experience for other users no it shouldn't affect the modern Community but can we trust the legal system to make that distinction I think
it's very challenging you would have to have such a deep knowledge of gaming to tell the difference between the legality of a mod that I don't who cares lets you run around as a as a hypersexualized bunny in a single player game versus a mod that allows you mods sure versus a mod that allows you to uh change your in-game skin in fortnite to some combination of the default grass building and dirt textures essentially turning you into a camoufl Ed player model right what would be the difference
to them and I they I just I don't I don't I don't think I trust them to be able to tell the difference so it's really hard for me to take a Firm Stance on this even if I am ultimately happy to see these uh these game cheat makers paying some kind of penalty and and to see finally some kind of Crackdown that isn't just falling on game developers to try their best to infect our computers with more you know kernel level software and and rootkits in order to freaking supposedly prevent cheaters
from degrading the gaming experience uh hold on a second imperor 3 3733 says companies are not people regardless of what a clueless judge thinks they're not I don't disagree with you it makes absolutely no sense um but it's also there are reasons for it even if they suck is all I kind of have to say about that fair enough uh should we do the remaining announcements I think we've got Dan week and remaining charity stream items yeah yeah hit me or if you want me to do it themed float plane week and this time
we're highlighting one of the most important people on the W show that's right it's the one and only Dan Dan week is Upon Us on Flow plane and we've got special content going on such as a video about Dan's new car which is like actually really cool I haven't seen the video but his car is cool um answers to your Dan Centric questions and a rant about of all things a table additionally we're going we're doing a giveaway With Many Items including Green Man Gaming codes retro and stubby screwdrivers LTT
store desk pads and 20 bread plushies wow uh thanks to everyone subscribed to Flo plane we're excited to bring you more of Dan also remaining charity stream items check out the remaining products from our charity stream that are still available for purchase at whatnot um lmg lm. charity leftovers will bring you there we've got some LTT store items a PC a laptop and some other PC parts and peripherals still up for grabs hey there we go all right got the list up there and I have some quick
updates about the pens I believe that "we've sold probably probably about 1,00" "to 2,000" "currently we have apparently made 5,000" uh so unless you want to wait another two months for them uh you should probably buy one tonight oh I was wondering where you were going with that because I um yeah yeah this is just the live audience too that's wild yeah no yeah I'm getting I'm getting some info from Nick as well but what the there's only hold on a second how many people are even watching the show
seriously hold on hold on hold on hold no no no no hold on I've already done 517 merch messages uh you're a unit Dan just so you know hell yeah there's "10,000 people watching on YouTube okay" there's probably based on sort of chat velocity numbers because we don't have an actual viewer count but there's probably somewhere in the neighborhood of a couple thousand watching on float plane there's probably a couple thousand "watching on TT yeah there's 2,000" watching on Twitch and I Lord only knows
how many are watching on Twitter because I think that number is fake so there's "somewhere between 15 and 20,000 people" watching W show that means one in 20 of you like like look to your left look to your right there is a one in 10 chance that one of those people bought a pen you guys are wild um yeah I mean it's a great pen and it's honestly a good price compared to other like stainless steel machine like it's a beautiful pen um but you guys are awesome and thank you so much for your
support you guys sorry we're we're up to 1500 now way to go Dan way way to sell 300 pens or whatever that works out to uh to be fair uh you know I talked to Nick a half hour ago so it's already another 400 and a half hour so my God okay yeah that's wild all right what else we want to talk about today uh one quick question I have for Dan is you're seeing the merch messages come through how many people are buying like multiples of them I don't think he's looking at what people are buying loot
yeah so if you want on fire if you want accurate numbers I now have 530 merch messages and we've sold 654 sorry 531 32 655 uh that's basically how F 56 this is how fast it comes in uh 57 this is how fast I have to this is you're ruining my life uh yeah why are you talking to D 59 60 I'm sorry Dad keep going keep going  me this is ridiculous 62 every time I refreshed the Shopify 500 people went to the site since I mentioned this okay well anyway yeah it's a cool pen uh guys
hey um I love you all3 make sure to pick up you know a t-shirt or something in the meantime we've got a man the clothing products have not been selling as well but the reviews are so good so if you guys are you know picking up a pen hey maybe check out the polo shirt 4 and 1 half Stars maybe pick up a button-up shirt 4 and 1 half Stars you know we got lots that man we got we got so much we got so much clothing you guys what about the dip dieye hoodie look how good it looks okay we don't have any
reviews for that one yet but it's great the Dropout is my personal favorite am I wearing my Dropout today yeah I'm wearing my Dropout today man I love this thing this is a Five Star product literally five stars amazing quality five star it makes me feel awful oh that I got it at such a steep discount yeah it's great anyway all right all right all right all right buy some clothes uh what else we got today Luke will return in a minute oh oh uh okay dang it well this was one that I really wanted to be
more of a discussion oh I was about to have Dan join no no you're busy I got stuff to do sir I'm on my own I mean I can help a little bit no you're good you're good you're good do you think um Sony struggles with the you know what no I have an idea I mean realistically he's not doing anything anyway so uhoh oh well that doesn't work why why do I not I thought my phone I thought all of my Google contacts automatically join my phone contacts but apparently they don't so I have no idea how some of
those people ended up in my contacts  okay realistically this guy's not doing  hello all right what's up what's up Eli all right we're going to be talking about $500 skin bundles and before we do that I just am going to kind of put you on the spot live here um you know you know how we we talked about you know one of those conversations that I was having with my kids about stuff that I don't want to see them doing and I was all like hey kids doing that thing what is that and they're like it's dumb are are
you comfortable talking about you know what we talked about after that conversation with my kids I'm asking in very coded language on purpose here are you are you are you ask wanting me to tell how much I've spent on skins no no well yes basically the like the conversation we had about you know how that can be bad and stuff you know like that whole thing oh like is that something you talked about or I don't remember I remember telling you how much I spent and then you said
it was shameful that's all I really remember okay man um okay uh mute me for a second Dan  second we're back yeah okay so so Elijah um one of the things that we chatted about when you were over for the land party um was how for you in-game spending actually got to the point where was a real problem for you um and you know this is one of those things that I feel like for me and Luke it's very easy for us as people who never got into it to kind of talk about well just don't
buy the skin right but I think for for someone who falls into alcoholism for example to hear someone say well just don't drink the drink is is actually very uh very non-constructive and so as we make our way into the um the Riot news this week about their uh their skin bundle um you know why don't you talk a little bit about what it's like to be the sort of person that's being targeted by this type of marketing um because we chatted about that a little bit at the Lan yeah totally so I mean one thing
that I have always struggled with was mainly the the fomo and like loot boxes so you know the chance of getting something that is is there you know falling into that gambling aspect um unfortunately I suffer from being taken advantage of that and basically having gambling addiction so in early days when loot boxes were super super prominent and basically the first thing you see when you boot up a game is oh my God you can get this skin you should go get it right now it's it's very tough because
you can then boot up a game and maybe your friends have it or maybe someone else got it that's in this game and you're like wow that actually does look really really cool um it's it's it's a tough feeling to fight because you know it almost feels like you have no control because you're just like oh man they're just shoving it in my face There's an opportunity I have to take it and I don't want to miss it so it's it can be really tough and the game can be a significant part of your social life I
mean it's not like I can't relate to that in my in my Peak TF2 left for dead days I literally got up in the morning ate food went to work ate some food worked some more went home grabbed some food and sat down at my computer and gamed until it was time to sleep rinse and repeat and do it again and so the idea that you know this could be a significant amount of your Social Circle is your gaming buddies and a significant amount of your social life is interacting in this game is I mean it's
something that we should be able to relate to even if we haven't really considered it that way before so let me run through the news from this week um League of Legends developer Riot is selling what it calls this is great some of our most generous bundles to date I'm gonna stop there for a moment Elijah how do you feel about a game developer describing a skin bundle as generous I would say they're pretty humble perfect this is despite the fact that the cheapest of these bundles is
$50 and the most expensive is $500 the $500 bundle features cosmetic skins for the playable character AR leading many players to argue for boycotting the character as ranked league matches allow each team to vote on a small number of characters who can't be played in the next match boycotting players could eventually potentially even block others from playing Ahi some players however still appear to be buying these egregiously expensive limited time offers at least one thirdparty seller of in-game
currency claims that some of his customers took out small loans in order to do so saying can you guys stop taking out loans to buy the AR skin I don't want to put you in debt legit every second order is with a loan agreement so can you talk a little bit  feels it doesn't shock me that people are buying it and I think that's kind of I remember one of my first W shows in when I was typing in chat you were blown away when I mentioned that a csgo skin sold for six figures uh you you know it's it's one of
those things it becomes a flex status symbol it's the same reason that Supreme clothing you know can charge prices Gucci can charge the prices even if they are good quality you're paying the artist for their work of what they've done it's a flex status at that point oh man I uh I I got to confess like I still have a hard time wrapping my brain around that that's still something that's that's very uh that's very difficult for me to to Fathom like when I was in school right like I wasn't
cool um I didn't have status symbols U my my RCA lra MP3 player did not get me chicks what the cool kid the cool kids  right so I don't know as someone who maybe maybe part of it is that I have never reaped the social benefit of flexing um and so maybe that's something that and and guys you know let me know if I'm kind of on to something here but like you know is that something that can get you kind of addicted to that dopamine hit of people being like Whoa man like cool jacket or uh
cool product like is is that is that part of the experience I I think part of it can definitely be related to that I think this $500 skin is definitely going to be pushing that outer limits of you know people being like damn you're kind of an idiot potentially because you spent $500 but there's also going to be that group of circle that's like wow that guy must really like this game or he plays this game a lot or you know whatever it may be because they have that skin and yeah
like you said earlier Social Circle right if you're part of a group of friends that only plays league and you want to be the guy that has the $500 skin it it's a status symbol but like wouldn't the status symbol be like I I I I'm baller enough that like I don't I don't have to like I don't have to dress up I don't have to cosplay as a league player I can just I can just rock vanilla and beat you and embarrass like 100 in the world then like that's the kind of thing you know no one cares
"about numbers thousand to 10,000 they" only care about the top thousand so you know if you can't make it there your next chance is to look cool and look  oh my God Chase is in the chat now good Lord did you see this valve apparently lets you rent CS2 skins so you can try them out and then decide if you want to buy or keep renting them are you kidding me dude it's a thing where people will buy a skin put it on a gun and get upset because it doesn't look as good as it does in the shop
what does that even mean it was digital in both places no no okay but like when it's in your hand and like you're in first-person perspective seeing it and how it glints off like maps and lighting if it interacts with the environment if the Shadows if the light dude I I can see your reaction looking at the camera right now I get it you're you're dumbfound by this like I get it you know why they call it dumbfounded because I found dumb I found it sorry I'm not even GNA ding that that's just clever thanks Dan
it's it's it's crazy like I I totally uh yeah yeah but I I totally see why renting would be a thing because if you're not sure how it's going to look on your favorite map or in your game why would you spend the $500 maybe I $10 my God just luk who it is in float plane chat is like $100 a month you get every skin new idea you're welcome EA but it's all a rental okay so it's it skins as a service let's go I love that I hate this worst idea can we can we get a patent on that real quick oh my God
Sony's already got it Elijah I would rather not make the money than oh I mean I guess we could patent it so no one does it that's what I'm saying or I see okay you're not in charge anymore Taran if Taran asks you to do this you know we we kind of have to now I don't know if I'm the check man I don't know if I want any part of any of this we could sell new colors for the LT store that's fair oh float skins I like that idea you give our Chatters specific colors for their username and they can
rent it or like you could have dark mode or like Pew for the background people they already pay a subscription yeah but we they could pay us more why do we want nickel and dime people we they're a trapped audience why does fortnite do it why does valerant do it because it's profitable yes think of the think of the opportunity I mean look I got I got to tell you like back when we were looking at development of our own VPN it's not like we didn't recognize that digital products are are so scalable can be so
profitable I mean if we could come up with more digital products I mean look at float plane we have almost "35,000 paying subscribers on float plane" that is a that is a pretty chunk of change and we're so appreciative of you guys for supporting us like this that we actually go and spend a lot of money on you know making sure we're creating exclusive content and all of that stuff and it's it's great right it's it's winwin because we can build out a team that is able to have a good job here at
Linus Media Group and you guys are getting all this great behind the- scenes content all that good stuff but like I don't know we've had these conversations internally that I'm like yeah but should we just be creating a digital product for the sake of having a digital product because it's just profitable I don't know I I I want do that no we don't I mean okay we did yes the potato okay yes yeah okay I was like I thought we did this didn't we but that was a joke and people still took it it was an
obscenely profitable joke I think we sold like 800 potatoes and they weren't even real nfts they were just pings or jpegs or something oh don't don't spoil it don't spoil it ah no no they knew we said it was I I know I yeah we were totally upfront about it that the whole thing was nonsense do any of y'all still have your Potato by the way did did anyone anyone in chat buy a potato imagine if you deleted the PNG and it's just gone you just lost it yeah yeah oh what a shame is is Luke coming back like do you
do you need a camera because my like my audio is garbage so like uh I don't know is it hey Dan is Luke planning to come back yeah he's right here oh okay yeah Luke's apparently ready to come back okay all right cool okay see you later Elijah okay bye buddy thanks for filling okay by um yeah really really cool different perspective and the timing was pretty good to bring him in just because I I think that Luke and I as Outsiders can be a little judgy about that kind of stuff and and that's probably unfair
because we know that these companies are engaging in psychological manipulation and so I think just being dismissive of of people's susceptibility to it is honestly just kind of kind of non-constructive so I think I thought it was pretty cool to have Elijah come in and uh give us an alternate perspective on that uh Luke did you have any thoughts you wanted to share on the $500 skin bundle or do you want to move on to uh oh this is a good one social media children are finally fighting back as
adults something I called like almost 10  ago yeah I think on the $500 skin bundle like it's if if if it doesn't make you better at the game if it's not a skin that like makes you camouflage in with the background or something like that um I don't think the people should buy it but it's a free game so like I don't really care they need to make money somehow and if someone's going to buy this like cool I guess but based on how many people dude but based on how many people are taking out loans to buy it I
mean doesn't that isn't that just sad doesn't that just tell you like what they're they know what they're doing they've got to know what they're doing right like at what point do you have to kind of go okay look you're working at a tobacco company you're complicit you  doing yeah I I think there's I think for some people though that $500 skin bundle isn't going to be bad and smoking tobacco is bad for everyone and like look I get that not everybody's in a position to be able to make a moral
judgment about you know know the job they have to do to put food on their table I get it no judgment here but I do feel like at least at the executive level they've got to know who they are making these things for I mean Luke you've talked about this before where there are games where they go into their analytics with enough granularity that there are specific users that they will craft an item for and Market it too heavily because they know they're going to buy it it's nasty yeah absolutely
yeah I don't I don't like it um but I don't know my my I I don't feel super strongly about it just because I think my stance on this is just like obviously don't buy it um but I don't know what was the next topic next topic is now that the first big wave of social media babies are hitting adulthood some of them are now advocating for protecting children from their parents online over sharing two notable Advocates are right topic yeah yeah yeah are cam Barrett and Chris McCarty who have been testifying to
lawmakers in multiple States asking them to regulate family vlogging and ensure that children are protected and to some degree compensated for their labor they are working they are generating Revenue this is not the same as household chores and I have had some stupid conversations about this where like I just about made my brain rot From the Inside Out people basically going yeah until they're 18 they're my kids and if I tell them to do something they got to do no no child
labor is not something that you have the right to have your kids do and if they are working on a commercial Endeavor they are child laborers and there are very strict regulations around it even in Industries where children children where children are allowed to work like the entertainment industry 25-year-old cam Barrett claims that she was traumatized by her mother's dream oversharing which included everything from childhood Tantrums to personal medical information in particular
Barrett was humiliated by her mother's decision to post publicly about her first menstrual cycle when she was only 9 years old these posts led to celebrity attention and perks like front row concert tickets but also fed ammunition to bullies who used the information to ridicule her she claims to have started hiding in her room to avoid being on camera and that she felt she couldn't confide in adults for fear of her Secrets being exposed on social media meanwhile 19-year-old Chris McCarty is a
founding member of quit clicking kids and he has noted that family vlogging can be in some ways worse than child acting as these children wind up living in houses that feel like sets with parents who feel like their bosses and it's unclear when they finally get to stop performing mccardy likewise says these parents are often failing to empathize with their children and not considering how they would feel if they had the most intimate moments of their lives monetized young people are
likewise increasingly criticizing the practice of family vlogging on social media it's about time I called this so long ago and yes my kids do appear in our videos from time to time  them I know a few things sorry there's a butterfly well yeah you do you're you're a family friend it's different and we compensate them yeah like I was an extra on the X Files I don't know if I've talked about this I was extra on the xfiles when I was a kid um I I it I've never actually seen the 
um yeah I so um but like I'm not bothered by that because all I did was appear on camera my dad gave me the money I mean it was my money right but he made sure that I got it his rule for it was that we both made money we were both extras and that we weren't going to you know it was like uh it was like a couple hundred dollars or something like that and he was like Hey it should be um we should do something together with it like he didn't really like give it to me give it to me but we both we went and we
ate at um labello be which was a fancy French restaurant in Ladner when I was a kid it's not there anymore um and we went and we tried it because we would walk past it all the time and it was one of those places it was like1 plus dollar a plate and that was back in the 9s right so this was a very a fancy fancy restaurant um and so yeah I was in this thing but you know my Intimate Secrets were not Spilled Out online uh we turned it into an opportunity to do something together as a family no harm no foul but
that's not I think it's cool what these families are doing it's absolutely wild I think there's also a huge difference between uh happening to appear in you know one video every once in a blue moon being compensated for that um compared to having content made about you including as you previously mentioned uh pretty intimate parts of your life like first menstrual cycle stuff like that like that being on YouTube for all your peers to see is ridiculous and not okay yeah brutal Sony seems to be
struggling with the concept of multiplatform support oh wait wait wait hold on I want to finish by making my prediction again um the only way that this is ever going to change the this family vlogging exploitation of children is when one of these kids reaches the legal age and sues the out of their parents and it's basically like hey you guys made by my rough calculations with data that is easily available online uh you know $8 million over the course of my entire childhood um I am one of the
three principal talents on this channel I would like my $2.7 million or whatever whatever it works out to uh you can you can send it through my lawyer that is the only way that this is going to change if one of these guys takes it to court and wins it otherwise it's just going to be the same um okay Sony seems to be struggling with the concept of multiplatform support according to records from the Korean Ministry of Sciences testing and certification Center Sony has developed
a PC adapter for psvr2 showing that they've made significant progress ress on their promise to add PC support sometime this year this would likely bolster sales for the psvr2 which is reportedly experiencing a major backlog of unsold device it's a pretty cool device got an OLED display um it's pretty darn comfortable it's um yeah I think something that would do okay um I don't know it'd be it'd be it'd be pretty competitive for the price I think I'd be I think I would find a psvr2
pretty darn attractive as a as a gaming headset meanwhile PlayStation's new co-ceo Herman Holst insisted at Sony's business segment meeting on Thursday that PC Gamers will want to buy a PS5 in order to play their upcoming exclusive sequels like Spider-Man 2 and God of War Ragnarok after playing earlier entries in those series recently released for PC and our discussion here is as a PC Gamer would you be tempted to play uh Horizon zero Dawn for example on PC and then run out and get Horizon shoot see as a PC
Gamer I can't even remember what the second one was called because I played zerod Dawn and then I was like oh there's a sequel oh it's not on PC I guess I'll just not play it but I I I tend to I take a pretty different approach to my gaming backlog where I'm just like oh well realistically I haven't gotten to participate in a cultural moment like uh you hell divers 2 or um what was that Pokemon with guns game pal world or you know whatever else I don't get to participate in these cultural moments
anyway so screw it if it has staying power then I'll play it later um but would you be tempted to run out and buy a PS5 in order to play a sequel I could see that being a thing um I I honestly could absolutely see that being a thing I think a lot of people play play games more than they play systems if that makes sense now the economic environment that we're in and and the cost of modern consoles might put a stop to that um I think it used to be a little bit more approachable to get into a console
um but if it was like if it was kind of time to upgrade your computer anyways and your favorite game was the the the game that you're playing now and there's the the next version of it is just on the console I could see that happening but I think that's going to happen significantly less than Sony thinks and I think they would drive a lot more overall Revenue just releasing the darn games on PC I don't know man a lot of people CU go ahead I I just you you always have that
experience or at least this happened when I was younger where people would come over to a friend's house and see Halo for the first time and then be switched over to Xbox houses or whatever else like like individual games can swing people absolutely and a lot of people in chat are talking about it happen a lot of people in chat are like yeah I'd be tempted it's totally a thing but can I can I propose man I don't know why so many I was reading this article a little while ago I might have even
talked about this on Wow before but it was about um every once in a while like uh like luxury goods articles get fed to me like the state of the luxury goods market and particularly like um uh what is it South China Morning Post or whatever like there there I'll particularly get articles from them um this was more before they they went paywalled and I would actually read articles there now I just am like oh okay pay wall I forgot about that and then I navigate away so I don't really
get them anymore uh but one of the things that they would talk about a lot is they would kind of keep tabs on the state of the luxury goods Market in Southeast Asia and China kind of overseas and uh I remember reading about how there's this like Trend um there's this trend toward more uh secondhand luxury goods and the the incredible value that you can get by buying and by selling the things that you bought for so much money and getting back some of the money for it and then you can buy
something else with that and and by saving money by buying secondhand it's like like it's like like the idea of you know a thrift store is a new idea or something but but um I don't know what it is about people because I don't think it's just the younger generation that was what the article was about it's like younger generation comes up with the idea of buying and selling secondhand no no you didn't um but basically I don't understand why so many people are allergic to that if a game comes out
that you really want to play go pick up a secondhand PlayStation 5 on Facebook Marketplace okay so that's like let's do the numbers right so that's uh it's probably going to be like 100 bucks off or whatever so that's that's 350 bucks out of your pocket let's say I don't know the actual numbers it doesn't matter but that's 300 bucks out of your pocket okay you go buy the game right so that's 70 bucks or 80 or whatever works out to for modern game these days I don't know I'm in Canada so I don't even
know what US games cost so you you go buy your $70 game or whatever so you are you are $420 out of your pocket nice okay so you play your game right realistically it's probably got you know what 25 to 75 hours of gameplay so you can probably get that done in let's say a month right I'd say that's pretty reasonable for a game that was was so compelling right for you that you went out and you bought a several hundred console just to play it okay sell the console it's been a month
how much you think the value is actually changed right compared to buying a new one the value of a secondhand one realistically hasn't changed that much you can probably get what you paid and if you're you're patient you can probably buy for lower and sell for higher and then sell the game do you really need it I've I've you will be out made money in those scenarios before too you'll be out of pocket probably 25 bucks and it costs you overall less than the total cost of the game it's no big
deal I used to do it all the time another thing too is if if you buy one that happens to be like a little bit dirty or a little bit scuffed up you can try to not not I wouldn't say refinish but like clean it up a little bit take better pictures of it than the original poster did make it look a little bit  money and it's it's it's yeah it's a little bit of work but it's also kind of it it can become a hobby it can be come fun you know bargain hunting is a lot more fun if you follow through and you
don't just buy if you sell as well and you maintain like make a spreadsheet have the discipline make a spreadsheet where you track everything that you're buying and selling and keep it Net Zero I bet you can do it and I don't know I had a I had a blast with it and man the resources for it are so good these days if I had had Facebook Marketplace which has problems I mean the fact that they're not tamping down on sellers who list for Z doar and actually it's it it costs a lot of money
oh man are you going to tell the bunker story or should we save that for another W show you want to tell the bunker story okay I don't know he's muted so who knows what he's saying but it sounds like he's not going to tell the bunker story we'll talk about the bunker story time uh I I can tell it now or another time I'm down either way sure sure let's talk about the bunker story but the point is let me just finish this thought Facebook Marketplace is an incredible tool in
spite of its problems and I would have man I would have had a blast okay I want to talk why don't you tell the bunker story Luke sure okay so we were at uh a land party at Linus's house and having some fun and Elijah happened to find a uh a a concrete a safe I think it was it was listed as and it's like it's it's very generic it they sell basically it's a series of exactly uniform concrete slabs that make up all of the walls I believe the floor if there is any for the floor
and also the ceiling I know the walls in the ceiling are all the same uniform concrete slabs and then there's just a big vault door that goes into it was able to actually Google the company that makes it and figure out that this person that listed it for $0 was effectively just trying to resell from another company uh because all they posted were sample images not an image of the actual safe or vault or whatever you want to call it so they weren't reselling something that they owned they were just
trying to advertise and make money that way um so Elijah bugged them by offering him I think it was like a single dollar so it was listed for zerar like but the real price I think Elijah mess it was listed for $1 sorry yeah so it was listed for $1 We messaged him um Elijah offered him a dollar I believe it was or $2 or something um and "he's like oh but my cost is like $40,000" and Elijah was like well you shouldn't have listed it for that if you shouldn't have listed it for a dollar if you
wanted to sell it for more than "$40,000 uh and then my brother and I" caught wind of this um and just decided to have have a little bit of fun umed  a series of questions that ranged from like um what how it would be transported to us and what the transport costs would be um I got really into the exact material composition of the concrete and when we nailed that down um despite knowing the safety rating of the lock I started getting into um like how many uh I I don't remember what they're called
but like the big not the pins that you would pick with a lock pin but the pins that go into the wall to keep the door closed like how many of those exist what are the material composition of those how long do they stand up to angle grinder attacks all this other different type of stuff um just like every every question you could possibly imagine um and then when you when you get to when you kind of run out of questions you you hit them with the old $2 offer um so we it was it was just a little bit of
fun you know just wasting wasting somebody's time who's basically wasting everyone El's Time In fairness In fairness he had it coming I'm with you on this one but how many days did your brother keep him keep stringing him along wasn't it like almost a week my brother had him I I think it was actually a whole week because the last messages I'm seeing here are from the next Sunday um I had actually seen this one the last question was could you fit a small card car inside
yeah and he's maybe Dan's Car he's like like like very small like a very very small car can you fit one inside oh man I would love for this to become an entire content genre just like trolling people who list things for zero or $1 on Facebook because you know what those people they are ruining the platform for everyone else and they need to just screw off apparently it is oh that's awesome well I thought we came up with something but I guess uh there's no such thing as
a unique idea apparently Dutch tick Tok is full of it I love it that's awesome that's great respect yeah my my brother had him I I think my questions got a little bit too obvious uh but my brother was trying to convince him that he had an extremely extensive watch collection that he wanted to store within the Vault and stuff like he he spun this whole story it was great he did a better job than I did I just got really into asking him a lot of questions but my brother was like
trying to have a conversation which was uh a better use of time I think but it was good that's hilarious um um open AI has formed a new Safety and Security committee only a few short weeks after it saw several high-profile resignations and ultimately the uh dissolution um of its super alignment committee which was focused on making sure that the pursuit of artificial general intelligence remained aligned with the interests of human beings open AI says that this new safety committee
committee will be led by two members of the current board alongside CEO Sam Alman the primary person who has been accused of making irresponsible decisions regarding Ai and AGI development there's not really much else for us to say other than seriously who's going to who's going to oversee the tech Bros how about the tech broest of tech Bros um you know I yeah I'm I I got a bone to pick actually with um with with with the community and I uh I don't know how to address this because I think a
lot of you probably recognize it but I get called a tech bro a lot I actually have very little in common with tech Bros I do not run a tech company I run a media company yes you do okay float plane sort of float plane's also a media company I run a media company an other more different Media company and an apparel company  on anyway there's a good question what about Labs so there's a train going by so I'm trying to toggle mute quick Labs is Media it's still media it's all media
it's been media from the start it's the Moon meme always has been like yeah I love technology so if if I I don't do V I don't do VC investment I don't do like I don't do Tech bro stuff that's a big difference I don't do any of that stuff I run a I run a heavy VC I run a self funded Media company so I resent that okay I resent that I think the heavy VC funding and building in order to sell is the biggest differentiator because like if you want to call Flow plane a media company um is
like are people who work at uh YouTube not in Tech are people who work at Tik Tok not in Tech um like I I it gets a little bit weird but I think the yeah the heavy like financial company backing um and stuff like that is a major differentiator yeah there's no private equity in float plane there's no pressure on us to behave in any way that is that is unethical or that is um uh that is hostile towards our users base or our customer basee um and so there is notification there's no reason for it to
happen um and it's something it's it's it's it's the way that we are structured is the antithesis of of like a tech bro style company um and you know obviously as as people who are who are into technology and who are you know running a company I can see how you know there's a lot of cosmetic similarities but the the underlying structure of this company is completely different and the pressures on us are completely different uh someone asks what about framework I do not run framework I don't have a seat
on the board of framework I I had some cash burning a hole in my pocket and I saw something that I thought was incredible and could be an industry changer and I was like you know what would be really cool is if I put my money where my mouth is and if it ever grows and I ever get a return on the investment that's super cool but I'm  and I guess we'll just see what happens if if it doesn't take off then at the very least I put my money where my mouth is and I showed that I believed with
with real concrete like money in my pocket I showed that I believed in the mission I'm super proud of them they are doing incredible um and since we're at it right um it was a very very similar investment into that Nas operating system that is still turning away in the background they'll they'll let you guys know when they're ready to announce something but again I'm not being All Tech bro about it I didn't even they offered a seat on their board I told them I don't even want it I don't I
don't I don't want any of that pressure I don't want any of that responsibility they were good people who were building something that I believe in very very strongly I wanted it to have a shot that was it that's it I am they they were like you are the least Hands-On investor that we have ever heard of because I basically don't even like respond to emails they'll be like giving me an update I'm like all right and they're like hey we really need to have a call like because we just
like to talk to you and you know get some insight on something or whatever or like you know obviously you invested in this because you felt very strongly that this is a product that you know creators and Tech enthusiasts need um you know we'd love to get some clarification on some stuff I'm like uh all right I can fit you in on Saturday that's the last call I had with them I was uh I was driving home from  lesson anyway uh Corey is the name asks "does $100,000 really mean that much to a"
company like framework at the time um it was helpful but no it wasn't critical they had put aside a little bit of equity for an investor that could open doors for them um and as someone who can who can help cheerlead the product which I told them I would do regardless of whether they took my investment or not it was at their discretion I told them I would do it regardless um they they saw uh me and our company as someone that  with uh let's talk about the Spotify car thing there's an
update uh they are not going to be open sourcing it however they will be issuing refunds for the car thing so long as they have proof of purchase following backlash to spotify's plan to Brick the barely three-year-old dedicated streaming device um as someone who cares about the environmental impact of tech I'm not super happy with this outcome but I am a lot happier from a customer um customer care standpoint um refund would have been a lot better or sorry uh uh open source
would have been a lot better I would have strongly preferred that but I also did talk last show about how I  possible is there anything else in the dock did we did we get through the dock in a reasonable amount of time today how are your fingers doing so I suspect we have yeah uh let's see I have done 780 merch messages that is um not good enough there's a lot more coming Dan wow I'm working on it no no I'm kidding I'm I'm kidding I'm kidding there there are actually like 145 in the Q still so so
objectively speaking it's not good enough but I'm still very proud of Dan and I appreciate his efforts see the these things can both be true subjectively I'm so happy that Dan is doing such a great job but objectively it's not good enough see another way to frame it could be that Dan's effort is good enough but he he might need an expanded team in order to conquer this uh workload that's actually interesting had we ever Dan had we ever thought about like if we're launching a big
product and we know we're going to get like a bajillion merch messages bringing like Jake bellance back for for like a Friday or something I've been uh training kind of chewy to to do this oh because he wouldn't probably embroil Us  guy uh see you later so I think that would probably be useful um I think there's like a level of uh intuition that you get eventually um which is why I can do this now and I would be struggling like six months ago all right yeah we should uh yeah maybe
that's something that we should consider hey what was that one that just came up about someone having a one-on-one with their manager about wearing the LTT hat Pro do you remember replying to that one I do actually hilariously uh the Hat was not professional enough uh or something like that and he wants to make a case for it it and I think I suggested two hats that is hilarious the LTT hat Pro is not professional enough something like that it's all black it's a ball cap
though I guess I kind of understand okay so we need to work on a more professional hat what's a professional hat no hat what's a professional hat yeah like what Top Hat what makes it I mean We've joked about it before that would be S that's what you can use the AL Packa wolf for oh God a wolf yeah yeah pack a is why I was late on that you guys it's going to be like a $100 hat people are going to flip out you're buying a top hat people already give us a hard time about our stupid pricing and
look quality products cost money I'm sorry not sorry but that an alpaca wool Top Hat you guys are going to get me roasted on social media I mean if it's already happening then like what you look like can wear a top hat you got to spend like you can wear a top hat yeah he's not wrong he's not wrong that cardboard cut out with head on top of it is um okay Dan I don't think that it is realistic for us to get through all the merch messages this week I mean if you're ending the
show I mean I was making good progress um I think if you guys start some of the other ones then I can get this down because now we're in the the dayah of the evening and so they're coming in a little less fast okay um all right in that case uh Luke how long do you have you appear to be in a park there is literally someone hiking behind you right now yes um so right now uh I am mostly battery limited so since I got out here we've burned 22% of laptop battery oh that's not so bad so when that hits zero
I'm done unless we want me to go onto my phone which I'm willing to do it will be a significantly degraded experience I'll tell you what why don't we uh why don't we start on some curated messages and I'll read them out and then Dan will continue to reply to some and we'll see how we do uh Mike D says hello Dan Luke and beardless lonus what's a video idea you've had over the years that seemed like it would be good and an entertaining one but just wasn't practical to produce oh man there's been so many in
fact I could pull up a spreadsheet right now if Luke has one off at the the top of his head that he'd like to that he'd like to talk about then you know by me I I can talk for a little bit what instantly jumped into my head was things that that is true for but we we honestly ended up doing anyways because we thought it was just a good thing to make for the community like honestly we announced it this stream like making scrapyard Wars doesn't make a ton of sense um it's it's very very difficult
to make it takes an incredible amount of time not only in the fact that like sometimes they're up to a week long of two shoters sometimes more two host and then the editing time for it is enormous and I'm super insistent that anytime we do a competition or a or a game of chance style piece of content that it is real so there is legitimately a strong probability every time we do something like scrapyard Wars that it's just going to be boring as um yep so it's super risky but yeah we do
things but we we believed in the content because we as we talked about for a different topic on this show we like promoting the idea of people making economic choices by people buying on the used Market we're contributing less to ew because we're reusing things you can get a lot better of a deal you can get into computers computer gaming computer performance in in whatever way you want to um by reusing other people's stuff saving a ton of money and it can be fun which is part of what we're trying to
show people as well is it can be engaging it can fun it can be done relatively quickly um and you can get really interesting things and honestly a lot of the computers that you end up making that way you probably feel more attached to anyways like it's it's I don't know it's all very good but realistically it's not super practical the return on investment of making a a scrapyard War series is like super bad not the greatest um I could do a lot of like I could do a lot of sponsored pool robot videos in
the time it takes to do scrapyard War I'll put it that way yeah yeah a ton of them uh here's one I I really wanted to do a Roundup of window mounted AC units with how much heat pumps have been in the news like doing a doing like a window mounted like heat pump style heater cooler window like I I think that would be super super news you can use content um I'm sure there's a channel that like is more focused on that kind of thing but I I feel like it's something that we could do if we really
wanted to you do it this is uh W in in our in our rating system so I've got like a colorcoded rating system for video ideas um W is good ideas that might require sourcing something difficult or waiting for new technology to arrive um so one of them was oh man we're trying to get our hands on a tashiba 55 Z2 Glasses free 3D TV uh that's one of those um one that just wasn't practical was using the Vision Pro for a whole day and just like vlogging about that we just kind of
got to it too late oh here's one I've wanted to do for so long the e-w PC where I actually go like dumpster dive but the problem is all those recyclers because of their their data protection policies and privacy policies and stuff which I totally get and totally makes sense they won't let you just dig around in the e-w um and any any transfer station or or dump like landfill in at least Le the part of Canada where I live won't let you anywhere near that because they're worried about liability like
what if you puncture your skin on a hypodermic needle while you're digging around in computer cases which by the way is a possibility remember that time I found a crackpipe in a computer doing scrapyard Wars yeah so like yeah I I really want to do that people have suggested it so many times you think we haven't tried man we've tried so many times when we did that um that Acer sponsored piece where we uh where we set up like a strip down Windows on like an e-w tier machine like office discard
machine that was supposed to be the e-w PC we had found an E-Waste processor like on the east coast and we were going to pick up we were going to go all the way there to do an E-Waste Build Challenge thing it was going to be sponsored by Acer and it fell through like we've tried so many times I would I would love to do it people are like sign the necessary ndas Etc it's not that simple they have agreements with the organizations that send them e-waist that say they will not allow an
unauthorized party to have access to it it's that it's that simple the answer is no yeah that's tough sucks uh all right archive oh yes it's after dark uh Chase M says sup dlll I wanted to ask about the Lux backpack I'm on the fence about purchasing it and was wondering about how long I might have has it shipped ooh uh shoot this one I don't actually know the answer to uh I know I just signed off on the on the final sample of the  saac which I don't think we have talked about before uh so that's coming to
match the Luxe backpack but um I believe we will have some inventory when it arrives like dozens of units not a lot but I believe will have some when it arrives okay archive Gareth says Hi D back in many of your old videos you would say to always use an antistatic strap and you claimed you always had one in your ankle is that true or were you lying for clout um it is true that you should it is also true that I was often in a hurry so yes I lied if there's a lie that you could nail me on it would be that one
that is one time that I have actively deceived the community but my heart was in the right place I wanted to make sure that I was encouraging proper best practices while also recognizing the reality of our fast-paced understaffed production environment and desperate attempts to keep our business alive that would have been slowed down by me constantly clipping in and unclipping my antistatic strap and I didn't have the money to invest in things like antistatic flooring and I'm
sorry I'm very sorry you know what there's a second lie I I've I've told very few lies to the community the two that I can think of right now are that one and when I would fill a water loop and I would tell you guys that it was distilled water it it was it was tap water and there is one particular member of our community who knows who they are and is a idiot um who is very mad about that because I showed the performance of a water cooled system that had tap water in it which by the way here in British
Columbia Canada in the city of Sur is not hard and doesn't have a ton of chemicals in it it's basically whatever it doesn't matter um like I have run our tap water in water cooling systems for extended periods of time years at a time nothing goes wrong it's fine um but the point is they're extremely mad because I said it was distilled water and then I gave performance numbers not comparing multiple products against each other I just gave some thermal numbers and that I lied and deceived our viewers and it's
like are you for real who cares it doesn't matter so that that is a second lie that I told I said I was using distilled water because depending on where you are it may actually matter here it doesn't you put some bioside in it you'll be fine um but I I would like to encourage best practices even if I don't feel like going all the way to the grocery store to get distilled water because we're in the middle of a shoot and I need some stupid water I'm just going to go fill a bottle and I'm going
to fill it from the top I'm sorry I'm sorry sounds like you should make a donation to BC children as okay I just did I I just did I just did uh this was cool this was cool I actually had the the relative of a BC Children's employee who works in the lab that we donated to walk up to me in a parking lot which is a little creepy by the way please don't approach public figures in a parking lot like your intentions might be good but it's it's actually kind of scary um but anyway one the worst times yeah they
approached me in a parking lot and we're like hey I just wanted to say like thank you you so much for the money you raised my brother and his team are so grateful and they're going to do such incredible work with it and it's completely blew away their expectations so that was pretty cool but don't do that that's all right what's next oh right I'm I'm in charge of this but any sorry it wasn't for cloud it definitely wasn't for clout it was because I want people to uh follow best practices even if um I don't
always have time to do things properly um Mitchell D asks I bought an engagement ring and I'm trying to think of ideas for how to propose to my girlfriend lonus what's the story of how you proposed L andan do you have any plans of how you would propose in the future okay mine's terrible my wife explicitly told me not to put the ring in food and not to propose in front of our families I did both I don't know why I don't I don't think I could put myself back into my head space my original plan
was to propose underwater and then she EXP she explicitly told me not to do that so my plan was to be scuba diving and find you know a treasure chest with a ring and I was like I've got a really good idea and she was like as long as it's not underwater and I was like oh okay busted and then I I don't know she hates our my proposal so whatever you do don't do what I did a good bet would be to ask her for inspiration kind of go chat GPT on this ask her to to to to to to you
know give some inspiration and then try and find something that's aligned with her interest but that would be a fun surprise and different find a funny find like a compilation of funny ones online and watch them with her and then roll it into uh like rating them on like how much she likes them I can't be super specific right now someone is across the table geeky Vapor says don't do it publicly unless you're 100% sure they want that yeah 100% geeky VAP knows what's up yep cool cool
cool yeah uh anyway good luck with that congratulations in advance I hope or I'm sorry to hear that tldr or how however that that copy past it goes uh Juan B says hello from Miami welcome to Miami sorry sorry sorry I I did that wrong I'll be watching this on my way to work tomorrow morning what are some of the things you wished you knew when you started the company and what are some pros and cons of having your own company I wish I knew how much bloody work it would be um you know the
pros are that you kind of uh you can control your own destiny to a degree like there's things you can't control there's economic conditions there's pandemics there's all kinds of stuff that you can't control but compared to just having your livelihood and having your your life and your happiness to the whims of someone else I would say that is a major advantage but it's also a major disadvantage because you're going to be subjected to all of the pressure that comes from having that level of
control if anything goes wrong you have  yourself Caleb G hey Luke I was curious since you grew up in sports and being athletic if you ever Mountain biked especially given you grew up in one of if not the place to get into the sport  yes I did actually um but I mostly did it on like trails that just happen to be around my house um sorry one second we are we are battling a invading insect that I just conquered um uh yeah no I I I used to go on like trails around my house when when I was growing up my
house was much more Wildland around it than it is now because kind of yeah got got all over to where our house was but originally it was mostly fields around there so we would go around the fields and um and make little tracks in in the forest or like jump over you know just push a bunch of dirt in front of a a fallen over tree and use that as like a jump or whatever else um but the reality of mountain biking is was a little expensive for our our uh abilities at that that time so I was luy
to have a bike with gears like ice hockey exactly yeah like my my mountain bike had no shocks um my shocks were my legs and I would stand up while I was going which was great I didn't mind it but um like there was there was some issues with like okay we're not going to go up to Whistler every summer and like go mountain biking on Whistler and stuff like that um it just wasn't going to happen which is fine but it was a little bit limiting we didn't play Ice Hockey we played ball hockey things like that
um but yeah no I I think mountain biking super cool but I never got like really into it I just enjoyed riding a bike um on on trails and stuff like that benar says I love this upcycle I've wanted a forever pen for a while but couldn't decide this is the one hey thanks Ben question for lonus how has your autograph evolved over the years have you considered changing it I have changed it multiple times because I realized that it was pretty stupid uh to use my real signature um
and hand it to people in public bad don't do that yeah every once in a while someone will hand me something that uh they're like hey I had you sign this once and uh I want you to sign it again and I'll have this temptation to like Scribble out the old one CU they'll have like my real signature that I use realistically what I should do is I should just change my signature um maybe I'll do that you know what there this will be the kick in the pants that I need to finally change my signature I
just got a new document of some sort I'm not going to tell you what it is because you don't need to know but I just got a new document of some sort that needs a signature and uh I'm going to sign it with a new signature and we're going to see how that goes it's going to be great I'm going to come up with something it's going to be really inconvenient for youon for reasons that Luke will find funny but none of you  uh my mic was muted but that is actually quite funny um you guys are still doing 
about William G says lonus as a fellow Ally lover I'm disappointed with how they've been handling warranties have these issues influenced your preference between Ally and steam deck okay this is a really good question it's complicated question I'm sure that you've seen the leaks for asusu is rumored allyx handheld and so what I predict is that if Asus uh were to continue to have um support practices that I can't fully get behind I would need to say something about that in any hypothetical 
Mark says Hey lonus as a parent with ADHD what strategies do you use to help your children avoid the same pitfalls you had going to school school is so different for my kids anyway they don't even have like homework and stuff I don't even I don't even know like I don't even know what they learn okay no no I know what they learn they learn stuff yeah they don't do homework it's like not allowed or something whoa like if they don't finish a worksheet and it's like it's like a
problem like they were being disruptive or whatever occasionally they'll be asked to finish the rest of the worksheet at home or if they miss a week of school because they're sick or something they'll be given a package to work on but they are supposed to be given ample time to complete work in school and that seems to be a policy um is that a government policy or is it that a that school policy I have  idea yeah so they they they seem to honestly it's probably a good thing because like kids are in so many
extracurriculars these days compared to how I feel it was when when we were kids um like I don't mine are pretty busy like they're busy kids so if they had a bunch of homework on top of it I don't  survive um Rick T says hello dlll if a Netflix or Amazon approached you about making a tech newsentertainment show for them do you think it' be something you would go for man that'd be tough I I can see why Mr Beast did it uh I think that's going to be really incredible it's going to be
potentially the moment where he transitions to being like a mainstream celebrity U as opposed to the biggest YouTuber you know like I think that's super cool I don't know what our Tech SL newsentertainment show would be it's something that I haven't brainstormed in a long time I used to have some kind of cool ideas I always thought something in between uh Just for Laughs gags and MythBusters would be kind of cool like Tech pranks and I I had one idea for like a pilot um where uh we even got as
far as kind of brainstorming some ways that we could do it but the idea that I had was um like using using um speakers and sound projection and uh Machine Vision to turn a crosswalk into a piano or something like that like so we're all the pranks instead of being yeah instead of being like slight of hand or like like like um like more illusion or or or magic oriented we more Tech oriented I thought something like that would be really cool but I just have no idea what kind of um
what kind of offer I would have to get to justify shifting my focus from what I do to doing something like that I think it'd be kind of cool though I wonder if I still have my I I specked out how to do that musical crosswalk thing I wonder if I still have that document somewhere we had a couple different ideas for how to do it so  there ear says lonus you mention that you read comments before watching content when you decide to watch a YouTube video do you speed it up yeah I I watch at uh
1.75x if they speak fast and then I'll go to 2x if they're a slow speaker I actually kind of wish they could go a little faster I was watching um what's technology connections video on the color brown the other day and I was like dude I need like 2 and a2t for you um but like you know really really good love the channel and everything but um certain creators I do wish I could go a little faster fantastic Channel yeah uh Shay B says Hey bad cholesterol team JK what is your general experience
negotiating with Brands sponsors and suppliers are there some insane terms you can share or crazy stories oh man I don't I don't really negotiate with brands that much anymore um I will say h man what can I say what what can I what can I what will not get me in   um insane turns and stuff not really like oh ter requirements like yeah there's been a few terms that were crazy but we just said no and then didn't do it yeah like had ones that I've asked for like I remember a phone manufacturer
in like October or something or sorry August or something wanted like a non-compete for three months over the entire like September iPhone launch slash whatever period and they were some like Rando like Chinese phone company and I was basically like no like what are you what are you even talking about um so there like there's definitely been some stuff like that but we just say no so uh man oh man I got I got got the most chatted out um this is amazing oh my God I have a big  there 
it uh why do you need to catch a flight it's 12:30 no no no no no no no no no I am oh no oh no uh uh oh uh oh uh oh hold on hold on oh  them okay um how do we stall them I think I have work been uh with me gone Dan oh sure go do that do that question  remix mop re what I don't know oh oh oh oh the wow thing no I'm not no I'm not hey Luke you mentioned Dimension 20 a couple Dan shows ago I wanted to ask  favorite oh um sorry to be disappointing I don't actively watch it um I think
it's cool but I mean that's a lot of content to sit and watch I don't really watch that much stuff I I play video games if I have time at the computer if I if I have time at home that's free I'm I'm not usually going to watch TV shows or or anything like that I'm usually just going to play games or work on stuff does Luke still keep in touch with   929 what's that I don't know that's what it says 929 929 Best Buy 9 is this is this best by 929 I possibly they bought a pen is that the Best Buy
929 yeah that's the Best Buy I used to work at that took a moment to remember um not super actively there's a there's a couple people like I have I have a couple people on Steam and I don't really talk to them but I'll see them jump in and play games every once in a while and I'm I'm often tempted to like send them a message but I don't even know if they like remember who I am um so I I don't don't really B because it's been a long time for some of them and like for some of these people one of
them in particular that I I know I still have on Steam because I see him launch things every once in a while the last time I would have talked to him I think I would have been like 15 um so I don't know U but there there's quite a number of people that I I would be happy to but um I don't I don't really keep active contact with them no I'm surprised this person wrote 929 I'm wondering if they're one of them or something um because I don't think most people would know that that is the Best 
for those wondering I I realized that I screwed up something on my my badminton playing schedule in Taiwan and I accidentally booked some stuff for this Saturday and then I realized that a few days ago and then I forgot to message so I'm literally supposed to be at a center in like a few hours and I have to bail and I feel really bad because it's with someone that I have played with last year and then played with like years before and like we had dinner last year and like you know um I I feel really
really really bad and I just completely forgot um do you have another day you can play with them yeah I think I'm gonna I'm gonna see if uh gonna see if he's around sometime in the middle of the week but I I feel awful because he's like super nice guy and has helped like coordinate groups for me before and stuff um yeah he's super cool uh anyway yeah so I feel really really awful right now and um let's get through some more curated  messages oh wow there are there are oh
God Dan you're curating a lot of them uh okay JS asks hey lonus what's your favorite and least favorite part of the langly house like the one we used to shoot out of my favorite part of it oh man I guess it has a pretty open layout on the main floor that was pretty helpful uh my least favorite do they mean like favorite part of when we worked there or do they mean literally the physical house I don't know my favorite part of working there was definitely the camaraderie I
remember actually pitching to an agency that was looking for like reality Talent like they were pitching me to come be on some reality show and I was like you know what you guys should do is you should come make a reality show here cuz this thing this place is nuts like can you imagine a reality crew being in there with like you me old tan Burl Brandon Nick I think that was Ed I think that was the whole crew at the time um that would have been nuts like the deadlines were crazy the hours were
crazy like things were kind of tense sometimes but respectful but tense and like it would have been it would have been such a window it would have been such a time capsule in into an early stage of of like New Media that I don't know if you'll ever be able to capture again it would have been really cool so cool they missed out they just like never replied to me I was like well yeah I do wish that happened you're dumb would have been awesome uh Anonymous asks Su lldd can
you give us a tldr version of the real harm of big tech companies collecting and selling your data why should we care about it um you should care because of who they can sell it to and I get it right I think it's pretty easy to fall into the whole well I've got nothing to hide so what does it matter kind of trap but the thing is that you have nothing to hide today I mean women in the states didn't have anything to hide until very recently potentially with respect to medical procedures for
example and like look this is a tech program I'm not interested in taking a position on that matter I think I've made my thoughts on it pretty clear in the past but what I will say is that it is a prime example of something that didn't matter for your you know searches about uh day after you know pills or whatever else um they didn't matter before and now all of a sudden they matter right Insurance uh insurance company policies can change um the the the the value of the data can
change like something that that can be detected like some medication that you're on today they could find out something new about it and all of a sudden oh it's a risk factor for Alzheimer's or who knows and all of a sudden yeah sure legally pre-existing conditions of something something can affect your coverage something something something yeah sure today but things can change and once that data is out there it's out there and that's it that's why it matters there's also a lot more that you can
glean from that data than you might be than you might realize like there's there's old stories about how uh did parents would figure out that their daughters were pregnant before I put your camera on so I could virtually high five you Dan that they had at Target yes good job Dan got through them sorry I I talked Over You Luke sorry sorry go ahead uh I was just saying that sometimes there's more information that can be gleaned from um that data than you might realize as well so they might know more
about you than you think um and and also just like you're you're in a somewhat constant battle for the information that goes into your brain um and do you want to give that level of information about how you work to people that are spending gratuitous of money to try to twist your actions and convince you to do things that you might not otherwise want to do um also the data is almost certainly gonna leak Julian Le s uh that's a really good idea I'm not going to read it out on the show so it can be a
surprise for everyone but that's a pretty cool idea uh Damon s hey L of stand and disconnecting Luke I work in the trades and thus have so far been unaffected by the AI Revolution do you guys see trades and other skilled labor positions being threatened not in in the near future I mean I think that quote unquote unskilled labor um which I I I don't really like that term I don't think that uh I don't think that anyone who who is who works hard and and tries to do their job as best they can I don't
think anyone like that is unskilled I've seen some wild you know YouTube shorts or Tik toks of people who work on a on a box assembly line like like doing it faster than I could imagine any machine possibly could like I've seen stuff right there's there's no such thing as unskilled labor but um I do think that relatively lower skilled labor like unloading trucks is definitely at more risk than something like you know running data wiring in a in a in a new new construction or you know something
like that um but I don't think anything is forever but I do think that skilled labor you know like that requires apprenticeships and study and all that I do think that you guys are a pretty good position and I would strongly encourage people to pursue uh a career in trades right now um man it's hard to find it's hard to find good trades people and they are valuable yes and they they charge a lot because  can Tyler P hey lldd and E when's the last Linus Le development item that actually went
through that's a good question uh wow I don't know yeah it's been a long time actually this isn't something I've like tracked and and to be clear uh lonus Le development was more specifically like a if lonus asked for something we do it era lonus still ask for things um it's just more of a conversation now and sometimes we won't do it for various reasons uh but it doesn't mean we're just automatically not doing things that lus suggests we still do tons of things that lus suggests we might not do it
exactly at that time or we might not do it exactly in that way um but yeah the reason why I refer to it as lonus Le development is because all choices on what to work on and when were effectively going coming from from Linus um and that wasn't working for a variety of reasons that's a wish throw it's not it's not really his fault cuz he wasn't working with the team he didn't see the things that we need to be working on he didn't see a lot of the stuff he wasn't directly in that um so there there's no
way that it would have been possible for it to be accurate and as I've said in the past multiple times it's more on me I should have taken it over sooner but I'm happy that I did take it over eventually Anonymous asks why do you guys think these companies are so focused on dedicated gaming devices like steam deck Ali claw Etc when phones and tablets are becoming powerful enough to run good games it's a different class and you can go kind of yeah oh yeah phones are going to get better and
better and better it's like yeah so so are those right and the fact that we can play you know AAA what used to be desktop class games on a portable handheld device now is is pretty incredible and it's going to be a long time before phones are going to catch up or enough and by that time yeah we'll probably get another generation of consoles which is going to mean another generation of game developers pushing the boundaries in terms of graphical Fidelity I I I I I do think that it's a
valid it's a valid in between piece and I think that it's going to see a bit of a I think it's going to continue to see a bit of a Renaissance I mean Microsoft is rumored to be working on a portable Xbox uh I think Sony is rumored to be working on like a like a not PlayStation portal like actual new handheld so Nintendo switch 2 is supposed to be basically switch to it's supposed to be another hybrid portable handheld I'm I'm very excited for for gaming portability I mean the original Nvidia Shield which
was that little Android clamshell portable gaming handheld was like reinvigorated um my love of gaming because I had just had a kid and I had no way to play games cuz I was never able to sit at my desk and it allowed me to stream like Tomb Raider and stuff  Seth asks did lonus ever daily Drive the OnePlus open uh no I really wanted to and Belle took it home after or rather took it to a trade show after the short circuit and I was like yo I had wanted to take it to the trade show and he was
like well uh I have it and I was like okay well can I get it from you after he goes yeah and I got it back and already from having been used for like a week or two the hinge didn't open all the way and I was like okay well so much for that is Luke gone am I on my own oh yes I think he did Luke you stopped moving and you're you're cardboard stand in fell over uh I I sorry I accidentally kicked it uh David T says why did MSI repossess the laptops from your gaming Min minivan you mentioned that in
passing in a May 8th live stream I I don't know I think they might have been engineering samples so they might have just needed to go back and like it's not like the sponsorship dollars still didn't come through and you know if we don't keep the hardware from a sponsored project like whatever we we we we got paid we paid our staff everything's everything's hunky dory but it means that there aren't actually computers in there right now and I've been putting off putting new ones in because I want
to make a video about it so my poor kids just are like yo dad these screens uh don't do anything um I'm an okay parent uh Matt C says uh speaking of security Theater what's the most annoying it rule you've ever dealt with mine is not being able to access a site from mobile Safari when Safari on on M series Mac is fine yeah that is pretty irritating I don't know if I can think of anything personally but Luke can you think of something dude password rules oh my goodness I I recently had to create an
account at a financial institution I will not obviously name which one uh and they limit your password to 20 characters maximum 20 characters and I think they had a minimum as well and then they had some requirements of what symbols you could use and they're like you have to use a symbol but then the symbol that I chose to use they're like well that one doesn't like we we actually don't recognize that as a character so we're not even going to allow you to set a password with that symbol in it let
alone not count it towards the minimum symbol required count so they like they they didn't allow a bunch of characters and then they maximize the amount of characters that you could use and I'm just like dude this is this is important Financial accounts like you can't you actually can't just oh man yeah I don't know password rules Drive me nuts constantly wow Dan editorializing in the replies foldables are dumb anyway I mean the cases are pretty bad so Ryan G definitely has a point but uh wow what
am I I'm not a news reporter wow Dan um yaser K says Hey dlll lonus when did you first realized that you were going to be held to a higher standard than most people deal with was there a moment that made you think I'm kind of famous thanks I don't  um there have been lots of little things that I've kind of looked at and I've gone like really um but I think part of the reason that I get held to such a sometimes um ridiculous standard is that we've always been very transparent we've
always publicly held ourselves to very high standards so I think I've kind of created this for myself because people can I I don't think it's a function of being famous like Leonardo DiCaprio is super famous and no one seems to actually care that you know he hangs around with women who are you know several decades younger than him even though that's like you know a behavior that would be weird if your dad did it when you brought your friends over you know and like I'm not saying he's a
pedophile um like as far as I can tell everyone's you know legal age of consent and all of that but it's just like being famous doesn't necessarily mean that you're held to some kind of high moral standard or whatever there's there's an awful lot of like haha you you know like I just yeah I don't I don't I don't I don't really know I don't really know I don't really know what I see in in some cases with with famous people where uh not only are they not held to a higher standard they're actually held to a
significantly lower standard like them them acting like an idiot in whatever way will be aggressively defended by their fan base it's like funny and endearing or something yeah yeah like it's it's it's weird like they they almost are allowed to get away with being more of a bad person because they're lemon here completely the other way Cohen lemon here is like yeah every rock and roll star ever with drugs like if if some if some nobody has you know possession of of whatever then oh yeah they should get
like the beat out of them by the police and they should go to jail but if a famous person you know throws a party with like where the you know they bake bread with cocaine instead of flour it's like that's hilarious right like it's just yeah I don't know  yeah uh Joseph A say says hi LL and D I'm ring data through conduit to a barn roughly 100 Freedom Units away should I use cat 6 or Fiber 100 ft oh man no I'd go go go cat 6A go cat 6A cat 6A is boss tier it's good uh jakeen how much do I need to
spend to make lonus rub his head and Pat his belly at the same time I mean you spent $194 on the store I'd say that's   do it's funny cuz I've done it the other way before so I was all ready to Pat my  belly like that one I can do no problem you've got that down pretty good but this one took me a second any who there you go you got it Adam K hi DL and DL digital Luke L do you have any advice for someone really interested in playing badminton in a region where Community badminton groups
are virtually non-existent thanks no it sucks it's one of those sports that can only be as big as the facilities to accommodate it I know that a lot of groups here will try to rent out like School gyms and stuff off hours um and that's something that's also pretty common over in Asia from what I've seen But if those groups don't exist in your area man it's it's it's tough to get something going it really is uh M Happy Days everyone I barely get to catch you all live as someone in the
trades are there any specific Technologies like remote operation or autonomous operation of heavy equipment that excite you I mean I think we had a similar question a little while ago and like autonomous farming with super precise like geolocation and stuff man that is that is super super cool stuff uh William C says farming stuff wow thanks for contributing Luke farming Tech I find to be you're going you're going to interrupt for that I like farming stuffing things I play I
play I Like Trains um yeah anyways William C asks lus since your note 9 no longer gets security updates yeah it's pretty bad that I use this are you looking for a new phone I mean yeah I was and then you guys freaking saddled me with the wing I that was a real that I was I was having a conversation with y'all and you MD on me um are you looking for new yes I wanted it to be the fair phone 5 but that thing ended up totally sucking uh so no I'm not waiting for anything in particular I'm waiting
for not being lazy and just getting a phone I I probably will just go for another note something um or whatever the ultra whatever I I I I don't use the stylus often but I do like it so I'll probably just go with a Samsung phone with a stylus I kind of want to daily a pixel though kind of tempted Anonymous says dlll how do you handle working with team members who disagree with the chosen solution and don't put in as much effort since it's not their solution I'm a tech lead and I 
commit I mean it happens all the time um what I what I talk about is that you know as as compan companies grow you don't have to agree with every decision that the company does but you do have to kind of like do your job um and if you disagree with enough of them consistently enough over time and it never changes and you're voicing your opinion and it never changes uh maybe it's potentially time for for you to move on I guess you're the manager in this situation so maybe it's time for
them to move on um if they're consistently underperforming all the time because they don't appreciate company Direction that's a performance metric that you can talk to them about and potentially move them on because of that but like I don't know you got to do your job sometimes you don't fully agree with all of what that is but I mean that can be okay F fully agreeing with everything that anyone else says is like never going to be a thing you're never going to be in 100% agreeance with anybody um 
perfect I wish we could handshake through digitally that would be fantastic John M says I work in corporate Audio Visual and produce a lot of Live Events I wanted to ask what your biggest challenges were making live Style videos like PC or no PC thank you for the great work wear oh man PC or no PC I'd say the biggest challenge with that one was that I asked one thing about the set I wasn't super particular about it I asked for one thing I asked that the jib shot which I knew was going to
be a thing not look like crap so we couldn't just see that we were in an empty warehouse and I got there and I was like um I'd say the huge number of moving Parts because that's how things like that get overlooked because everyone has so much on their plate and time is so limited that it can be a real challenge to get all the details right um like at the roast the audience wasn't miked that destroyed of the V they loved it they were eating it up the house was it was it was such a great
atmosphere and the vaud on YouTube just doesn't capture it and you can see in the comments people like well these jokes suck they're so flat the audience isn't even laughing at all they were they were freaking loving it it was a great atmosphere um and it just little details little details are the hardest part of the of the kinds of things Tyler V says hey Luke Luke and Luke I see you talk about turning down potential opportunities for massive profits what is something massively profitable that
you've had to turn down recently something other than the VPN we talked  week I don't think my team runs into this as often but I do am I muted no no I don't think my team runs into this as often the VPN is by far the best example that we have um I I think our best example of this would be that we we tend to always work on like the hardest stuff possible um because we think it is I don't know more interesting more uh who knows honorable I have no idea we we tend to to reach for like not
not just the the highest fruit but like H can we climb a mountain to get to a tree that's taller to grab the fruit at the top of that one instead um that that t tends to be more the stuff that my team ends up working on um not so much a business opportunity things I think I think really the only really major definitely hugely profitable business opportunity that we could have gone after is the VPN there's been other offers from companies to like um make video stuff for them um or or do
custom things like that but I I don't know that they would be hugely  yeah teimo says hey lld how can one learn to master live storytelling and the Art of recounting personal experiences in an engaging way how do you and  entertainingly well ludwick's not here so I can't answer for him but I think for me I I kind of alluded to this on the um on the yard podcast when I was on it I think that one of the things that content creators have in common generally is a degree of narcissism I'm
not saying that that means that every single you Uber has narcissistic personality disorder um like anything it's a spectrum right and I do think that disordered or not there's a certain degree of innate interest in on self and assumption that other people should care about oneself that has to be there for you to um for you to even practice the art of telling personal stories recounting personal thoughts and personal experiences for an audience you because otherwise if you
didn't think that people should want to hear it and should want to know about you then you wouldn't push yourself to to take those opportunities when a crowd is gathered to talk about yourself and talk about things that have happened to you um and I don't think that you would get good at it and it's like anything for me I I didn't start out being good at storytelling or anything like that everyone's born knowing nothing but it's something that for whatever reason I am compelled to
practice you know when there's a conversation my brain kind of goes oh yeah it's like that time that I and and and I want I want to tell that story you know some people are more conservative they're more they're more um they're more self-reflective they don't they don't need to tell other people about things but for me it's like like I want to right um so practice is really the  say Luke doesn't need to add anything to that apparently okay Philip p hi Leg Show uh Luke what are your thoughts was
directed just to you sorry no no no no it was for both of us I think well it was me and lwig but he's not here so yeah uh Luke what are your thoughts on cousins of birds the cousins of birds reptiles I myself have a small family three adults four children and eight eggs of crested geckos any tips for starting a business selling them I yeah yeah okay sure go for it Luke I don't know dude uh what I have no idea my mom when I was growing up used to breed and sell beta fish my dad built
this huge wall of cascading fish tanks so that the the water from one fish tank would kind of like flow into the next one and all this other kind of stuff it was all crazy and cool and he did a good job with it um and she used to sell them and I think it was mostly like like Web 2.0 internet orders and stuff back then I don't even fully remember all of it I'd have to talk to both of them about how they did it cuz I was pretty young at that time um but yeah she would breed
and sell beta fish um how exactly that worked I don't know do I have any advice on selling reptiles no not even sort of um and I know basically nothing about them other than whenever I see geckos I think they're neat that's that's pretty much it sorry good effort Luke good effort Hi D I recently turned my side project into a software as a service and getting requests from fans to become Affiliates any thoughts on what makes a successful affiliate program well you're going to get a
pretty biased um version of that from me obviously what makes an affiliate program successful from a from a media standpoint is that it has to have a strong payout it has to have a compelling reason for people to use it um Amazon had that cool like smile thing for a long time where like they donated proceeds or something like that like you've got to you've got to engage with people emotionally to make them want to use your affiliate program um one of the things that we look for is recurring
Revenue so if this is a if this is a software as a service product where your revenue is recurring we expect our referrals to be recurring um but hey you may not find that that's the most successful thing for your side and you may find that it's better to to cut off the you know leech influencers or whatever who promote your product but um yeah that's something that you're going to have to kind of solve for yourself we have not figured out how to build a successful affiliate program for LTT
store even though that's something that we have talked about and something that we would like to explore in the future Brandon B hi DL I'm a woman working in the male-dominated AV industry in a technical director/ supervisor role what advice do you give female managers who receive push back  man I feel like this is a conversation that I've had so many times to such frustrating ends um with my wife I mean we've talked about this on on the W show I think pretty recently so I'm not going
to talk about it for too long but just the way that people will talk past her to me you know even if she's the one that is s has sent every email leading up to this inperson meeting even if she's the one that is answering every one of their questions like their laser locked eye contact with me instead of talking to her and um you know the cold hard truth is people are going to be like that and all you can really do is do your best and kick ass and you know what those people
right um I'm sorry I'm sorry that I don't have like a a solution for you I mean frankly if I did I'd be mansplaining it anyway I suppose so like I don't know I don't know what but but for real you know I I my my general approach has all to business because I'm not that good at like shmoozing and I always get a kick out of conspiracy theories about how I like am in bed with you know Executives at every company in bed figuratively right um and I have I'm doing all these like back
room deals man I don't I don't I don't deals with any I don't even like talking to people um you guys are the exception and I think it's it's mostly tolerable because you're basically a camera like I'm not actually the kind of person who craves um like a ton of human interaction I got into this because I liked to play video games by myself in my basement right so let's be let's be uh let's be real here um so sorry where was I going where was I going with this right right right
right right so my philosophy has always been like I'm just going to let the quality of the work speak for itself and if you need something from me because that looks good to you then you'll figure it out you'll come to me and we'll do business and if you can't get over that well then you right what do I care I'll do business with someone else and I'm doing okay but you know hey look I obviously am speaking from a very privileged position here right like you're already talking about these
challenges that you're receiving um but I really do believe the only thing you can do is just kick ass just keep doing it you're clearly doing all right sounds like they are yeah but just keep going yeah exactly yeah Chase K says Hey dll for the smaller L I'm starting to play ano 1800 I keep losing around the Artisan stage any tips on getting past it or better setups okay so you definitely got to figure out uh the efficiency of your production if you don't figure out how to boost the
production of your farms and how to start using um uh trade unions uh with their like boosting items and and laying out your industry efficiently so that all of your all of your raw goods are able to be transported uh quickly and efficiently um you're going to have a really really hard time getting past that you've also got to figure out inter island trade routes so I'd say those are the main things to focus on also small backpack when I have a sample that I'm supposed
to be wear testing in Taiwan but I might have forgotten it in my office and I don't don't know if I have it with me but I I'm I'm going to get all my stuff moved over soon and hopefully soonish Mason G Wan Stars it's a new one I'm struggling at work with supervisors not following company guidelines and personal boundaries emailing at 11: p.m. sharing personal information with other employees any advice this is a tough one and it's funny because like we take these kinds of guidelines extreme and
laws many cases laws uh whether they're guidelines or whether they're laws we take these kinds of things very seriously here um and we recognize that there's enormous you know liability and so I think a lot of the time you guys hear a very employer perspective from me because if we put a toe out of line the liability to our company and to me personally is actually enormous but we live in a place where employee protection regulations are extremely strong and that's not the case everywhere and we also
uh work in an environment full of people who could just get a job somewhere else and be making great money somewhere else if they felt like it we have an extremely skilled team and not everybody is in such a privileged position to be in demand um the way that a lot of members of our team really are so you might be in a position where speaking out um is is not something that is covered or protected and finding new employment in your field could be extremely challenging for you and it's
something that honestly I don't I don't have a ton of experience with I mean obviously you know having conversations starting with an I feel statement like these are things you'll find in any guide for how to how to interact with people but if people don't respect your  um there's nothing that I or anyone can do to protect you from the potential consequences if they ultimately just decide to just not respect them and I hear horror stories about other workplaces and and the kind of employee
treatment that that takes place there and I just don't really I don't really know how to reconcile how any of that makes sense in in in good faith human  sorry Ryan M how do I get refills for the pen still getting one before knowing uh they take they take standard Parker G2 refills so you can just buy any that they come with a Schmid easylow 9000 medium um but you can just fill it with whatever Parker G2 refill you want they're common archive Anonymous what's your current use of the note 9 UM
daily what do you recommend for Less technical relatives iPhones honestly uh I typically get a new device when support is dropped yeah yeah I really should Robert D asks how's the Tian holding up I just hit two years with my 4S wagon and it's amazing except the software bugs are awful sometimes like it can't list music files on a USB drive or the nav voice nav voice unmutes itself uh mine's not too buggy occasionally It'll like kind of have a little moment and Android auto
connectivity can be kind of a pain in the butt sometimes but overall it's been pretty darn okay except when it's in the shop um like there's a recall for the uh windshield heater or something right now I have to take it in for but it's so  later okay we're so close you guys we're so close um Thornton no we're not doing an episode of me playing badminton no one cares about that but thank you for the suggestion Liam B good ey from Australia when do you expect proper neural
interfaces to be a thing I have no idea but they sound cool Tanner lldd as someone involved in North American manufacturing what's the thoughts on insuring some manufacturing even if it understandably increases cost in theory it's great in practice um even the most ethically minded consumers seem to really struggle to maintain that when their ethics are reflected in an increased cost at the till um like I was blown away by there's almost no maintenance of that whatsoever
statistically I was blown away by the number of Americans who use shien as their primary source of clothing like I just look at it and I'm like well this is trash how about no like navigate somewhere else but fast fashion man it's it's a killer Chris L since we all seem to generally agree that this timeline has gone to hell what year or event was the turning point for you interested to hear all of your opinions all right well why don't we let Dan go first cuz he seems to be too relaxed now that he's gotten
everything done I'm still going through it I'm I'm just I'm teasing I'm teasing um let me think I think it was probably the release of uh the 30 series we've been seeing so many really really good like price to Performance increases from the the GPU market and then it just started to fall off and now since then we're moving into other fields like Ai and things like that and so the consumer space for better and better gpus is kind of becoming boring and I don't know there's not a lot to
get super excited about  things Luke you want to go next yeah I I I think mine's significantly older than that I think Dan's lines up kind of with like Co um not not exactly but pretty close um oh am I gone no you're still here no okay cool um but there's there's  204 2012 around there where like you know income versus housing started spreading apart in a in a really bad way um suicide rates started going up like a lot a lot of things just started getting bad I don't remember all
the reasons for it I've looked into it before and the reasons made sense but I don't remember what they are um but it was kind of around that era where things started to just kind of get worse for very significant amount of people and it's been continuing to get worse for a lot of those similar people um so you've identified you've identified the second inflection point of the hockey stick um it started a little earlier it started more like in the late '70s to early to mid 80s um and basically that was when
that was when itive pay started to dramatically outpace um median pay that was when housing prices started to dramatically outpace uh increased earning power of the worker um yeah that's that's basically when everything completely in the world went to uh at least in like the Western World you know within our limited sort of worldview um but if I had to have a tech answer I'm going to go with mobile gaming oh yeah I uh I misinterpreted the the question no both both answers are
great very much agree with lonus yeah that was that was bad romics was not good um Jeffrey lonus are you still enjoying your large Chinese TV in your theater do you think TVs above 120 in will be under "$8,000 anytime soon I love my 150 in" projector but would totally swap for better black levels no I don't think that's coming anytime soon even that "$1,000 TV turns out the MSRP in North" America is going to be like "$3,000 and it doesn't cost that much to" transport it across the ocean so I don't
know I don't know what tcl's smoking over there um I think they recognize that consumers over here will be willing to pay a lot more for it and they're just basically taking advantage of that so yeah yeah can't can't blame them it's their technology if you don't like it then uh don't buy it I guess but um no time soon there's a lot of logistical challenges around products that big already and going bigger is not going to reach that sort of commodity pricing in the near future I don't
think and I think is that it we will see you again next week same bad time same bad Channel bye with a big delay oh my god look to go I'm still there get me out of here sorry Luke
