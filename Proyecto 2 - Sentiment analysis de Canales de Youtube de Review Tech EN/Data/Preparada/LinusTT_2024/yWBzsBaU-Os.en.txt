many people claim to be gaming on a potato but very few have the spuds to actually do it and I know what you guys are thinking lonus it's easy you just Mash a little bitty raspberry pie into a and boom it's done but come on that's small fries we want the full starch experience friends I'm talking a full Windows PC in one of these and since it's a plant well it's going to need be watered which oh God we're liquid cooling it that's just the beginning when we're done this potato is going to
play balers Gate 3 cyberpunk Halo infinite and sponsor Segway simulator 2000 oh I love that game almost as much as I love thorum their rings and watches are made from unique materials like gibian meteorite and ethical naturally shed antlers check them out at the link below and use code LT for 20% off our biggest problem for this project ironically is that potatoes are very small so initially we set out to find bigger potatoes but in spite of some promising leads finding one big enough
to fit a full fat gaming system was a fruitless Endeavor get it even our hand selected super spuds are much smaller than a standard Mini ITX motherboard so we turned our attention to finding a smaller computer and that we did meet the minis forum M 680 it's got eight zen3 plus cores that turbo up to 4.7 GHz and Radeon 6 ADM rdna 3 Graphics it's shockingly powerful for such a small package the whole package is just 10 Pringles tall we're going to have a link below if you want to pick up one of your
own of course even at that size it's not small enough for us so we'll be taking it apart with this prototype LT Precision screwdriver complete with bit storage and hybrid ceramic bearing top yes yes you will sign up for a notification at LTD store.com got to love that nice strong magnet I couldn't believe how small this computer was originally we had another mini Forum that is about 14 cm uh both directions and that was small to me but uh when we got this one in I was blown
away I didn't know computers came this small this is Tiny so small actually the power of a gaming PC in the palm of my hand now I've Got The Power of this Cooling solution in the palm of my hand here okay pop that out oh liquid metal on the stock cooling solution after the issues we had with it on custom builds I just never thought this stuff would go mainstream but with the right protective measures like these covers for the surface mount components and these gaskets it seems like manufacturers can
make it work even big ones like Asus and Sony it really does help you get the most out of a small cooling solution of course we apparently will not be using this one because we like playing h on  mode hey there we go oh cool they've got a main board up here and then they've got a daughter board down here that's handling all of the io including the micro SD slot IO is um going to be a challenge huh USB 4 is truly incredible we actually only really need two USB 4S to go in one for power and one that's
going to go to a dongle for everything else now that we've got the whole thing apart I can show you how the two boards go back back together there we go and that's it CPU 32 gigs lpddr5 memory a terabyte of pcie Gen 4 storage and even USB 4 so we could hook up an external GPU to this thing if we really wanted to we don't want to though because we want it all to fit in here so without further Ado let's throw this little guy into the frying pan figuratively of course unless now that we found a computer
small enough we need to to select our potato oh any one of these is fine any of these should do I think there's some that are better C this one she's soft though uh how long have we had these potatoes about a month they're a little old how about this guy that's pretty that's a pretty good he's got a nice Regal shape to him the it kind of looks like you uh never thought I'd be asking this but what's our plan for potato carving my original plan was to slice the potato in half and then just scoop
it out with an ice cream scoop oh yeah exactly all my all my testing okay David's getting a cutting board right now but the way I see it it's not necessary not for a fruit ninja like me damn I actually kind of nailed that this cutting board is much fancier than I expected oh wow cool swag Corsair anyway uh which way do you find its best um there's no method to this radness it's just Madness you'll want to be careful when you get close to the edges sometimes it can kind of just jump and
then rip some skin off but I see the potato or of my hand uh yes who would have thought a potato has this much juice speaking of now that we've worked out size our next problem is that potatoes are well food uh you know boil them mash them stick them in a stew however you skin them they're not an ideal environment for computer or any electronics for that matter how are we  uh pretty good good news uh reaching the iio is not going to be an issue I'm up yeah like the iio is going like right to
the edge oh wow we chose kind of the perfect potato I couldn't help noticing then that I'm hollowing this out too much maybe airflow baby sure for a water cooled system sure do we have a fan why would you need a fan you're water cooling I keep getting potato juice in my eye it's good for the skin sure but is it good for your eyes there's an eye of the potato the I of the potato it's the Keen night among you might have noticed that we were just kind of willy-nilly putting this thing in
here to mitigate some of the risk of the juice shorting out any of the components on our board we gave it a a battering like not this like french fries a battering of conformal coating to protect it from dangerous potato juices all while being careful to leave access to any ports or any contact pins that we need for the system to function of course that wasn't the original plan was it no the original plan was to preserve the perfect potato before the shoot I tried dehydrating baking freezing a
vacuum chamber resin a resin vacuum chamber but nothing really worked no matter what I did it would rot collapse or just look disgusting I see that uh so instead we decided we're just going to YOLO it do it all on Set For Better or For Worse uh you're welcome yeah I'd say that's for better is this even safe let  bite any who another part of the original plan was to transplant the entire cooling system from the mini Forum just to make our jobs a little bit easier but that's dead too huh yeah it
turns out problem number three potatoes aren't very good for cooling in fact they're kind of good at insulating so we had Justin our resident mad scientist fabricate this absolutely gorgeous water block did an amazing job it look so good even like the design on the top I don't know if that was intentional but it looked really good the coal plate is machined from Billet copper and then the rest is resin 3D printed now I'm told I'm not allowed to take it apart for you guys since the O-ring is kind of fragile
but we've got a render and you guys can actually find the plans for this in the video description if you ever need to this for some reason uh we ended up having to reinforce the seal with some CLA to prevent leakage but the rest of the parts are recycled from our laptop water cooling Adventure don't watch that video right now if you have a weak stomach though or if you want to witness history because if you want that you're going to have to watch this video yeah okay Moment of Truth the blocks
on it fits perfect it actually does fit really really well all we've got to do is carve out some IO you'll have to let us know in the comments is it game t or put G now David question for you do we need to get at any of the other IO or is this side enough that's all we need we can power it through this dongle we can do up to 90 Watts okay to this let's give it a shot first boot that's my computer hey don't mock my computer no I love it from my research I don't think anyone has actually built a gaming
potato no I didn't manage to find one either so world's first baby which is kind of shocking with how many times it's been Meed y I was expecting to find like a hundred different YouTube videos about it and then there's basically homeless who's going to just do it way better than us you can't do better than this don't challenge him no no no you can plug it yeah you can plug it right into the dungle or I can plug it right into the potato okay I have proper peripherals but for this part we'll use
these proper peripherals oh God how do we power it on I guess is there just there's a light there is a power switch and there should be a light or there wasn't the case okay there's a light we know we don't have the water cooling hooked up yet but hopefully we can at least just get a post out of it how long does this thing take to post it doesn't take that long you're to come on turn up okay it's off that's good o it's really hot it's really hot that's a good sign though right uh I mean yeah but also we
didn't get an output let's get the water cooling hooked up outside of the potato then yes real quick real quick we've gone with a dual 40 mm radiator which for this kind of thermal load should be enough to run completely passively and then this adorable little pump from the water cooled laptop setup oh there's water all over the board what happened it leaked fudge uh glass half full you guys get to see the inside of the block now I mean theoretically this board's conformal coated so that's a
good point my bigger concern is just that we didn't get an HDMI output from this thing that's fair our contact with the Dy is actually not great it's probably fine just need to put some more thermal compound on here uh let's just test it without it being installed and  happens oh my god did it work okay makes that that's a sensible picture by the way we're kind of bringing it back but in a more everyday wearable form H coming soon to LTT store I'm going to find the leak I'm going to stamp it out
that's that's how you stop a leak you just stop leaking oh snap literal oh no yeah how long does it take to resin print a new top as we're about to find out while we're waiting for our new block to print let's talk about the advantages of resin printing you can do more complex shapes with higher detail it's low cost uh as well as much faster than Machining from acrylic and it's just watertight which is kind of important when we're making a water block so it's a much better choice than
fdm printing this is going to take about 40 minutes that's pretty fast once we're through that we're going to wash it and cure it uh and we're going to get back to it and hopefully finish this today the downside to resin printing as we experienced it can be brittle depending on the resin you use We Now using tough resin which should give us a little more Linus proofness and the other big downside is just it's a mess and there's fumes it can be kind of annoying when you're done a print just dealing with
the leftover resin getting it back and you know this watertight could you 3D print some water cooling tubes are we making a  now the top is not the same as the previous one that was printed oh I see it doesn't have the divider in the middle which quite honestly is not going to make a difference fantastic what could go wrong yall ready for this uh these holes are really small are you guys aware of that uh yeah it's look the blocks not well that's why it cracked are you aware of that I wasn't
aware of that oh here look uh Justin flew pretty close to the Sun on the size of these holes and you can see that's actually probably what caused the cracking we did a rush cure job so the resin's still a little malleable oh well that's good it's good this is going to go it's going to go it's a goer not a shower without it being cracked which is a plus time to mount this bad boy now just a gosh darn second here it's not as thick as the old one and the screws are too tall we can fix that we
will never be able to unscrew and rescrew them though cuz this will mangle the threads oh hey and we've got much better contact with the Dy this time I wonder if those previous screws were sticking through a little bit as well oh maybe there it is that's what I'm talking about looks like cheese I want to eat it it's an appropriate topping for a potato certainly oh man I wish I had the foresight what to make a block out of cheese can formal coating cool or what the fact that we just spilled water all
over this board and here we are like half an hour later just using it why doesn't everything have conformal coating on it cuz it's expensive it adds another step and it's more difficult to repair after the fact oh that makes sense so there are reasons I'm just start covering everything I own in formal coating do you have like a spitt problem is there a reason really excited when I game is there a reason your electronics get wet oh no way I think we're good tough resin sure well it's working oh we need to
make a little cutout for the tubes oh yeah we need quite the cutout for the tubes oh balls so David do you want to eyeball this sure so right about yeah  okay he looks like he's got braces who knew a potato case could be so modular man water cooling my pumpkin next Halloween uh did we have any thoughts for how to like seal up our case like what about hot glue would hot glue H hot glue is worse hot glue is worse all right oh so you've actually put I've tried measurable R&amp;D into this
everything to try and make potatoes happen if you can pull on the tubes a little bit just to yeah oh boy oh yeah there we there oh yeah there oh there we go okay a little more oh yeah oh yeah oh buddy I mean oh spoty oh spoty that's a filthy joke what do you expect it came out of the ground oh we need power button oh right no no that's okay I got a solution for that okay now you're speaking my my language power button okay my jwi so this maybe I could cut a little spot for it after after
first let's make sure this thing works  who all that's left then is to seal up our potato oh uh oh totally fine yeah yeah hold on hold on uh see Advanced repair no we we got to windows before I bet this just boots this probably just boots time to seal the deal the only thing we're missing is some peripherals oh wow that worked really well that immediately was like yo you're not taking this apart anymore okay potato PC okay okay does it need uh I think we need a little stand so it doesn't roll
around some potato wedges uh potato wedges I get it what about okay our potato fry monitor bezel oh my goodness wow David you um you made that hash brown desk mat  oh and what better Mouse to use than a potato Mouse did you guys get a Makey Makey or something no it's just it's just a mouse they took the insides out I conformal coed it and it it works I think I can even hear the clicks yep yeah there it is surprisingly this does appear to be tracking serviceably hold on I'm going
to launch a game let's play some uh hold on the click is a little bit of a challenge I'm launching Halo infinite okay here we go the mouse works oh my God it actually kind of works ahh and no self-respecting gamer can possibly complete their setup without RGB potato powered RGB you've got one LED lit yeah r g b was there not enough current to light more than one LED so I actually have a battery powering it currently oh it's cheating it was really cool when it first was put together you're lucky I
didn't have time to make the potato keyboard the mouse is surprisingly somewhat usable what do you think of the hash brown desk pad uh it's really it's kind of unpleasant and greasy but LTT store when okay what how's our CPU doing uh we're at 50° right now that's definitely warmer than we got when we first tested the system okay but we wasn't in a potato so change of plans we're going with doom maternal the goal one kill I was pretty impressed with the performance I was getting out of this
thing I was a little bit weired and doomed cuz I was only getting 25 frames and I realized raate tracing was on you know what 25 frames with r tracing pretty good oh man my like my arm muscles from how hard it is to push on the click I am getting 45 55 frames per second right click get up on oh did I get him I think you did oh no you didn't no I didn't hold on right click am I oh I'm not not on the right uh oh yeah yeah yeah I got Glory kill Glory kill here we go here we
go yes potato gaming boys med pack med pack oh my my mous fell apart hold on I got this I can't click it's going toart no I can't click this has got to be top 10 stupidest things we've ever done no  three I'm so happy I got to be here for this the mats come to apart oh no oh W everything okay but like can we appreciate for a moment how amazing this is with root access we're managing some seriously impressive hash power which of us is responsible for that line I think it was a team team thing sorry it was
Big Potato that forced us to put that in there as much of a meme as this project was it is a amazing guys what you can do with a tiny Apu powered PC these days and I really hope that even if this wasn't the most practical application of this this gets your tractor rolling coming up with cool ideas for fitting powerful computers in places that they have no right to be like in this the world's first peelable case and in this segue to our sponsor if you guys enjoyed this if you like janky dumb but
