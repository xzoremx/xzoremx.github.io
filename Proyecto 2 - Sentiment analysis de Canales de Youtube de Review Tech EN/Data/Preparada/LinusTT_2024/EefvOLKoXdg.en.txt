what is up everyone and welcome to the W show we've got a great show lined up for  oh okay there's one bit of bad news we're going to talk about this uh real estate dystopia very cool algorithmic pricing means uh cost of living basically go up but this time it's  huh I will be eating some Humble Pie today we got hacked earlier this week uh control of our Twitter account was lost and it turned out it was my fault fortunately Humble Pie you get pie out of it is delicious yeah so we're going
to be talking about exactly what happened and uh I'm going to be eating crow no pie pie not not Crow but humble C what else we got I went to Defcon and it was super cool and we're going to talk about that cuz it's like actually cool and interesting that's the badge yeah this badge is crazy it has a Game Boy emulator on it  uh you know we were sitting here for 45 minutes anduk goog team pixel program changed to require influencers to be biased towards Google I didn't think you
were going to bring up your uh fishing I thought you were going to avoid it so that was going to be one of my topics no I'm not avoiding it I'm eating it head on I encourage people to come out and talk about being exploited being hacked and being open about it so the only thing that I can do to salvage any kind of scrap of Pride at this point is practice what I preach and go into it completely kimono open here's everything that happened yeah all right so here   the show is brought to you today by
Corsair Squarespace Ridge and of course our chair partner secret lab why don't we jump right into our headline topic for today which I forget what it is what was it again you getting fished Disney Disney we didn't even have that as a headlight topic right we got to jump right into that this is crazy this is not okay A 42-year-old woman died after an allergic reaction eating at a restaurant at Disney World Resorts Disney Springs in October 2023 uh she was highly allergic to Dairy
and nuts the restaurant was chosen because they advertise the accommodation of persons with food allergies as a top priority okay a lawsuit was then filed in February of 2024 by her husband for damages of more than "$50,000 um this was a wrongful death" suit now okay that kind of makes sense because if you say hey like I'm allergic to this and they're like hey no problem we got you there are there is some fine print I think many menus will actually have a disclaimer where even if the
server says Hey like yeah sure there's no there's no nuts in that there's always the chance of these things that this chance of cross contamination however um from the article that I read on this seemed to suggest so take this for what it is seemed to suggest that there was a substantial amount of what she was allergic to in the dish got it okay so this is where things go completely off the rails and is what pushed this to the top of our subreddit earlier this week Disney filed a motion
in May alleging that the husband okay okay so not not the woman who died the husband accepted a forced arbitration agreement when signing up for Disney  2019 they also seem to be under the impression that they agreed to an arbitration Clause when purchasing tickets to Disney World the husband's legal team argues that that the Disney terms were made effectively invisible Disney put the link to its terms of use within another link on the agreement page when you sign up for Disney plus and neither of these
agreements were necessary they were never forced to read them to eat at the restaurant because get this you don't need to buy  Springs this is wild oh yeah this reminds me of who wasian as hell who who was it who uh hold on I'm going to look it up I'm going to look it up the soft drink Hitman thing yep yep yep I'm going to  um yeah yeah the Coke the Coke death squads okay where their defense their defense for this was not we didn't we didn't contract kill people that was not the defense the defense
was here in the US you cannot pursue us for this because it happened outside of your jurisdiction yeah I mean I thought the whole Ula thing was kind of settled where they're they're in super enfor where they're in a where they're in this gray area where like as long as everything makes sense within all of the other laws that exist for all the good reasons that they exist then yeah you are effectively agreeing not to use the I don't know um team viewer for terrorism or you know
whatever else the case may be right like there there are certain things within an end user license agreement that do make sense because they're for the protection of intellectual property holders uh for the protection of the general public they're for the greater good and they're they're things that you would kind of expect however for me to agree not just to a forced arbit ation Clause over some issue that I had with the Disney plus service because that I could see if somebody were to say for example watch
some show on Disney plus and they were to get inspired to shoot John lennin who knows right if if if Lennon's if Yoko Ono okay we're getting a little off the rails here but if Yoko Ono comes after Disney and goes okay you're liable for the shooting of my husband um I well wait cuz did she sign up for Disney plus the the point is if you're if you are a user of the service and the issue that you have with the service is related to the service then okay no problem but if oh man I'm trying to No
I'm trying to come up with a parallel here because this is mind-blowing okay take our what no let's take our company okay okay uh let's say for example that you sign up for float plane okay okay so that's our that's our video streaming service where you can get early access to some of our videos uh including scrapyard Wars uh you can also get extras for some of our videos including scrapyard Wars I'm not saying you should sign up for float plan I'm just saying it's got good stuff uh but let's say as
part of our as part of our uh agreement you know we've got okay yeah there's a there's a forced arbitration Clause because if for whatever reason um uh there's a billing error okay uh and you say I I was it it put undue mental strain on me that uh I was double build that one month because of an administrative error and I'm seeking "$50,000 in pain and suffering damages or" whatever else we B we basically are going like look our entire agreement with you our entire agreement with you
is over like tens of dollars um uh this is going to go to arbitration we you wave your ability to like make a file a super no not super but basically a nonsense law suit like I can understand that protection being in place I actually don't know that we have a forced arbitration Clause do we do you even know I don't think so I don't know well anyway ter the point is let's say you sign up for float plane okay so and let's say we have this clause for you know maybe maybe some kind of reasonable
reason but then you go to you go to LTX you go to a whale land okay and and we have we have a gigantic Elijah head that is suspended from the ceiling okay because we think that's funny as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] for some reason I mean it would be right it would be like a giant Elijah head it would be pretty funny oh man what if you had a whack-a-mole game and it was Elijah wearing helmets thank you but this very off topic yeah I like it though okay so we have an Elijah wacka game
okay and you like hit yourself in the face with well no cuz that's on you you get stuck in the machine you get a staff an LTT staff uh tells you to go inside the machine and and you get you get Elijah whacked to death you get  whack to imagine so far off the rails like if you never if you never signed a liability release to to ride the Elijah Wacker wait this is starting to get a little weird um the point is that if you never signed a release what we just do a direct thing you ate you ate food there
whatever it doesn't matter the point is if you ever if you never signed a specific release for that if you if you never consented to anything to do what does your agreement even though it's the same organization actually it isn't cuz float plan's not even the same entity yeah it doesn't matter the point is this this is insane yes this is completely insane and honestly I think I think you and I have had this conversation where like I remember talking to you about this and I
was just like yeah you know what the legal system needs it needs like a like a common sense filter we we where there's like an intervention layer that basically looks at something and goes hey proactively B DET you know what maybe maybe the law doesn't account for this but we need to get some legislation fast-tracked to deal with this because this obviously makes no sense like this is such a bad phase argument that I don't know I don't know how Disney's lawyers can sleep at night
yeah yeah absolutely I mean we we've had convers when we were when we were doing the legal agreements for Flo plane and a couple other things that we have um we did have conversations because the external contractor legal team that we had handed us like the most legal thing on the planet and I remember this was many years ago but I remember you and I looking at it and being like this just sucks cuz it's it's like impossible to tell what they're trying to say so we had to get them to do multiple rounds of
like simple this down make it easier to understand and even then just to be completely honest ours isn't the best I've ever seen I've seen some that are like very easy to understand really really well laid out but you have to work with lawyers to get it there and they don't want to do that they want it to be difficult to understand because then it stands up legally like more which is annoying I hate that so there's a few things here so alt ochres in float plane chat says that's what judges are
supposed to do but that's not actually true judges are in charge of sentencing and they can interpret the law but they don't get to look at the letter of the law and go I don't like that law it doesn't make any sense if there is a is a a a basis if there's an argument that has a a strong basis in law they can't ignore it right like that that's that's not the judge's role it's it's legislators who create laws judges just interpret them um anything about that process Mr VY says term says it covers
any disputes with the Walt Disney Company and that may be true what I'm saying is that that's crazy um there is another Point here and this is a really good one from papoa that says Disney doesn't run that restaurant either okay so I don't actually know if that's true but it's a really interesting point because here's my problem with that when you license your name you are you are you are collecting money you are you are collecting revenue for granting the trust that is associated with your name
because otherwise the name being on the restaurant wouldn't have any value I'm eating at it because I trust Boston pizza or Subway or what whatever here's a question on on that topic you just mentioned Subway Subway is a franchise system so if eat at Subway and you get don't know czy F poison or you could sue for's just imagine there's something could do you sue the franchise owner of that building or do you sue Subway so what I I I don't I don't know the specific answer for Subway what I
suspect is that there are various agreements depending on who you are franchising from and depending what exactly the agreement is there it also probably depends on exactly what happened if you followed if you followed process that was handed down to you by the I don't want to call it a parent company they're not a parent by the brand by the brand owner company um and something went wrong anyway then I think that's kind of between you and them but it it might end up being a chain of
lawsuits or because Subway is a bigger better known Target with more money I could see how if someone did encounter uh you know get poisoned at that restaurant say for example I could why they would go after the bigger more obvious Target without necessarily even considering that they're also probably the better protected one um from a legal standpoint because they probably deal with this kind of thing all the time but but my point is that you can't have it both ways you can't hide behind oh well
I mean we weren't even running the restaurant but then also benefit from your name being put on you have to take a you have to take some responsibility for it I mean I remember having this conversation with a YouTuber who famously got into the fast food business a couple of years ago where I basically said yeah I I don't know I good for you um but we've never done anything that you can ingest um and the reason for that is that I am I'm deeply cons I tend to be pretty conservative when it comes
to uh business risk and liability um and I am deeply concerned that compared to almost anything else we do like uh a shirt shirt a back or even water bottles actually I we talked about them a lot before we uh before we move forward with them yeah a backpack you know what's the worst that can go wrong right um compared to anything we do something that someone ingests has well the maximum ceiling for what can go wrong it could it could kill them um and even if I'm not liable even if
I'm not found culpable for it cuz it's like a ghost kitchen or whatever do I want to do I want to think about that no I don't there's there's a lot of decisions we we've made actually including the the flow plane VPN thing where it's like yeah we just don't really want to think about this problem at a certain point like we could we can do it we could have made some type of food product for sure sure there's even want to dude there's food products that I'd be pretty interested in making yeah
like I think you know how much I love breakfast cereal I've I've recommended you make cereal multiple times I know I know but like there's a lot of risk with it dude am I going to be on the factory floor yeah exactly am I going to know if there's toenail clippings in it the factory floor probably won't even be in this country yeah I mean realistically yeah I don't know I mean actually I don't know like grein products right now I think where like where does uh where the uh where does like General Mills
make cereal where where where is General Mills based out of uh headquarters in min all right yeah they make Cheerios in North America okay yeah there you go maybe that's a thing yeah maybe maybe that's a thing maybe that's a thing cuz like I can't imagine shipping like basically air and wheat yeah I just automatically assumed it's a product it's made somewhere else yeah know we have a lot of wheat production but yeah we do we do so that kind of makes sense um anyway in summary I don't like it yeah
yeah all right yeah it's bad right unsubscribe yeah well I mean signed it yeah after you unsubscribe I don't think I don't think that helps I mean I still would anyways sure but I mean you do whatever you want yeah I mean do you really need to watch Mulan that badly probably not there's this whole thing going on with Disney right now where they're losing the like the war for kids attention like the main viewers of Disney right now are millennials not kids really um and like if you if you
look interesting is that why inside out too killed it cuz hold on think about it think about it Riley in the film is what 13 I'm not sure I think she's 13 cuz she's going into high school oh she's either 12 or 13 we're getting there we're getting there we're getting there so if I am at the at the the Leading Edge of Millennials I in my early 40s right now if I had kids at 28 which is was a more normal age back then cuz now people are just not at all and if they do it all it's like well into their 30s
but if I had kids at 28 all of a sudden my kids are around Riley's age dude is this just a bunch of Millennials taking their young families to see it probably textbook case Luke I think so did they case study me because I took my kids to see inside out too you're probably part of it uh they've apparently even been making certain changes to the parks to cater to Millennials more because Millennials without kids are currently the main demographic of people going to Disney
parks and actually spending considerable money while they're there because it's childless Millennials that like can afford it because if you have kids in your Millennial you probably can't afford anything so it's it's really interesting and like they're they're losing a lot of uh uh they're losing a lot of viewership to YouTube effectively yeah I don't remember what her name is but there's some lady that does something on YouTube that is getting like incredible amounts of views for like kid content um sure
someone prob who knows I don't know but like they're Miss Rachel yeah someone in chat immediately knew what I was talking about um but yeah Miss Rachel is her name uh there's a bunch of other kids content that's just like exploding Coco melon stuff like that Disney is not super in the picture right now when it comes to kids content one day ago yeah yeah are you kidding me right now this  content owns it 147 million views in 4 months what even is happening right now yeah yeah she's closing in on a billion
views on this see I find this interesting in like thumbnail logic stuff right she advertises the the time of the video as an element of her thumbnail uhhuh so like oh I want my kid to leave me alone for an hour for 35 minutes yeah that is 50 minutes hilarious 60 Minutes 85 minutes one hour wow and it's just it's it's super safe um dude she collabed with Sesame  me you know what slay Queen she's killing it absolutely yeah all right like I don't know anything about her for
all I know she eats babies um and that's why she makes videos for them but I I don't know her I'm not saying she does do that I'm just saying I I don't know her all I know is that she's actually mind-bogglingly successful point where she's beating Disney seems pretty wholesome on the surface so uh yeah slay she's a teacher apparently yeah not anymore I mean still but I just I don't I just mean not like you know out of school anymore unless she like also still is she y just cuz like she might just that's
crazy I got to tell you I don't really I don't really see I don't really see the I don't I can't tell the difference between like the the kid content that works and the kids content that doesn't work um but I'm yeah I'm sure she's doing great anyway point is uh as far as my understanding goes a oddly high percentage of Miss Rachel's success has been word of mouth oh because all the parents are telling each other like my kid really likes this one also I've like watch some of it it seems really safe I've
overheard conversations of parents telling other parents about this Rachel and then what is she just like less annoying than blippy so maybe yeah I don't know yeah I don't know anything about blippy but someone in flow plane chat I have no idea if this is true someone in flow plane chat said the studio that owns blippy was sold for $3   Harlem Shake plus blippy Luke watch later I don't I don't think we need to a piece of cake to bake a pretty cake yeah man it's crazy cuz like sorry there's a
there's a mashup that's basically the best hold on a second did Disney buy blippy and was part of a $3 billion acquisition by Disney oh Disney bought it cuz they're trying to fight for kids they're trying to get the kid viewership that's crazy oh man wait what they made 17 million in sold for three billion oh man I don't know dude I don't but part of a three billion dollar acquisition by Disney who knows okay okay fair enough all right anyway yeah man I it I remember back in the day like looking at
some like have you seen any of the weird like Russian channels M like Russian like one of the biggest channels in the world is like as far as I can tell just these Russian kids that are being exploited for views on YouTube like it's probably accurate freaking wild D and I'm not saying that cuz they're Russian I'm saying that cuz like there's a lot of kids that are exploting for views on YouTube it's just a thing yeah 100% um yeah anyway I uh I I remember looking at stuff like that as I was sort of like
going through like top channels by country and like I just see these just explosive view counts I'm sitting here going dude we do so much work to reach like a million people because just frankly not that many people care about how many platters are in a hard drive or like whatever the is we're talking about like yeah and I could I so I could just I could just d i could sing songs I taught swim lessons I teaching swim I think that's almost like there's a fishy in the middle and he can't get out no he can't
get out no he can't get out eat the ther dude I can even sing on tune let's go subscribed dude I I would watch it you would get an amount of people that would subscribe and watch dude like so many of these songs are just like um uh uh what's what's the term public domain and stuff like oh yeah totally a lot of kid songs are dude whatever I could I could I could make up songs about Sherlock Holmes who's also public domain okay probably not for kids see this is why this is why I can't handle
it I I think I I think I'd get bored I  nuck Sherlock Holmes in the The Case of the the the stolen Binky or something oh my goodness it was in the power supply mom opened it and then unfortunately Mom isn't around anymore the stories of Hard Times explaining difficult things God I would not tune into to your ch ch good that's fine um all right anyway speaking of fishies in the middle oh the pway uh amazing I got fished yeah basically I think the so okay earlier this week
actually I oh man last weekend so almost almost an entire week ago uh we were having a pool party at our place sorry make his advertise said Luke's channel is the one you get if you leave YouTube  autoplay oh yeah that's way too real momy's an angel now and came back to Earth as Elsa Elsa's building a computer she beat Spider-Man I want to go home and start  immediately okay sorry anyway we were having a pool party and I got an email that basically was like someone logged into your Twitter
account from some IP address in Russia okay so I'm going to I'm going to interject as you go through this what you're referring to as Russia is in fact Russia plus yeah exactly or or as I've taken to calling it Russia plus turkey Russia plus Ukraine wait sorry carry on uh so did you do all of this on your phone so no okay so you got the alert and then you ran into your computer I did okay okay and um basically it dropped me on a page that was like Hey reset your password and it's one of those things where I
like to think I like to think that I am better than this for real I I like to think that I I can do better than this I know better than to click a link in an email you navigate to the site manually and reset your password that way so this is the so John Hammond a uh he's a YouTuber who does hacking and security content um I shared some of the details in the email with him and then he did this like really sick Deep dive so I'm going to kind of go along with your story with with breadcrumbs that John
Hammond has so this is this is uh actually just the screenshot from you so this is the email that was sent to lonus it shows like the location being Russia which for most people is going to instantly click is like something is very wrong it says that uh this account has logged in and then there's a link to secure your account now yep um and then when you clicked that link it would have brought you here yeah here we go yep right here so that's how they got the password and then once I entered it
here's a quick question when you entered it did it say that it was wrong uh I don't think so I don't remember because when John Hammond was poking through the site he found that it will automatically tell you that you entered it wrong because they can't actually check yeah so they tell you it's wrong so that if you did actually enter it wrong you'll hopefully correct it interesting and they're just trying to gather as much info as that's possible that's possible but like the
thing is I they caught me at exactly the wrong moment and that's that's what I was that's what I was about to say cuz like I'd like to think that I'm better than this and smarter than this but I had just lit the grill oh it was hot I was supposed to go and get food to put on it there was kind of no one else to to do that um it was It was kind of ivonne's event and and so I didn't want her to have to to have to cook and so I  Russian thanks um and I was like okay well I just need to
get this locked down nothing else matters other than just like getting it locked down I don't ultimately I think part of it is I I don't really care about the Twitter account I think there's a combination of things going so so uh distracted time pressure from the barbecue y there's the don't care as much about the Twitter account like I've had multiple conversations in the last 6 months about just not bothering with it anymore we don't get a ton of Engagement there compared to um Instagram compared
to Tik Tok um our social team has mostly been redistributed within the company anyway because we're looking at it going what is the ROI here exactly like tweets yeah um and Twitter's been a big part of that because it just it just doesn't move the needle for us we can tweet about a new video and we'll get like four referrals like okay why why why are we even why are we even bothering with this um so the the the last one which I think you mentioned at one point in time publicly was that with
the YouTube hack there was some takeaways and one of the takeaways was act quickly so I I think taking those things combined it was a bit of a perfect storm sorry keep going yeah so so basically the next thing it prompted me for was my uh my TFA which if I thought about it no I don't need my TFA to reset my password because it should just go to my email to reset my password so what started happening was um at some point I I made it to my desktop I don't know if it was immediately that sorry I'm going to I'm
going to timeline us a little bit sure so this is the page um not on your screen sorry this is the page that you would have gotten after you entered it one time um so maybe that is where I went to desktop then cuz I don't remember exactly like it was happening really fast yeah yeah um um there's there's a couple okay actually I'll go into ways that you could have figured out that it was wrong actually once we're done so this page comes up and then the two Factor page comes up
which uh I'll find that you keep talking yeah so basically what I'm I'm not going to get into too many details cuz as you can tell I'm fuzzy on it I was distracted and I was in the middle of something but what started to happen was I started to get real password reset things that I was also doing mixed in with some of the fake stuff yeah and that's where I got really confused because I would I would get I'd get a I'd get a real password reset email but like it wouldn't work but then
that's so confusing because it was clearly still tied to my email by that point that real password reset email was probably the hacker setting things over but those emails are still going to you that makes sense I never really thought about that so long story short I got disc confabulated and I guess it happens to me once every eight years that's the last time I got fished when's the last not eight years ago no the last time the last time I got uh Bamboozled into clicking something on an email was the
last time I lost control of the LTT channel so oh that's really old that's older than that's older than eight years ago hold on a second I'm going to find out when it was closer to like 12 or 13 in the meantime why don't you walk us through this and all the ways that this really it this hurts right because I know very well I know better if you sat me down and told me I'm going to give you like a security test and you asked me hey if you a password rece email should you click the link I'd be like no
yeah no you should navigate to the site manually I've even heard you say this before just to back you up um so first off uh if you really want like oh hold on a second while you're while you're hosting this part you're going to eat Humble Pie I'm going to bring out a special treat for the show this is my Humble Pie uh which was meant to be a surprise for my co-host that I will be that I will be eating Humble Pie on the show today well you announced it earlier in but I also talked about it earlier on
the show now so I'm going to I'm going to get this going a because I deserve this um B because it's the right thing to do um when something like this happens the best defense we have is to own it publicly own it use it as a teachable moment um so that hopefully someone else will avoid a similar attack and uh reason number three cuz I'm actually really hungry and I could really use some pie right now I've actually had kind of a hard week nice nice um you want some pie I assume not
but I should offer it Dan would you like some pie uh yeah sure I thought you were going to just eat the whole thing on Wan show no yours doesn't have to be humble yours can be just blueberry pie blueberry only mind's humbleberry pie I mean I can go leak the the Twitter account again if you want then I can have some pie that would stupid pie malicious pie 3.1 for I fired 31 no unin Employment Insurance P yeah yeah uh if you want the the best public breakdown of this there's a couple but if you want
the best one I would check out the the fishing website that hacked Linus Tech tips video from John hammed that he posted two days ago I'm not going to play it for the stream because you should check that out what I will go through a little bit though is his Twitter thread which is also a good breakdown of events but not as good as his video his video has extra little tidbits including a conversation that John Ham had with the person who did this to you oh nice that's included in
the YouTube video so you should go check that out it's a really tell interesting conversation um John Hammond was was quite diplomatic about it I think in in an attempt to try to get more information but didn't get a ton of information but there's an interesting back and forth that happens including some like it's it you should go watch it it's really good uh Dan I um I went I fell just short of putting this in a blender but I think they heated this up or something cuz it's
falling apart that's okay my mouth does that anyway here's your pie he's not wrong thank you very much um okay so I'm going to go somewhat through this Twitter thread um this we can't see in this screenshot but the the sender email or the the from for email was like x- login.com or something can I interrupt for a moment can I inter project the email you're referring to as xom.com is sorry no um I don't remember exactly when it happened anymore but at some point in the interest of simplifying the UI
mobile mail clients stopped showing the email address by default there's a lot of things about this when did this H when did that happened cuz it was years ago and why yeah I don't know probably space savings like couldn't condensing things um I remember thinking it was stupid back then and I I own part of the stupidity I I hold on let me get my Humble Pie let me get my Humble Pie I own part of the stupidity here but can that not be a thing like why is that a thing that would have definitely helped
because I would have seen that it would have been front and center hold on hold on I'm I'm also going to get that date for you um of the previous the the YouTube One from way back yeah I legally think it was like 12 years ago or 13 years ago um but yeah okay all right carry on carry on Luke's laptop Luke's laptop the from which isn't on screen right now but the from was info@ x-login check.com so that's your first if if you check that um that's your first flag that something's going wrong there's a
couple other things that are wrong with the email but it's going to be really hard for you to be able to tell this is not an exact carpon copy of x's actual we noticed a login it's pretty close but it is different um but if you highlight over this secure your X account now um that's the next kind of somewhat easy tell that this is wrong uh because the link that it went to is this one this u 458272 38. c. sendgrid.net and then it wasn't uh an an x.com domain so that's that's another give give away once we
get to the website itself this page uh there's a few things wrong with this  um old password is a little bit weird um all these Links at the bottom aren't actually links that was a fun one that was figured out is that these don't go anywhere they're just text that you can highlight with your mouse they don't they don't do anything and this like old password new password new password is kind of a weird way of writing this out this is like kind of a weird English way of doing this also
some of the UI design just like doesn't feel 100% right but it's not super obvious it's just thanks for throwing that in for me it's just a little it's a little weird um moving forward uh he like looks into the this is really interesting he looks into the actual code figures out how things actually work finds the API requests different things like that finds that the comments are all in Turkish um does some more poking around where is the login failed here it is okay here's
the next one when your first login fails every login that you do here is not real when it actually works it just offboard you to X's actual website because it's like whatever we have nothing to do with you anymore um but after the first time you put in your data it's going to ask you to do it again and it's going to say that it's wrong at this point in time you've already given them your information like you're I don't think you've given them your two Factor at this point but
you're already kind of screwed things that stand out here though even if this image loads I think the reason why this image didn't load at the time was because the account was set to private so I think when you did it the image would have loaded uh to be clear it just didn't load for John Hammond um this change password button actually going flush against this bottom line is probably not something that um developers would have done there but also look at things like this your old
password is incorrect space comma space please double check it no punctuation um nice little things like that can can tip you off that something's going wrong um I don't know if he has the screenshots of it in this thread I know it's in the video um but when it asks for the two- Factor code yeah it it says twac um it doesn't uh yeah I don't think it's in here dang interesting um but he he has it in the video but the the text for the two factor is like pretty bad um cuz it just says like twac and it's it's
all written oddly um but really like the easiest way to get around this stuff and an and an automatic default and you should apply this to a lot of different scenarios not just potentially fishy emails um is when you're warned about something like this like if your bank calls you and they're like oh my goodness something terrible has happened say tell me what number I can call you back at no yeah and then you check it then you Google you can check it if you want but you just Google the number and
call them anyways you don't you never call the one that they tell you on the phone unless you Google it and it matches perfect matches yeah yeah yeah um or like sorry extension is what I would is what I would ask okay you need to be able to get back in touch with the person obviously but you don't don't talk to them yet yeah don't talk to them on the phone you want to be the person who reached out and you want to be able to verify the contact that you're going to reach out to them at um through
entirely your own methods don't listen to them telling you to Google as specific thing in order to find them don't don't do any of that stuff find it completely on your own in this case what you do is it's oh there's a weird breach with my X account close that email load up X the app if you're on your phone or go to the X website directly yourself on desktop and then reset it that way this is one of the things that really screwed me here I'm not logged into that account on any of my
devices not a single one so sorry I want to I want to point this out really quick some full chat said you don't even trust that the caller ID is valid that is true it's you can absolutely fake caller ID don't trust it at all no matter what it is and then find another way to reach back out to so if I had been logged in to my Twitter account I would have just used the app to sign out all other sessions yeah but I wasn't yeah what what threw me off was that you had said that you didn't click anything
in the email so I didn't I didn't think it was fishing so I was trying to figure out like what the heck would have happened because from my perspective I'm trying to think about like okay I mean the first thing everyone assumes I'm at Defcon was it me right but I can rule that out pretty quick because nothing weird is happening to my stuff and if they got into any of my things why would they go after the X account it's like one of the least valuable things I have access to there
is so many bad things that could be done like that doesn't make any sense to me I so okay so I rule that out pretty quick say you didn't click on a link okay so I rule out fishing turns out it was fishing but I rule out fishing at the time then I'm trying to figure out okay if they got into like our password manager again why would they go after Twitter or X or whatever it's like it's It's oddly low value compared to the other things that they would able to get if they had uh these other potential
attack vectors so I came down to assuming poor Sammy I came down to assuming that like Sammy logged into the account from a personal computer that was comp or something cuz I was like that's really the only route I can think of that would have worked for this and my brain is just completely on fire trying to figure out like what the heck how did this happen um and then uh I think it was John Hammond reached out and was like Hey it kind of looks like it's fishing and he pointed out a few
reasons why and then these are again things that wouldn't have been super obvious um in the moment but are ways that he was a able to verify that it was a fishing email later um so one this Android thing is not an Android version so that's interesting um oh no that looked like yeah yeah yeah um 6942 he also noticed when he did get emailed by them um that the Android version changed so he thinks it's just like a random number or something not entirely sure uh and then if you look up
the X login account device email thing or or make it happen somehow it is a little bit different so he could he was able to verify that it was a fishing email there so I looked back into it um and I had lus send me the email and then I was oh yeah okay I realized before I even clicked send to you that I was done I like a crap absolutely wrecked yeah someone asked how many followers does the LC Twitter account have they could just want exposure um sure but again if they had any of these
other methods why just take the ex account if you had our password manager you could take the X account you could take the Instagram account you could take the YouTube account and then hit all of them at the same time um like just taking the S account is pretty low value if you have like actually breached um things that we have but if it's it makes sense that if it would be a fishing account but yeah I don't know um so yeah that's the that's the the fishing topic um nice be be vigilant watch yourselves
um always Vigilant yeah yep and check out John Hammond's video cuz it's fantastic yep uh all right apparently it's time for us to do some merch messages it's not it's not I don't know what it's but go up to the fishing Topic at the very top there's this oh uh oh then announce oh yeah hey oh yeah we have do you want to want to go to the thing uh sure so uh do I have to read all right you know what no no no no no hold on let me get some of the pie getting some of the humble pie eating The Humble
Pie what better way to commemorate minus getting got then with a limited edition t-shirt and Hoodie uh these are print to order so um yeah the these are these are mockups of what the design will look like but you guys know we do we do a great job of our merch um  fish is it the the whale land whale but without the jewelry yeah which we know a whale is not a fish calm down um yeah yeah yeah designed by Sarah these are a reminder to always be vigilant about the emails you receive clearly it can happen
to the tech Tippi of us thank you for that team but the best part is we are donating all of the profits from the shirt and Hoodie to the Electronic Frontier Foundation a nonprofit which defends internet civil liberties it says Luke should be able to talk more about the or since he picked it they are now available at lm. gotfish if you Google e uh you're probably not going to get the the eff that we're talking about uh so Electronic Frontier Foundation yeah so look that up not the acronym um but yeah
they they they seem pretty cool to me I don't know a huge amount about them but they they have like three different parts of their organization I don't remember them exactly one of them is a legal base where they try to jump in on certain trials and um help in whatever kind of way benefits civil civil liberties for people because their biggest thing is I I don't remember what they call it but it's where they try to jump in on cases where like precedent is being set cool and they try to make sure
that the right precedent is being set in these cases um they so develop things so if I remember correctly correctly it's like privacy Badger or something is made by them which is cool um and there's there's other stuff that they do that's that's cool as well we were trying to pick a like kind of somewhat hacker Centric organization so thought this made sense cool yep um so we're we're going to we're going to turn this L into a w as best we can um while you're on the store this week we've actually got
some pretty exciting new product oh my goodness they've got a whole they've got a whole thing for me okay so first of all scribe drivers which I wish we'd called the write off but hey the name is done the packaging is printed uh we're going to the lonus cam scribe drivers our pens that are made out of failed screwdriver shafts from our original supplier that kind of jerked us around screwed us over I think that's the word I was looking for um they are not knurled enough for a screwdriver
but they are knurled enough for a wonderful little writing Implement with a cool uh bolt action uh pen action so you guys can check that out we've got uh "10,000 in stock which is a which is a" lie uh because we actually have yesterday before end of the work day we were already around 50% of that yeah I know uh hold on hold on% or something let me check let me check so if you guys are wanting to get in on this shipment of scribe driver you might want to move pretty fast because we've already sold
"through 6,200 of them and we restocked" them yesterday a little before noon I think so cool um yeah go check it out it takes standard uh it takes standard ink things from what what are their names again lmg Dogg pen here you go uh where is it yeah Parker G2 refills these have been really popular reviewed really well uh from our first shipment people are are freaking loving this thing are you guys going to carry the refills uh no I don't think so cuz people could just like order them from
Amazon or wherever like uh I maybe maybe not I don't know and you can use whatever you want yeah like that's the thing right I that was kind of the whole point is we're not selling you a subscription for a pen we're just selling you a pen and you can put whatever refills whatever color whatever whatever it is you like I'm just thinking if I if I want this pen long term I might buy the pen and some refills I know thing but then we have to like find a supplier for refills you're
not you're not wrong I the team knows okay yeah yeah they're they're they're working on it but either way you can get refills from wherever you want cool um oh apparently we changed the print on the boxes from gloss black to white to make it read a bit more easily anyway it's available with a brass or stainless steel accent and uh enjoy the bigger one is guys the laptop bag oh finally the laptop bag is finally here have you actually been Hands-On with it yet never genuinely not once
which terrifies me cuz that's he always uses this as a way for me to show it off and I don't know what I'm doing every time he's the worst Vanna ever yep and I kind of love it about it here it is oh it's full of stuff meet the offsite we're going to the loot cam okay here we go oh yeah it's an offsite storage reference ha or off-site work reference I mean I wasn't involved in the naming on this one at least it's better than what we normally do which is which would have been laptop bag laptop
bag yeah so you know what baby steps um baby steps any who we're going to the loot cam uh even though it looks like one it is not a sleeve it holds way more and already wants us to zip the laptop pocket open which is the one on your left the one by the the one by the little handle okay I was inspecting the zippers for a second okay so first you've got a laptop pocket it opens up way deeper than that sir does it oh no that one doesn't no no no yeah the other one does sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry
first you get the laptop pocket which is lined in micro Suede and is divided into two sections one where most laptops will fit and then the other is a snug pocket for smaller laptops and devices okay he wants you to zip the laptop pocket back up wow R's got all these instructions and everything direct instruction he knows both of you very well he works for Creator warehouse now our old uh social lead um okay but B one but then you unzip the primary storage compartment no one can see what you're
doing luk God just how do I even un the unzip the primary storage compartment okay you got to unzip it all the way and there's a pocket for just about all of your smaller electronics and accessories dude this is crazy like the number of laptop sleeves and stuff that don't have a a place to hold a charger is absolute Madness to me that's the mouse pocket okay it's the big one this one so you can hold a real charger you can hold a real freaking charger anyway we're supposed to highlight the laptop charger
pocket the mouse pocket okay cuz like we understand we understand and respect that you need to carry a mouse we've got our cable Loops um there's a micro suede tablet sleeve so you can carry a tablet around with you as well and we even have a hidden air tag pocket did you catch for oh yeah there I only knew that was there because he showed me before the show but this thing which could hold a scribe driver um you can like roll that away and then fit it in in there best thing about it is everything's in sight
everything's easy to reach no rumaging around inside your bag and then there's a smaller pocket at the front it was just a lot bigger of a book than I expected heck yeah uh there's a smaller pocket at the front you can close it um for like passport or wallet or any small objects oh whoa there's individual little sley things in here as well go heck yeah so I've seen a lot of people commenting that it's really expensive I like yes do you know how much those YKK zippers cost do you know how much all
these pockets and all of this construction cost I don't I don't make the rules um it's one of those conversations we've had a lot of times expensive versus overpriced yes it's expensive no it's not overpriced um all right let's go back to the loot cam you also have another pocket in the the back here that magnetically opens and closes so that that pocket that that was in is magnetic which is kind of nice cuz it just will hold it closed and pulls out the shoulder strap so this has a wide
padding that's very similar to the straps that you'd find on the LTT backpack and it secures onto the laptop bag with two locking carabiners uh if you're not into that it is completely detachable uh available in two sizes small and large for $99.99 check out which one your laptop fits through the size guide lm. slaptop Bay yeah so if you were tossing this in like another bag or or just wanted to carry it by the carry handle that I don't know if we mentioned um you could take this thing
off with the Locking carabiners and then repurpose this back sleeve for whatever else I guess yep um considering that they're not shipping yet so they're expected to start shipping by the end of this month uh these are actually moving pretty well I'm very very excited a luggage strap yes oh yeah cool right yeah it's it's a pretty featured laptop bag it's like the a lot of people saw our backpack and we're like who the heck is this for and then the tens of thousands of people who
know what it's for bought it and loved it this is like the same kind of deal it's the same kind of deal it's the laptop bag for people who have actual like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] work to do and have stuff they need to carry you know like she's she's kind of thick when she's loaded up actually if you kind of show that's that's with a laptop and a tablet and the Charters and The Mouse and the books and and the shoulder strap and everything like it's not Harry Potter technology it but it can get relatively
thin yeah things things take up space but it's uh it's designed to be able to fit stuff very very very very excited to be launching this one uh webbing on the sides um I don't think you would call it webbing but they're like Loops there's Loops here yep so and right here there's another loop it's currently being used for the the um luggage strap but this luggage strap is Velcro so you could remove it if you weren't going to use that feature cool right and then it's the same two loop on the other side so
if we ever have accessories they might attached to the loops there or or or you could just hang cute little you know crystals or figurines off of it I don't care I suspect that'll be the most common use Cas yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah but cool what is the max size of laptop uh we have a size guide on the site cool yeah go check it out um I wanted so badly for it to fit the framework 16 with the GPU hump but it's the weirdest shaped laptop ever and I was like sorry framework I love you guys
very much but it's not going to fit in our laptop bag yeah yep I know guys I know believe it or not my investment in framework does not actually guide the decisions we make as a company if it did  yeah um all right what else we got what you want to talk about oh oh we're supposed to explain merch messages all right so yeah if you were going to order something hey now's the perfect time to leave a merch message don't do super chats don't do twitch bits do merch messages because that way you can throw
money at your screen you can interact and interact with us and support the show and you can also get great products in the mail so all you got to do is go to LTT store.com and in the cart you'll see a little box that gives you the option to fill out a merch message it'll go to producer Dan hey look there he is wow he's real I mean this could be pre-recorded Dan prove it's not PR recorded hi see if I leave this long enough it'll  pre-recorded no I can't H so it'll go to producer Dan who will reply to it
himself forward it internally uh pop up your message down there like that or well that's his message what what are you who you replying to who are you replying to thick what are you even talking about anyway or liked it or he'll send it to me Luke for uh as a curated merch message and we'll talk about it on the show what do we got Mr Dan oh well we have loads of merch messages coming in today we've had so many people buy pens oh it's pens it's pens it's a lot of pens we've done how many how many
though Luke how many though do you know how many pens yeah just through hold out your hold out your arm and I'll write how many there are okay use the pen okay here we go where do you where do you want want in inside yeah okay oh no I know what's happening I've  [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I mean I got F but at least I didn't fall for that I only got it when you started writing on his hand I was like what does he mean how many why would oh man okay oh I honestly the second show the people yeah that many
pens 15 15 pens 15 pens the second the second he started W I was like I Just Happening Now there's no point what the first line is there like it's better to dis Embrace yeah yeah exactly you know I actually feel a little better are you sure you wouldn't like some Humble Pie it wrote no I'm good I I deserve it but I I I don't uh it wrote pretty well for on on yeah it comes with a quality refill out of the box um but then you can put in anything you want after you put in a crappy one
if you really want uh if we ever do a promo on the pen it should totally be  off oh man uh all right uh yeah so yeah we're probably going to do are we a pen company now I know right like what the heck dude I don't even understand what even kind of what what even kind of company are we do you know how many of those PTM 7950 thermal pads we sell probably a ton on a random day like earlier this week we didn't have any promos running we didn't have any product launches or anything we sold a
100 units of that just like do you think it could be like Builders just in one day yeah like so what I'm saying is like are there single orders of a bunch of them oh that I don't know cuz that would be interesting to me cuz I know they can just be like really annoying to get you know what our timing was great because even though it took us forever from the video we made about it to getting it in stock uh there was a recent article on I think it was Igor's lab where he was
breaking down like bad thermal paste that GPU manufacturers have been using and then he used PTM 7950 or maybe it was a separate article about PTM 7950 hold on I'm just going to bring it up uhm 7950 either way he's been he's been talking about it there you go not so overhyped um they are they are freaking awesome so it's been like in the news and being discussed a lot especially lately and as far as I can tell we are like no one ever mentions us for some reason which is weird but when people go
looking for it we are like the goto for reasonably priced well- packaged PTM 7950 um someone in chat said I bought seven of the smaller pads when they were on sale there you go yeah 750 but I'm just wondering if there's if there's like actual professional builders that are just getting it from there like cuz I don't know maybe they buy much larger sheets combat gem says for the PTM there's a cooling dude on YouTube who does consoles and stuff who talked about your PTM and how it's just easier to get
and you know it's the right stuff without going through China like that was my big problem when we were trying to get it to make our video finding a reput a reputable source for it was a nightmare and I was like this is just this is stupid because this is a quality product from a brand that everybody knows if you've never heard of Honeywell like you've been probably living under a freaking fridge that was made by them like it's like they're just one of those companies that makes everything right
and it seemed so ridiculous to me that counterfeits existed of a stupid thermal pad and that not only did they exist but they were so convincing while not having the performance characteristics that it was almost impossible to determine which one was good and which one was bad and I was like okay well we just need to get in touch with honey well which by the way is a lot harder than you would think like Honeywell does not care about your "$50,000 order of thermal" pad zero this is the number of FS that
they give about our business but fortunately it was I I believe it was a connection through a viewer who worked for a distributor who was able to get in touch with honey well so that that was how we were ultimately able to get definitely absolutely TTM 7950 yeah and uh yeah super cool so what kind of company are we are we a thermal Pad Company we sell 100 thermal pads a day Luke you sell pads and shafts that's all you sell a day you're a weird person I'm not the one who said that 
true all flat and round that's the two things you s cloes only two two shapes two shapes two shapes flatter round flatter round lumpy okay less than 100 a day less than 100 a day in the last seven  572 is this is this seven days yeah this is s days why what just some of these things there's just a lot of them dude LTD stores are real business yeah yeah wow I know right it messes me up every time I look into fact the fact that at one point in time we a water bottle company
and there's no water bottle up there oh yeah there's one most of our water bottles are out of stock it's a long story but oh yeah that's part of it um and then we were we I think we were a water bottle water bottle company and then we weree a mouse pad company yeah and then overnight we became a screwdriver company and also a backpack company like at a very similar time they launched almost at the same time man I still can't looking back that was stupid I ordered $
"100,7 $ screwdriver what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] was I" thinking I mean it worked out I know but it was crazy yeah that one to be fair that one had a lot of like lore behind it the logo for the channel and like all this kind of stuff what if it wasn't good yeah what if project Farm had reviewed it and been like yeah it's a piece of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that would have suck like I the the number of people that I've seen you know criticizing the price or whatever it's like yeah criticize it all you want but
the reality of it is to make a high quality product like that with licensed patents from companies that develop products that you could patent stuff like it it's not like it's cheap it's not like I could just turn around and and liquidate them for $10 that it no it's it's just an expensive screwdriver and I'm sorry that's just the way it works um so if project Farm had been like yeah it's rubbish that would have been it I would have been done what's what's this video at now oh
I don't know I haven't looked at it in a long time the last time I looked at it which was quite a while ago it was cook um see 4.1 million he's got a million on the stubby dude that's that's wild if you're wondering why these aren't watched uh it's just cuz we're on like the W the way accounts that's crazy uh no that's not even that's not even oh no I use my this isn't my personal I use my personal to watch YouTube cuz I have premium um yeah and like look like he's not the
only opinion that matters obviously but he is an influencer in the truest sense of the word yeah where he influences yeah I feel like he probably wouldn't love that um but I just because of the I don't mean it in the derogatory sense yeah because the association that it has with things but I I understand what you're saying and I do agree I he's someone who other people go to for the advice they give to anyone that is that is influence with a capital I yeah and so he was terrifying I knew
about project farm from from years before he he reviewed the screwdriver um I I I don't remember why I think I found like a a video that he did on jeans or something yeah sure I don't I don't remember what it was but yeah this is crazy guy guy covers like everything counterfeit tool batteries like knife sets I'm just looking through what he's done lately I haven't checked out the channel in a little while like the best trash bag it's like yeah I need to know that yeah
why not I should probably watch that one need to know what's a good trash bag how else how else will I throw away my trash effectively I mean who who likes garbage juice who likes garbage juice getting all over your floor I hate that I hate that it sucks do in the apartment building all the time it's gross yeah so so I don't mean any disrespect when I say influencer I mean one who is influential he has influenced me y um so yeah that was that was pretty scary have have we really spent all this time Yik
yacking without actually doing a merch message Dan Dan can you confirm I I uh yeah the the longer that I'm not doing merch messages the more merch messages there are so I'm not really too bothered to be perfectly honest cool good chat goodbye can we do a merch message though I was going to say we actually do need to do one more yeah let's do like a couple I think okay hi D I work at work I use an identity vetted email service it has zero spam mainly because of the vetting process would you consider
identity vetting if it meant an end to cheating in video games oh oh wow that  either I I think at at a certain like you know how they have like casual ranked if they had like casual ranked competitive and competitive had like identity vetting I think i''d be cool with it I would do it no question yeah I had someone actually email me after the fishing thing yeah I was I was gesturing with my head can still read it nice you're just tuning in now he's an Enthusiast it's his new
tattoo he got it from lius was a gift oh man he got it 15 times oh yeah um any I had I had someone reach out to me um they're like a security they're like a security researcher they do Security Solutions um yeah basically they were like hey yeah so here's all the here's all the stuff that I was able to dig up on you uh you know do you want to know do you want to know more about this and here's some potential insights and um you know here here you can have a look at you can here's a here's a device you
used in 2019 and uh here's apps that that you've installed and here's this and here's that and I'm just like thanks all of that's public you can probably find more info on me on Rocket reach if you really want it my privacy's dead and he's like no it's not dead it's not dead it's not dead I'm just like dud it definitely is though uh oh dude dude it's so dead it's so dead man like it's dead it's been dead for a while it's been dead for a long time I mean I have lived so much of my life on
the internet at this point like every once in a while I think about it um someone will talk about like OG you know YouTubers or whatever that are still active dude it is getting to the point where there aren't that many it's genuinely from like very small amount my era I was at I was at Defcon over the weekend and one of the things that happened was some people that we were hanging out with didn't know like who I was so I would explain uh and they'd be like oh cool like when did you guys
start that and I'd say the hero they would just be like like what what I'm like yeah not actually the beginning but like at this point it might as well be yeah the funniest thing about that is when I got started on YouTube I thought I sure it was too late yeah I was like no it's too late yeah like everyone's already established at this point I'll never catch up like I'll be Irrelevant in the tech space forever um same thing with twitch man you look at you look at the popular twitch moves faster in regards
to pushing people to irrelevancy you look at the top like x amount of creators on Twitch even from like a year ago or two 3 years ago and it's completely cycled y I mean the whole like whoever like x x fell off you know asterisk fell off it's it's it's a meme at this point yeah oh only X number of viewers blah blah bro fell off right like it's someone told me recently about the like the fiveyear rule where it's like practically impossible for any like influencer Creator whatever you want to
call it to stay at a at a high peak for more than 5 years yeah do it I call it the curve I've talked to you about that before that's my that's my term for it the curve has only one shape yeah that's it I wonder how my curve is doing you used to be able to see it all on social blade because um that was before uh it's one of the most annoying things YouTube has done yeah YouTube um made them stop displaying data that they collected via the API that is over 2 years old so you
used to be able to look at the entire lifespan of any channel and you could see the entire like shape of the C curve and it was always well and the subscriber numbers also weren't as like chunky this yeah yep um hey hey hey hey look at this though look at this we're going up guess who's back back again your hair is blonde blond's back kind of works out tell a friend anyway yeah wait did you just get an LTT store ad you probably didn't see it but did happen I don't know I I don't
see ads you close the page yeah look oh yeah look at that an ad nice that's not a very good ad we paid to show ourselves what's even happening like you don't I can't even fully tell it's an ad it's just like  icons interesting so if I if I click a specific product does it open that product like tab yeah yeah do we even is this water bottle even in stock I don't oh oh it is yes okay so it managed to pick a product that's in stock that's something that's good uh circuit desk pad yeah okay it's
a nice desk pad quality okay so it does open the individual wait can you even buy that is that is that a size we carry what is this size oh okay oh sold out okay well yeah make sense we're not going to restock that size it's so small yeah I mean it's adorable but no um oh are we not bringing a circuit desk pad back in oh well it'd be nice if I could filter by stock is that something that the store team could do like just so I could say like show only in stock or something uh I think so that would be
kind of cool uh can someone log that the arrow on that drop down is also uncomfortably close to the bounds of the box but yeah I mean no professional web developer would ever do that according to your thing earlier oh that wasn't that wasn't the thing that was wrong that was wrong yeah yeah yeah yeah come on um oh Ary says you can you have to go to all products well yeah but I I want to be able to do it like on the individual VAR that might be pretty annoying but we'll I'll M we'll look into it yeah if
there's anything we can do that' be pretty cool uh all right what are we what are we supposed to be talking about right now here's a second merch message ah yes what about second merch message did you need to be home by 9: yeah I was not informed of this I was not informed of this yes you were yeah you were like halfway through the show no yeah yesterday what yeah who's on first I'm just I'm I I I have no idea what they did or didn't talk about I don't care rud yeah get
wrecked I don't remember this now you're wrecked on camera hey you want some more of that pie I haven't finished this one cuz I can't stop typing cuz I'm up to 187 now uh hey D I've been thinking a lot recently about net books and I think the form factor should return besides their underpowered components why do you think we haven't seen any recently you know that's a funny question um the usability issues with netbooks went beyond the slow Hardware because that's something that is totally
solved at this point you could make a high performance computer in the in the form factor of an Acer Aspire One at this point uh throw like a like a AMD Apu in there or something like that I mean look at the size of something like the steam deck absolutely you could make a netbook but for me the usability issue with the netbook was less to do with the performance with those crappy Intel atom CPUs and it was more to do with uh the usability of it it's not like the it's not like the form factor doesn't still
exist like companies like GPD essentially specialize in building products that address that market like look at this here's the here's the win Max uh 2024 Edition here let's just fire that up I'm going click an add let's go but there you can't oh no not that one no no not the win Max hold on hold on hold on hold on uh no the one that I want is uh is it the pocket micro PC I think it's the wi four I think it's the wind four let me have a look here uh pocket three no not the win for
oh plus I can never remember their product naming scheme where are the hands for scale whatever the point is that you can definitely get devices in these form factors but what made Netbook so special was that they were super cheap yes that's what made them sell the only reason why people really want the only reason people cared so now that we want performance that's decent they're not that cheap and the usability issues that existed for netbooks like their little tiny screens and little tiny
keyboards those haven't gone away and I think a lot of people were kind of tech curious about the category and tried it and realized once and for all that they never need to do that again um there are definitely careers that I could end up in where I could be convinced to use a book like device potentially uh there was one really cool one that I think was from GPD that had uh an input on it so that you could actually use it as a display and keyboard and mouse for a device like as a as a mobile technician
or something like oh that'd be so cool but anything I have to type on for any reasonable amount of time I want it to have a proper siiz keyboard and I just I'd rather I'd rather save my space this way you know and have a keyboard then save my space this way and not be able to type on the device because you have to put the battery in it either way it's going to have to have a certain internal volume if you want to have reasonable battery life this so this I don't believe is a topic in the doc but
someone in full plane chat just mentioned it and I'm going to just say it out loud so you can look into it if you want but uh apparently there was a 2 billion plus leak of personal uh date of birth and Social Security numbers for US citizens that happened uh there's not 2 billion sorry what it says 2B plus I don't know that doesn't make any sense doesn't make much sense to me either unless maybe it includes uh numbers and information of deceased people oh uh no even then I don't think there's been
ever 2 billion Americans total isn't there like over 300 million yeah so if it cycled yeah that would be a lot of times yeah no okay um anyway big leak well would you cut it in half uh 2.7 billion records apparently it's uh yeah it's it's the number of it's a lot more than half so it's probably counting a record for a full name a record for an address a record for date of birth a record for Social Security Etc yeah it's a lot a lot of stuff like I said it's not a prep topic I the number is definitely wrong
but a major record holder got hacked essentially yeah okay yeah um the records are inacurate okay cool well yeah it'll include dead people changes of address all kinds of stuff like that got it uh Troy hunt apparently has a Blog post about it that makes sense he would do that all right want to talk about super cool real estate dystopia yeah all right uh this is a great article that I read on the Atlantic earlier this week um just a few months after reports emerged that modern cars
were sharing information with auto insurers a California woman had her home insurance canceled because of Drone footage um oh wait this is this two different oh okay this is two different things this is not the uh the the Atlantic article so first is one from pipic pixel um Joan Van Curran's insurance provider of 40 years CSAA dropped her home insurance citing unacceptable hazards and liability exposure van Kernan was told by a representative that they flew a drone over her house and concluded that the
Final Phase of her of her home renovation project was hazardous clutter now here's we've talked about this before because this has happened to someone else um but what's interesting about this one to me is that her insurance provider CSAA is saying hey we didn't violate your privacy we don't have drones we just paid someone who did we used several sources of information to assess the condition of the property which could include aerial imagery captured by third-party fixed-wing aircraft and satellites sick
and this is going to be a tenuous connection but this kind of reminds me of the Disney um okay the the Disney case earlier where it's like look if you're going to have your brand name on it if you're going to have it as part of your business practice at the end of the day you know if you're Amazon and you're going oh well those those mistreated truck drivers or whatever they are they don't work for Amazon isn't there some amount of precedent for this um they're contractors I mean that's why companies
contract so that they're not responsible for the workers's conditions so that if something goes wrong they're not liable they can cut ties and just walk away or maybe because they really want to work with that person but that person's in another country and then that's the only way that it can work we like our contractors hello or because they live in Quebec and Quebec it's complicated Quebec's a whole heck but I'm not talking about hiring a contractor here I'm talking about taking
an entire division of your business or an entire role within your compan Contra it to another Contracting it to another company who then can treat those people however and theoretically there's this there's this layer of insulation between your brand and your company and what they're doing and it's like I I don't understand why we allow that insulation to exist if you if your contractor is using aerial footage to why are we getting into this conversation about who who the Drone belongs to who cares
yeah you are using Drone footage that was collected which is technically legal I guess but you're using Drone footage to surveil someone's private property and determine if they should be eligible for insurance or not it's just it's freaking dystopian that's the issue although it's not nearly as dystopian as this next one and look I am not a lawyer I'm not a legal adviser so take everything that I'm about to say for the ignorant rants of a lay person that they are but this one really upset me this
one's from the Atlantic here the original article you should go read it it's really good it's going to break it down more than what we're talking about but in other unfortunate real estate news 30 to 60% of multif family building units in 40 housing markets are apparently using property management software from the company real page to adjust rent prices okay so far I guess right sure but Real Page has been accused of antitrust violations and price fixing due to their AI Revenue management
algorithm see he's starting to I'm we're starting to get some Twitches in the thing basically Property Owners input their unit prices and vacancy rates and then the algorithm spits out a rent recommendation based on what competitors are charging the loss suits actually multiple lawsuits against Real Page and there are lawsuits against similar Services allege that the landlords actually encourage their competitors to also use the service why because if they're all using it then everyone will get better
results uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh and they can collude without talking to each other directly and they can all work together to raise prices to sorry excuse me let me use the correct term here AI managed their revenue this is flipping Wild and the reason that I wanted to talk about this is because the tech bro cabal you know the the the tech Elite whatever whatever you want to call them the people who are out there doing interviews and making arguments about these AI agents or algorithms I don't
really think it's fair to call an AI agent an algorithm I actually don't really like that term because to me an algorithm is something that can be expressed as a function uh whereas machine learning is not necessarily simply expressed as a function you can you can express um the desired outcome you can express what the input was uh but what you can't express is exactly how it achieved that necessarily because it's going to depend on how many times it has adversarially reinforced itself
in order to achieve that outcome like it's simple function though that that narrative is used by companies that want to well I'm getting to that they have no control okay I'm getting to that here's my problem is the people that are getting out there and doing these interviews making those arguments I'm really glad you brought that up because that's exactly where I was going with it they've got to pick a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Lane because on the one hand right they're kind of going oh we couldn't possibly
know it's a black box it's a black box we don't know how it works um we just try to poke it and hope yeah we we we just hope for the best right and then when they want to when they want to train it right uh when they want to use um let's say copyrighted or otherwise you know not legally available content like say from YouTube channels or or Netflix or whoever else well then now all of a sudden well you know it's uh it's oh wait this wasn't quite the argument I wanted to make whatever okay
let's back up a little bit let's back up a little bit so when they want to train it okay the argument that they make is that it's kind of like a person right like anyone any any entity could have consumed that content and learned and everything that it that it produces from that point whether whatever similarity it Bears to what it learned from is just like any any person would right but then the legal argument around this uh this price fixing issue it does something that they
don't like it's not it's not it's not a person it's just an algorithm yeah so you got to decide which one it is yeah does it behave like a person taking in information from around it and then and then Black Box doing its own thing with it and it's generative or is it an algorithm and can't be held accountable for behaving like a person would because that's the argument that real p is making they're basically saying that well because none of these people are talking to each
other there is no single entity that is bringing the entire thing together to become collusion they're all just using an algorithm that is suggesting things to them based on information that it has but the lawyers who are filing these lawsuites argue that it like a person who was acting as an intermediary has private information that it shouldn't have in order to give those recommendations sorry it took me a while to get there but basically we made it my whole thing is like look you've
got to pick a lane you've got to decide if they're people and therefore should be allowed to intake any content they want like a person would or if they're just algorithms in which case well I guess you can't really do that to to to to train them they shouldn't be able to take in that information either way it's pretty clear to me that what real page is doing is textbook collusion and price fixing yeah it's just that the textbook was written a long [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] time ago yeah this is this is horrible I
I'm really hate corporate residential investment um but that's a story for another time yeah and just again I'm not a lawyer I I don't I don't know the law but what I do know is this doesn't seem right yeah um and I am I I don't think it's cool yeah anything else is there something that's cool is there is there something in here that's cool yeah our sponsors hey the show is brought to you today by Corsair maybe you're a fashion Pioneer pushing the boundaries of style and

um because it turns out while people weren't that into the design of just an LTT in a random color on a shirt people were super into the quad pack bundles that we did of them at a really aggressive price um people liked them so much as a stupid loss leader item that we actually intentionally did I think either two or three rounds remember of printing those shirts with the intention of selling them for um I think by the time we like everything was handled and everything I'm I'm pretty sure they were
at a loss so um good job team um I mean it is a thing that businesses do well where they will buy something with the intent of not making money on them with the intent of losing money on them but it doesn't happen that often for us we're pretty small company we don't uh we don't just buy stuff to lose money on it generally speaking is isn't that like the whole thing with the Costco food yeah yeah vertisserie chicken the hot dog yeah vertisserie chicken is a huge one yeah y I didn't even know that the road
history chicken was like a lost leader thing until I I read some so cheap for what they are you can't you can't buy a uncooked chicken for for for Less crazy and it's cooked and seasoned and everything they're really nice this is just a Costco sponsorship now Val herck says the vertisserie chicken isn't a lost leader really I that doesn't that doesn't compute for me I I don't think you're I'm not sure they say they don't waste a single bit of it well yeah but even then guys yeah but it's just a
chicken they just took a chicken and they put it in a plastic container yeah guys I I yeah I don't I don't know I'm I'm pretty sure I'm I'm pretty sure um in a 2023 earnings call Costco Chief Financial Officer Richard galante said Costco's rotisserie chicken is an investment in low prices to drive membership to drive sales in a big way that's just a fancy way of saying loss leader the back of the store like the bathrooms for a reason yeah and uh the next line of this is almost exactly what
lus said word for word is that's a fancy way of saying that the product is a loss leader yeah that's hilarious that was I wasn't even going to say it and I was like wait that's almost word um yeah so yeah I mean I think it is or it might even be a thing like maybe maybe they profit like a tenth of a cent on each one that's still kind of a lot leader in a way yeah because even just the administration of having that is going to make that automatically not worth it y all right lmg continues it's assault
on my wallet lonus did you ever hear from Big Time about sponsoring them uh unless a deal is done you know I'm not going to yeah I'm not going to talk about it um what I will do is I'll reiterate that we would love uh we'd love to do a SP ship with big time there's even if you know everyone agreed in principle that that was a good idea there'd be a lot of details to sort out like you know let's say they were like oh yeah sure sounds good uh how about $1 billion you know for a for a community
post you obviously we wouldn't move forward with that so there's a and I'm not saying they did that I'm just saying there's a thousand reasons that something might not go through even if we'd like to and even if they'd like to so I I'm very interested in it personally but there's also other stakeholders internally that need to be convinced we we don't just operate based on what lonus thinks is a good idea anymore we have other leadership and that's a good thing what a loss you're a loss and a
leader I don't I don't think I'm uh is this loss yeah do would you call like support departments and infrastructure a loss leader in a company oh uh they're known as the burden Department yeah not lost leader but they just cost the company M because a lost leader actually has to have the potential to generate profits elsewhere yeah we don't come here for infrastructure I think no but I think that's true because I mean if we didn't have a single server well think about the
infrastructure Department think about the accounting department no you're called cost centers bment heard Warden no I I know cost centers yeah yeah that's a nice name yeah no you don't get to be loss leader sorry I don't know if cost center is a nice name I I prefer burden Department because it's way more offensive burden Department yeah like you're a net drain on this company keep doing your job but we're looking at you it's like it's like oh I'm sorry for being employed by you if you didn't have
us your company would implode but it doesn't mean it's on your balance sheet is anything good investors what's this well that's the entire Workforce that makes that makes are well we got to get rid of them we'll Outsource them and then the company implodes that's basically what that happens all the time yeah lay off we'll just Outsource it you know we'll get his the stop is doing poorly fire everyone I love who who's going to fix the company AI yeah that'll make the stock go up what do we do when that
doesn't work I don't know that's some other shareholders problem I'm okay I'll get a golden parachute move on to the next one yay uh in the badon center is definitely a cost center not a lost leader yeah especially when it takes all of our infrastructure people away I want to do my job no I have good news no it's good news why you got to be such a dick so I had a meeting with the city oh no way I had a meeting with the general manager of the city of sui I I can't believe I haven't talked to you about
this I didn't know cities had general managers sure do I thought it was just mayor well I mean Mayors have staffs they don't just do everything you sound like one of our viewers who thinks that I like it's the weed and harvest the weed and bake the weed and like a little red hen over here like no they they have of course they have a whole team no wheat oh it's the story of The Little Red Hen I know I thought you said weed did you not have children's stories the Canadian version of The Little Red Hen
not the weed rolls the joints in a tiny beak you don't bake the weed the weed bakes you never get eye in your own Supply Linus okay so those eggs would be off the chain though from high chickens okay like high chew but way worse um had an important meeting yeah so so we had a meeting with the general manager of the city apparently cities have and in much the same way that you know I can't say with confidence oh we're going to sponsor big time or you know whatever I can't say with
confidence that we're going to be able to move forward with whale lands at the Badminton Center SL I'm just going to start calling It smash jamps so that's that's what it's called it's called smash Champs um I'm not saying that we're going to be able to move forward but what I will say is that we had a really constructive meeting um we chatted for almost 2 hours so it was a it's never a good sign when a meeting is 15 minutes um it is almost there's like a there's like a
happy spot like how good of a sign it is is if it's a 4our meeting it's probably bad um so it was almost 2 hours including two site visits so they went to smash Champs and then they also came here to the office to get an idea of you know what our operation looks like um for like land gaming and SL sport in the city and then what our operation looks like that pays for land gaming and um sport in the city um in order to just like get an idea of what we're about out and I will tell you this at the end of
the meeting the question the summary question was okay what do you need from us to get these gaming events going o that's a nice one it's not a guarantee no there's you know red tape but it's it's good red tape can't be immediately you know cut necessarily no matter what kind of position of power they're in but this is really cool for me as a resident of the city of Sur I've I've observed many times over the years that there is like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] all to do here um and one of
the big problems is that our previous councils uh like our city councils have not prioritized it um yeah so to have fun you have to travel out of the city basic for a long time and what's cool is one of the things that he said is that in his 10 years working for the city um this is the first Council that has come to him with a mandate of hey figure this out that's awesome actually yeah that's very cool even not even just the impact on Smash Champs like obviously I'm happy
about that but I'm also excited about the idea of things to do being something that the cities that are out here care about I'm going to bundle in like Langley suburbs carrying a little bit more with like the Langley Event Center and stuff but even that like unless you're doing organized sport it's I mean that helps that's cool I like LLY Event Center I'm I'm for it but we need kind of more stuff like that yeah 100% And and it's it's it's funny because uh one of the things that he also mentioned is
I forget what the time frame was but I think it's sometime in the like next 10 or 20 years based on projections sui's going to be the biggest city in the province not Vancouver yeah I mean that makes sense because Vancouver's already built up and Siri's only Built out and not even completely built out um and so a major inefficiency like the fact that we don't the fact that they have like all the sports arenas and like all the Entertainment District and all that stuff is sort of it's sort of like why
yeah why is why sorry why is Siri a suburb of Vancouver like can like why don't we just why don't we have cool stuff to do here and I love that mindset yeah that's super cool no it's great and so yeah so I was talking to him and I was just like look like I'm I'm I like to live my life via improv rules right and improv rules is you work together and you can't say no because no is not useful no doesn't give your partner anything to work with and we've encountered some some obstacles
within the bureaucracy and and the answer could be a barrier that's so high that it's effectively a no yeah but but no is not helpful and so like okay one of the concerns that was raised to us was occupancy and we kind of went okay so what's the limit there no and we kind of go but what if we what if what if okay what if as a requirement all the bay doors are open during these events cuz because there has to be a reason rules exist for a reason so tell us the underlying reason because if we don't
know the reason we can't address it so so so it's fire code but with all the bay doors open everyone can leave incredibly quickly yes okay but that isn't even the issue because sure I'm just I'm just with the number of exits we have I think we could do up to like 400 or something like that so that's not even the bigger issue it's not what we're cleared for now but looking at the building it shouldn't be a problem got it um the the big one is parking and we kind of go okay but what if we worked
with our neighbors because these events would be taking place outside of regular business hours and this is an industrial park so uh theoretically as long as we clear it with them it should be no problem to have tons of parking and they're like no and we kind of go but that's not that's not rational that's not that's not a conversation that's just well okay there's a there's a truck parking place down the road like literally half a block away or something like three of a block away uh what if we
worked out a deal with them uh or we or we hired out a parking lot a greater distance away and we arranged a shuttle Serv no so is the issue parking or is the issue that you're just an obstinate Fu what is what is the actual problem going on here let me solve problems and and talking to the GM um he seems like a problem solver cool and he seems excited to you w in that role problem Sol and so that's that's my whole thing right is sorry I didn't know your job existed is yeah sounds like you're doing
it well so that's my whole thing is I like problem solvers because this is this is one of those things that is a is a net obvious benefit to the city it brings it brings dollars into the city it brings uh attention onto the city which is what they want they want to be treated like a city not like a suburb of some other city and so okay well then you've got to have things happening sur's also historically like the the butt of jokes for for cities around here and this type of stuff might be able to
help them Shake That reputation absolutely Langley too Cloverdale all around here but they've got to have the right attitude they've got to have the right attitude in order to make that work and it just seems like we have finally reached the level um where it's stuff done it's a get her done attitude instead of a follow the rules attit like one of the things that we ran into is that um in an industrial Zone you can have Recreation but not entertainment so you can actually get a 
hul but you can't play computer games and so that's one of those things and yeah so the pro so that's one of those things that's like clearly an arbitrary distinction icky yeah yeah someone somewhere in the bingo gaming industry got that pushed through at some point and and so I'm just kind of sitting here going look uh there's a there's a charity event that um Ivon and I participated in where you can repel off of one of the towers in Central City that's cool yeah and so one of the
things that if they were if they were seeming like they were going to be kind of obstructionist one of the things that I was going to bring up was like look clearly you guys can do things if if I can repel down a tower in the middle of the city if if they got a permit for that then there's no way a permit to play video games there's no there's no way I can't play video games in a badminton gym yeah right but I it didn't end up getting there it didn't end up getting there
because it seems like and this is such a relief because uh poor Dan and Shawn and actually Jake too and uh the smash chams team and everyone has been working really hard to make these land gaming events a possibility and for months now we've been doing so with no solid indication that the city is going to yield and that they're going to allow us to do it it's been like actually a lot of work I live there now yeah I know the the IT team yeah and the vast majority of what they're doing there there is
some stuff there that is specific to smash chs's functionality but the reason it's so complicated the reason we have access control everywhere the reason the Wi-Fi is crazy overbuilt the reason that we have fiber and power running everywhere and all these terminations the reason we have so many security cameras is because I'm not worried about a couple couple hundred rackets going missing I'm worried about access control "and dividing a group that has $2,000" laptops from just random liil L that are
there playing badminton whatever else like it was designed for us to be able to run these events without the cost and time of doing them in a non specialty built facility yeah so we've really thought about it from the very beginning like how do we make this purpose built for land gaming on this side without interfering with the regular business over here when we want to do these  so hopefully that's that helps at least Dan for now I mean I I I love it it's fun to build things you know yeah but
it's nice if people use them after you build them I enjoy the act of building I don't care if it's seen or used by anybody and it's very important to like that you know I actually believe this I don't I don't just just for other people listening I don't think that I think there's an additional benefit it always is nice but it's not to be expected and if you're out there doing something for the validation from other people you should probably look into why you're doing it that's fair that's fair build
something for the joy of building it won't it be nice if other people enjoy it too yeah cuz it cost a hell of a lot of money oh yeah there's there's that there's a lot of that K pointed out uh only an hour left of Luke time that's not even true it's less than that cuz I have to be home by that time so uh I'm going to jump in can more topics can I do the Defcon topic yeah let's do the Defcon topic I went to Defcon and I didn't know what to expect I've wanted to go to Defcon since I was a we lad um
watching the the like vods of Defcon panels on like I I'm pretty sure I think I watched them pre YouTube even but I know I watched some of them on YouTube back in the day um I I'm pretty sure the reason why I think I watch them pre YouTube is because I have a bunch of them downloaded um like a lot of videos from Defcon downloaded from back in the day because I'm pretty sure I I got them off of you know before YouTube a lot of places you had to download video when it was on the internet so anyways um always
wanted to go never really wanted to go to cons by myself M and never really wanted to go to Defcon especially by myself because it's it's a it feels scary um so this's a lot of hackers there I went yeah quite a few this time I went with uh Theo and Theo CTO Mark um and Ed and not edel here edel a different Ed um but I I I barely even ended up seeing Ed because of reasons that I'm going to explain in a second U and while we were there we met up with Thor and or pirate software and and
primagen and a group of other people uh that are not as much of a fan of being named or having pictures of them or anything like that so those guys are also super cool everyone that I was hanging out with was were were just Legends but I don't I'm not going to name the other ones um what I expected we would do is you know go to Defcon and hang out at the show a bunch uh that didn't really happen I can't even read that no no you're good I'm just um what what really happened at Defcon was we we
showed up we went to the show floor for like I don't know couple hours and then we got an invite from Thor pirate software to join him in a hotel room where they're doing a a capture the flag like Challenge and I was like oh that sounds pretty cool so we went there and all immediately became obsessed with this challenge called the the gold bug puzzle um okay and this is what I ended up spending the entire rest of the event doing I sat in this hotel room with a bunch of hacker dudes on laptops and
tried to solve puzzles we were up until like 6:00 in the morning basically every day trying to solve puzzles and then we won we won the gold bug challenge which was amazing heck yeah uh I don't know how much uh it's okay for me to say we uh they all think that I can but my contribution is Highly Questionable compared to certain other people there um but it was really cool and if you're interested um you can actually kind of do it yourself still so the puzzle is still live it's bbs.com cryptv village.org
pazzles HTML and you can find all the puzzles they're all right here um the types of puzzles that they are this this was just this was so cool and some of the people there I I felt incredibly dumb being in that room because the stuff that people were able to pull off was was wild um but the one the main one that sniped me was chess there's all these different names for these puzzles etiquette chess uh charades pass a slipper whatnot um we when we started deciding like okay
we're we're pretty invested in this like Mark Mark Theo and I um I start started to try to figure out what one can I try to contribute to and I heard there was one named chess I was like okay I'm going to work on that I click on the chess puzzle and this is all you get there's this picture of this girl uh some text down at the bottom that reads A Horseman rides across bread comes dropped by a child reduced by one in file and then a chess game and you can play the chess game
um but like this is it the the solution for the puzzle there's just like a text box and you have to type something into it that's all that's all this is all you have you have to try to solve what this puzzle is um I could go over all the things that I tried I didn't even end up being the one who solved this but I might have helped narrow it down I don't know that's questionable um I noticed right away that the Knight moves around in a very specific pattern this isn't a
normal chess game if you don't interact  around the pattern of movement for the night ends up being important to the solution but I I was thinking like Reduce by one and file so I was mapping down the the movement pattern of the night and then the files are are alphabetical and then if you look at like a grid of the spots on a chessboard they're all letter number so I was reducing by one of each so you end up going down to the left so I like mapped out the knight's movement going down
down to the left and then I I started trying to like okay maybe the puzzle is solved when a certain position on the board is met and this was an agreement that a bunch of people had was like that might be it so I was trying to like leave it says you know breadcrumbs Dro by a child so I tried like putting Pawns in the place that the Knight was going to move to so it could take my pawns and like all this other stuff none of that ended up being the case I'm not going to give the answer of how you solve it out
but I I tried everything I beat the AI I I beat the game that way I um here let's go really quick where is it uh if I go into here nope it's not that one oh I thought I clicked on script my bad take back okay this will only take a second so you can you can like reverse your moves H interesting okay so I figured out one thing that we figured out pretty quick was you can make it start to play chess so it has Logic for actually trying to beat you um but there's only ways that you can even
there's only some ways you can do that so if you like hard oh did I just break it no it's just I bet you a lot of people are loading this right now um if you like hard charge down the board yeah and then just start taking stuff it doesn't like react right away but it will react eventually this just breaks the game you put their their king in check and it just stops working there's other ways that you can break the game where you can take over control of black non programmatically like you play chess
and you like confuse it in a certain way it'll do an illegal move and then because of the illegal move it passes the turn order over so you start playing black and the AI starts playing white so like I thought maybe okay maybe you're supposed to take over black and then win the game as black like I tried all these different things it ends up not being that type of stuff but we were working on these puzzles for essentially the entire event and that was so cool everyone on the team that we're on were
super super cool to work with it was it was very very fun it was very mentally satisfying getting the answers to different puzzles that was a a blast it wasn't even sort of remotely what I was expecting Defcon to be like cool but it was awesome um another thing that we did was Theo and I uh were a part of a tf2 hacking challenge where you have your your team is comprised of two separate units you have the players of TF2 yeah and then you have hacking group and both sides
help each other and the score of each individual component of your team contributes into one pool of points so like by winning TF2 rounds yeah you gain score and you gain like tokens and the tokens can be spent to get hints for the hacking team and as the hacking team captures Flags effectively they gain points that can be spent to give you like powerups in TF2 like crit bonus and all other type of stuff so he it's like that was super fun really really cool event uh and then we come down to the
badge yeah okay which I don't know how well this is going to you want to jump to loot cam this is the badge for the event so you have it hanging like this and if I left it here long enough it would go into badge mode it's not in badge mode right now um but you can also flip it over and it turns into effectively a Game Boy um there's there's the a new Raspberry Pi launched on the same day of the first day of Defcon and it is in here so it has like a new launch version of a Raspberry Pi um it has a ton of
features it has an IR sensor where you can like put your badges together and like transfer across um there's an SD card reader there's a bunch of LEDs all throughout it that are all individually addressable yeah so you can set up like color modes for your for your badge um if I try to get in here for a second oh it's upside down right cuz you have to put it in like Game Boy mode um they made a game it's going to be a little bit hard to see yep but as this like Scrolls through the game will start
and you you can like design your little hacker character and then you set the date and time and you can go through the Defcon convention hall you start in your hotel room and then you go on the monor rail and then you end up at the Defcon convention hall okay um and depending on the date and time the convention hall is like different and there's NPCs that you can go and talk to so yeah I'm setting the date here and time I'm picking my little hacker character trying to make
so the screen can see I'm in my little hotel room now that's wild I can interact with how is this a badge for an event yeah Devon is crazy so I go how many of these did they make the monil now that is one thing I was going to let people know if they do decide to go to Defcon in the future I would pre- buby the badge because you can buy your ticket at the door but it's not guaranteed that you get one of these you might end up with a paper badge that's a thing every time uh maybe not this exact level I've
seen some past badges that weren't as cool as this WOW but they always have like pretty crazy badges okay um you can you can get into the menus and like so on here I can change the LED colors so let me go to the the right cat eye sure and I'm going to make it there okay made it green but they're all individually addressable or you can do all of them at once that is crazy this is the most I think this is probably the most extra thing I have ever seen a lot of things at def gon are pretty extra um there yeah
yeah you can update the firmware on it like the battery Mount they just hucked it in there yeah yeah that part some people manually affix it I haven't taken it apart yet to do so okay um you can there's an SD card so you you can load other like ROMs for Game Boy and you can actually play other Game Boy games cuz there Game Boy ulator why not um people at the conference like this turned into you know how we we took the activity of gold bug and that like became our Defcon some people took the activity of just
the badge yeah there's tons of different things that could consume your time and some people yeah went for the badge and they they they put PM OS on it okay cuz apparently this is a touch screen no way I mean yeah I don't know if it interacts with the Game Boy game but yeah you can you can do I or I saw people using like a a pen to interact with it but yeah uh badges come with entrance fee yeah I think it's a $20 riser to to buy it like it's $20 more I think to buy the badge ahead of time wow
I just got a I got a photo for you in the game cool yeah or I got some kind of prize for knowing that the first Defcon was hosted at Sans yeah so it's like it's like it's an actual game you can save your progress you have inventory of all this stuff um how do I check my inventory I was in the inventory earlier on the back wh uh oh well anyway uh I closed the game oh yeah that's a that's another point is um everyone scared everyone scared me of like you know you can't bring your devices to the show
floor cuz you'll get hacked and all that kind of stuff so I brought an old Android 12 non-updated phone just for LS and manually and and so did yeah so did Theo we didn't plan this ahead of time we just both brought old notse secure phones in an attempt he wanted to do it for a video I just wanted to do it of curiosity and then I was like hey I mean if we get it to work you can use mine in a video taken my phone that honestly would have been pretty funny um and we tried to connect to every open wi-fi we
possibly could with these old unsecure phones just to like see what would happen yeah I'm assuming some stuff happened no really yeah they have a like security through everyone knows that everyone who's here is going to be bulletproof so don't bother or like or what about it like backwards like those would be unsecured devices connecting if you do stuff to them they're going to do stuff back sandbox you no no no no like Luke would be fishing backwards like wanting people to try stuff to my phone
and I'll destroy you maybe there's a probably a bunch of mine gam they had a wall of like these people have been pwned at the event um and it was like basically for people being silly um they had some crazy Wi-Fi security thing where on the secure network hosted by the convention itself you had to register your devices officially so they could track like individual devices at that level you it wasn't just free entry it wasn't just entry with a password you like it was wall of sheep is that what
it's called yeah wall of sheep and it's like if you if you goof and get owned at the event um but yeah okay what what Kaboom pow just said ends up being I think ultimately it no one's going to blow a zero day on you right so you're like standard devices like no no one's going to do something super sophisticated at Defcon right because what's the huge value there um but there is other things going on and people do get ped and there is Wi-Fi networks that are trying to capture you
like I noticed uh a trick that people were doing was they were trying to set up Wi-Fi networks that were open that had the same ssids that you'd run into at like an airport and stuff like that and devices were automatically connecting to it but I don't think they were actually doing things super malicious they were just trying to catch you to get you on the wall of sheep got it okay like it was a game okay I think I don't know I'm sure I'm sure there's people that go to Defcon and do things
that are bad yeah but like it it didn't seem like actually a huge deal so if you're like really scared you know don't do silly things I would highly recommend if you go to the show floor with a device manually turn off your Wi-Fi so that just in case you've connected to open networks before and someone tries to get you with the like naming a network as the same thing or whatever you're not going to automatically connect to it because your Wi-Fi is just off and you only go off to cellular data
um yeah someone said and Bluetooth yeah it's a great idea um just turn off things that are going to automatically connect to networks um but yeah it was tons of fun they even have a section that's just for like kids to learn how to get into uh security and and testing of different things which is really cool they had a lockpicking village where they had just like a chain link fence with a ton of different locks attached to it and you could try out all these different lock picks and and learn from
other people there that would teach you kind of cool um it was actually a very almost like wholesome positive event and I had a ton of fun I'm definitely going hearing you describe it I'm surprised that this was your first time yeah I've always wanted to go but no one really wanted to go with me and then Theo and I were both thinking of going and Thor was like no you guys are coming and it was like well all right sounds good do they have social engineering seminars yes they do how did you meet people I mean
uh most everyone's there for the same reason I guess right like yeah and most people that I met while I was there I was planning on meeting unless like Thor who introduced us to that that group of people that again I don't think they want to be named so I'm going to leave that out but um yeah it was it was it was really sick can run Doom yeah I'm not surprised people were talking at the event like can it run doom and and the consensus of most people was yes and it probably already does someone at the event
probably made this happen already y um so I'm surprised there was some drama around the badge I don't know all of it um but I'm not super surprised because I think there was a huge huge amount of contributors and to make something this complicated as just the badge to an event I don't know I'm not surprised there was some issues but yeah I I don't know all the drama stuff but if you want to look it up I as far as I know it's like pretty heavily documented on on Reddit and other places so you can go
figure that out Dragon 2 night in float plane chat no that sound was my back cracking they thought it was a fart oh no I'm  apple yeah apple is making payments more open I it's not enough Apple needs to do more and it doesn't make up for all their past transgressions but I do like the new I like the new Apple I like the Apple that is constantly paranoid about being investigated for antitrust because they're being investigated for antitrust in response to the European commission's
antitrust investigations apple is making a host of changes surrounding payments and third-party apps Apple is allowing developers finally to offer NFC transactions in app using secure element that means users can set their double click side button shortcut to an app that isn't Apple pay it also means that thirdparty apps can use contactless transactions for things like hotel room keys or Transit passes this is going to be an absolute Game Changer and should have happened years
ago so many years ago the fact that it's happening now means that Apple could have done it anytime they wanted they just decided they didn't want to the apis are open to developers in select countries in the iOS 18.1 developer beta to use these apis devs will need to enter a commercial agreement with apple and pay the associated fees however and that's where the malicious compliance comes in probably we'll see um Apple has also changed their rules surrounding showing pricing and promotions in apps
developers are now able to inform users of pricing information in the app and they can make purchases directly from the location of their choosing be that another app store website Etc uh by applying for an entitlement that Apple can approve or deny based on their terms and conditions however should an app link to an external payment platform while using this entitlement they will be subject to a store Services fee explained by The Verge um blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
basically it's a fee uh in addition to that there's a 5 % initial acquisition fee that applies under the same terms so this is this is Apple complying without in good faith just dealing with the fact that this is not going to last you you are not you're it's not going to it's not going to keep lasting you guys um there was the whole drama this week this actually isn't in our isn't in our notes but there was the whole drama this week where uh patreon is apparently going to be stuck paying
the 30% fee on everything that goes through patreon which compared to patreon's own take no no um oh what are the details there patreon is actually I I think it's well they're offering the options and reasonable how they're dealing with it um is they're they're offering the option for the Creator to eat it or for the Creator to pass it on to the user I don't think patreon in any case is eating it himself I shouldn't say patreon is eating it that's incorrect because patreon only
takes 8% of the gross so it wouldn't make any yeah I believe that's their cut um but basically apple is demanding 30% of patreon contributions which is ridiculous and we've talked extensively in the past about how the float plane model which is very similar to the patreon model is completely untenable it gets dunked if you take 30% from us with a 30% take we we don't have 30% for you to take from us it doesn't it doesn't make any sense this is this is direct funding um for creators and so if you're
taking if you're taking that kind of cut out of it as a as a platform um like like a device platform it's not manageable yeah some some people are pointing out like other platforms that people could use and stuff honestly I don't think there's a better way that patreon could have handled this just subscribe online or online through the web through the web yeah just subscribe through a web browser and I'm pretty I'm I'm I don't have the patreon app on my phone but I'm going to assume that if
you subscribe through the web you can still access their stuff on mobile like just just do it that way I think the the easiest way to do it is for creators that are offered this option to pass it forward to the users and then hopefully the users will see that and just go subscribe on the web um because I I don't think it's you know great for the creators to have to eat that percentage either  is whoa what is this Google's team pixel program was changed to require that influencers be biased towards Google
screenshots leaked from a member of Google's team pixel influencer program I've never even heard of this uh showing a Google form requiring the user to agree to preferential coverage for the pixel oh look at this by opting into this program do you acknowledge that you are expected to feature the Google pixel device in place of any competitor mobile devices please note that if it appears other brands are being preferred over the pixel we will need to cease the relationship between the brand and the
Creator yes acknowledge are people misinterpreting looks fake almost well it's just a Google form Google no I know what I know what a Google form looks like I just mean like like this seems so um this seems like something that you'd be too smart to put in black and white you know like apple never says this outright but is this like we've we've both never even heard of this is this something that they're doing for reviewers I don't think so I don't think it's this seems like a a product
placement agreement which wouldn't that make sense I mean I feel like this is a very unpopular opinion it would help prevent those really embarrassing uh I love my huwe whatever sent from my iPhone situations like I I don't think this is a reviewer thing at all what is Team pixel does anyone know what team pixel is I looked up team pixel and I found a Google Blog article that doesn't make any sense at all uh it's just about like # team pixel and it's if you take photos but I don't think this is
it uh that seeds early units to influencers and super fans to drum up interest as brand ambassadors okay so these are not reviewers for brand ambassadors it's not for reviewers this is a totally different thing okay yeah if you're supposed to be a brand ambassador then you're then you should probably you're a completeing idiot if you're going to like show off show off an iPhone products more often than the brand that you're supposed to be the ambassador for um however okay think it's the
change that people are are upset about okay because the program's previous terms which listed no specific expectations also said that member content should always be truthful accurate and reflect your honest opinions and experiences what does it say now um well I don't know that we have the entire survey necessarily we just have that one question a picture um it says Now by opting into this program do you acknowledge that you're expected to feature the Google pixel device in place of any competitor
mobile devices please note that if it appears other brands are being preferred yeah again though if you're a brand  sense uh reviewers are joining team pixel as well oh well I mean that's a huge problem yes that's like obviously and objectively a huge problem um yeah I I've never even heard of the thing so I don't know that seems like a separate problem though either way Google gave the following statement to Android police team pixel is a distinct program separate from our press and
Creator reviews programs the goal of Team pixel is to get pixel devices into the hands of content creators not press and Tech reviewers we missed the mark with this new language that appeared in the team pixel form yesterday and it has been removed okay okay oh why was the oh man how did this end up as a main news topic the FTC says no to fake reviews they have now finalized their rules Banning fake reviews online after spending almost 2 years working on them the full text is in the FTC statement
but PC World has summarized the rules like this no reviews or testimonials from people who don't exist that's going to eliminate a lot of them no buying reviews of any kind positive or negative I actually kind of love this so this is great does this mean that programs um where you like get the thing on Amazon and it comes with like a like a voucher and if you post a review they'll like give you something like is that can that just go away now hopefully um a lot of this like was this not already illegal
well apparently not even look you got to remember the FTC is not necessarily doesn't have necessarily much fangs depending on what the thing is and in fact they've kind of been their power has kind of been eroded lately um which is if this is what they're up to that's a really bad thing um for them to not be able to enforce this stuff I don't know what enforcement's going to look like but here let's get through the rest of it um no reviews from company insiders like yah obviously yeah no fake review
sites oh interesting how do we Define that though that is very interesting because we had that whole conversation around um air purifiers a while back and how house fresh or whatever they're called yeah yeah so house fresh to be clear it's not the fake one no they're cool house house fresh blog here hold on a second I'm going to see if I can find it these guys um yeah yeah here we go here we go here we go uh how Google's killing independent sites like ours and basically they talk about how no one's
ever tested and of these air purifiers but these large media companies have enormous SEO capabilities and relationships that allow them to surface their nonsense listicles above folks who are actually testing air purifiers and dehumidifiers properly um and it's like it's like a whole problem it's it's a deep rabbit hole but it's worth it to read that blog post cuz you'll be like oh my God I can't trust anything but hey at least you'll at least you'll know that at least you'll know that I mean I
would say that something that sounds like a revieww from someone who's never touched the product is a fake review personally I I don't know if that falls under this but should no review suppression now that's interesting remember remember when Logitech was uh blocking reviews on the g-cloud if they were NE display reviews on your site you display I mean look I haven't I haven't read this yet like as we don't have we take a principled approach to our reviews on our side the only things that
we filter for are um like harmful language hate speech things things that are obvious and nothing to do with people's critical feedback on the product uhoh what no not we're not having another cut open in the bottom of the backpack moment are we you screen all the reviews personally don't you yeah yeah that's that's what you're paying that's Dan's other job oh no no no no look you supposed to say all you did was disappear what do you mean look no I said look me yeah yeah I got him uh Dan
has never seen a review in his life actually he doesn't even know what they are um I'm impartial no we the the only thing that I'm worried about is with with no review suppression is would you have to leave that stuff up I certainly hope not I hope not as well um but that gets interesting because like where is the how do you define where the line is there I don't know but apparently the  is the experience we had then do you know reseller ratings.com no oh okay well resellerratings.com either is or
was um like a thirdparty review site like kind of a like an independent um Better Business Bureau type thing and basically the only way that you could respond to reviews was to pay an extortionate amount of money to them that's their entire model is they collect negative reviews and essentially use as leverage to make you pay to be able to make them go away um yeah so that was a whole that was a whole thing that's rough yeah yeah uh I'm going to have to go in like a few minutes here fine be
uncool you know he hasn't played Super checks with me in weeks months what a loser I could I could call back in if you want though it's up to you yeah maybe I'm over you wow wow wow wow yourself uh oh this is cool uh Steam OS 3.6.9 beta notes including included added support for extra Rog Ally Keys valves Lawrence Yang confirms they've been working on Ally support with additional handhelds to come the steam deck Twitter account also announced official Windows support for the steam
deck OLED um the Apu audio Wi-Fi and Bluetooth drivers were Linked In the tweet and drivers for the original LCD version are also available that was it there's nothing to really discuss here other than that super cool uh what is this battlefield thing here does anyone care about this the largest field for Battlefield I don't know I don't know anything about it uh okay I'm going to close that then I don't think I care about that I haven't cared about Battlefield in a long time just keep Rel
releasing worse and worse games another long running site comes to an end Auto blog is done after recently celebrating their 20th anniversary uh employees were told the site had been sold off and September 13th will be the final day for Auto blog in its current form um this seems to have happened around the same time that Game Informer was abruptly shut down by GameStop Auto blog has been sold to Arena group who used to publish Sports Illustrated uh this is really interesting and actually ties into that
air purifier story that you guys should go look up house fresh.com uh and then the how Google is killing independent sists like ours because you might ask yourself hey well if they're acquiring Auto blog why aren't they necessarily going to keep all the employees like how are they going to publish articles these guys get into it how what these groups do is they buy recognized Brands uh media Brands and then they just pump out AI assisted garbage um based on never having
actually tried anything and um just kind of ride it into the ground and then they go find another one pretty gross uh I don't know that Arena group does that oh here we go okay yep no yep okay Arena group during their stint licensing the Sports Illustrated name used the brand and at least publication they own the street to publish AI generated articles that were credited to fake AI generated people sick good job and that's it for our topic so um it's after dark which means
I guess you can go anytime you want or you can be cool and hang out with us no I'm I'm I I know he has he actually has something important to do I just I just like grinding his gears breaking his balls grinding his balls in my gears wait squeezing his I got a merch message here for Luke if you uh if you  torture I've got a few minutes we we can do one uh I miss watching your old streams on classic wow I was like yeah why do you never stream anymore I was the shammy that joined your guild as a
float plane uh do you plan on playing the war within I didn't have a guild called Flo plane who did you play with no I think he joined as has float plane oh okay cool yeah um what did you say war with no I I'm not interested in new WoW stuff um got in in regards to game streaming in general though uh my my roommate has moved out so eventually where the computer we have to do some renovation stuff did your roommate come get their stuff yet yeah nice it's finally gone it took like months uh
anyways that's fine um uh it's we need to do some renovations things now that he's gone one of the reasons that we couldn't do them previously was because um we didn't want to burden people with leaving our our birds at their place especially because they die so incredibly easily and I don't want people to are you starting to wonder like your bird's dying is like a don't even you can stop there that could that could end immediately um anyways so but by having by having the roommate gone
I'm just saying he eats a lot of chickens oh my god um they weigh 30 G each and you got to think about how much that is like feathers and B you're watching your weight right oh my goodness um Dan you know we're not funny right like we're not even a little bit funny no um I think it's just bullying like I think this is just it's just being mean at this point I think that's I'm sorry I'm eating   pie yeah you you hacked me well I'm going to sell shirts about it I don't even I'm just going to give
the money away to no we're giving the money away eating pie I don't even it have a member of Staff it's not buy me a pie anyways um yeah now that now that he's out we can like seal off an area and work on it and have the birds separated from that area so they don't get like dry uh drywall dust and y y y um so now we can finally do things that we've needed to do for a while and then once that's done we're going to move our desks into that other room so now I can stream without being in the middle of
the house with the mic picking up anything that you do and if you want to move around almost at all needing to go on camera um so it won't be like basically just rude for me to stream um and then the plan is to start streaming again but I also don't play as many games as I used to so it's not going to be as frequent as it used to but I still want  yeah looked purple I thought maybe I P a Jack Horner Luke go home we don't want you anymore yeah I think it is about that time I don't C6 maybe I should stream
the end of it maybe you should get to  it destroyed yeah you leave you leave oh look you walk away oh there's no you still can there's no recovering from that 98% of his body is covered in third degree burns oh my goodness I would say I'd play it this weekend but it's probably not going to happen yeah I know I know it's not going to happen all right it's me and Dan now lying to everyone what's up Dan hi just waiting for again I can call back if you want you want what call back
in if you want oh I mean you have to call back in to say bye oh yeah we can call them then that's legally required yeah no don't worry Luke we've only got a handful of merch messages that Dan created he apparently replied to the rest of them okay what a what a guy what an absolute Chad yeah talking about your keyboard Yeah well yeah M build it for me it's got silent keyc caps that keyboard man it it takes a pounding you know yeah like my self-esteem here heyo any lldd love the D Google video with
the internet becoming more and more subscription based and personal info Farms is there a way to make your own internet at home streaming chat Wiki Etc I mean I've definitely heard of projects where people have backed up substantial portions of the internet I mean archive.org is obviously an example of that and there'd be no reason that you couldn't you couldn't host content locally and then configure um yeah it's it's it's it would be woefully impractical for an individual but I know
that there are I know that there are companies that do some some significant caching of Internet Resources um Dan can you think of a practical reason to do that like streaming no no you wouldn't be able to stream except to anyone who it' be like an intranet on that point it's not it's not the internet any more I do know of some like you know cities or countries that have those kinds of underground internets and things like that but yeah it would be an internet but then wouldn't that just be
what the internet is as well you know it's just a smaller one I know that um a lot of isps have Clauses where you're not allowed to share your internet with your neighbors yeah but in this case like it would be yeah you'd have to have uh but somebody would need to have an entry point I know that there's I think it's in Cuba where they have like a a USB stick almost streaming service where everybody just yeah sneaker net yeah something like that yeah yeah there there would be there would definitely be
limitations to something like this but absolutely it is it is the kind of thing that could be built but the thing you got to understand is if you're issue is everything being like subscription based there'd be a cost to you know know hosting and distributing all of this and and so people would have to subscribe to your they would have to buy into this system so it'll be like you got to get your own Point too link and buy all these servers and then all of a sudden you've just built another internet
you've XKCD standards uh standards dit so then you could brand it yeah exactly oh no you could sell it as an MLM if you get four people on the network we'll move you up to Gold tier Dan like and then you can have 4K movies can you try to be ever so slightly less full dystopia all the time you know it's it's the only thing that lives in my mind is how much worse our society could be and every day I'm proved right okay good job Dan what else do we have today also why am I sitting why am I sitting here the
only one on camera you you ruined all my stuff I had I here I was like this oh yeah sorry now Dan's on the show got him cool let's see uh what else do we have I looks like you uh you close that one my bank blocks all International charges I ask them to unblock a subscription I was told they unblock for 3 months because they unblock the entire country have you all seen any terrible security oh dude one of my favorites is uh some of my information was compromised a while back
and I forget whether it was Equifax or one of the other ones um but I had to sign up for credit monitoring and basically I was blown away to discover that at the time I don't know if they do now but at the time they didn't support to Factor authentication didn't support it I literally was on the phone with customer service I linked them to a blog post from their own website on the importance of two-factor authentication and I was like you guys don't have this how is this even possible and they're like is
there anything else I can help you with absolutely blew my mind um I think that's probably the worst one that I've ever seen given the industry that they're in and given their companies obvious awareness of the importance of it honestly I actually no I've got more the fact that social security numbers and the equivalent here which is your sin number your social insurance number the fact that those cannot be changed or can be changed but with a great deal of effort is mindblowing to
me especially given that we've known for so many years now for so many decades now that they with the number of people and organizations that you have to give them out to just to function as an adult they cannot be considered proprietary information that only you know um I I don't get it I don't I don't get that at all hey dll why haven't we seen more cam 2 in laptop since G uh J DEC what would you call it J Jed uh officialized it last year year also you ever think one of the big GPU vendors would ever try
kind of Cam implementation uh no gpus are never going back to upgradeable memory there's um it's not an it's not a conspiracy theory it's not an invention of you know big PCB manufacturer that um you can run memory at higher interface speeds if you bring it closer and closer and closer to the die and at the speeds that we're running at now the shorter you can get those interconnects um the the more the more the better the signaling is and so that's the that's the main reason along
with the fact that the vast majority of people didn't take advantage of it that they moved away from upgradable vram on gpus um it just it wasn't practical anymore and so back to cam 2 and laptops compared to soldering directly to the motherboard it's even though it's no worse than sodium it's still worse than soldering directly to the board from a thickness standpoint and even though the signaling makes up for the um the limitations of sodium that have kept us from going Beyond I think it's 5600
megat transfer per second not a lot yeah something like that and they've gone way beyond that in some laptop designs by moving the moving the memory either onto the board or even onto the package like what Apple's been doing um it's still not as good as being on the board right next to the CPU and and GPU for that matter um depending on the kind of memory I think you're talking about CPU memory so next to the CPU or being right on the package so I don't know I don't know how much
momentum cam 2 is or isn't going to gain I mean I know Lenovo has that one mobile workstation I'm hoping for the best but um this this actually was a this was kind of a a controversial point back when we did our what is it stricks Point whatever an AI 300 review and I said that right now AMD does not have support for uh for non soldered memory and I I can't say anymore people people said look hey it says on their site uh that they support it um no note okay I'll say I'll say this note
that there isn't a single laptop design that has Soo memory note that just note it that's all um can't really say more I work as a drywall taper I'm wondering if lonus has any horror stories dealing with drywallers at your job as a painter I've seen some bad drywall jobs and felt bad for you guys love the show um I mean every construction project that we've ever done has had some really questionable drywall work done overall I think the vast majority of the people we've ever worked with have been
industrious and tidy at least as much as you can be when your entire job is to put mud on things and create dust you know uh but it only takes sort of one careless person to just kind of slop something together and go ah good enough I mean it's not like it's my building uh to create problems um I'd say one of the funniest ones that I saw recently was in the call me Chris upgrades so you can actually I think it's in the last part where I or no oh it's in the I think it's in the
float plan exclusive where I go after the shoddy craftsmanship of the of the drywalling at her place and just how bad her paint job is both because the paint job is bad and because the drywalling under it is terrible got two for one eh yeah hi guys given how divisive some products can be are there any Tech products that everyone seems to hate but that you guys actually like what do you think Dan you got anything on this one I was trying to think of something cuz I feel like it's going to
be a cop out for me to just say PS portal again and to be clear I don't actually like the PS portal I didn't buy one I don't even have a PlayStation um but everyone seems to hate it and it was very clear to me as someone who really liked the Nvidia shield and as someone who likes game streaming in general that it um that it that it clearly had a use it clearly had a had a a target audience that um that would be very passionate about it and and people didn't really seem to people didn't really seem to
agree I don't know Dan you you got anything like what does what does everyone what does everyone hate I mean  which I'm going to come over there yeah there we go no the camera's backwards yeah there you go yeah exactly uh no I can't think of anything that like everyone seems to hate seems like everybody like likes everything was the call me Chris cab three years ago no I was oh my God yeah I've nearly been here 3 years now seriously oh god well okay next up any who did you guys check into doing a
collaboration with Edison Motors you talked about trying after the huboo with that Grant they didn't get under unusual circumstances no it was only two years ago oh jeez you guys are killing me here okay cool um I think we might have something going but I don't want to promise anything because I'm not the one dealing with it and I don't know all the details but I I I think that they're super cool and I think we're super cool with how super cool they are and we want to do
something together but I I don't know when I don't know when the plan is for that uh pingpong greater than badminton what say you lld I guess it's just LD just want to hear your thoughts on table tennis table tennis is sick uh I've been getting back into it and it's good exercise it looks like so much fun to play it at a high level but for me um I just I there's no way that I could justify switching to it right now because the the the learning curve um you could probably get more
courts in in Smash Champs right well I mean sort of it depends on the level people are playing at yeah man you see those high level games people are running all over the place that's true that's extremely true like I no I no no no no like mile yeah you can probably get the same amount of yeah yeah I mean you most people are basically like standing right at the end of the table and plinky plink plink right but um man no I I I just for me to get enjoyment out of it I would need to play at the
same kind of level that I can play badminton at and for me to play table tennis at that level I'd have to play for years or I could just spend those years playing badminton and having fun instead of sort of banging my head against a brick wall learning curve in 2019 Texas instrument tried Banning assembly coding from their calculators but reached a middle ground with coders after backlash from wano viewers what's your favorite time wano caused a good change did I did I did I know about
this I don't don't I don't know thing this is before my time there's there's no way this is a thing I I don't think this is a thing I don't think Texas Instruments even knows who we are uh Texas Instruments am might be in gaset W show assembly code what no there's no way does anyone does anyone know anything about this it says TI and calculators I assumed it was Texas Instruments yeah no I mean yeah that's I I I don't think we I don't think we did that um we definitely give some love love hugs from
time to time I remember the time we brought down the KN to a website but hey look if you guys know more than I do and and there's any information about this that maybe you can get to us next week maybe we can look into that but I  know okay uh hey lonus how much do you credit networking with your success as an entrepreneur I help college students with networking and would love examples that you have to use as examples I suck at networking I I have probably the smallest rodex
of anyone that I know of who sort of has a has a career like mine um I I literally don't even have contact information anymore for people that I have literally collaborated with before like okay I just mentioned call me Chris I I don't have a functioning contact information for her that I know of anymore um I I totally suck at like the relationship building side of things the the cold hard truth is I got into making YouTube videos not because I'm a people  person the rest of it all just happened
accidentally I just liked tinkering with computers and stuff um you are absolutely right to emphasize the importance of networking with your with your students but I suck at it I think Theo is an excellent example of networking done correctly basically hey I know a guy you should talk to this other guy and then you just do that forever and then everybody knows everybody and you're in the center of everybody's Universe yeah yeah I I I don't I don't that's just it's a crazy
skill yeah that you that can be your entire careers just doing that a big part of like my approach to the business has been we'll just make sure our product is great and then it won't really matter like if I play the game and suck up and whatever else you just hire somebody with networking skills to do you a business right well I mean yeah right that was that was that was kind of the plan with Taran like he knows everybody um he know he knows me he's one of the few people that like I know
but uh he has all those connections like that that's his thing that's that's not my thing exactly um support network is very important uh hey lonus I'm very late but just checking in to see if you watch the C uh SCF Stanley Cup Final I know you're Canuck guy when you watched from a prior video did it give you Joy to see Edmonton lose out not even a little um I mean Edmonton even going into the start of the playoffs I think Edmonton had the most Canadians on their roster out of
any out of any team so like while you know obviously um wasn't great to watch them beat Team Sweden um no I was I was I was actually rooting for Edmonton the truth of it though is I don't really I see teams as businesses so beyond just kind of the fun of being in the atmosphere where everyone's cheering for the same business um you know let's go team aquini uh I don't really I don't really care my investment in is pretty low like I I tend to get more into the like the the the the story lines of like the
players themselves so like seeing um seeing Paul Maurice for example who was like coming up on or was already like the winningest coach in NHL history who had never won a Stanley Cup or something like that or whatever whatever the the kind of story was there like how many times he'd gotten so close like I I was kind of able to appreciate it from that perspective even though I was cheering for Edmonton in the final I you know I didn't like seeing um I didn't like seeing that team who you know worked
really hard and who i' followed more closely and sort of you know built a weird parasocial connection with some of those players you know get beaten by the players that I didn't really care about even as much but yeah at the end of the day like to me the the jerseys they're just businesses these are just these are just emblems that are purchased by billionaire business owners uh it's not very meaningful to me um whereas like you know uh some some of the individual athletes I I can certainly get a lot
more on board with um like here in Vancouver uh the sadine twins are like Local Heroes not just for what they did on the ice but for all the contributions that they've made really meaningful causes for their reputation as being super downto Earth people um the fact that they' stuck around and continued to work at the organization even though they could have justed off back to Sweden uh the second that their contract was up as players um you know it seems cool you know it seems like they're
they're members of the community as opposed to just Hired Guns who play hockey right so and last one I've got today oh and uh a couple people have found the Wan clip as well when we're talking about the TI 84 looks like it was from June 18th 2020 um I know we both con lemon and no as well what what does this have to do with the wancho this is someone else's uh this is someone else's video uh developer CE concept okay wo handled the situation better than TI yeah I I don't think this I know about
the situation with ti but what I don't know is that TI acknowledged us or that we made any difference in any way that that's what I don't that's what I have  of okay whatever last uh match merch message I've got for you then hope this isn't rude but since he went and canceled the Marino t-shirt and Ma MC address mcknet got any recommendations for alternate brands of similar quality to you thanks no actually um hopefully we can bring back stuff like that more in the future but
um uh apparel sales has been a little rough this year especially with some of the the less boring stuff anything other than t-shirts hoodies um it's one of those funny things where I think we have I think we have a really strong reputation among our buyers for for creating quality products but that doesn't necessarily mean h how do I put this that it's easy for us to sell stuff that's a little bit more a little bit more stylish um so it's something that we're really working on right now trying
to figure out you know what an identity is that we can build where we can take advantage of our strength which is our attention to detail and our our uncompromising uh passion for making highquality products but also the sometimes kind of basicness of of of our audience I mean the reality of I'm I'm one of you right like I I I wear t-shirts I you know like jeans and you know like I I get it um but there's tough business realities for us to for us to figure out um if we
want to do more more Niche products like that yeah oh okay all right uh thanks for tuning in to the W show this week we we will see you again next week same bad time same bad Channel bye nice thanks Luke oh Dan you're you're floating in the ocean and oh no I'm drowning volcano oh  say Luke you're drowning yeah okay bye okay bye thanks Luke he really does care Oh Luke is a real one for that I ate way too much pie that was brutal
