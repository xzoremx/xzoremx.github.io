the EVGA classified super record 2 is an utterly Unique Piece of gaming history when it was released this motherboard and the two CPUs inside it would have set you back nearly "$4,000 add some memory case and power" supply probably a handful of gpus for that sweet sweet quad SLI action and we are dangerously close to a gaming system that would cost "$10,000 adjusted for inflation a gaming" system all I can say is for that kind of money this thing better be pretty darn
future proof it better be would you look at the time it's future o' so to see if the sr2 still F we put together a library of awesome games that still support SLI and we got our hands on not one but four of the fastest quad SLI gpus that EVGA ever built to see how this monster holds up 9 to 13 years later like the video if you think that's a good question to answer certainly better than that segue to our sponsor flexi spot with improved stability a weight capacity of up to 540
lbs and a 15-year warranty the flexi spot E7 plus is built to stand the test of time pun intended check it out at the  the very first thing you'll notice about the classified sr2 is its massive size this ain't your mama's eatx and it ain't even your papy's xlx it uses a form factor of evga's own design hptx that weighs in at a colossal 15 in by 13 and half their justification well where else are we going to put the two Zeon workstation CPUs the 12 sticks of DDR3 memory and the whopping s pcie
gen 2x6 expansion slots to even get that much Hardware support in spite of EVGA marketing this platform to enthusiasts and Gamers they used an Intel 5520 server chipset so as we mentioned before we've gone with the best chips of aailable for it a pair of xon x5690 Allin we're talking 24 total threads with 24 megabytes of cache operating at turbo speeds of up to 3.73 GHz and the word on the street is that if you're willing to risk your substantial investment "$1,600 each they overclock like wild on"
this board challenge accepted to make the platform more friendly to Consumers the classified sr2 supports non ECC Ram so the same kind you would put in a gaming system rather than a server or a workstation we did find that the support for it was a little bit spotty especially when we tried to Cobble together kits out of older sticks we had lying around but thankfully Corsair still makes DDR3 and they sent over enough sticks for us to Cobble together a couple of triple Channel DDR 3600 kits
will we get better performance than dual channel in games almost definitely not is it cool heck yeah it is is it soft no for that you're going to need the new polo from LTT store.com time to get this mama jama installed and  um thankfully we've got a solution the one the only EVGA dg85 I flipping love this case it's going to require a little bit of work but this case unironically holds up extremely well HDMI pass through for VR a built-in rear door for a super clean look an acrylic side panel and acrylic
interior panel not to mention ample Cable Management the only issue is that these standoffs are not in the right place though that seems to be more the board's fault than the case's fault going to have to mask these off three screws seems pretty good now something that doesn't hold up as well is the storage support on this board modern nvme drives require a ufi type firmware rather than an older bios type firmware and the sr2 it ain't got it there are hacky workarounds involving a
bootloader on a SATA device and then handing off to an nvme device but for Simplicity we've stuck with tried and true SATA 2 terabytes for our library of SLI compatible games now we need to think about power if we want to run not one not two but four 980 TI I mean "that's 1,000 Watts right there and our" CPUs are going to draw up to 130 watts "each that's over 1,200 Watts if only" there was someone who made a power supply that well okay you spoiled it okay fine we're using the EVGA Supernova
1600 T2 and the size isn't the only weird thing about this motherboard I mean look at all of these extra power connectors we've got two eight pins for the CPUs and then an additional three six pin PCI Express for auxiliary power for well potentially all these devices that won't be a problem for us though because we don't care about cable managing this build there we go we chose this particular card because it's a twos slot variant so when we went to add three more of them they would actually
fit without using risers plus I mean look tvga we had to go EVGA you believe a top-of-the-line GPU with a 384bit bus and six gigs of memory was only $650 practically pay that much for a GP with six gigs of memory today I mean not quite but jeez anyway we're going to take a baseline with just one of these cards then we're going to add some more she works it's alive two CPUs let's go what better way to try out our SI gaming system then crisis 2 considering it's only running at between 60 and 70fps at 1440p I
wouldn't say it's running especially well but that was kind of this game's whole deal let's see if our system can handle something more modern what about cyber Punk hold on hold on it doesn't say play again I wanted to play the new crisis cyber Punk but red launcher's crashing even with the Legacy patch that's fine let's overclock this thing man I do not remember how to overclock on this platform In fairness to me it's been over 10 years okay let's just try dummy OC dummy OC let's go oh it worked we are
over 4 GHz gummy OC for the win effortless little bit more voltage easy 4.2 dang CPUs are only at like 60Â° too this is why people used to overclock cuz there was a point I want more though oh my God that was 400 watts decided to go for gold here we went straight to 4.5 GHz are we going to get it oh oh she crashed 4.35 I believe no blue  4.2 what kind of FPS we looking at I'm Vibe checking frame view doesn't work on Windows 7 so we just have to Vibe the FPS S I would say it's not a lot better
but it's a little better I'm seeing far fewer dips into the mid-60s that indicates to us that a faster CPU never hurts but it wasn't our main bottleneck thankfully we have a plan let's see how many gpus we can stuff in here by the way did I mention we're sucking back like 500 watts with only one 980 TI right now to somewhat control our benchmarking I am going to look at this flame that's going to be our scene 93 fr fres per second and now you see why we didn't bother cable managing anything while
there are nine PCI slots at the back and in theory that's all we need cuz the first two are unoccupied and then we've got seven all right that last card is a double slot card and um there's nowhere for it to go that's where our new case comes in did uh Justin make this test bench oh yeah did he do it really fast oh yeah nice unironically this is how a lot of people ran sr2 I mean it's right in the name this was not a daily driver platform for regular consumers it's the super record 2 something about loading
up a motherboard with gpus that just man I miss it you know time for the big moment the quad SLI Bridge oh yeah now for the most fun part configure SL maximize 3D performance uh casual uh 400 Watts at the desktop 500 watts at the desktop no big deal this really is the Hummer of gaming machines all this brick of gpus would cost you "back when it was new was $22,600" accounting for inflation is about equivalent to $ 249s today but hey it's got 24 gigs of vram just like a 4090
maybe it'll keep up no that's not how that works that's not how any of this works last time we ran the unigen heaven Benchmark on this system it was with just one card we got around 2200 points coming just shy of 90 frames per second four-way SLI scaling isn't perfect but I got to say I was expecting a little better than that here's the thing remember that 24 gigs of vram well it's split between all four different cards you don't just get to pull it together every one of these has to hold their own
copy of any asset that's required in order to render the scene also this SLI link not that fast so the intercard communication adds a ton of overhead as they're coordinating who's working on exactly what what this means is that especially Beyond Two Cards the scaling is awful and the worst part is that none of that is the worst part it's hard to pick up on camera but oh yeah there it is you probably saw that micro stutter which is caused by uneven timing of the delivered finished frames can be very
distracting and make a higher frame rate feel like a lower one because of the hitches and choppiness but I'm not going to let that dampen my enthusiasm let's  go it's like not even 10 FP it's 96 oh my God hold on hold on we haven't gotten down to our fire yet we got to look at the fire maybe this setup is fire and all we're drawing is uh 800 WTS you know what hold on a second no no this is faster we're at95 120 FPS but that fire 140 150 FPS that's that's legit actually cuz we were
getting 90 something before the 50% Improvement never mind that two cards probably would have gotten to very similar numbers but then we wouldn't get to see the sweet sweet SLI times 4 in our top left try to launch another SLI game let's see how compatible SLI was with uh video game games back then all right could we have done 4K woo she's floaty and that 60 FPS does not feel like 60 FPS oh wow that's truly awful I want to see 1440p man this bottom card the fan just keeps turning off going
back on it's not doing anything while we're drawing 630 Watts it's actually less than I was expecting it's a lot less than I was expecting they're definitely not going to full usage nope I mean I think if it's all the way all four are being used so we are basically not touching our quad no we're using like one and a half cards something to keep in mind is that even games that support SLI don't necessarily support three-way or four-way SLI let alone take like full advantage of it like support
does not mean utilize Titanfall 2 yeah it was on the list crank it times eight  msaa I'm getting over 100 FPS 108 1080 but this is cranked 1080p by the time you put on 8X msaa you might as well be running out a higher resolution yeah but look we're using still like one maybe two cards yep all we're really learning is that the 980 TI is a really good card and we can tell from our power consumption too actually our power consp around 750 watts we are probably getting some benefit minor but  GPU 0 42 48
5054 so it's not that only one GPU is doing the work it's that each GPU is doing very little of it okay tried Jedi fall in order that's from 2019 here we go with a system from 2010 to 2015 depending how you measure it no I see this doing weird stuff in the startup menu uh but is using a lot more of the cards I paid for the whole card I want to use the whole card yeah 144 graphic quality epic epic here we go uh o this does not bode well that does not look like 60 FPS sir I mean it's using those
cards though oh yeah oh boy 740 750 okay never mind the power is being used and we're getting 68 FPS but that looks more like 25 oh yeah even just through the camera like it should be plain to see that that is not 75 FPS oh wow that was horrible oh did you see that was it transitioned highest we're going for it absolutely cranked 1080p screen capab broke I mean the game's working this is only 45 FPS and feels way better than Jedi Fallen ordered it at 75 we lost our SLI tracker though yeah we don't know
how much is being used very little it turns 5 60 watts yep Ultra Plus wow that is a very uh excited ponytail yeah why is it shaking so much why is everything awful so much oh wow what is happening I don't think the Witcher 3 despite saying that it's compatible with SLI I don't think it likes it at all but none of that is the fault of the classified sr2 so what if we took a more modern Jeep pu and at least gave it a chance to run these modern games In fairness to SLI this was the last
generation of cards to use the older style non High Bend width link and before gpus got this fast it did work a little better it was less of a bottleneck this feels stupid but I'm doing it wait a second are there even Windows 7 drivers for the 490 that is a great question I don't I doubt it okay the 490 doesn't have a driver for Windows 7 but you know what I say to that no big loss cuz guess what the 3090 TI does and also hey happens to be the fastest card EVGA ever made well fastest
card they sold fastest card they sold were you in 1440 before when you got the 130 number 120 what 150 at the fire what like 140 150 it's not that much better well we're not the fire yet I guess no but it's not that much better right that's wild then hold on what's our Cuda core counts Colin can you look up how many cacor a 980 TI has and then compare  has uh Vance can you look it up please sure he tries so hard as it turns out the total number of cakor is not that dissimilar with this having about
"10,700 and our 4 9980 TI totaling around" "11,000 does it maybe make sense that the" performance is about the same holy crap the performance is about the same wow actually power consumption is not even that far off no 580 pretty close this is obviously a case where the CPU is what is holding us back in spite of the fact that we're running it 1440p Ultra let's try a more demanding game crisis 2 was demanding for its time wow I mean it looks better it looks way better yeah you know what it's super h
though yeah we're probably held back a little bit by DDR3 as well our CPU even though we're at like what 4 GHz uh the IPC of how many generations yeah is really going to climb and something to consider is that if any aspect of this game leaks off of the six cores that are on the one CPU and needs to be handled by the other one we have to wait around for that qpi link between the CPUs you can really see it these birds are like yeah they just like stop and then go I want to try a couple more games
though this is 100% completely totally fine and playable this is freaking awesome oh I mean except I need to get good that's the only issue when the CPU is fast enough you will get a great gaming experience I would definitely recommend upgrading an older system like this before spending that kind of money on a GPU yeah but you can throw in your new GPU and then upgrade later if you really want to you could as long as you've already got the uh power supply head room yeah this is freaking awesome
400 watts oh wow and so much more efficient which tells us we are still very CPU bottle oh 100% our cards fans aren't even turned on I mean even if we are capping the frame rate that is flipping wild okay why is that frame rate capped though I don't know you know what I bet that frame rate cap is a big part of why the CPU is not causing issues as well cuz not just running it right up against the limit okay Jedi fall in order I feel good we're going to play a reasonably game on this ancient
freaking platform plus a 390t well plus A 390t Minor Details this is better but still sucks much yeah this is still very hitchy now give it a sec maybe it'll warm up you know what I want to do now what not now now but now that I've seen this I want to get those 980 TI running on something a little newer they might not be that bad 6 gigs of vram though I feel like this is CPU again oh wait no we're at like 100 FPS also it's not hitching as much anymore yeah it warmed up this kind
of settled in this is like perfect now playable perfect perfect is a stretch see it's not perfect when he goes to New areas and it has to load for a second struggling a little it struggles it is damn playable markedly better I'd like to see you play this game on your 13-year-old console oh yeah no that's not going to work mind you your 13-year-old console wouldn't have "cost you 1,000 to upgrade or to begin" with you know what else needs an upgrade this segue just kidding not yet I wanted
to talk about how much fun we had building this okay it was kind of a disaster and there were compatibility issues just like in the old days but like overclocking man we got a meaningful Improvement in performance and crisis for like 15 25 minutes of effort do you guys even overclock anymore we're going to link a community poll in the video description it just doesn't feel worth it and man and I don't know what it is maybe it's the polo shirt with the collar or the old
Hardware but this was an absolute blast even if the price made no sense and it was inefficient as all hell just like this inefficient segue to our sponsor flexi spot you know sitting is so last year standing is what the kids are into these days and flexi spot knows this that's why their E7 plus standing desk is so darn solid unlike typical twoleg standing desks the E7 Plus's four-leg design gives it a leg up on the competition boasting a weight capacity of up to 540 lb static and 440
lb lifting this extra support means Rock Solid stability so no more worrying about all the stuff on your desk toppling over just from you breathing on it and unlike some other four-leg desks it supports a variety of accessories like monitor mounts underes drawers and keyboard trays Plus with a generous 15-year warranty you can trust in its durability for years to come even the control panel is Advanced with programmable height presets and a USB charging port check out the flexispot E7
