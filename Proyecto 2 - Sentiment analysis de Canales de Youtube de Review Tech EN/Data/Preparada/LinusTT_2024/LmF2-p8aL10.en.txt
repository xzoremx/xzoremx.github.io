what's up everybody and welcome to the W show we've got a great show lined up for you this week but it is it is a sad day yeah today we found out that unon te has been shut down and uh I don't know I think it'd be kind of fun to well we'll do a quick rundown of exactly you know what went down uh there's been some commentary from Dr Ian Kress who formerly worked there um and I think it'd be kind of cool for us to you know all kind of talk together about what that site meant to us and how it's
impacted our our journey in Tech cuz it really for those of you who are relatively new to the scene it really was a big deal back in the day uh not so much these days and uh I guess that's why it's dead um in other news the telegram CEO was arrested in France this blew my mind absolutely blew my mind we'll be talking about that what else we got uh we've got a fake person a well-known activist that might apparently not even be real so that's might seems like seems like some pretty hedged wording here
almost certainly not real it it looks bad speaking of hedged wording a new version of winds uh unlocks crazy ryzen performance boost nice yeah maybe they should have oh wait there's a blurb oh I guess I do it after the intro   the show is brought to you by MSI ant lion audio pulseway our chair partner secret lab and our new laptop partner LG always love me some LGS and now luk and I each have one they sent over these new gram Pros for us to use and we finally have matching laptops they're
thin they're super light especially for being 17in and they're packed with some pretty darn good specs too you can learn more about them at the link in the video description yep we got some Mexican G's right  LG's oh by the way I guess this is the part where I should probably do a framework uh sponsor closure oh hey look look LG the amount of conversations people have had about the laptops that we've used over the years when they when they when they weren't sponsoring the uh the
placement they can deal with this one being a little awkward to start don't worry I'll do a really professional job the next time okay why don't we jump right into our headline topic today a non Tech has shut down they've announced that the company will seize public application after 27 years 27 years pretty crazy I'm feeling old that's a good reason to feel old I did I didn't even think about thought it was 27 that I started reading a ontech when it was like pretty established and it was 2003 or something
2002 I don't know yeah like 2002 was probably when I started avidly reading an on Tech um the good news there is a a small Silver Lining here the website will remain publicly available and the Anon forums will remain active or at least as active as as they are as far as I can tell I I saw a comment that there's no way to register on the site right now I don't know if that applies to The Forum but comments under the Articles you apparently can't register uh but people who have accounts can still comment so
we'll see how long that that um we'll see how long keep going Forum lasts forums are tough It's a tough it's a tough time to be a forum anyway the site was founded by Anand shimpy in 1997 when he was just 15 years old it was purchased by perch in late 2014 when shimpy retired from journalism to join Apple then in 2018 it was sold alongside other perch owned properties like Tom's Hardware to British publisher future PLC a former an nonch senior editor Dr Ian catus has released a video on the
closure in which he expressed that a NCH had been in Decline for some time it's it's an astute observation uh we we did need Dr cutus to come in and uh pull out his um monoscope or and have a look at it or you know whatever I mean that's uh  it's okay I'm going off we're going off script now a NCH was seriously like one of my half a dozen bookmarks in my browser like it it for me it oh dude lonus when when I first met lonus if he wasn't working on a video for some reason or working at NX or whatever and
sometimes even when he was he usually had a ontech open yeah like literally all the time it was it was like my home away from home like I had my email I had um NC and the Forum I had separate bookmarks for each just in case I needed to shop really really fast or go to the Forum really really fast I had extreme systems I had a non-tech uh I had Red Flag deals um at some point when I was doing a lot of trading I probably had like my heatwear in there that was that was that was it that was like my entire
internet World there were other sites that I read I read hard ocp read I would pop into Tom's Hardware every once in a while um there's a there's an extreme something there this this is an interesting one gur 3D like Guru 3D this is an interesting one that I've been seeing a lot of uh Phil H in chat said I'm amazed that Tom's Hardware will have will have outlasted a ntech as that place has been an Adin fested monstrosity for about a decade but it somehow keeps going and that is how yeah
one of the things that uh Ryan Smith who was the current um editorinchief at a NX said was that they were they were given the latitude to run the site the way that they wanted I mean I'm not sure that I entirely buy that because the anac that I used to 10 years ago did not have nearly as much like clickbait garbage on it as the the current version of the site but they might have been trying to at least editorially I think is what he was trying to say editorially they were able to run the site the way
that they wanted and I guess that should give you guys some idea of how difficult it is to run a site that is not just turning out AI generated or even just AI assisted lists of products that the writer has never actually ever set their hands on um let's see what else uh in his in in Dr Kress's opinion so I'm coming back to her notes Here uh this was the result of the gradual attrition of key staff members who left as a nonex corporate owners pushed towards more commercial
topics that they weren't interested in writing about um I suspect it's a little more complicated than that as well but I mean I'm sure that he keeps in touch with folks there from time to time uh what few new people were coming into to the company weren't sufficient to replace those who left leading to a negative feedback loop of declining capacity in scope this then led to declining reinvestment on the part of a non-tax owners and lower pay for Freelancers cutus also said that
additional layers of management made communicating these issues upwards increasingly difficult I can tell you as an outsider the main issue for me was that I just wasn't really interested in what they were covering um and I don't know how much of this is is topic choice and how much of this is how challenging the space has become like there's not there's not as much kitchy interesting stuff these days like I could see if I was shopping for an AO cooler like this is fine I guess but clearly almost no
one cared um but like what is this thing the number of like random small form factor computers from brands that i' never heard of got the most comments outside of the AMD ryen launch of anything that I'm seeing on the front page so far oh no you got to scroll down a bit though like what are all these what are all these coolers like was that the only thing that they still had a test bench for I mean and it's not just recent it's been for a very very long time that I just haven't been able to get
into um the stuff that they've been reviewing you can see like when there's something interesting to write about about they're still getting engagement um I mean I I'd be a little more interested in this than I think 16 comments merits it's kind of cool but it also kind of doesn't really matter it's a power supply and the things are on the edge and it's G going to probably be like kind of okayish it's probably not going to be the best one like I guess there's just so many there's so many
known known quantities these days um this was this was another thing that I had noticed with a ntech over the years was like enax who cares it's not 2003 anymore enax is such a such a small player in the Enthusiast space these days in terms of how the how the average gamer might perceive them they just haven't kept up and to be clear I'm not saying enax is not a valid brand or that enax makes a bad product that absolutely is not what I'm saying brand doesn't carry a lot of
clicks by its own compared to 2002 20 2003 when it was antech enax and irrelevant right like before ocz like stormed onto the scene before our power supplies were were a twinkle in burned out sure fizzled do uh anyway and before before power supplies were a twinkling corsair's eye uh enax was hugely important and it's like why are you guys reviewing two enax power supplies in a span of a month so there were times when you know I wouldn't I wouldn't accuse a non-tech of you know pay for play um especially
because I read Ryan's article and he said that they were left to their own devices editorially but I would see stuff like this what is the gecom A7 Mini PC and how could I possibly care about this how is that how is that out of all the bazillion things that you could cover the thing that you want to cover I guess it's a pretty easy category to cover is it also like who they have like someone likes doing those and specializes in those so they're just like it's freelance writing I don't know
man like this is a tough one because like you on the one hand you know I okay I hear something like that and I go well management needs to manage that person you know they need to kind of work with them to develop an interest in something else something that um that that is that is commercially viable and in the case of a non-tech I'm not even saying like hey they should just do the most mainstream stuff I mean that's never what the site was commercially viable doesn't mean
that it has to be what uh you know what Think Geek or Think Geek uh uh uh what was that life hacker you know like back in the day you know it doesn't have to be what life hacker is doing it doesn't have to be the most mainstream thing or The Verge or whatever else it could be it could be a deeper dive but it just just it needs to be a deeper dive into not the uh I don't know here I'm still I'm still scrolling here so I'm just going to I'm going to go back to that to that last one that I was picking
on whatever that when I look at that writer um Ganesh TS uh when I look at that writer it's a lot of these types of things so I feel like this might be a freelancer who's just interested in these types of things I don't know if it's a management situation but then the other side of it is like as as someone who works at a place is it not considering if the work that you're doing is commercially viable and will continue to keep you gainfully employed and maybe maybe this is like
oldfashioned or something but when I was at NC I worried a lot about the value of the work that I was doing like I know you're the same way if it didn't feel valuable um not only did I not feel personally fulfilled by it but I was stressed by it well yeah cuz you start to wonder like if if the wall start to crumble are you the easiest thing to drop yeah right so you you you question the value that you're bringing you don't have to be the most valuable member of a team but you never want to be an obvious
place to cut yeah um and so I don't know I just I I look at a lot of the editorial decisions that were made in terms of what to cover and you know what was taking up space on the homepage and I just it doesn't it doesn't surprise me that readership fell P kinetic says if you're a freelancer do you care yeah yeah don't you like your freelance checks you still have where do they come from job yeah yeah um it still matters and it's like your portfolio right like if my if if my portfolio and
to be clear I've I've never met um I've met Ryan I haven't met I don't think certainly I haven't had a long conversation with anyone else on the who's on the team now be super clear I'm not saying it's uh this person's fault yeah it's nothing it's absolutely nothing personal but like as a freelancer wouldn't I want my portfolio to be something someone that I send it to wants to read and it's it's possible this person did and might have wanted to do something else and they they had them on the team as a
like Mini PC person or something and that's just what they want yeah but then that's a management issue I do agree so that's what I'm saying I'm not blaming anybody I'm just saying you know as a team you got to kind of at some point look at what you're doing and go hey is this valuable is this um is this moving the needle yeah and I you know there's a lot to be said for you know the Integrity of you know being interesting and passionate about something and and single-mindedly pursuing that regardless
of you know whether um whether your particular art because I don't I don't see writing a review as as a as a purely uh scientific Endeavor I think that there's an there's an art to making it engaging and making it accessible and making it interesting I I think as well like looking at this not going to lie I think it's just there isn't interesting things like they're releasing so many articles yeah the stuff's just not there yeah and like I was okay like there was some stuff that I was looking at um I
hate to pick on Ganesha again cuz it's like SSD reviews like portable SSD reviews and I'm like really but then SSD reviews were one of the things that a non Tech really set themselves apart from like when I was learning how to test ssds I read a lot of Anan Tech articles anan's original review of the x25 series was what ultimately drove me to like get super into them and pay a bunch of money to get them for myself um which is why I made videos is this going to be your like
this that I get I got called out for SSD versus hard drives and like SSD buyer guides and stuff like this like you got called out for it yeah because back then uh people didn't get it because they thought that it was all about boot times so that was why I that was why I came up with this idea of putting together like a bunch of practical tests to show people that it wasn't just boot time so I would do like application launches and game uh game loading and stuff like that
and I did like a side by-side drag race um because a lot of the a lot of the marketing from the SSD makers and from the system makers was just boot times and I was like well that's stupid you don't you don't boot up your computer very often no wonder people think these things are stupid because you got to understand back then the price was so high for an SSD and we were so used to waiting around for our hard drives that it it felt like people called me shill they called me ignorant they called me
whatever they called me all kinds of things for saying hey no ssds but it was actually like a non's coverage that that got me really interested in them and got  them I really think though that there's content on here that they're doing just because they need something to fill the pipeline like power supplies there's a lot of them they're not super interesting to all the viewers but there's a ton of them so they can fill the pipeline coolers I don't think their cooler reviews are getting a ton of traffic but
there's a ton of coolers so you can make a lot of topics part of the issue I'm I I haven't actually thought about a non-tech in so long because I just stopped reading because it got really boring but part of the issue is that they're still doing a really old school style of article they're reviewing a cooler you don't review a cooler anymore you round up a bunch of price comparables and they did roundups back in the day but maybe the issue is that they just don't have the the budget and
time for it right like we don't we don't know all the constraints an interesting let's just have a business meeting on the show oh um why are we doing that then so the idea is that so to power supplies like are you talking power supplies specifically um everything so the idea right now just for because not a lot of people go to the website uh right now we have mice keyboards graphics cards power supplies so I think that we definitely need to figure out what our Focus needs to be
but I can tell you that the reason that we started with power supplies was it's supposed to be something that we can automate to a significant degree um I don't know how deep you want to get into this business business meeting um oh that oh but sure I don't know the representations to me about the degree to which they could be automated have been very different from how the situation actually is yeah so um I I mean we haven't really talked about this much but Luke is the interim head of the
labs right now and has been doing a deep dive into how things are going over there and why are we doing power supplies Public Service on I need something that starts with the U undertaking oh nice okay there's the reason I want to know I want to know which ones are bad Luke when we do a budget build guide I want to know if it's going to blow up okay here's something you can't put a price tag on we did a video recently where okay so but the reason sorry let me finish let
me finish we did a video recently where we bought systems from people on Facebook Marketplace we bought three systems for $900 and in one of them they used a game max power supply now in the old days I would have said I've never really heard of these guys they don't seem particularly reputable but I have nothing to say positive or negative from my own personal experience about the quality of this unit thanks to LT Labs I was able to say the game Max products that we've tested have failed our testing these
this is not a reputable brand that knowledge has been now passed to the million and a half or so people or 1.1 or 1.2 million people who watched that video and we wouldn't have known unless Lucas did his F work that he's doing not me yeah yeah l oh yeah sorry Lucas new the tall one the really yeah yeah very tall very smart yeah super cool guy if if Lucas hadn't done his work and I believe Onie did the write up for that one yep and if Sammy hadn't you know worked on how the visualizations for
these things work if those people hadn't done that work we wouldn't know because who is out there testing this stuff because it's not profitable an onch well they weren't they didn't test any game Max anything they just test thermal T and enax for some reason but here's here's okay here's a conflict of interest problem though we're just we're we're continuing the uh the business about Linus's um framework power supply investment that's not what I meant uh PSU linked no that's not what it's 
circuit um on all right we're on your laptop we're on your laptop you're not in charge of labs now are you um there's there's been conversations around this because this is this is PSU circuit right um and some of these don't get very many views and now it has been disc that this is supposed to be just like again a community service thing so okay but it has also not community service not of neither of us has been convicted of a crime as yet oh no you can do can you do
that without well I think the I think it would be called volunteering I guess yeah okay fair enough yeah I think the connotation of community service is that you had it coming yeah fair enough okay uh cuz PE people have been pointing at things like the the seic focus gx750 and going like okay this is not the launch so the launch one got 10K and then they got 2K after that for a little bit and then they started faltering Sama no one cared thought Sonic did pretty good but
this one this one did pretty good and then after that yep so it's going to have to be a mix it's going to have to be a mix of basically it needs to be a mix of the things people are buying but then like and the things people shouldn't be buying but this Sama one has gotten some flak this is again this is internal business meeting you guys are here as an accessory we thank you for audience thanks for attending yeah this is actually really efficient because we're able to host a video while also having a
conversation that we would have had to have anyway yeah so this one there's a lot of reasons to test this one one of  it's the logo and stuff makes it really feel like it's a seic power so it's tricking some people so by getting the information out there making very searchable all that type of stuff um we're still fitting that category but then this is getting negative Flack because it didn't perform very well so it's like we have to try to we're getting oh are we're getting Flack
because we covered it no no no no no no uh oh like internally people are questioning why we're bothering well with the whole Channel but also specifically with that it's going to have to be a mix it's going to have to be a mix we're going but then we can't yeah if it's if it has to be a mix then we can't stress the performance of the individual videos and the performance of the individual pages no no what no we can't yeah yeah okay all right I mean did I I don't remember
maybe we've had a lot of talks probably not I don't know I think that the mix that we've had so far has been a little weird like the fact that almost every power supply has been uh 750 watt yeah that's changing yeah so like I I will also credit that I mean it started changing before I came in yeah yeah yeah not that's not a me I just mean there's definitely some stuff that we've got to do to to optimize the mix here um there should definitely be more you know your Corsair your seic your your reputable
Brands um I I would like to really focus on the stuff that people are buying like the fact that we don't have like a thermal T smart 430 watt in there is is in my in my opinion and look I you know I haven't been handholding this um I so I I haven't necessarily given this feedback before so my apologies is if this is a surprise to anybody but the fact that we don't have like a 430 WT thermal take in there is is a huge Miss to me because the number of people that are buying these things is enormous we
can see that in the reviews on sites like Newegg and Amazon and what I want to know as someone who is you know in charge of recommending products to people is okay but how bad is it yeah is it that bad like is it is it is it bad like it's going to fail does it break your system in a year is it is it bad like when it fails it could light on fire I need to know this stuff and so power supplies I'd say is probably the vertical that we are closest to in terms of the vision for how the lab is
supposed to function and I have actually repeatedly talked about PS circuit as something that I consider to be a win yes I know that I've been trying to explain to people why that's true um because this is what we are trying to do and it's going to take a long time for people to but this is this is something that's really important to slam home for people because of a conversation that we had during this topic a little bit earlier where were talking about how people don't necessarily want to work on
things that don't like do well so it's really important to communicate to a team that like you know the the web article getting of views we impacted literally even if we account for that people don't watch the entire video we impacted hundreds of thousands of people and made them aware that this brand is sketchy they wouldn't have known otherwise no one's covering this included in an LTT video okay yeah yeah "cuz the game max circuit video got 1,500" views sure I was one of
them and now I know right like that's what we're doing that's what we're that's what we're trying to do and it's going to take it's going to take time to to build out the verticals that we want to build out it's going to take time to automate what we need to automate there's a lot of that to be done um there's a there's a lot also like I know there's been some criticism put towards the the lab in regards automation cuz some people have pointed out like uh the more you automate stuff
the more you remove the human touch and you're less likely to catch things and stuff um we're not trying to automate a lot of those types of things to be clear and I'm not trying to increase Automation in the labs actually necessarily to increase the amount that they can even do necessarily I'm trying to make it so they can spend more time verifying results and retesting things and doing things like that um so yeah it's okay um okay uh I don't think we ever actually ended up finishing the I do
think it's it's an interesting thing to consider though that yeah pretty much all of the things that you just pointed at for an nonch yep we are diving into head first attempting to do the same thing but what percentage of our headcount is  circuit it's going to be three people okay which is a pretty considerable amount but it takes a very noticeable amount of time but is there a benefit to the projects that the other people are working on that do make money to having this resource and to having this
knowledge yes all right but it's just you know I'm just saying I'm just saying I have a vision L I have a vision right now I'm having a vision and to be clear I I think some people might be getting squiggly legs right now um I support the labs project I'm just trying to push him a little bit um look I will I'll defend it all day yeah I'll defend it all day because I'm just I'm just saying all the criticisms that you Lobby towards a NCH are the exact same things that we are
doing but what a NCH planning to do what a NCH doesn't have is it doesn't have LT yeah LT is is basically this like Evolution machine it is it is it is taking the feedback from the community it is processing it through the writing team through me and it is constantly shifting and changing and sometimes it changes forward sometimes it changes backward but it's constantly trying new things in order to increase engagement in order to make sure that this business stays sustainable sustainable in order to feed
resources back into the machine that is supposed to build these resources that will in turn make LT more authoritative which will in turn bring more viewership and more resources which will allow us to continue to build it the way that I've been seeing it is that um some people have said that the LT Labs team is supposed to be a support department for writing and I don't necessarily see it that way I think we are we are supposed to support yes but we're supposed to support the content
creation of the company that doesn't necessarily just mean writing that doesn't necessarily mean a singular part of writing that just means content creation within the company at all um that also includes the lab's website which is technically a separate thing from Labs but we're supporting the content of the labs website um and a lot of the ways that we do that is like this constant generation of of Articles and reviews that we're doing say on the website um in reality do we really expect the those
articles to make enough money to be like this awesome business within lus Media Group um cop cough look at what's happening to Anand no not really but by doing that we're going to keep up to speed we're going to be in the dirt of what's happening with these components all the time so we ideally know what's going on or have at least a good idea of what's going on because we'll be trying things out all the time will we be able to catch everything no um but it should keep our level of educated on all of
these topics up quite High that's the goal and you know what it's been slow and uh it's we're not going to we're not going to rush anything uh at this point so it's going to take in some situations we are slowing down yeah and we're going to take as as long as we need to take and uh godp speed heck yeah um all right topic two says our paper over there the telegram CEO was arrested in France yeah pavl DAV the CEO of telegram arrested this week on suspicion of failing to act against
elicit actions on the surface service such as drug trafficking fraud and the exchange of child sexual assault material his arrest has caused a debate about free speech and government  um you can't even say his name is this like your personal Voldemort now no but  stupid with figures such as Elon Musk and Edward Snowden publicly defending durov as if Twitter doesn't follow all of the the rules with respect to you know back doors and whatever else it's like it's only some irrelevant Market in
South America that they'll go to they'll go to bat against get give it a rest anyway Edward Snowden has at least some some street cred here um durov certainly seems to have a history of resisting government influence now he seems to actually have a history of it not just a history of being a blowhard um in 2006 he created the facebook- like social media site now called VK in his native country of Russia it quickly became adopted by Russia's political opposition the Kremlin allegedly began pressuring
der off to sell the site to more State sympathetic parties in 2011 and when the Kremlin pressures you to do something you either do it or you end up dead it's actually very different from the kind of bleeding about um you know political censorship or whatever else that happens from some people um DAV left Russia in 2014 claiming it was to avoid requests from the Kremlin to hand over the data of Ukrainian protesters though he did succumb to pressure and sell his VK shares to be clear government censorship
does happen here just the bleeding or not um it's it's just yeah it's very different from hey you should sell your shares and then if you don't then you um you jump out of a window um and shoot yourself in the back of the head at the same time yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah um very crafty all right while telegram has a reputation for lack moderation DAV gave an interview to Financial Times this March where he claimed telegram planned to improve moderation within the year using AI
related mechanisms though he stated he didn't think the app should police people unless they cross red lines um it's not clear what those lines are to him this arrest has reignited the conversation on endtoend encryption since DAV was also charged with providing encryption without the  declaration but telegram's encryption is actually pretty bad says our not it's not on by default the setting is not the easiest thing to find it only works for one-on-one conversations and can only be
enabled when your conversation partner is also online interesting which I we I have to confess I actually didn't know that I knew signal was like the better one um but I I actually didn't know these these details so is it is it actually bad or are the settings just bad cuz it said the encryption is bad but is is that true if it only Works while your partner's online it leaves a lot of room for error can only be enabled when the partner is online is also online yeah I'm assuming you turn it on and then
it's on for that conversation yeah that's to me that's a really poor mechanism for encryption if I am using an app that I think is encrypt mean that the encryption itself okay no no no I'm not saying AES whatever like the actual encryption I'm saying the implementation of the encryption in the app is leaves a lot of room for user error is that a better way of phrasing it sure yeah yeah yeah I just I think saying the encryption is bad is is rough I'm trying to see is this the one that I use I
always get them mixed up the Wy in float plane chat says I've also seen some academic analyses that their crypto design is questionable at best okay yeah I'm I'm not even saying it's not legit I just I don't know because it's handrolled implementation instead of using a standard well tested one yeah there's a there's a number of people that are uh talking in float plane chat about how it's like got issues apparently uh or at least could have issues so Luke yes I'm trying to figure
okay whatever an interesting take that I read on this um I believe this was an article somewhere I was reading I forget the point is they basically were like okay here's Devil's Advocate sort of take on this you know I signed up for telegram I like joined some groups and within minutes I had offers for everything from drugs to uh human trafficking to um government state sponsored subterfuge like it was absolutely wild how telegram was essentially should you choose to unlock that capability which
is very simple to do uh was basically a a black market essentially um that's one perspective where if you were to go okay he's in trouble for you know what providing people with encrypted communication that sounds pretty bad or he is in trouble for essentially running a black market Social Network I have I have a complicated position on this but I thought maybe I'd let you go first what are your thoughts I don't know uh government enforce platform moderation is always kind of a
weird state sponsored subterfuge not centrifuge did you say centrifuge no oh who said centrifuge someone in the chat  right that's pretty good for Uranium what oh float plane CH oh sorry I liked Dan's comment um yeah I don't know um yeah like state state required moderation of of platform is weird um it's it it's it goes both ways right it's the same thing as the opposite state required non- moderation of platforms is also weird in my opinion like when people say like rah rah but my
free speech it's like sure but this isn't government property or public property or anything of the sort this is my random website we also have to be super careful with like free speech because Free Speech means free of government oppression it doesn't mean anything to do with a private entity that owns a platform yeah so like so so that's kind of weird in one side but then the government forcing it is also weird because again it's my platform isn't it so that's odd so but if they make certain
things I I don't know it's it's but there has to be some oversight right because you can't say uh like cuz you can't Harbor there there's the whatever being an accessory to a crime or whatever if I'm a if I'm a government and I tell you look you're not allowed you're not allowed to log anything from minors or even suspected minor yeah so like I legit support that I I would support that yeah it's a nuanced conversation but I don't think there's any avoiding that for me
um I support the existence of a platform like this even if I wouldn't run it um I'm it's scary when there are no tools to not be observed by the government because we have seen so many times throughout history that just not go well but the thing is that like they also you also don't want to Harbor all this bad stuff there should be there should be an expectation of privacy I mean when you sent a letter in the year 1823 or whatever the expectation was that it is illegal to read it yeah I
don't care who you are you not allowed to open it yeah that's like not how that works and that's basically all that telegram is name yeah right that that's all it is is it's it's an an implicitly telegrammed message to someone that is intended for their eyes and their eyes only yeah and so you know I look at this a platform wants to do that it's hard for me to say that they shouldn't be able to and and if they're Chad enough to stand up to regimes that would oppress people for communicating
about things that aren't human trafficking that are just living their lives and existing and that aren't bothering anybody like uh freedom of expression freedom of religion whatever the case may be then that's great like you go girl that's the weird thing like tools screwdriver here you could stab someone with it you can use a hammer for bad things this is this is an argument that works for so many things something that can absolutely be used for good can very often also be used for bad things
but I don't know you put yourself in a really bad spot if you remove these things that can be used for good because they can also be used for bad you lose out on incredibly important things I mean we talked about this in our in our recent um like hacking tools um where it's like what so we get rid of hamers yeah oh yeah yeah yeah good point it's the hammer argument yeah but like with the with the yeah with the hacking tools if you ban all the hacking tools then people aren't going to know
how secure their things are as easily and also the people that are that have the ability to just make them anyways because some of them aren't inherently that complicated or now that the like plans for making them are online if you're crafty you can make maybe a not quite as good version but you can make your own version anyways so like they're still going to exist and now it's just harder for good people to get their hands on it but with all of that said I couldn't look in the eye of a of a of a
trafficking victim who had escaped and tell them which is why we didn't make her own VPN and tell them you know I'm going to keep running this platform I I don't I don't I don't I I don't have it in me um which is why we yeah we don't do that so it's honestly for me it's the same it's the same logic I um I well forget her name um she's like super   no h i can't remember there's there's someone who works on another Blake's privacy platform and she's she's super cool uh she did a she did an interview
recently she doesn't do that many of them um but basically she was like yeah this is really important um dang it anyway well whatever her her whole being private thing worked then uh anyway yeah the point is yeah for me I it's it's really important I I support endtoend encryption I me too and and you know I think there's room for there's room for conversations around what that implementation looks like like should we be allowed to have an endtoend encrypted um you know very large group chat for example
where you could you could organize an attack or something like that and it's like well oh yeah maybe that would be bad but then the flip side of that is okay um the government has uh has has oh okay this is great the government has declared um that what's his what's his nuts won the election even though there's pretty significant evidence that he actually um didn't and people need to people need to organize so that they can gather so they can resist like that's why that's why these platforms need to
exist the only problem if a place is under attack and you're trying to evacuate as many people as you possibly can and Communications are being monitored so they can create choke points and you want to avoid that like there's there's lots of super legitimate reasons as to why you would want these tools and and the problem is that they don't move at the speed of a telegram anymore yeah so they move so fast that they're hard for enforcement to stay on top of they're hard to they're hard to
deal with and there's there's there's really there's really bad stuff happening and it's it's not like this stuff isn't going to happen even if you take telegram away no but these tools are so powerful now they can happen so fast no I know butes around in Shadows just so much more easily than it used to like I don't even want to name them cuz I don't want to I'm I'm going to anyway so get wrecked but uh I I feel like they actually they don't cater to this stuff a ton but it
still happens on their platform anyways but Discord yeah practically everyone has it these days yeah and you can set "up a server and invite 2,000 people to" it instantly and it all works instantly and the there there's no like personally identifying information to create account complete throwaway account knowing it's going to be banned in two days Y and not care and then just you're there yeah whether it's encrypted or not people are just going to be and there I oh man again I was I was reading some
article about this or other um and apparently there's just all kinds of like shorthands for discussing ilicit material that I'm sure there like I as a as a person who doesn't get into that um like I I could read a conversation and I could have no idea that it's even about that well that was a whole thing I I did not follow this enough okay and this is probably I'm going to this is going to open a can of worms I just remember a lot of the whole keyword thing that you're talking about being a part of
this conversation but the whole pizza gate thing yeah pizza and hot dogs and do you want lunch and all this other type of stuff where it all means something else it's like okay these sound like completely normal  know WrestleMania says yeah uh crimes use code words I love that he called them crimes I read too me too that's great thank you for that okay we're not talking about the pizza gate conspiracy theory around the like one pizza restaurant no um just the terminology didn't want
to bring it up I just remember there's a lot of conversations at that time about code words that's all um someone said Discord needs to moderate their platform better do you have any concept at all of how genuinely insane that would be it'd be impossible what a crazy task if if we properly like if we want moderated Discord on the level that you're talking about I hope you're ready to pay 15 bucks a month like or more yeah that's the thing like these services are only viable as
long as they're financially viable right like you can't just say oh well they need to H okay with what army right like it it can't even just be it can't even just be randoms like these people would need need training they' need criminal record checks you know they would need the whole thing would have to be monitored and overseen who who does it right Coman said or pay per server LOL yeah except Discord killed all of those yeah Ventrilo and TeamSpeak and all those services are gone
basically I know I technically still use TeamSpeak some of them like the team speak technically exists but like come on it is not the same thing and the thing that killed them all was was Discord because the servers are  know but you know you do know how to send a merch message but if you don't know don't send a twitch bit don't send a super chat if you want to interact with the show like this like Tara o down here all you got to do is send a merch message go to LTT store.com throw
something in your cart we'll have a couple of suggestions for you in a minute we've got some stuff to talk about throw something in your cart and you'll be prompted to send a merch message you'll get a reply from Dan okay which may or may not be useful depending on what kind of a mood he's having um was warranted they're always warranted or he'll forward it internally or he will curate it for me and Luke so we'll show you guys how some curated merch messages might look and then we'll
give you guys kind of the update for what's going on on the store hit me Dan sure thing let's see what we've got here hello Dan Luke and random beardless blonde dude uh lonus if when you retire from YouTube would you still do the W show you guys are big part of my weekly routine I would hate to see you go um don't freak out but Luke and I have had this conversation very recently and I think we more or less agreed on on yeah yeah yeah that the the The Show Must Go On The W show specifically I
mean it's one of those things where it's kind of a it's kind of an no-brainer because there's no way that Luke and I are going to stop like reading Tech news um there it's not really that much work for us to take the Discord chats that we might have throughout the week and just not do that and then point a camera at you know when we get together in chat it's uh it's in a time slot that doesn't really interfere with people who don't have a life slave as that is yeah it has very rarely been a problem
for me yeah there's that Katy Perry song I have no idea what she's talking about yeah we sat at a tabletop yeah we  tech oh my goodness um and to be to be clear like we're we still got we still got a mission right like um having having Luke taking a close look at what's going on with the labs has been really refreshing uh it's really exciting because we've we've got a lot of work to do um you know looking at the path forward for the channel Z the the various channels here um it's been
really nice to see LT on the upswing again yeah and this is big agree this is in spite of how difficult it is to make Tech interesting but damn it that's what we do that's what we do you guys are figuring it out there's there's been some real bangers that's what we do really really well we've got a great team um the sentiment on scrapyard Wars is insane yeah that was a lot of fun things are things are getting to the point where you can kind of get into things affordably again maybe a little
bit as long as you've got a little bit of you know scrapyard War spirit and you're willing to get in there and learn some stuff um which is dang it that's our wheelhouse right so man I'm uh I'm I'm excited I'm actually pretty good right now I'm optimistic um more so than I've been in a while to to be perfectly honest with you guys right like if you look at how the last 365 days have gone for the channel um you know we were in we were in a pretty rough State last September it wasn't
good and you know we'd have a a banger or two here we'd have a couple good uploads and then it's been this kind of this pattern of like yeah we like recover for a bit and then it's like it's like we've been swimming against the current for a long long time but then you look at look at that trend line what happens here in July and I mean even this low low Point here is not nearly what we were looking at back there right so you look at this low point in July and you go kind of like oh
things are things are on the up and up you know finally we're we're pulling it together uh we're figuring out you know what is what is the new meta what are people looking for um what is the mix that we need of reviews of things that people need to know about like you know Snapdragon x uh Snapdragon X or um like okay yeah here's one that didn't perform particularly well uh amd's new mobile amd's new mobile chips versus you know what are the what are the content styles that are going to appeal more
broadly uh like this one this one's a really good example where it didn't necessarily start out doing too great honestly like if you look it's at the low end of what our of what our typical ranges for video performance then it just keeps going up but we figured out how to do this more often how to find stuff that achieves I call this like uh escape velocity yeah right where where we're finding ways to make content that appeals algorithmically to the YouTube audience um in a way that we were
struggling with for a while so I'm I'm actually I'm really optimistic because we're going to be able to do that better with more foundational testing and we're going to be able to afford to build foundational testing as long as we can continue to do that better as we go and you know sometimes um the content that we're uploading these days has been a little controversial I mean that stock Android one definitely ruffled some feathers but I don't think my thing has ever been having the same opinion as
everybody else no and I'm I've been tired of that for I it's I feel like it's been like two or maybe even three years where for some reason uh people in the tech space have been obsessed with all the reviewers saying the same thing and if they don't it's like a huge problem that's just rough I'm not going to do it no good like yeah that's not good and you know what the funny thing is in time a lot of the time the discourse kind of comes around to my position do you remember what a
firestorm it set off when I said that ad block was piracy is that coming around yeah really oh yeah dude watching the when I said that it was like it was like I had dropped a nuclear bomb on my career essentially like you wouldn't believe how and some people are still super mad about it it's weird when I see the community wholeheartedly Embrace piracy and then you say this one thing is is piracy and they're like no it isn't it's like wait what but I never said don't do I never
said don't be able to sleep you all trading Linux isos on your Plex servers what are you even talking about like we meme on this stuff all the time yeah relax bro yeah um and and it's the same thing it's the same thing with warranty gate yeah what all I said was it it's only worth the paper it's printed on the value of a warranty is is Sol I do think I will say of the's willingness to fulfill it I will say I still think okay so I M it Terri I messaged it terribly it was
wrapped in like the worst packaging you could ever imagine but the underly I don't disagree with the underlying statement well you know what it was Luke was I was thinking back to a conversation that I'd actually had with another content creator who knows who they are um I'm not going to name this content creator sure uh but it was a conversation that I had with another cont content creator where I was talking about what the contingency plan was in the event of mine and Ivan's passing and
how the company could continue to operate and they basically said to me well my company is specifically set up with a poison pill Clause so the second I drop dead everything's gone everyone loses their jobs the brand can't continue because you know it could reflect on me post humously and no one has any warranty and I was like that's pretty up was sort of my response to that and this is this is a content creator again they know who they they are um and I was like nobody has any
okay because they they sell products or you're an actual [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] essentially right because like the the the level of narcissism on display was sort of mindboggling to me because of the the just the whole thing or the the warranty is not ending okay all of it the fact that everyone is just like instantly out of a job because because this thing couldn't possibly be good without you like are do you have do you have any concerns does it smell bad living inside your own rectum
like Honestly though uh do do you have is that a concern for you at all like I and I I know you're mad at this thing but let's hold on hold on so that was where I was coming from when I said that super weird thing about how whatever we put together should be something that can Outlast cuz I I remember whatever yeah should be something that is structured correctly such that it could be Main in the event that it wasn't just down to me saying trust me bro and making that whether it makes Financial sense or not
we just take care of it MH that was what I said but it was super weird the way that I explained it and it got Twisted by people who know who they are um and I think you probably should have just wrote down a warranty anyways but well probably but we also hadn't not written one down the product wasn't launched L the product wasn't launched that was the craziest thing for me I it's like one I think it was it was it was kind of weird like refusing to write one Luke but then it was also really weird how much
feedback there was when the thing wasn't even out yet we had the Integrity to not take people's money to we could have we could have pre-old the crap out of those products okay we wouldn't take people's money because we didn't want them to have on uncertainty about it because we wanted them to have third party feedback on it before we were willing to take their money Luke did we do the popup before the warranty no I don't remember no we didn't okay I thought we did I don't
remember no okay the whole thing was absolutely unhinged and it's really funny now because in every conversation around people like talking about our customer service you see people that are like like L has said like yeah I saw one recently was some the the zipper like peeled off a backpack or something um oh my goodness and like I definitely have thoughts about that like from a sustainability standpoint I would rather see people like go get that patched and i' I'd rather give people like a small
you know credit for that or something then send a whole new backpack but we stand behind the product and I I believe that person was offered a new backpack would that be a cool option there's a there's a lot of work is there some way there's a lot of work involved because sounds yeah really difficult yeah like it's not like we're it's not like we're a huge multinational brand and we can have like a backpack service center in every major city or whatever but yeah I mean there's
definitely there's definitely you know things about that that I personally I personally I wouldn't submit a warranty request for that but personally I I would stand behind our product right so sorry sorry I was looking at uh give me one second sorry yeah this is clean I was looking  subreddit someone posted that during the  oh man sometimes going through the Reddit is a terrifying experience and sometimes it's just hilarious there people got some screenshot I think it
was from scrapyard Wars or something and they they remade the like Drake meme where it's like no or like that one that's so funny I've been enjoying those I don't know great ski ghost asks what about those who were unable to claim back the $25 you promised only on buying a single new product we offered them a full refund at the end of the day my liability to you is absolutely not more than the cost you spent on the product if you weren't happy with the $25 credit we offered a refund that's it
that at at that point we have done all that we can do I'm not going to give you a back massage like I I said I said I said trust me bro not take advantage of me bro yeah oh  me not on the  this anyways uh what about front massage says that's a nice hatat oh man should we go through our announcements we've got yeah we've got wait well no we're supposed to do a couple merch we did we did one merch message I want to kind of change up the format a bit we do one merch message you
read all your announcements and then we'll do another one and then we'll move on oh nice look at this guy being a producer you know he's had the title for a long time but that that was some he does produc that was some no that was some Next Level producing that he just produced the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of us that's I feel produced we need like we need like a logo in the corner of his webcam it's like SSS plus I'm going to produce a resignation no I don't accept he just said we're doing wo forever you don't
get to quit you're stuck well we wouldn't be working together technically but we would still be doing wo the streak dude this streak is going to be longer than my underwear okay the streak  end you still wear underwear smells  too my goodness wow oh man uh announcements uh right right right so we've got some announcements speaking of popups uh yeah we're hosting a popup event speaking of not being willing to take people's money for un unproven products although honestly our engineering team and our
fashion team are getting good enough that I I might be willing to start relaxing that now probably fine I think it's time for us to just treat our our product design capabilities as like we're actually like pretty [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] good at this at this point anyway I do agree but the pop-ups are also kind of fun pop-ups are kind of fun so we're doing another pop-up um on Saturday September 7th we are going to be doing a popup where we will be launching slm making available our
brand new LTT Precision multi-bit screwdriver and bit kit and if you come to the popup you'll be able to purchase one of 500 numbered Precision screwdrivers as well uh are they numbered on them or where's the number it's a lasered onto them oh that's well not these ones cuz these aren't part of it it can't be numbered if you have extra to show on the show when we number something we number it actually oh man okay sorry I'm this derailment Luke and I Luke and I Nick and I had a conversation recently we
found a bunch of those Lambo beanis do you remember the the 69 only Lambo beanis and I didn't know what to do we found apparently for minimum order quantity purposes we ordered more than 69 of them also to have warranty and etc etc um because we said we would only sell 69 of them but I hate waste um so the conversation what what Nick wanted to do was uh do like a promo on Wow or something like that and and I basically was like if we say there's only this many there could only be this
many but our options are either to what sell them hold on to them forever yeah you don't want to do that or throw them away and you don't want to burn them which I don't want to do like the the fashion companies is it okay to give them away the chat says it's okay to give them away I think giving them away is okay I so so the numbered ones can be the ones we sold and but we could still give them away is that okay Gauntlet wizard said give them away in a promo that I don't necessarily know it would
have to be a genuine giveaway we can we can profit from more than just money like that's something that you guys got got to consider just because I turn off the AdSense on my video for example that doesn't mean that I didn't benefit that I didn't profit that there isn't that there isn't a a net benefit to me of uploading that video let's say if it's something that's going to get a lot of views it's it's not that black and white the world is about more than just money right so if I use it for a promo I am
absolutely profiting even if it's not directly financially um most people seem to think it's pretty cool to give them away so how many are there it's like 40 or something like I like maybe we had to order a couple hundred or I don't know or like 150 I I don't know exactly that don't don't quote me on the number it's less it's way less than a thousand it's more than 10 let me ask the audience this because I feel like they're the most likely to lean in One Direction um but I I feel one thing that I suspect
will be opposite to the audience so I want to check with them just to counter my bias um is it better to give it away internally or externally um because if you give it away externally then you're not selling it you're there's actually a lot less benefit I think we should give it away externally then but it's not always easy giving stuff away is not always easy like people don't need the whole fast fashion movement oh chat's mostly saying internally uh it's kind of both sides
yeah that's a company benefit that's a park now that we've provided so in terms of like are we getting something out of it we actually like kind of are absolutely is yeah uh whereas if we give it away externally and do it quietly so that nobody knows about it then it's the least benefit to the company interesting it's zero benefit so this is this is really important Gauntlet wizard says you're also profiting on any charity events by that logic y yeah that's like the whole
billionaire Playbook why do you think any of them charity anything a I made a billion dollars and suddenly I am now philanthropist that that there's also like it's a whole it's a whole it's a whole rabbit hole it's not even just the reputational uh management of Charity stuff there's a whole it's a whole thing but um that's that's that's one of the reasons we don't really talk about stuff much um although there is something that we get to talk about this week because the thing that precipitated the donation
was a very public event uh we ended up  oh and to be clear for the people watching for the Electronic Frontier Foundation oh nice "$20,000 with that uh got fish shirt so" thank you guys very much that was the full profits from that shirt very exciting um what what is what am I looking at here is this like a oh well okay whatever so here's uh here's a thing about the Electronic Frontier Foundation there you go you can learn about them there cool I'll pause the video or whatever so that that's
pretty exciting uh but but yeah that's that's the only way to do it is to to donate something and not talk about it at all um yeah and to be clear that doesn't mean that creators doing charity streams and stuff like that are like bad or like specifically doing it for profit but there is a benefit to it it's not it's not benefit it's it's less beneficial than them just doing like a A subathon or a donate to me drive in in of some form um they are still giving that money to charity is still
benefiting from it etc etc etc but it's not benefit Navy EMT says can you donate it to uh to a developing country actually that whole thing is a big problem so back to what I was saying about fast fashion there's now an excess of secondhand clothing because people just buy stuff wear it a couple times and it's so cheap they just oh yeah well I'll donate it and then like I don't have to feel bad about the massive amount of raw materials and labor that goes into these products that I'm
consuming and then using a couple of times like we I feel like there's been a huge mentality shift like when people would talk about people would talk about never wearing the same pair of underwear as like a completely unhinged outof touch you know Behavior we would laugh about it and joke about it but but now it really does seem like people will will wear a shirt a few times and be like eh out of style now I'll just pick up something new on teamu or or it's so cheap and manufactured so poorly that it
might be like somewhat destroyed by the thirdware um the logo is all wrecked or may not logo but the the thing on it is all wrecked or whatever else and so back to donating to other countries it's actually not necessarily a net benefit because what it can do is it can destroy the local market for those products destroying the companies that produce them making them forever dependent creating this cycle of dependency on like Teemu garbage that gets shipped across one ocean worn a couple times and
then handled a bunch of times and then shipped across another freaking ocean like the whole thing is so so inefficient um I'm not saying we won't donate them if anything I think that's clearly the position I'm advocating for here is that we we give them away externally but what I am saying is that it's not that black and white it ain't that simple yeah yep um yeah 4com 5 says go feed your local Ducks then stop the thing that happens next isn't nice um okay let's go back to talking
about our pop-up shop shall we lius cam here it is oh yeah wait how did we what don't worry about it okay uh so we'll have some other popular items from LTT store.com including our recently launched offsite laptop bag and oh should we talk about the product a little bit are we are we going to talk about this at all so there's a few things that make the new Precision driver really exciting you guys can sign up for a notification we're going to have that link down below right Dan
people can get a notification yeah I believe it's down there I will double check though so there's a few things that I really love about this kit uh number one is the driver itself uh super super high quality machined aluminum nice strong magnet in the end that's just kind of going to be if we're going to have a staple for our screwdriver products that's going to be it we've got in-handle bit storage that can hold three of our Precision bits which use the standard shank size and are actually
the standard length but with a Twist I'll talk about that in a minute speaking of twisting it's got a high quality bearing on the top that will spin for anywhere from let's say you know what I don't want to Promise Too Much let's say anywhere from 20 seconds to we've had them spinning for darn near a minute depending on how you get them going it's going to be yeah there's a lot there's a bit of finesse to it there's there's some variance in the bearings there's a lot of stuff going on
uh we're going to have accessories including uh different tops so you can have a concave top if you like the finger hold we're going to have a convex top if you like to Palm it and then by default it's going to ship with the flat top but you'll be able to get top kits and who knows what kinds of tops we might have available for it in the future that's the driver itself then there's the kit super high quality Case comes with a detachable top that you can can use as a parts tray includes a sheet
magnet inside along with little organizer spaces for the stuff that you're taking out of it there you go there's one of our bits in there and okay that is probably the worst bit you could have possibly put onto there for my next Point uh our bits are also pretty exciting even though they are the same length that you would find from um well let's say you know other bit dang it other bit manufacturers that we respect a lot one of the things that we changed was the depth of the um uh the
the hex portion so you can see it drops into our driver there and she's a little she's a little longer in the skinny part one of the issues that I've had with many of the Precision drivers that I've used in the past is that they aren't deep enough to reach into in some cases like almost anything yeah um depending on the bits so we're really excited for these to be not super deep I mean still not a fixed shaft screwdriver you know you're going to need a fixed shaft screwdriver sometimes and we're working
on solutions for that but they are a little bit deeper making the multibit a little bit more usable um and I guess that's all I have to say about that is there any other like major points that I missed here anodized aluminum endcap is interchangeable hybrid c h ceramic hybrid bearing uh incredibly strong magnet yeah yeah oh oh yeah right the driver will be available by itself if you already have an iFixit kit uh we we love iFixit they're a great partner we love their mission we're not we're not
trying to replace iFixit we certainly never will I was just to say not like all the replacement parts all the guides but we uh we're real passionate about screwdrivers really high-end tools um and we we really love this thing comes with 61 different bits standard philli specialized bits for game consoles all kinds of different ones and I think that's pretty much uh all I have to say about that for right now soone said what time is the popup opening oh right uh okay so it'll be next Saturday September
7th from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. at the Linus Media Group studio in sir wait is that the studio or the Lab Studio I was told studio studio okay so it'll be at the studio um he not reading this might be kind of exciting or whatever but do not travel far for this event is why we didn't give you very much notice this will not be like LTX or whan um we will have some testing stations for you to like try out the product um you'll have uh you'll have an opportunity to talk to some of our design and Engineering folks
about how we develop our tools and products um there might be a few other things um but don't don't travel we literally don't have enough capacity for a ton of people to be here and everyone's just going to have a bad time if people are trekking out here from like wherever stand um so please don't uh yeah okay cool oh right there's a couple of other things for the store uh scribe drivers um the pen are now available to order again uh if you missed out on the last two drops or you're looking to buy
more you can secure yours on back order at lg. g/ pen uh so that's a good candidate if you guys want to send a merch message today I still haven't even been able to get one you don't have one yet no wow Get Wrecked scrub I tried to buy them in the last wave I couldn't get  enough I want to like to put a request in for you right now no it's fine it's fine well okay this is not a rule etc etc etc I don't like putting in merch requests when customers can't get them so if the thing is perpetually sold out
it's very Noble of you plof literally took a a small break from the shoot that we were doing together sat on his laptop ordered one and then came back and I was like what were you doing he was like  really yeah so I I want it to like be able to exist on the store for more than you know a couple days and then I'll try to get one I mean you got keys in your head of instructure you could just turn off the cameras in 107 and just go go  handful that's really smart you can't joke about that smart you can't even
joke about that it's just he's a smart guy yeah it's not like there's like massive amounts of logs and all of us get emails all the time if anybody would try to do something like that yeah it would be pretty obvious um okay last couple things people V by chat are like gra grab me one I mean you could just do ITT I got you fam oh man um last announcement is we are resuming our sponsor partnership with Asus uh we stopped working with them on January 5th of this year due to
issues that we were seeing um through our community feedback team or through our community feedback mechanisms on the Forum um I oh oh look at this Asus timeline what is this oh wow Colton put together a little document for me uh so in 2022 late 2022 we saw the first Asus complaints on the Forum in um second quarter of 2023 we saw a detailed post about someone having issues with Asus support um followed shortly by some more issues and an influx of complaints regarding Asus like
GPU mobos with display issues in early May of that year we told Asus that if we didn't see improvements or if they didn't do anything to address complaints we'd have to consider pausing partnership um so that was within a month of this sort of influx of complaints um in May of 2020 wait what year are we in 2023 uh on the W show I said that Asus was in the dogghouse and that we were in talks about Shoring up customer support uh with them um there's also a call to action in the segment encouraging people
to go to The Forum with their complaints um in August uh we let's see hold on we reiterate we're sharing the complaints the process takes time oh yeah okay yeah in August we posted regarding the large amount of complaints that we've been receiving since early may we reiterate we're sharing the complaints in September um we were told that Asus had an action plan coming for how they wanted to change their processes we share with the Forum that this is coming in December we went
through the entire Forum history and compiled a list of all sponsor complaints from 34 different users and sent this to Asus we flagged the ones that were valid complaints that needed resolutions ASAP in also in December we had a call with Asus to go over each issue one by one and share what we thought the resolutions should look like in mid December we posted our weekly Forum update um in January we announced that Asus would no longer be a sponsor of LT in March we made a threat on the
Forum to assist with people needing rmas it's still pinned in April uh we worked with Asus to audit people's issues we realized a few were still outstanding uh so this is in 2024 now um in June um Colton and I actually met with asus's CEO I don't think we've ever addressed this publicly um but we sat down directly face Toof face with their CEO um I laid out what I needed to see happening with the the ongoing issue with the SD card and the RG Ally I laid out what I needed to see Happ because
this was around the launch of the AL 2 or Alx excuse me um I I laid out what um philosophically I felt was an underlying problem at Asus I sort of I spoke to some of the issues that I could see um that I could have empathy with um what I saw from speaking with him was someone who was told yes sir yes sir um when things weren't getting done and I told him I can empathize with that and I felt that what they needed was an improvement in upward communication um an ability for people to to raise these
issues in a way that would make it so that he wasn't blindsided by it because it's one of those things where you can you can kind of you can bash someone for what went wrong but I don't feel that that's actually the most effective way to enact change I think it's far more important to empathize with them and to try to figure out what went wrong because it was clear to me from speaking with him that he didn't want isus to suck at all he wanted it to be great and so I was like okay well here's an issue
um one of the other things that I outlined as being very important was I felt that Asus still had a very 2000's mentality sometimes fix it with with a revision was something that I told him that I felt Asus had embraced for a lot of its history and that was a big part of asus's success for a long time was to move fast and break things um and I was like look you guys are a grownup company now and I think that's something that needs to change he seemed extremely receptive to everything that
we talked about um so far we have actually seen very little in the way of overall activity around Asus support issues um you know one of the ones that I saw the person was outraged because there was a credit card hold for an advanced R that's standard practice there's a credit card hold when you get an advanced arm so advanc RMA is um is when they send you the new product and they're waiting to receive and then they're waiting to receive the old broken one back and then they take the
hold off the credit card that is completely normal and you need to chill um in fact offering Advanced r at all is like really good I I I love Advanced R cuz then I don't have to have downtime if something's like kind of working so um we felt really good about that things seem to be going okay and if anyone needs you know help finding the correct channels of support from Asus we still do have a topic here so you guys can check this out uh I'm going to post this in the float plane chat maybe Dan
if you can Chuck that in in some of the other chats uh but we think we've we've seen enough that we're ready to work with them again but nothing's permanent right like we have we have begun and ended relationships with industry Giants time and time and time again I mean nid reped them Nvidia is a hilarious one right because they went from you know working together to not working together for a long time to working together extremely closely to not working together for 2 years because
because we called them out to working together with them again we're working with them now we don't agree with everything they do but you're not going to get a lot done um from the outside change people leave mentalities change mentalities shift I mean I do think that Nvidia has a bit of a chip on their shoulder from the top down sure I mean I I would I would not criticize Jensen's business Acumen when you have that that nice of an oven you've got to be a shark to some degree or as knowledge everyone
I've ever spoken to from Nvidia is like the scariest thing about Jensen is that he thinks he can do your job better than you can and he probably can and he's right yeah he'll walk in in like two seconds and solve something that you've been spending a week on and it's like that'd be terrifying you know that kind of pressure um but it's very clear that Nvidia is for out for NVIDIA first that's all that's all I'll say about that um so anyway I've got some questions about the screwdriver really
quick oh yeah um that is what is the cost of things um what is the cost of the screwdriver itself what is the cost of the case with the bits and all that kind of stuff and what is the cost of the combo kit do we know any of that look at this face you don't know any of that does this look like a face that knows no okay all right I actually don't know can we figure that out um cuz I think there it's public info isn't it at least for the screwdriver itself it is 8:13 everybody's gone I'm not messaging
anybody right now all right well yeah I could I could call Nick but I I don't need I don't need to call Nick for that I'm sure we'll figure it out you'll figure it out oh I mean when it's out you'll know yeah exactly exactly I'm not going to bother someone if it just like doesn't matter that much yeah uh okay Nick's going to call in three no my phone might be dead actually no no no still got 2% all right got a lot of teams messages oh no I'm kidding do you want to do another merch message before
we move on to additional topics 10 minutes ago was that was that all the announcements there was a lot of them this week I got to make sure that you get through them all or or we get hit we get assaulted we did the popup event yeah yeah we're good we're good okay we gota be sure calm down boys they'll beat us with sticks they will not beat us with sticks they come out of the quarterly budget if they break us on us  new you didn't use up your stick budget this cor we're going to take it out of
the fiscal report you know if we bought higher quality sticks then they wouldn't  sticks uh okay let's see grow on trees oh oh yep that was my entire contribution to that bit and I ruined it I 100% ruined it you did too aone Fox  manager uh okay let's see I can't even pick down uh uh helloo how did the video game auctions go David had an impressive collection oh I I didn't ask him yeah I don't know I meant to ask him hopefully good probably good can we see okay that I'm not too
bothered about just like asking someone okay I I'll ask him I'll ask him I'll see if I hear back okay uh should I do another topic while you are you just calling them or yeah give give us give us one more Dan sure sure sure um let's see what piece of tech has the best value we've seen all the unique builds in your house but what do you value the  most value is tough cuz like okay I was actually just talking to Ivonne today we were at the water slides and uh she was like oh are you going to leave your
phone like at the at the like little tent site slash like blanket area I was like yeah I don't know she's like are you going to like cover it up I'm like oh sure and I like kick it under a blanket like I and I was telling her I actually love having a piece of crap phone that I don't have to care about Yep this thing doesn't matter to me at all and I value that oh yeah absolutely so like what does value mean cuz you clearly said it's not money this is a mildly controversial part of the reason
why I don't want a new car because it's broken in it's got the first scratch the 10th scratch 100th scratch if something it's more scratched than I'll be sad if it like stops working but I'll just take it to a mechanic if someone like bumps it I don't know probably get it fixed like I'm not super it's a Honda effectively there's I'm sure there's parts and they're probably not that expensive like whatever it'll be fine yeah that's a very comfortable Luke's a bad driver I've never once been an accident in my
life shut up no that's not the point like a scratch from like okay hold on I'm going to try and think of some of the hilarious no no no no no no yeah lean on it no I'm trying to think of some of the hilarious stuff you've had taking up the entire back seat of your car when I've gone to put my backpack in it okay no no good reason for no no he there he had this computer tower that had this like machined part that Jake made him in like high school or something it was back there for weeks
months months there was a water leak in my storage unit in my apartment so I effectively didn't have storage so my car just like became storage it's solved now so it's on now my car is empty now really yeah I need a ride tonight so I'm going to find out just how empty it is yeah it's actually like empty and that my friends is how you secure a ride home I noticed that cuz you had previously said you're going to Uber but I mean I don't mind well no no no no no no I I no no not home I meant from
culus from from culus Lake when to get back here when are you going to C this I went today did you not notice me say I was at the water slides oh that no I was very focused he doesn't even listen to me I had so much work to do for [Laughter] you uh anyways uh but yeah the car's the car is actually legitimately pretty clean at this point I'll be the judge of that sure all right yeah uh what are we talking about how it get scratches but there's there's tons of ways CU like if
you're wearing jeans yeah like putting random see has so much stuff in it scratching things on the way in and out it has leather seats so for a while  was uh for a while there I was worried about like you know putting something on the seats or what I would put like a a blanket or a towel down or something try to protect the seat and now it's like whatever dude I don't know it was liberating spilling muriatic acid in my car right like it kind of sucks but at the same time you're like ah first one's
out of the way yeah nothing's going to be worse than that yeah yeah I don't know like I've I've St snowboards in my car now like whatever at a certain point it's like I want to use it for what it's for and not worry too much about all the little details the Fric is jeans part guys I have never even gotten to the point there's the little like studs on your jeans that hold them together and if you lean against a car it could scratch the car I realized somewhere entirely they never popped off from the
sheer size of my Luke you don't hold  together sorry motion anyway we should probably move on Rivet sorry I thought they were called we never answered their questions what what do you value how did we get to that I don't know this is going so badly cuz you always bring it there I'll take that start talking about your pants uh oh my  can't oh no I don't know where the limit is so I'm going to keep the mouth shut uh what piece of tech has the best then you really won't be able to
whoa waa oh my face is starting to hurt  hurts is that like a weird nerve thing like where you kind of pinch here but  know okay okay okay oh man was homoerotic Vibes on the bingo I think that's the middle Square  one um what is this stupid show um most valuable piece of attack oh right right right okay so what do I value I value my Nas the Nas is the one I would save in a fire okay I'd  um oh man I have cloud backup of the things I really care about now that you said the save in a fire thing like I I
wouldn't save any of my tech in a fire you wouldn't even take your phone if it's not already in my pocket there's probably other things I have the birds I mean that figuratively you do not save anything in a fire unless it has a beating heart yeah yeah yeah I but like I mean even just like I don't know my phone I don't even like it yeah um I I I'm not going to replace it cuz I'm too cheap but I I'm not a fan of it so like whatever I if I can grab it on the way out sure it's just that I'm a little hurt right
now why because that Bulbasaur computer was handcrafted by my children would love and you would not choose that as your most valuable Tech Charizard's  um it's so big and heavy and it's like I I'd have to if I don't unplug it it's going to be stuck I'm just waiting for him to bring up his Squirtle again got him oh Casey B said what about your birds yeah that's essentially the problem right like yeah but how do you like save a bird in a fire like they don't have clipped wings literally I'd
have to grab the cage and just run okay the cage as long as you have the cage then they have a chance if they're out of the cage it's probably just over um if there's smoke and they're out of the cage there are tricks to be able to catch them really um you have to make they have oddly enough I always thought the opposite for the longest time but birds have ter at least budgies maybe this isn't true but all oh interesting terrible night vision Oh I thought you say they're territorial no go ahead owls
have fantastic night vision as far as I know but budgies have terrible night vision so if you just turn the lights low they can't see anything and I can just catch them Oh I thought you meant like catch them outside no no no no no no if they get outside they're they're pretty gone there is ways to catch them in that case but that's like a process it's not yeah Tran Dart no they would definitely die they 30 the size of the a really small one obviously I'm not an idiot I think I've told I think I've
told the story on wano but have I told you the story about how we were trying to catch that person's buddy that got out yeah I was walking around a park with a bird cage and a speaker playing bird noises looking absolutely insane yeah yeah yeah um yeah that's how you catch them cuz they hear other birds and they're like oh okay that's good and they see occas like well that's where food often is right so I'll go there and then you just close the door nice but then you have to figure out where the
heck they are right so that can be rough put an air tag on it then it wouldn't fly away yeah that's true that's true hey oh speaking of pets uh we got two new cats yeah yep your arm is what I was pointing at oh yeah right I told the story last week yeah so we how's that going great they are super super well socialized they are yeah on day one they were like scampering around climbing everything sitting in our laps couldn't believe it couldn't believe it the sitting your laughs part is pretty
crazy are they integrating with the other cats at all day one wow yeah just they are they for practically any animal they be chilling we put a little I found a cheap uh cat tree on Craigslist and our Facebook Marketplace and just like put it in the bathroom where they're staying while we keep them isolated from the other cats yeah how long do you have to do that oh they want they want to see show the class okay yeah here I'll send it I'll I'll uh I'll I'll message it to Dan Dan
yep how long do you have to do the isolation for we don't have to anything but they have fleas and we can't treat them for another 3 weeks God and that also gives the other cats a little bit of time to kind of smell that something's going on and um it also gives these guys a little bit of time to get a little bigger and you know stuff and stuff are they um you said they have fleas and there was a picture of Aon sitting with them yeah so we're just you just watch take your clothes off wash them after you
yeah that makes sense um and realistically we're just going to have to like everything after anyway so yeah yeah it is what it is yeah we're over it yeah that's fair enough yeah Birds usually do like a month even if there's no known issues just quarantine for a month yeah yep oh they're at the top of the dock oh okay I thought you were just going to put them up okay so uh here's uh here's my wife um I managed to catch her yawning is that cute or what that's pretty cute oh shoot 
my that's the best one yet anyway uh here's them ridiculous are they cute or  yes they seem to be getting along quite well as well yeah that's good yep we'll see we'll see the what the other cats think have so many now yeah we're up to five that's that's like we're we're getting pretty close to crazy cat lady territory what is the what is the line there oh I think we're is it five or you pass it like if you got one more are you now officially crazy cat lady we see it as a ratio we
are a household of five people so you're we only actually have a one cat to one person ratio that doesn't seem that crazy if we had 15 cats well there'd need to be an inter vention of some sort I don't know a lot of people have two cats yeah but they have two people usually yeah you got five people there 10 cats yeah totally totally reasonable 10 I think 10 would be fine yeah pretty reasonable no yeah it's about the ratio Luke no I don't think it's okay I think it it can be at least
partially about the ratio but it also has to be if you and I had two wives then it would be fine as long as there's two of us right so it's fine as long as between the two of us we don't have say Six Wives here in Canada anyway yes oh he doing the cult other than in Bounty pool yeah yeah there like there's like a cult town in yeah in BC we're not really sure how that works no we want to do the cult Town L that's only YouTube that's not me LTT Li Tech toown yeah it's already

I think we have another title topic which one was it oh yeah new version of Windows unlocks crazy rise in performance boost yeah early tests of amd's uh Branch prediction improvements in the upcoming 23 H2 version of Windows 11 show significant performance jumps in most games Hardware Lux found improvements between 13 and 41% for Starfield wow for all the dozens of people playing that game still great job this one's maybe a little better 4 to 61% for cyberpunk this is a huge Delta
um and roughly 10 to roughly 20% improvements for F1 2024 uh depending on CPU hardware and boxed found a 2 to 4% Improvement in Halo infinite but a 30 uh 30 plus% Improvement for Gears 5 and 13% Improvement for Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege Hardware on box also found similar numbers to Hardware Lux for F1 uh 24 go check those videos out for more information um Microsoft has also backported the improvements into an optional update for the current version of Windows oh that's exciting as well
excellent so um yeah great work keep it up uh maybe next time you know at launch would be better yeah wait for that update letting everybody know you're using an admit account and you know stuff like that would be really good that'd be nice um what else we got this week um there were a lot of people calling on me to how do I put this to kind of do a takeown of um hold on let me just uh I want to actually bring up the the topics dock because uh I actually wrote some of my own thoughts in there and I they
didn't necessarily make their way into the dock itself so there were there were people particularly on Reddit calling on me to do like a takedown of Austin evans's video on the framework 13 um he published a review yesterday um talking about a lot of the downsides of the the hyper reparable modular laptop investment disclosure I'm invested in framework um some of the downsides he identified were the relatively high price for the performance uh construction compromises for the sake of
modularity the genericness of the keyboard um there's actually some stuff he talked about that isn't necessarily in my notes here he talked about um the the leg for framework to have the latest processors um but I guess what I'm sort of trying to ask is why would I be doing a takedown of his video his conclusion was that essentially it wasn't for him he didn't see the value of it and this this ties directly back into the same thing that I've been complaining about which is not all
reviewer people need to agree with each other and that's okay um Austin doesn't need to agree with your take if it even if it's even different than your take but that's the thing is I don't even think he did if you watch the whole video and if you listen it's 20 minutes long like it's long and if you listen to everything he says he talks a lot about the positive things as well it's actually pretty balanced um and I think actually the a lot of the neg he's getting roasted for it seems like it and
I think a lot of the negativity toward the video actually demonstrates what a good job he did of outlining the compelling things about the framework and particularly the framework 13 because everyone who watched his video disagrees with his conclusion because he actually did a really great job of outlining everything that's super good about it um there are a there are a couple of things that you know if I was to have a private conversation with them I might say yeah here's you know
something here's an alternate perspective or whatever else but I I don't know it was it was kind of disheartening for me um to see the people who were looking for some kind of drama or showdown between me and Austin there won't be there shouldn't be he gave his opinion he didn't make it personal nothing he said was personal everything he said was his opinion based on his time his experience with the product um and he has different priorities I saw a couple people criticizing the laptop that he compared
it to saying that it wasn't like for like the one that he found for half the price that had the same processor in it or whatever else and and you know what that's fair but Austin's priorities might not be those things that are better about the framework 13 and I think you'd have to be a complete Fanboy you'd have to be duded to look at the framework 13 and say it's the best value laptop we don't even use them internally here and there's a variety of reasons for that a lot of our folks
prefer touchscreen framework still doesn't have a touchcreen option that's feedback I've been giving them on an ongoing basis um the cost is not necessarily the most competitive for what the spec is there are departments where we have at least considered rolling them out and the ability to upgrade them over time is a key part of that the abil the ease with which you can get replacement parts is a key part of that but it's not going to be perfect for every environment and guys
investment or no investment I would never tell you that it's the perfect thing for every environment like look the second that I turn into a framework salesman you should stop buying Frameworks and you should stop watching LT that hasn't happened and it never will it's ridiculous um yeah like what's uh hold on I saw I saw a comment from someone that was like it felt like I think it was crystal it felt like he missed the point but he didn't he outlined the point really well he actually talked in
detail about the point and about the benefit is and I I don't agree with his conclusion which is fine yeah which is totally fine but what I do respect is the way that he outlined both sides before he presented his conclusion giving you an opportunity to be armed with the facts and decide if you agree with him or not I don't know I uh I'm just so I'm so done with everybody having having to agree and and if we disagree not being able to do it  respectful yeah you should get multiple
perspectives I have always said that and the only perspective that I won't accept is the perspective that you don't need multiple perspectives there is no one truth there is no one answer it is never that simple you could look at the best benchmarks taken in the most scientific manner but if the most important thing to you is turning on all of the eye candy with a bunch of mods those benchmarks are never going to be the most relevant thing to you because in the interest of repeatability they can
never use those mods it's never black and white literally never just I'm tired of it man tired of it it's really frustrating uh speaking of frustrating Ubisoft patch resets player progress for Star Wars Outlaws several hours after the launch of the paid 3-day Early Access for Star Wars Outlaws Ubisoft sent PS5 players an email telling them to install a day one patch that's a weird way of communicating that but sure uh the patch fixes some potentially game-breaking bugs such as one that could lead to the
player being forever stranded in space but it also requires players to restart from a new save o according to Ubisoft pre patch save files will face issues and progression blockers um as compensation Ubisoft is giving these players an in-game cosmetic called a Trailblazer trinket and 100 Ubisoft connect units is that a belly button ring or what what kind of Trail we blazing I have no idea it says AKA loyalty points  treasure oh my goodness uh it says AKA loyalty points I don't know what connect
units are whatever I have no idea uh the deluxe editions that include this 3-day Early Access period cost $40 to $60 on top of the price of the base game um some players lost 15 hours of play time okay so here's my  data should be  dude yeah dude the first time I did it wasn't work it was play it's definitely going to feel like work the second time it's definitely work the second time a lot of game probably this this is one of the things that makes me so angry about Nintendo just they do a lot of things
that are really great they make great games I'm going to keep giving them my money like but the way that they hold your save data hostage if you don't buy their online subscription is actually like I I can't make an argument for why it should be criminal but I wish it was yeah it's so ridiculous the fact that you can't back up that save data in any other way just so angry and so looking at this the fact that people had to pay extra to have to do work essentially doing QA for Ubisoft a multi-billion
doll company I just I can't I can't abide it I speaking of this is a little off topic but um in the realm of how you were like yeah Nintendo's Mak some great stuff I they make really frustrating other things but I'll just keep giving them my money because they make great games uh Mr Mr dankpods over there has a video his most recent video It's called it's time to change it's time for Linux and he basically talks in this video and you watch it yourself what year is it the year of Linux desktop is
it the year is it the year of Linux desktop it's go ahead go ahead it's it's a great video it has half a million views already um we're not going to watch it although it is it is you know this type of stuff uh but you should go watch it yourself even if you're not going to switch to Linux honestly I think it's just a really I mean he's been doing this for a long time he's really good at it it's a very good video um but he talks about a lot of like good stuff and he talks
about how like people have flamed him for switching to Linux but then he talks about how those same people are the people that say you should like vote with your wallet on things and he's unhappy with with what's happening with Mac OS and he's unhappy with what's happening with Windows he talked about how like you buy this operating system then you get ads in it which yeah that's ridiculous dude I tried to install an unsigned driver on Mac OS that was for like I I had to clear like four or five
different prompts and dig into the settings in order to yeah it was it was wild yeah I was trying to get an old printer working and actually this was where I was going to get into year of Linux one of the things that is still just very difficult with Linux was we needed a Linux desktop like quick because we were just trying to see if like this old printer would work with it and I was like steam deck I'll just grab a steam deck that's like the the closest atand machine and you just reboot it in
desktop mode it doesn't even reboot I don't think it just switches fires up  and valve didn't include any of the printer stuff because why would they I guess on a game console except that it's supposedly a desktop computer and it's it's just completely not there and it's like you could get it but it's going to be annoying he talks in the video about how there's every time I touch it it's just okay yeah side quest he talks about that it's like if froto had to put the ring in Mount Doom okay but first he had
to go play World of Warcraft Harvest a bunch of pigs and then he had to go you know get the in-game gold and get it on a USB and personally deliver it to freaking like I You could argue there's some side questing in Lord of the Rings okay you could argue that there's there's a fair amount okay it's like he had to put the ring in the Mount Doom but first he had to go and Fight The Wraith ring wraiths I don't know I never read the book and he had to talk to Tom Bombadil which is where I stop reading
Phil of the Ring every single time yeah that's it he had to talk to Tom Bombadil the actually scariest character in the whole book dude the guy's deranged uh but yeah anyways every time I I've tried to read that book like three or four times can't get past it and I'm not the kind of person who can just skip yeah and I don't think there'll ever be an Abridged Lord of the Rings has someone done it have they actually published and I'm I'm going to look it up bridged Fellowship version I'm not counting that
whether you're interested in Linux or not honestly I would go watch the video I think it's really good I think it's I think it's extremely based for consumers to just not by into things that they actually really hate um so I strongly   pompous it is not possible even at Great length to pot the Lord of the Rings in a paragraph or two it was begun in 1936 and every part has been written many "times hardly a word in it 600,000 or" more has been unconsidered and the pacing style size and contribution to
the whole of all the features incidents and chapters has been laboriously pondered you could have prach the Lord of the Rings uh yeah dra rayu in full plane chat said a bridged lot or yeah lotr is the movies yeah I guess which is kind of true but the the books are still why didn't they just take the birds That's The Abridged one oh just go on the big Crow and then just drop it in from the sky and then uh woo we saved the hobbles the hobbles there you go lord of the 30 minute
short Zap rosow Says those are tolk's words I know that doesn't make them not pompous yeah I carefully hold on hold on what's the hold on what's the  pondered oh man anyway I kind of respect it though I don't think you should have Bridget um if you can't stomach bomb bombad bomb bomil if you can't stomach Tom bombil just whatever just move on it's part of the damage take some damage I just I want someone else to do the work for me I don't want to have to skim I don't want to skim to see when
the boring part is over like leave I want the important parts I don't want to have to Wade through this slop in order to get like an interesting conversation that takes place or something I think if you're really trying to understand the actual and he was actually very into this um as someone who has read the Similan and uh what is it called the Sons of hurin or whatever it's called and all all the other books U I think he's trying to help you understand the world and understanding Tom Bombadil
does help with understanding the world oh my God I'm so bored feels out of place you're so tedious right now it's funny cuz you actually look more tired oh yeah oh yeah 100% yeah anyways uh you could read the  yeah you probably can like does good reads have a comment section good reads   comments uh there there are reviews they're reviews not comments there's comments on the reviews there we go Cliff's Notes oh no let's go no let's go oh easy peasy next The Two Towers let's
go B Of Orcs capture Mar and Pippen kills barir yeah maror spoiler alert uh although treated roughly by by the Orcs Mary and Pippen remain unharmed when hear him attack the hobbits run to safety of the forest y yeah this seems pretty good okay you know what I'm just going to go with this I don't need to read the books now to be clear I'm a reader I actually am a reader I have I have I have read you know thick books and stuff it's not that I'm incapable thick books I've read thick books and
stuff I just can't get through Tom Bombadil it's insufferable I've read thick books and I can't be fictitious I can't be fictitious yeah wait and I no cap what are you even saying yeah that basically all right um yeah I read the  um yes I've considered skipping him that's what Luke tells me to do every time no someone should help someone should have to look my that that's not my point my point is just that it's not that I am I don't have the attention span to read Tom Bombadil is a is a
difficult section of the book it's really stupid between that and the UN ending descriptions of mountains I'm just like if I want to know what a mountain looks like I will literally just open my door and walk outside and touch grass I have mountains right there some people don't but I do I don't need that book for them oh so now we're hating on mountains no I love hot dogs and hamburgers I like hamburger patties that are made of hot dog meat I'm going no I don't think anyone would like that would
that be would that be good that's not a hamburger patty sausage patty sausage patty a sausage patty and also hot dog meat is not sausage sausage is awful hot dog is a whole other level pork patties pork patties hot dogs made of ground beef okay hold on what are we even breakfast sausage patties did we just did we just invent food I think we might  I think we invented a food I think I'm going to go hike into the mountains and read Lord of the Rings in the mountains so I can read
descriptions of mountains while on a mountain you're totally not going to do that probably not but I am going for a hike on Monday but anyways you're not going to take Lord of the Rings with you that'd be so that'd be so lame yeah that'd be so lame you wouldn't be able to hike on the [Laughter] mountain oh man you've been you've been on one today you've been good I'm spicy  um police using AI to write reports um that's dumb axon formerly  is is selling soft evil Company Inc axon axon
axon is selling software to law enforcement that uses AI to create draft police reports from body cam footage called called draft one notably they're also the dominant vendor for police body cameras in the United States at least some police departments such as the Oklahoma City police are already using draft one the software is only intended to create a draft that an officer can then review and edit into a final report there's no way this could go wrong both because the AI is not 100% reliable and
also because an officer who testifies in court needs to be consistent with written accounts authored under their name yeah they can't just read it before they go to court that'll never happen let's see how this goes it'll surely not be terrible guaranteed to be terrible it'll surely not be terrible what a joke H people suck so much wait where did my where did my note on this go what happened to my notes on this what notes on what or wait hold on did I not have notes on this maybe I had notes on something
else um no oh oh man I was missing one of my really good notes on something the nonch shutting down thing I had wanted to talk about how one of the big challenges is um that there's no money in you know the the the the the the the written media format that a ntech so yeah relies on any I think it's also that the the techy space is a higher percentage of ad block users ad block hits things like uh static web ads kind of the hardest uh there's no money there I know there's there's review sites of more Normy
things that do a lot better because lower ad Tech is going to basically Tech is going to eat its own tail by you know automating automating things to death and I was I was like reminded of that when I saw this uh post on r/ Hardware about our Snapdragon for a month challenge where someone used an AI generated summary to basically there save you 18 minutes and it's like you realize that an AI can't use these laptops in a real world situation um and then report on that unless someone is actually doing the 
it's yep good luck everybody yep it's it's super it's that that that's a weird Community yeah it's it's super weird the uh yeah how sort of tentative and scared people have to be to say I thought it was a good video there man the tribalism is a it's a whole thing anyway good luck everybody uh nice hash according to multiple Reports online Crypt broker nice has has sent out an email announcing they'll be charging a $6 a month service fee to users with inactive accounts starting on October 1st
according to the email users can avoid the service fee by simply engaging in an activity on the platform such as buying or selling crypto it does not mention account deactivation as an option but many have rushed to do so regardless I guarantee I know why they're doing this they also implemented a series of other fees including $10 to change your account's email address look at this H so um reset TFA 10 bucks recover account 10 bucks serious 10 bucks okay you said you know why they're
doing this other than just being okay this part I don't know the previous part I thought it was just cuz they probably had a lot of stagnant accounts from like the absolute peak of GPU Mining and they're sitting there with all these stagnant accounts that have Bitcoin sitting in them like I can slowly drain these out from people that are not paying attention to their accounts even if hey you know maybe I sort of forgot about that account cuz it only had like 10 bucks in it I did this over like a
few weeks with my GPU and then sort of forgot it existed over time and you know 10 bucks would be nice but it wasn't impactful enough that I I sort of forgot about it you can drain that out but you "do that to 10,00,000 a million now it" starts being a big deal so you can just but I don't know extremely highly monetizing their customer support was not a a curveball I expected to come right after that so now I don't know well anyway we don't work with them anymore uh we did one sponsored video
with them back when they seemed pretty chill it blew up anyways yeah people were mad about it and hey yeah maybe they're maybe they're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] so great I'm glad we stopped working with them yeah like this one line the monthly service fee for inactive accounts yeah I suspect they're just you know if you're going to ignore it we're going to drain it which isn't a good thing but I understand why they're doing it the FBI is bad at shredding hard drives apparently this seemed a lot more
interesting when I was first reading it but yeah basically government not do things properly sometimes and this is really exciting man there's been so much good like Pro labor news lately and like Pro you know like regular people news there's been some bad news uh like there was the Canadian government mandating the rail workers back to work that was not super cool but this is super cool uh following a year-long investigation the US National Labor Relations Board has found that Amazon is a joint employer of
subcontracted drivers that work for its partner companies in Palmdale California Amazon's refusal then to negotiate with their currently striking Union was thereby determined to be illegal the company was likewise determined to have made unlawful threats I have no idea what the actual impact will be on Amazon but this is sick being able to just hire a firm that can be spun up and closed down or uh contracted and not contracted at on a whim being able to hide behind that and essentially not have to pay
people living wages and not have to treat them properly is such a broken loophole in I was going to say the American system but as far as I can tell it's like basically a lot of places and it's gross and this is this is far from a death blow but this is a this is a good start so let's let's do away with that at least one person checked their nice hash account because of that thing  bucks so maybe go check your nice account yeah go check your nice has account take get the money out of there
and then run away like back when it was cool it was actually pretty convenient and pretty cool which is why we worked with them um definitely get your money out before they take it found like $4.50 nice 40 bucks 15 bucks someone said a lot somewhere I don't remember what it was like a few hundred oh right all right anyway all good are you good oh yeah okay it's time  nice it'll take him a second oh yeah Dan's on this man what was it going to talk about you know I left here my my whole life I
had never been to the cultist lake water slides really never not once have you been have you done the 72t drop one uh is it super new I don't know if it's not super new then yes cuz I had it's basically like a vertical drop yeah they had uh they had kind of two that were sort of like that one of them was the tand the wavy one there's no tandem they only have one on the wavy one now no I mean sorry uh it was it was still a really steep drop but it was the bowl oh no not that oh man we put my dad my
brother and I all in one tube and did the bowl and my dad was able to touch the the lip on the other side we got so  awesome we used to go to call this all the time um yeah it was good all right anyway yeah no I'd never been so F finally went Prett yeah yeah it was good pretty good time that was fun yeah um let's see what else is new found 170 bucks people people just keep chiming in like they find a bunch of money in there yeah go go get that money yeah get money it might be zero but if it's not hey you
got something spend it on LTT store woo let's go I don't believe that one yeah I don't well I mean you never know some people pretty broy yeah true you own any crypto right now no yeah I got nothing I'm out dude yeah I get it I'm there's been a bunch of times where I've called it and I like could have made money but I just at this point in time I just don't want to follow it exactly I don't want to put the effort in I'm sure if I did I could make some money but there's other things I can do I don't like
remember my passcodes on my like Ledger also just like another job basically yeah I just I just don't care anymore I think I'm out Y and like it's you know which exchange is the one that's like probably going to disappear and take all your money this time I've got a buddy that you know but I'm not name that's super into it and  made oh yeah disgusting money oh yeah and continues to to be honest doing great oh yeah proud of the boy but it's yeah he pours a lot of work into it it's
his job job that's what he does so it's like okay cool but I don't want to do that I'm doing other stuff so it is what it is we all got our things I have 5K nice hash not even joking completely forgot BTC was like 15K back then oh nice sick okay yeah good for you I guess that makes sense if it wasn't necessarily super valuable back then but it's gone up a huge amount yeah it's it's sitting pretty good right now okay yeah so like $359 .71 in my nice hash don't forgety don't forget who reminded
you LT store.com LT store.com full subscriptions oh my we need to allow people to gift them are we working on gifting subscriptions now but we will be that is a plan um there is a man how much of the stuff do I want to say I don't know I don't know how about a lot of it no let's have another business meeting uh well there's a there's a huge thing that we're working on that I legitimately cannot talk about um why would you even tell me that then well you know you know about it I don't
remember you'll have to tell me you'll have to remind me nope um and as part of doing that there are some things coming that will be good upgrades I heard back from David um he said "pretty insane $177,000 after fees and" shipping so even without giving away some of his cool pieces or not giving away but even without auctioning some of his cool pieces he's still way up on what he spent on his collection okay so he is up Savvy buyer he's up Savvy buyer very cool yeah good for him 
all right yeah after dark it's already after dark you're after dark you're doing it your face is after dark got him yeah yeah I'm going to read you a merch message now hi L last week was the first Wan show I've missed since 2019 because wow weak you're weak because I was getting oh how do you let that happen I read ahead that's why I was I should have resed W yeah that that seems like things in life are important partner needs to understand that yeah why didn't you put it on like a screen there you
were on the streak now you're off the streak yeah weak yeah you're not a streak anymore you're a stain a stain on this show on this institution Jess you  marinate okay sorry what was the oh okay right what's your favorite memory from your wedding we were just busy Bering you oh I'm sorry why why are you two divorcing each other are Miss wo he miss wo I just can't live with this man he's intolerable ever since oh okay hold on we're going to come back to this for a second uh you
had me put letter Kenny on my Plex server yeah I watched a few episodes I didn't think you'd get it at all I never suggested you watch it I just wanted to watch it um okay you didn't think I'd get it I mean there's an entire episode about fart jokes get it I didn't think you'd necessar people sharing their farts each other wait you've watched that far you like it I I've watched three episodes I can't tell if it's like stupid funny or just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] stupid like I just I it's
actually great what I think you might legitimately like more is shy uhhuh okay yeah I didn't suggest you watch this at all people said fartbook is the worst episode well that's good because it's not very good fartbook was pretty rough okay it's like super campy just some like dudes in Canada doing with they can shy is shy is better in my opinion yeah okay yeah a lot of people are like I like letter Kenny but Shy's better the sh's far superior to letter Kenny if you're going to watch one of them watch
shy all right yeah okay anyway um but I didn't I didn't recommend you watch either yeah I I'm just yeah I'm just yeah I uh for me letter Kenny was side monitor content okay that was funny sometimes okay sh's like actually pretty good okay all right um so favorite memory from my wedding um it's hard to pick one Luke  so um no no he that's not cuz he like missed it we he didn't know me yet um favorite memory from my wedding yeah I met you like right afterwards I think like man how do I pick favorite it's
hard there's it's such an emotional day it's such a roller coaster you know like everything was chaos we were we were late for our own um I think that's surprisingly common uh yeah well like like the reception I think you're saying no not the reception the like the actual ceremony like we were we we were slightly late for it everyone was like already seated and like ready to go and we rolled in because like our our wedding day shoot ran a little bit late and like um the weather was incredible
like we we got married in l April and we did that cuz it was cheaper um cuz as long as you're not in May the rates are way lower cuz the chances of the weather were in Vancouver so the chances of the weather being good in April are hit or miss and the whole day was on andof showers but it was like the skies cleared every time we needed to be outside and then it rained the second we needed to go inside like it was actually kind of magical that's cool um like it was sprinkling and then we had our
outdoor ceremony and and then as people were heading inside it started sprinkling again I was like wow this is incredible and then it was clear for our shoot in the morning which was also outside um like the whole thing was just kind of incredible um you know obviously there's like like you know the moment you know the Rings and she's walking up the aisle and we had bubbles everyone in the in the audience had like bubble blowers so there was like bubbles  um Ivan tearing up the Dance Floor was
definitely a highlight that has to be um that's the Ivan that used to work here we were colleagues at NC before he worked here um just the like breathing afterward when it was over I could see that and kind of going I think we threw a really good party you know I could see that um CU it's kind of like it was the first thing we accomplished as a married couple sure was to to throw a hell of a party is kind of the way that we saw it because um Yvonne had like an emotional
breakdown in the leadup to the wedding realizing that she had completely lost control over like you know what do you mean we're doing it this way what do you mean we have this now why are people I I understand the desire to contribute but I actually didn't want that there don't bring it here and like and I basically was like hun it's not about you like yes this is your wedding but this is but your mom is marrying her first daughter yeah it there's it's for there's other stakeholders cuz she was
like I don't even know a lot of these people that are there and just like you know like a lot of yeah a lot of really tough stuff so it was basically like look here's the deal let's just go with the flow and what we're going to do is on our honeymoon we're going to take our wedding finery and we're just going to what about second ceremony with just you and me and a witness and we'll like we'll have someone over we'll do we'll do the donkey ride through the the town we'll do a new we'll do a new wedding
photo shoot we'll do we'll we're just going it's not going to have any legal significance or anything we'll sign the documents at home obviously but if that will allow us to just detach from this and just have fun with whatever it is and and lose control a little bit of of of the details and then and then it won't matter if you know the the the we don't have enough cake or if we or or if someone isn't able to or if we don't we never got to eat the food we just we had so many people there because because our
families wanted to invite people that we didn't even know but we went around and you know had FaceTime with everyone which back then meant seeing people face to face not using your phone um so we we we were able to just throw a party and enjoy everyone else enjoying it and US enjoying that and enjoying Parts ourselves and like there was stuff that we just weren't that into like some of the first dance stuff and you know that other people it was really important to other people for
tradition and stuff and then so so before we had this sort of frame of mind change um that was causing a lot of stress and I was like look the worst thing for this day is for it to cause stress oh yeah that not what anybody will benefit from and I think the the approach of like we'll just do it how you want on our own sort of version of it thing if you can afford to do that I think that's super sick because then yeah I think it helps release some of the pent up like cuz some people they
wait for that for their entire life so like if anything is slightly off they're going to go crazy over it so being able to let go with that is cool crystal says yikes shouldn't a wedding be about the couple sure in theory in practice the world the world is never that clean yeah it's just not that clean and at a certain point and you can you can fight for that cuz sure enough that's true but you can fight for that but it's going to be a fight yeah and you can have lines like you you you can absolutely have 
day are you willing to damage a relationship over it what is a wedding Maybe depends on the thing yeah but is it worth it depends on the thing that's the question you got to ask yourself yeah you got to ask yourself is it worth it I'm trying to think of my my brother's wedding my brother's wedding went fantastically well but I can think of a range of things that could have happened that I I probably would have like shielded him from needing to burn Bridges but I would have burnt Bridges with
ferocity and like it's just it you know if certain things happen you have topend there's that boundary line that you're talking about but there's there's some amount of flexibility that you can have as well yeah I mean and to be clear like you know we were lucky we didn't have anyone get totally wasted and say something completely inappropriate or whatever like it was never it was nothing like that it was just preference things and so you got to you got to ask yourself is
my preference really worth this fight does it actually really matter you might also at the exact same time that that's happening start start questioning why this thing with that person would need to be a fight and you can you can kind of like strategically reposition these relationships as you go but it might not be worth having that battle but you have to kind of keep in mind that that person brought it to that point trouble but love it my wife and I eloped a few months before the wedding because we'd
already lost so much control to her parents who were paying for it we went into our big wedding then with so little stress because at that point it was just a regular party with a little Recreation at the beginning that's cool and if you play your cards right there's some Recreation at the end  yeah sup LTT live in a closet guy here again nice I bought psvr2 as for Content consumption without a PS5 lus if you tried psvr2 on PC yet thoughts also is merch messages end to  given we're going to read them out I
think it's irrelevant but um I think I think they're just asking silly questions I am here I'm sure you can answer but yeah am I quantum computer safe um I haven't I haven't tried psvr2 on PC yet I I probably should play around with it but um yeah it's it's a it's a good headset the fact that you need the adapter kind of harms the value of the price a little bit I kind of wish you didn't but it seems like a pretty good play it seems like a pretty good play I didn't get it Insomniac and chat pointed it out
he's meeing on the telegram subject yeah yeah I didn't I was like was immediately ready to defend his platform he's had a hard week we can make it worse he's had a hard week we we can make there still time it'll be fine okay let's see uh Hey luk and Dan as an in as infrastructure guys are there any benefits to my jobs work from home practice of having us remote into PCS on our desk at the office instead of  servers uh if they are relatively unsophisticated than there could
be if everything is set up properly there should be no reason that you can't just use your system at home and like like a like and and remote into a virtualized PC from there yeah it depends on the security level of the things you're dealing with and sometimes sometimes like if it's dumb and it works it's not dumb and if they're just if everything is just set up and then they just don't have to change anything and don't have to figure anything out if you  workstation yeah probably fine again
though it depends on the security level of the things you're dealing with um editing video is like sure okay do whatever yeah pretty much but there's like there's there's other things that wouldn't be good yeah sinus Lake and man you have talked about poor search engine algorithm functions recently your thoughts on YouTube Shadow suppressing a video and claiming the algorithm any way to prove or disprove this sure I can prove it when one of the Paul Brothers I forget which one cuz they're both the
same to me um made the suicide forest video at yeah was it sure um and YouTube claimed that they weren't suppressing the channel but they like definitely definitely were because you could search for exactly the name of the channel and it would be below the fold um there I proved it yeah that was pretty wild there was absolutely no way that that wasn't a thing yeah yep so they definitely definitely can do that so okay cool hey what happened to the thing at the top of the of the merch message dashboard what
about it did I leak it too many times and now it doesn't exist anymore no no it's under partner spots one down you probably minimized it oh stats there it is I accidentally minimized it oh wow you guys pre-ordered a lot of scribe drivers I've just been I've been curious all show I they're going to be gone again um I don't know another another "10,000 of them I don't know man last" time what they lasted three days well yeah well surely there's a surely there's a limit to the number of pens people need
like some number what could it be here hold on let me see if I can write it down on your arm oh that was not that easy to get off even and and I had to I had to explain it just like the neck tattoos I forgot it was there and I never like warned Emma so she was like um what I think she'd be used to it by now in her defense it it wasn't like she was mad she was just like what what's happening more weird stuff okay yeah sink plane says please stop selling Prime in your venting machines guys I
said in the video they're they're just they were just in there for testing I don't know where they came from probably they just like someone who works there who doesn't even know who the Paul brothers are grabbed a bunch of random beverages don't worry about it it's fine also they didn't taste that bad I tried  but Luke is there anything in your frider freezer from Nestle no then stop what not a single  impossible maybe that I didn't  anything from any of these Brands so far no no Arrowhead crackers

from liby I Didn't Know Maggie was owned by Nestle jees you want to know the Gat code to this why I'm pretty sure I'm I'm right why I eat chicken rice yeah that's fine and uh yeah but Maggie is like a seasoning it's like MSG and brown oh season that's going to be I don't I me what was really surprising have that particular keep going it I don't have meal replacements this looks like n Replacements okay all right health health ice cream Pet Care no anything from P Pina for me I think I
didn't know that was Nestle I yeah Pina one but no yeah I think cool I'm throwing that out and the cat cuz it's touched Nestle Now new cat new cat oh my goodness Ru my point is just that if you're going to if you're going to be like no you can't no my my problem isn't even who it's supporting sure my problem is that it it has hydration claims that are not based on the ingredients not good sure yeah I didn't say it was good for you I said it tastes good yeah I'm sure it probably does it just doesn't really
do the thing that it's trying to publicly accomplished yeah that's fair enough I mean that's my only like Gatorade should we carry Gatorade actually I think it Gatorade is pretty good it has a lot of flavor but it does have a significant amount of hydration stuff in it it has good salts and and things now who are they are they Pepsi I don't know as power is Pepsi I think Gat is and like so many uh of so many food brands are like so bad I'm not trying to take that stance there's no part of me
that's like Logan Paul is more evil than Nestle or whatever else I don't care about that that's that's whatever um wait how do you even know about the Prime in the uh in the in oh how what how do they how do they know about the I have no idea what how did what's going on here video or a picture or something it's in a video that's coming out I think it's a picture on the Facebook page perhaps May that oh watch the food Theory video I didn't actually but I'm sure it's probably pretty good
here it is oh that's right no we talked about we talked about it okay so the video is coming smash Champs August update oh my God unrelease content on W show no no no no a leak from the chief Vision officer oh wait this could be a problem one sec what did you just do uh don't worry about it oh yeah save as a University of Florida as a University of Florida hands off our Gatorade what don't want to sell things also you're you're a you are a single unit of University of Florida

to do a lot of takes of this because he kept not actually recording the take it had been set up for 4 hours I had never tested that it's funny so that was that was pretty exciting okay wait for oh oh oh oh that did make it in cool yeah of course it made it in nice oh yeah is this legitimately unlisted by the way uh no it's private now cool all right so that's what you did yeah yeah yeah I said nice nice nice nice nice don't you even worry I got you very good um anyway what are we talking about
you're going to answer another merch message oh yeah hit me hey D2 the ll in terms of scalability do you see W show growing bigger with other hosts or production value or do you enjoy it being just the three of you no it's um it's I I I I I can't think of a production at lonus Media Group that has gotten less support for expanding from me than the wo it's all held together back here with rubber bands and paper look our set like seriously it's it's not good it's a wall there's so many wrinkles on
this I don't even I'm not even talking about the quality of the wall I'm just like look at the go watch 5 Seconds of the yard and then come back I don't know this view looks great look at the space we dedicate that's sick dude dude he's got a human organ bag behind him and and then we go to lius is oh second wall hold on hold on what about what  merch there boom nice there set blurry mer decoration blurry merch blch uh I you poured too much production value into W it would get significantly
worse yeah I feel that very strongly I support Luke's Viewpoint because I don't want to spend anything on when yeah but also like dude if you if you try to make the the like the news sections more structured or even more planned out it's just going to get worse y people want it to go off the rails people like it being fun including me speaking of off rails you guys were noticing this last week I have some bad news um there's a little line in it it's so minute um you're
probably not going to be able to see it but basically where the plastic flows in uh where's the gate on this piece of the mold I think it's actually at the bottom so sorry well the gate is where the plastic shoots into the mold um I think it's on this side anyway the point is that where the plastic flows and meets on the flat of the screwdriver there's a little line that looks like a scratch down the two of the three flat sides and the only reason it doesn't show on the
one flat side is cuz that's where uh the two halves of the mold meet so there's all a line there there's already a seam but it basically just looks like a little scratch here and a little scratch here but the problem is that the scratch goes all the way through uh so you can never get rid of it it's there and it just looks like it's scratched out of the box and that's why transparent screwdriver is uh um not dead but certainly not happening anytime soon it looks really cool yeah I wouldn't mind the little
line but the problem is we can say that and Wan chat can say that yeah and then some users going to get it and see the line r it and then we're going to say no we had it disclaimed on the product page and they're going to say but what about the trust me bro guarantee and I'm going to not want to deal with that yep so product doesn't get released yep that's how it goes hey lonus miss the days of needing a PCI card for everything cuz I could have a cool computer with all the gadgets
where can I get that nowaday what else has that nerdy customization energy framework laptop investment disclosure old cars you can get all kinds of cool like uh modules and stuff whether you need them or not I don't know that's up to you but uh you can definitely get them what else what else has that get a modular syn and then not be able to afford anything ever  you're supposed to use it for the work and you're supposed to Bill people properly for the work so that you can
afford the modular syn supposed to be a return on investment you didn't buy music for me you don't know how much that costs okay do you build those hours a lot more than you tried to Bill me you bought a service okay yeah but it's it all comes down to hours Dan it all comes down to hours and expertise you have to bill the the hours appropriate for the level of expertise and for the and for the how is this fight still going on because still Dan hasn't internalized that he lost yet that he
lost yeah because you have to account for the sporadic of the work so the level of expertise and how feast and famine it is you got to account for that you got to have smoothing in your billing you got to smooth over the parts where it's the famine with the feast and the cats to protect the granery that's why I have so many of them this is good advice you should uh if you do freelance listen to this no that's true I can't tell if he's mocking me or not I'm going to look at his face
I'm not mocking you keep the tone up and keep talking about this subject and then just sell courses dude I could make so much money selling courses infinite money dude it doesn't no offense it doesn't look that hard yeah could do the music for them Colton's been trying to get me to do a course for literal years literal years yeah literally yeah I keep telling him I'm like nobody should buy a course from me everything that I am an expert on I should give away for free so I don't
know I I give up but then he always says no people would pay for it and I'm like yeah but like H then it would have to be really good I get I think that's part of it I get like anxiety like if it didn't have to if it could just be like generic nonsense but like with really high energy I could do that so easy oh yeah but that's what most of them are I know that but I just I couldn't take pride in that work no I'm not saying you should actually do it I'm saying if you did do it you'd rake
in the cash dude you know what I would be the best at though tone and stuff you know you know what I would be the best at is a televangelist oh yeah I could crush that that's what you were built for dud so easy told you cult dude why won't you listen it looks so easy dude yeah you're you're you're basically just like a a well WellMed beggar and you just like you you just man dude I went I went to church a lot of times in my life okay do you know how easy it is to just crack open that
book read literally like two sentences I could toal I could 100% you don't even have to do the work anymore you can just pop in chat GPT just be like write a sermon about this cuz the message is usually only like 5 to 10 minutes dude easy I could do it no problem I wonder I wonder if Pastor using chat gbt oh 100% 100% probably no we we actually talked about it on W show before oh yeah where they're just like yeah I need like a I need a Sunday message about like forgiveness whatever and chat P will
just be like yeah sure this this this and this dude crazy nice yep um Jesus AI I'm afraid to click this but I'm going to do it it's just shrimp  it yeah get out of there not a good site don't go there yeah get also you might be uh you might be banned now you're at least getting a little timeout there yikes don't go to that site hey lldd thoughts on computers going through the same fate as what gpus did going from upgradable to unupgraded and the backlash lunar lake is getting
on not supporting upgradeable R you tweeted this at me I literally replied to you they really liked their question I'm sorry I don't read your Twitter no no no this no that person I know I know no well no the then I duplicated the the message no the answer was that we made that video hold on well maybe they just want everyone to maybe they they think they have a great question they want they want answered in front of more people um yeah so we we made this we made this video the one and only uh
Emily Young here okay I just posted it in the chat um wish nothing but the best for her by the way so yeah we made this video build a PC while you still can they're changing whether we like it or not they're not going to be upgradeable forever all right what's next when. D with the FTC finally waking up to the monopolies of Google Apple meta Etc and the EU pushing for stronger regulation how does this end just more fines or is something bigger coming some breakups maybe um I mean which could be
good yeah I think it could probably be a good thing if some of these Tech Giants were broken up Apple's a funny one because it's a bit of a weird one though because they don't have that many products China's getting into the te Tech Giant game yeah break break them up yep so if you break up all the American companies and make them less competitive that's a little weird it's a little weird um I'm not sure what to do there yeah cuz they're already going I I I it seems pretty clear to me at least that
they're going with a a similar model to a lot of their other business where they're like we're pretty good but we do everything and we're cheaper so there it's it's going to be a good decision for a lot of different companies uh um so if you if you break the other companies apart so they're less feature competitive and they're also still more expensive then yikes that gets really rough hey lus I'm opening an Entertainment Sports venue in October oh good for you I'm curious what kinds of
ideas you have for your badminton grand opening and if there's anything you really want to do but can't ooh we're kind of going to keep it small I think um like we're at our at our capacity we're designed for like 6 time 14 like what 28 * 3 I don't know whatever that works out to so like 85 people right so we we don't want like 500 people there um no matter what kind of grand opening it is so we were kind of thinking like like a hot dog barbecue in the parking lot like and you can come check it out 
um I didn't say what kind of hot dogs  okay oh man that's pretty good sorry  sorry next up yeah so I I think we're going to do a pretty we're going to do a pretty small thing so I don't really it's going to get raided I don't really have big plans yeah what about the um that's scary well they might just have to leave like we don't have any park for like a whole bunch of people so it is what it is you might need to almost uh like security it I'd be like sorry too many beeps because I'm worried about
the city's reaction if it gets a little out of control well theoretically they'll be there yeah we invited the mayor yeah so I'm worried about the  control I I'm honestly not that worried about it okay yeah don't show up if you're not going to like play badon yeah it's for it's for badminton that's it yeah hello when. d.x doping so many extra letters when Lina says something the community eventually comes around to his point of view how much of that is just him bringing
attention to something nobody else has noticed 100% both the warranty thing and the block piracy thing we 100% just like this is I don't shoot the messenger the way that you packaged true the warranty thing yeah I'm not denying it I did a bad job there's always you know you taught me about Optics the Optics on that were real bad yeah I did a bad job yeah what are you going to do about it nothing buy something from LTD store.com trying to buy the screwdriver or the pen yeah look the thing is like I'm live
here driver guys I'm I'm live yeah the warranty one was persistent across a couple events yeah but I was live every time that's probably fair enough and I'm not perfect and sometimes I'm sometimes I I I I'm in my own narrow Viewpoint with the context that I have that other people don't necessarily have and that I can't expect them to have but that's pretty obvious to me like I I I get it you've been making content for a long time there's a a ridiculous amount of hours of your
face on video sometimes things are going to be wrong yeah yeah I mean my favorite is I think my personal favorite is the time we did a wow topic where a guy bought a house with Bitcoin and we were like yeah but it'll never be used for anything real cuz it it didn't seem like it would the trans I mean even now the transaction costs are so high that it's like woefully impractical but I me people use it for Stuff one day I'll find mine nice oh no 2009 Bitcoins or dollars or the year when I started oof
350 Bitcoins somewhere somewhere in the world on a hard drive no way dude I started right at the beginning no way dude keeps me up at night sometimes 350 coins yeah something like that I mean they were they were like just coins back then you could just you know the there there was hundreds in a in a  number it's somewhere somewhere you have no idea where no how do you have no idea where it's 2009 so what I know where drives that I had in 2009 are I have checked all me
weird I mean they got written over oh so it's probably I have gone through all of them with like FBI grade recovery tools looking for blocks and things like that they're somewhere somewhere bummer one  hash I should check probably uh probably not though couple more hey dlll Luke any advice on how to handle work when your natural workflow involves spikes of productivity but management starts to expect consistent levels of productivity equal to your spikes that's pretty tough um I
uh I don't have any good advice for that I think I do do your best be open and honest um that's all you can really do start a communication with your manager about overall resulting productivity not the productivity of every minute um and try to find Grudge tasks like tasks that you know I don't know maybe your job is to do oh yeah good distraction tasks are good yeah like when you're distracted anyway yeah so like things that you can kind of just get through like maybe it's
email maybe it's something else where like you know this is an annoying task anyways and you know maybe you can be your your mind is kind of somewhere else but you'll you'll feel yourself kind of click back in and then you can get back to the main thing you're trying to work on like try to do something thing um even if it's not amazing um but but yeah try to try to show your your overall productivity over the course of a week or a month or whatever you want to use for your time frame um and show that
you're still doing well and just explain you know my brain works a little different something like that this is the second message like this during this Wan show go ahead Dan are you sure I mean I guess the second one it's the second one you didn't see the one in float plane chat no I didn't uh the only baby name my wife and I could somewhat agree on is for our second baby is lonus I promise it wasn't my idea does lonus give his Blessing so just think about this it's 
penis just seems like a pretty good name to me throwing that out there if that's the case just line them up for Success someone it's literally in like Oceans 11 or something like Matt Damon refers to a penis as his lonus or something like that like it's this is actually a thing in an actual no no it is absolutely a thing I'm tired of arguing with you Crystal um ly I thank you for that that's great yeah so um just consider that it 100% is a thing and uh in response to the person
in float plane chat earlier who said uh um you know I'm going to say that my kid is named after the Charlie Brown character can I at least give you guys an alternative okay go with this guy way more important than me okay if you must if you must name your child uh lius okay two Nobel prizes let's go okay "there you go 1,200 papers and books uh" new scientist called them one of the 20 great scientists of all time this is apparently my name sake so let's all let's all just remember who
the original lonus is actually I think it's a Biblical name hold  character pop line oh yeah there's pop Lines no no it goes further back than that uh I looked it up and found a Reddit thread from 11 years ago about this um and hilariously enough people are talking about you in it you you seem to  it what is this where is what billionaire there it is slang for the penis yeah there you go Charlie Brown is slang for the balls it is not if Charlie Brown was slang for anything it'd be a little further back
than the balls yeah really but yeah I  yeah they thought it was lioness yeah I've gotten that a number of times but then it there's people talking about you because apparently you linked This Thread I did oh per lus Sebastian of lus Media Group from three years ago and then it's kind of weird that lonus linked to this thread and then apparently some tweet  thing Oceans 11 I feel like it's a but it's a thing for like four people no it's it's in a movie I haven't seen anyone refer to the
Oceans 11 thing it's a thing ah hold on man if if it turns out that you're wrong will you be disappointed if it turns out I'm wrong no it's a thing do you want your name to be penis no nobody no Peter doesn't dick doesn't none of them want it I it might not be that bad unless they do hey how do you get dick from Richard yes yeah ask him nicely it's an old one I'm sorry yeah I'm not finding anything about this maybe Oceans 12 it's in one of them they definitely they definitely say that it's definitely a
thing we need we need we need the flow plane chat to research this and come back to us next week Arrested Development was it Arrested Development that Reddit thread that apparently you linked to was a rested development Reddit thread Buster referred to his his dong that way it's definitely  thing um I searched for lonus penis and now I  fans I thought we Clos that down I think it is yeah we did but I think you can still maybe find an archive of it  Reddit Apple's AI notification summaries
McDonald's coffee ruined Mercedes abandoned slitter Bond light's dead I'm sorry yeah that sucks that's rough I didn't pre-recorded pre-recorded Lano The Conspiracy Theory just have so much ammo now oh no it's been a rough day I mean you had a bad week mine is  worse I mean or better you don't have to  Tuesday [Laughter] nice it's all coming up so sincere that that nice was so sincere and it's nice that this is the end of the show we'll see you guys again next week same bad time same bad Channel
