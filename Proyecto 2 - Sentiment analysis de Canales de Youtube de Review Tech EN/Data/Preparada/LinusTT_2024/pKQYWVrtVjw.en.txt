what's up y'all welcome to the W show it's been a great week no it's been a great week nope and it's going to be a great w show okay oh I wasn't even talking about like world events I realized what that probably sounded like now I'm I wasn't trying I'm not even we're not even going down that road wow it took us it took us exactly 3 seconds I didn't intend to 3 seconds no to alienate somehow half of America that wasn't even what I was talking about and we don't even know which one it
is way to go Luke I was talking about completely not American things okay I nothing to do with America we've got a lot of great topics for you guys today I forget what the headline one was so Luke might get it for a change AMD is rocketing upward they have wow okay we we'll get into the details later but that is AB absolutely incredible EA has ditched support for Linux in Apex Legends citing the fact that Linux gamers are far more likely to cheat them some fighting words Y what
else we got this week a modder has made DIY upgradeable Mac storage okay this is so cool this is legitimately Co Crazy Prices we were talking about might not be so bad actually there's a little more to that as well we'll get to it intriguing uh the last one I will bring up is that Ms paint might be like a a cool neat thing to do on your computer again really maybe they're bringing AI features Ms paint and Notepad  the show is brought to you today by thingiverse oh cool SE Sonic notion and
of course our chair partner secret lab our laptop partner LG and our rap partner dbrand Okay small as side have you seen my car yet not in person I've seen pictures though my goodness okay anyway that's all to tell me when you get pulled over EA is dropping Linux support for Apex Legends despite the fact that the game was in the top 50 in terms of popularity on the steam deck over the past year according to EA developers it is much harder to catch linux-based cheaters and the quote is
the openness of the Linux operating systems make it an attractive the openness of the Linux operating systems whatever make it an attractive one for cheaters and cheat developers they claimed that the impact of Linux cheaters was having an outsized impact on other players experience and thus EA has decided it is not worth supporting the platform I suspect if I'm reading between the lines accurately I suspect this might also mean that the player base playing on Linux is probably
not super high either but it's very interesting to me that they specifically call out the outsized impact that that   toister EA one of Halo titles like Apex Legends which okay is not a Halo title  mean do it he wasn't even paying enough attention what he wasn't paying enough attention oh forget it get on the ball Dan I was responding to a horrific merch message oh oh uh uh well cool I guess we'll get to that later okay anyway the point is we've got a few discussion questions here and I'm I'm legitimately
interested to hear not just Luke's perspective but I'd like to hear your guys's perspectives as well like if there's anyone who works in game development particularly an anti-che development feel free to drop that into the float plane chat I'm going to kind of keep an eye out for it but you know the first question is wouldn't more cheat makers be attracted to Windows seeing as the paid cheat industry is kind of of an enormous industry these days and windows is obviously going to
be the platform of choice for most Gamers that's where your biggest player base is wonder if it's a premium thing though like the you know you have a less likeliness of getting caught if you use this one we are the premium specialized tool for the Discerning cheater I very much suspect that it is but do do you really think that it that it is more worth it Arch during the day cheating at Apex Legends at night do you really think that it's more worth it to kind of jump through whatever Hoops you might
have to jump through to become a Linux gamer you know figure out installing Linux for yourself which to be clear I I'm I'm not I'm not talking about you guys right now you guys know how to you know use rofus and make a USB drive and install an operating system on your computer yeah exactly exactly I mean surely that wouldn't cause the system to immediately brick you did you ever see that video I did nothing wrong except where it tells you that it's going to break no no different video oh
there's a short circuit where I unbox the Linux laptop I I install Steam on it I did I did nothing I just installed Steam on it and then it just wouldn't boot up again no I don't think I've seen that I have a talent I have a talent anyway you steam you steam and Linux in the same room yeah the point is I'm not talking about I'm not talking about you guys you can do that I'm talking about your average like Slack do gamer man like I was at Pax one year and I was at the Nvidia booth and they were showing off
this was when they were showing off game stream right so their Wi-Fi uh game streaming to the to the had they launched the shield console yet I don't even think so I think it was on the little Shield portable that little handheld Android box and there's this guy in a bean bag chair and uh I walk up to him and I'm like hey like how's the latency on it and he's he's like I kid   I don't know that it seems like a cool game no I'm just like dude you're in you're in the Nvidia Booth you're trying
game stream it's not even running on that machine that's like the whole point it so so I guess my point is like so you're your your average cheater someone in full CH said his latency was too high was a little high it was a little a little little high okay we were in the Pacific Northwest all right you know he probably okay we got a lot of uh he was enjoying a we got a lot of oceans okay a  reef he's a reefer this isn't fair you can't be this on it when you're sick you're it's not this isn't okay you got
to um my goodness anyway so so so if I was to try to kind of profile the person who needs to cheat at games see when I was a kid the people who cheated at games were like kids right because they they didn't they weren't good or they didn't have they didn't have time to use the computer like I feel like that's kind of flipped around where adults are doing things on their phones and like you know the kids just kind of seem to have free reign at their computers and stuff like the adults needed to like use
the computer like you were you were fighting over and and in particular the internet connection right like the the phone line needed to stay open unless you're I have an important call tonight exactly you can just like be on the internet all the time so so you would you could you could cheat and then you could like you could download a Diablo trainer and then you could kind of like have your Godly plate of the whale I'm so sick now yeah you know go and fight Diablo or whatever right so so so the
profile that I might have in my in my mind for like a cheater as just like you know an average gamer SL a kid who's not good enough or whatever that's probably just completely wrong right because you got people who are obviously Savvy enough to play a game like tarov but obviously feel the need to cheat at it so you've got these I guess I've talked myself completely out of my argument now because the amount of work that people are see seem to be willing to put into not doing the work there that's what I'm
trying to get at here when you and I were growing up when we were youngans uh cheaters were it was generally associated with having some amount of knowledge of like software development even if you got the cheat from someone else it it was it seemed like there was some amount of Arcane knowledge like it was a pain in the butt to figure out and the resources to to to research it and the amount of trouble you get in from your parents for going on sites that could get the computer a virus and now
it's like advertised on YouTube and Twitter and stuff like it's it's a totally different realm um so I think the like hey this isn't too bad a lot of people actually do this like all the time is the current Vibe and when that's the case you might be more willing to actually try the stuff that would be hard you know what I mean installing Linux running them that way Etc okay Decimus Roman says nothing Decimus Roman says I suspect that part of this is that Linux doesn't allow video game companies to
play the same games they do on windows with memory inspection um but even then the game was a mess on Linux and they weren't really making progress in fixing it do you think that Linux cheaters are just a scapegoat I've I've I wonder about that a little bit um cuz I do know yeah the the install base for Linux for most games tends to be really low um I know it's not super common for for developers to want to take Linux out of their um you know supported operating systems um Mac is is the worst U but
Linux is is pretty bad for that as well I've heard that this is much less of a problem now that steam deck is a thing because a higher percentage of your  but I don't know so okay hold on um Gauntlet wizard says it does allow memory inspection in  more is it just not supported by their anti-che that's a good question I'm not sure and again that would come back down to just scapegoating not to put in the  whoa is that scapegoating not wanting to put in the resources no I mean I I just
mean saying because it would still be scapegoating to say it's because of people cheating on the platform well it is for yeah so for if if the reason is actually just that they they they could deal with it but they would just have to put in the work um to to figure out you know better memory inspection um and I don't though is memory inspection really the biggest impediment though or would it be more to do with um I was going to say more to do with not being allowed to just run at kernel
level willy-nilly but even they probably like could tons of different I I learned this from playing tarov there's tons of different types of cheats because you could cheat and this would help you in Apex Legends a lot actually is knowing where everyone of the map is right yeah you can do that without changing what's in the memory you do that just by reading the memory I see and there's nothing you can do to prevent something from just reading I don't see how you'd do that I I I don't I don't know enough
about it I think it shows up in device manager though doesn't it um on Windows I don't like I Gauntlet wizard says nobody would let them have route to access it because Linux Gamers aren't stupid but it's like okay but hold on a second if the game just requires it if the game just requires it you either don't play or you do it yeah like what do you what is your I guess that's my question is what is your proposal for for anti-che then if if we don't access this stuff if we don't lock
it down like and and I'm not saying this is the way you know to to allow companies to install root kits or you know Colonel level antiche or whatever else I'm not I'm not saying that's the way I'm just saying okay if that isn't the way what what's the other way like give give me give me another  it's going to be yeah Windows Colonel expert can protect okay yeah so this is more just like PE people are mainly saying look this pretty much seems to come down to Resource Management
um yeah I don't know not a cheat developer I can't say Hardware level encryption of processes memory I mean we're talking about like a complete architectural shift then at least for you know like the open you know standards desktop PC I mean you could you could do that for a console or whatever else you're not going to do that on windows at least not for the time being um apparently Auto hotkey gives you Aimbot on apex I've I've seen a couple people talk about that this is wild dude I I saw some
someone in the chat in float plane chat was saying I I have a friend who's good at uh what is it I don't remember what it is Battlefield Cod something I don't know some game and basically he uses cheats because he'll get put into lobbies that are too sweaty and he just wants to go around and kill people it's like look I can't tell you B I can't tell you who to be friends with and who to not be friends with um but your friend's an [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] so yeah like that that it's mathematical I 
other like if they if they're if they're okay with that what other things are they okay with you know and that that's a bit of a slippery slope because you're expecting every person to be perfect but it's like it's it's it's concerning and it would raise a red for no there's an easy counterargument the easy counter argument is it's a game does it even really matter that much and then there's an easy counterargument to that if someone is willing to lie or cheat or or step on someone else when the stakes are
so low when it doesn't even matter when it hardly impacts them at all if it was on the line if it was a big deal would they stand up for what's right heck no obviously yeah like they were willing to compromise their principles for literally zero personal gain nothing I don't know just food for thought just food for thought yeah yeah funny hat says if you wouldn't trust a man with a dollar would you trust him with a million dollars people I I there there's someone I stopped playing badminton with um
because I was sitting behind their court at a tournament and it was uh it was like 2220 so it was like into Deuce where you have to win by two points third set and the other team hit a clear over their head and it obviously uh landed out no it obviously obviously landed in and they called it out and the way that it works in in recreational tournaments is that the line call is the team that is that is on that side you you call your own line calls because you're closer you you're the only one
who can realistically tell there's no line judges because we don't have you know six people to line up down all edges of the court and like check everything cuz it's just wreck right yeah um and what you're supposed to do is if you're not sure you replay the point okay if there's a dispute you're supposed to replay the point so the other person was like uh that was obviously in um and this this person who I had been playing with on a fairly regular basis was like uhuh uh uh uh uh
uh uh uh uh and like got all aggressive about it and declared themselves the winner of the game and the other people being you know non-confrontational and just being like dude this it's a game like what is what are we even what are we even doing here they backed down cuz they were like this is this is ridiculous and I was like yeah that's uh I I I would never I will never play with that person again I I will never set foot on a court with that person because you are just you're a
dishonest person uh you have shown your character more clearly than any words you could ever say yeah um especially in such a like not that it makes it better in a  uh game but like it's just it it just it it feels almost worse that it was like a casual recreational match yeah you know like I just I don't know I mean in so well and you know what no no I think that's a fair point because in a professional League part of the gamesmanship like literally I had this I had this like NHL card game when I was a
kid and um I don't ever heard of that one of and and so what would happen is like you could like you would it was like a deck game and you would well I mean any card games a deck game whatever just calm down the point it wasn't a deck building game it was a card game so so you would you would draw your cards and so you could um you could play a shot and the other person would have to have a save M okay or or they could play a hook and then uh I could play uh um the the ref to call the hook oh okay
and then you could play behind the ref's back and then the hook wouldn't get called and then my shot wouldn't go in you know like so there were like multiple ways to defend against a goal and so and and so I guess what I'm trying to say is I think at a professional level there is a there's a certain amount of gamesmanship that is pushing the boundaries but then that's also why you would have a ref or a line judge at that level of competition exactly so I guess what I'm trying to say is yes at a professional
level no I I I think I don't I don't really respect it no I don't like dirty players yeah but I also do acknowledge that that is the expectation and that if everyone's doing it now it's part of the game yeah and we can we can doesn't mean it's good the Dives in soccer are disgusting and ridiculous extremely detrimental to The credibility of the sport as an outsider who actually enjoys watching watching football there I'll even I'll even use the proper name for the sport out of respect women's
football soccer whatever is fun and cool to watch they don't dive yep so as someone as someone who thinks the game is super cool and at least I don't see a lot of it and I'm used to hockey you know so I'm not going to be I'm not one of the one of those Americans who's like I watch basketb if there's no scoring for like 18 seconds I'm bored like what's happening why is why why why is anybody scoring but that's so big like I like I don't even mind it I don't even mind it I come from hockey I'll watch a
zero I'll watch a nil nil game all the time no problem um I I mean I prefer scoring I I think we all do but but but but I like the tension you know I like the tension but it yeah really it really takes me out of it dude it takes me out of it in a big way when when it just feels like instead of watching a a a sports competition I'm watching a freaking like high school level acting competition yeah it's pathetic I I was trying to get into it at one point in time yeah if I wanted to watch I just
immediately turn it off the second someone I'd watch YouTuber apology video duels that' actually be kind of a funny uh a funny concept for video how well would ours do uh I don't know I didn't PewDiePie review it did he I think so I don't know I think so I have no idea I wonder what he said I don't remember I probably looked at it at some point L apology MC lean says well you're still around hey all right then I guess uh then I guess I guess I'd probably do pretty okay 
now how big is this Crea oh no what what is this what is this what is this 2.4 million yeah is this seriously the last video they uploaded too like what what is this this left it off on a banger dude 2.4 million views I didn't mean to click on  man what is this what are you looking  how did they how did they get my brain in videos I didn't expect that relatable what the heck oh man Dan hit me with that before I forget is that my key thanks oh okay oh man I forgot what
I was even trying to find entire chat is  you know what let it out let it out yeah yeah why not be in the Tuesday it's  screaming oh my goodness all right um so here's my here's my last sort of question coming back to the whole is it just because Linux Gamers or cheaters um I guess if it's just like a if it's just like a scapegoat thing Linux people Linux people are cheaters uh or or if it's just and and the real reason is we don't feel like doing the work then why are so many other anti-che games not
bothering is it also just because they don't feel like stuff uh I wouldn't be too surprised um I'd be interested to hear from actual anti-che developers because honestly I don't know but I'm I'm thinking about you know how much work it is to even try to keep up with the cheating community as anti-che developers uh because you're you're kind of like I'm making assumptions here not an anti-che developer you're kind of you have to sort of be reactive yeah oh I would think so that sucks I mean you're
going to try to get out ahead of it but like I'm sure you have some developers that are pushing to try to get ahead some developers that are pushing to try to be reactive but we've talked about this before where certain departments are Revenue generating departments and other departments are considered you know more like boat anchor departments and if I'm if I'm a game developer I'm looking at my anti-che not as a revenue generation department but as like a as as a burden as something that I need to
well usually anti-che is a separate company um sorry but you're you're still going to sorry sorry sorry uh you're still going to have internal people that are responsible for the implementation you're still going to have internal people that are uh working to make sure that the game actually functions with the third party um and so this is something that by and large and there's still going to be a limit to how much you're going to want to pay your third party anti cheet so in terms of the the
investment you're making an anti-che it's not EA going to pay 50% more to have Linux compatible to counter to counter how much cheat developers can charge for their services right so what we're looking at is a situation where the investment in cheating software is is a revenue generating Department an exciting Department whereas the investment in anti-che is like a burdensome we have to do this so we can sell more hopefully the the the players GFF yeah exactly um and so you're always
going to I I just feel like you're always going to be on the back foot that way um and and there there's a really there's a really unpleasant comment in the float plane chat someone said because they're lazy and that is just so unfair to developers I I have had the pleasure of meeting of meeting some game developers and I haven't met a single one that I would characterize as just lazy yeah um in fact they've felt to me and this is based on limited interactions none of them are my best
friends or anything did you meet the developers sorry yeah like that this is a person who their job is do development yeah well they're not picking their tasks well I know that's what I'm getting to Luke he ruined the thing I'm working on whole setup here I do specialize at that yeah I mean but but what I'm trying to say is like they've seemed in every case passionate um and a lot of the time if they're not getting resources if they're not getting time they're not getting tasked thank you
Luke on on these things that will that will improve the game for their Community well it comes down to the bean counters that that comes from somewhere to defend potentially the bean counters sometimes there are business realities that there's nothing they can do about if we spend all this time and all this money on this thing that like four people care about it will cost us an opportunity over here it will come at to the detriment of these other things can I no longer hire a person to help this
other overworked person we have on the team uh can we not give good raises this year do we have to lay people off because we're out of money um these are questions that be en counters are trying to dude that monolith tour it's rough out there right now that monolith tour was so cool um like the the number of the of the of of the game I wouldn't say necessarily all of them were devs but devs and artists um the number of the people that worked on the game that were like so multi hated and um like they
literally did their own combat Mo cap just like people who worked in the studio who were like I like train karate on my own time I'm going in the moap room to like fight with people and like d so sick that is so cool that was that was a really cool thing that we did um speaking of things being rough out there dude did you see Warner Brothers said they lost $100 million um Lo hold on lost 100 million I'm working on it uh they lost yeah here we go multivers and quittage champions
together a and flip Lan chat said it's rough when you do bad decisions don't disagree I will also say and I'm not saying that you don't I'm just I think sometimes a lot of the feedback that you hear from that is people that don't make that level of decision it's also really easy to look at those level of decisions in hindsight and be like yeah that was obviously stupid I've done stuff that was obviously stupid in hindsight am I I don't know can you think of anything uh  [Laughter]
yeah we're good I think I broke him we're good I think I broke him I think there's there's so many things running to his brain right now it's actually reached a runaway State and he can't bring it back under control okay what were we even talking about we were talking about the hard incident oh my uh which was not that word okay it was not that word yeah that's not a word that I believe exists in myab in my life to to aqual or whatever trust me I get it and there's a lot of scenarios where
I feel like even if if we're not thinking in a hindsight sense I'm looking at some of the things some of these companies are doing I'm like oh my that's so incredibly dumb and I mean it happens I'm not defending all of it I'm just saying sometimes like I don't know it doesn't it's it's not automatically that this person was just like being a malicious jerk um sometimes they're just trying to deal with the cards they have and they don't have a great option and they do the one they
think is best and none of them were good and that one sucks and people are mad and it's what was that channel that you were talking about that like takes apart the bags and stuff oh yeah uh did you watch that because you just like the  what I just I just couldn't help noticing that out of the two of us for some reason you're the corporate boot liquor no I'm just I'm I'm giving them a hard time goodness I'm giving Luke's trying to say is that everyone everyone human and I mean that at a variety of
levels too right we could be talking about a small indie game with two people or one person um and I and I mean that all the way up I suspect the more the company size grows the more it is malicious and bad and dumb decisions I think the more it is attached too exactly um you have people that don't care about the thing that they're making they just want more money and you have people who don't know who the people working on it are absolutely they don't see them they don't interact with them
every day like these these are absolutely things I'm just saying like I don't know anyway WB Games um lost 100 million on multivers and quiddit champions can I just say for a moment that I would be happy Warner Brothers I would be happy to work as a consultant for you okay and if you'd like for the small fee of $99 million oh okay I would be happy to tell you that whether you should make a game or not yeah yeah yeah and quited champions let me let me get let me let me it a pretty obvious
no speaking of speaking of uh uh bad decisions that we don't need hindsight to have known whether or not I don't know anything about this game not even sort of surprised it didn't do well why would you buy a Quidditch game quidditch literally is a sport one of the worst thought of sports that was invented by someone who hates Sports I didn't know that I'm not surprised thinks they're stupid and went out of their way to to make a like a um just terribly designed game uh what What's the word it's it's
it's it's not parody the it's satire it's it's it's like it's it's it's or maybe it is parody I don't know it's whatever the word I'm looking for it is it's it is intent caricature that's pretty good thanks ninja dude it's a caricature of sport it it emphasizes the the weird tribalism to the point where people are cheering when people get seriously injured or almost killed it it has intentionally arbitrary rules to sort of to to highlight how utterly arbitrary the rules can feel sometimes
especially if you don't really understand Sports and you don't care to learn about them like it it is it is intentionally stupid and intentionally makes no sense and this is something that isn't even just like a like a retcon oh yeah you know I totally intended for that plot hole um or you know I intended for those characters to have an unspoken relationship or you know whatever this isn't just some like random inserted in an interview 5 years after the fact this was was like well
established right early on yeah quidditch is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] stupid and that's totally on purpose um yeah and also like it was one of those games I remember reading about it because there was pretty much no way for them to win on this because to make the game um true to the sport right like in the novels and in the movies you you have to it would have to suck yes and you would and so you would anger a lot of the hardcore fans of you know the Harry Potter Universe right and and then
to make a balanced game that would actually play like a decent game at all um well yeah basically have to completely change oh right right right right right so if you make a balanced game you'll you'll you'll screw up with the hardcores and if you make the game the way that it was in the novels and the way it was in the movies it'll be completely unplayable to any gamer who's like knows what a rule set is and how they yeah raen 428 says they should have just done Calvin ball at that point dude
yeah I would play the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of Calvin ball like okay why not because Bill Waton would never license it that's why that makes sense Bill William if I may you know what no I disagree hold on okay hold on William okay how about this as a deal how about this as a deal okay you license Calvin h wait wait wait wait you license Calvin and Hobbs stop it but but the not for-profit organization that runs it okay has like all the safeguards okay it has like capped executive pay for the people who
M stop it for the people who manage the IP okay it contributes literally 100% of its of its yearly proceeds to the foundation or the cause of your choice um in perpetuity and and and and it just it contributes in some way in some way just nothing but good to the world with all the profits  toy I think I think based Bill Waton understands that given the erosion of time and entropy all things are able to become corrupted and wasted well then he knows that as soon  anyway hold on as long as you can or or
don't live to see your your thing that you made ruined or instead of writing don't allow The Hobbit to be made in video in movie form instead of writing that weird picture book or whatever spend your time spend your time like making it make setting it up for coolness before you go man because the world needs morein just did it that'd be cool well he doesn't want to he's like retired no unretire well I would like that too make yeah better this time please don't make that thing what up dude Steal You me yeah
for what I guess hello State your request over here what hello oh oh hi uh okay is this live right now yeah why are you doing this Dan I don't know anymore okay bye all right uh Dan do you have merch messages for me so he can go run away BRB one sec okay bye what topic are we even on I don't remember I don't uh EA ditching Linux I don't know how we got where we're at oh this makes this kind of suck it is what it is though all right I'm really not we'll uh we'll do what we can
anyways uh yeah sure you guys should go away there we go yeah leave please thank you I love you uh okay let's see what do I got what do I got okay I am so out of it today I'm so sorry it's okay okay what we it's okay what do we have I know that there was something dude so I have to i' I've so the W Show's been ending slightly early for quite a while because I've had  apart because it's 12 hours apart and you know you have to go to work it's basically determined that the latest it
could be in the morning is like 8:30 um so we do birds Med bird meds at 8:30 in the morning that means 12 hours later we have to do bird meds at 8:30 at night my my girlfriend's going to be away this weekend so I've had to try to learn how to do bird meds alone we've had this we've had this strategy where I catch them she gives the medicine we're good we we make the room really dark they have really bad dark vision uh humans have generally Better Dark Vision I can see them I can catch them no
problem and I hold them with two hands so I have a very nice hold on them where there's no pressure at all they're mostly just like standing on one of my fingers while I'm just not allowing them to leave and I nicely hold their head in place and everything's all good and safe and they're generally okay with it I now have to catch them entirely holding them in one hand and then medicine feed them with my other hand which is the traditional way to do it it's a hard thing to learn I'm figuring that out
right now that's been uh that's been a that's been a trip um ask for help um like from who who's going to be able to help me at 8:30 in the morning in my house um what if the other bird helped yeah oh we got line back already we didn't even get to do a merch message be a maneuver that was so fast what did you do sound like my wife again you what what did you  was you good me yeah yeah I got my chips okay yeah yeah yeah yeah that's good all right just making sure Canada hasn't been invaded
yet it's great life is good uh what are we talking about uh I don't think we actually got to IM mer mes I was I was buying time we do actually have to explain merch messages and do a couple so this is probably are we du to do that okay hey messages the best way to interact with the show it's merch messages or just I don't know rolling up and interrupting apparently because that's what Jake does what a what a guy what a flipping guy so we don't do twitch bits we don't do
super chats we do merch messages because the way that we see it if you're going to throw money at your screen hey your screen should throw something right back in your face that's right what what did you just throw I don't know it was Heavy though wasn't it yeah it was pretty exciting um so the point is that all you got to do to send a merch message which will go to producer Dan over here I wasn't aiming at you Dan no it's exploded all over the floor it's fine it's fine yeah yeah it's 
now who don't take a black light home the point is the point is that all you got to do is go on LTT store.com throw something in your cart you'll see a little box for Merch messages you can leave a merch message it'll go to producer Dan he'll forward it to someone answer it himself he'll pop it up on the bottom of the screen or he will curate it for me and Luke to respond to live on the show you don't have to do that anymore do what you got an operation and everything yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
100% 100% now it's just for fun all right maybe we can wrap up this segment and get into some merch messages  that wouldn't be a problem I know I'm tell you you can't be this on it when you're sick you're setting an unfair bar I'm never going to be able to do the W show what I'm saying it's ridiculous um so anyway it's in the it's in the cart you check out your merch mess something we'll reply to it curated merch messages Dan do you want to show a couple of them how it works sure sure
sure uh lonus do you still Hold Your Meme stock or did you end up selling it all uh Ivonne took it from me at some point because we needed to shift some cash around at some point um I think we lost money it was way after the fact I remember that yeah um I remember you I I think one of you told me and I was like oh you like still had that the investment account is empty now not because we lost everything was it did it come out flat I actually legitimately don't remember anymore but Ivonne needed to move
everything that was out of that sort of play money investment account that she let me have um and she needed to do something responsible oh I think uh to buy the smash Champs building building yeah probably yeah I think it was probably the down payment for smash Champs is okay so what okay so I hear you when you say the the investment account is empty and I I understand how that functionally works but when you have things like the the nas company and framework like is that because those are
different forms of so so the when I say the investment account is empty Market that yeah yeah okay so I own literally 0 of stocks in the market however I think uh I think I have uh an investment in a Reit uh I forget I forget what it stands for Real Estate something T something it's some kind of like term deposit thing and they like invest in real estate on your behalf or something something like that um so I I have I have a small amount in a Reit um I I have the approximately uh quarter m in framework
like 2 220 or 225 or something like that uh it's a similar amount in um I don't know if they have they they've announced their names right the name ashte well now it's announced I think so I think there's even a website in the nas yeah in the nas software company um and that I have real estate holdings and then I own stocks in lonus Media Group Inc this thing yeah hex hexos ashtech yeah it's down at the bottom of the page yeah yeah so so that that is that is it um it's one of those things where I
think that there would definitely have been opportunities for me to do extremely well in tech stocks um but it has seemed a inconvenient and be extremely um unethical morally questionable to participate um I wanted to buy Nvidia back when it was like $17 when I worked at NC that would have been a pretty good move yeah it is what it is but yeah you you know you know how it is I think yeah I think holding framework like Ultra Mega longterm is a little bit different than
like tech stocks Diamond hands those are very frame the framework was was a I wonder what the technical value of that investment is now I don't know I was going to say narv offered to tell me last time I saw him when I was at computex and I was like dude I actually don't want to know yeah it's not going to change anything yeah and the reality of it is even if it even if it doubled even if it quadrupled um it's not it's not uh going to impact our business in any meaningful
way like uh we're we're not um salar we're not cash strapped um it's not like we're it's it's not like we like have a troubl making payroll um you know and and I feel like now is a good time just like shout out the team like massive massive shout out to the merch team business team content team uh did we talk about this last week we had we had an all hands was that we talked about in the All Hands yeah we had an all hands earlier this week and um was that this week was it this week a long week dude
was it this week uh yeah holy crap oh my that's crazy no I'm glad oh no that's not okay that that's actually wild we all should not feel like that I'm upset that's actually upsetting what a week that's crazy um okay we have it's weird it's weird that the beginning of Co feels like it was like a couple years ago but this week feels like it was a month long yeah I could have guessed at least two or three weeks yeah so we had an all hands this week and uh I was I was the one of the
quarterly speakers it was mine and yvon's turn from the exec team to to speak in addition to sort of Taran giving opening and closing remarks and great power point uh thank you thank you very much uh I drew our building on fire um and my my my point was there's a lot of headwinds coming for us and um so what we should just give up so it was kind of a it was kind of a little talk about resilience um for the team and in both directions um you know talking about the resilience we're going to need
to have going forward and also celebrating the resilience that we have shown uh over the last realistically the last few years which have has involved a hypergrowth phase and a shrink phase and then a more gradual reaing our way back to where we were phase and um and I I took a little bit of time to to shout out um some of the teams that have been essential for that um for that kind kind of I don't I don't know what to I don't know what to call it other than just like um like a getting back on track
right um like LTT uh I think I had said was within like 15% 10% within 10% of of where views were like sort of last July last June last July um the overall company like the entire portfolio I think was in was within like 15 or 20% viewership wise uh float plane massive massive shout out to the float plane team uh to the social team so Sammy if you if you floaters are watching all those exclusives Sam's killing it man crushing I've really been enjoying crushing it the floe content um and and
you and you know I mean like Sammy doesn't operate in a vacuum you know you got to give you got to give credit to the behind the scenes folks right like obviously there there's the editors you know the Community Management like chewy there's the guys that are working on strategy from the business team um that helping with all this stuff yeah huge shout out business team but basically like every team he kind of been resilient um was was what I what I had wanted to talk about and I forget
where I started on all of this do does anyone remember what the question was I don't think I remember anymore Dan do you still hold meme stocks oh yeah right um yeah I don't remember how I got here but anyway the team is amazing and thank you all oh right float plane is back "almost up to 40,000" "40,000 members which is which is pretty" nuts kind of unbelievable yeah you know if you think about it cuz that we we spiked up that high because of the the YouTube hack um and then we you know we thought
it was going to decline after the YouTube hack because it was such a crazy Spike and we thought that people were uh at least some of the people coming in had no long-term intentions even before they saw the platform we were hoping that some of them were going to see it and be like oh this is actually pretty cool I'm going to stay um that did seem to happen to a surprisingly large percentage of them but some people were just going to naturally naturally Fade Out um but to be back up to near YouTube
hack levels is like whoa pretty nuts do you remember why I was talking about the All Hands cuz I don't I got distracted by the fact that I thought that that was like a month ago no okay cool well anyway um oh we you you were talking about how the company doesn't need the money uh oh yeah framework yeah okay so the um the framework thing yeah how did that how did that figure into that I don't know uh CU we were talking about Investments you were talking about how you you could try to
sell we were talking about do you do you know the valuation of your investment oh yeah I have no idea yeah yeah I have no idea and uh and it doesn't matter oh right and it doesn't matter because I was talking to the team about how like we're kind of back baby yeah um good we had two separate threads two yes I saw this with a bunch of upvotes I think it was either I think it was last week on the subreddit that were like yo have you been just like really enjoying the content lately and people
were like yeah it's been it's been and you know what it's been it's been really heartening uh for the team like today I I read out what I thought was just a really cool comment on um on one of plof recent videos um what what was it oh yeah I know what one you're talking about you do I think I know the comment you're talking about yeah you do how could you possibly know this did you did you read through Chewy's uh oh no you social report you sent me a comment oh no it's a different
one oh um so this was on uh almost nobody else has the world's best TV and uh they go this channel is running on all cylinders again the creativity of the Skits the edgy jokes the efficient means of delivering useful information the creation of a culture for Tech LT is putting out some great stuff lately lus seems like he's in a flow State it's good to see honestly I hope you continue to create a reputation for Quality transparency and fun you guys are killing it um that doesn't
happen with lonus in a flow state right like that happens when you've got resilience that happens when you've got people working hard caring a lot um and just kind of and and just kind bearing down and getting it done and when I say bearing down and getting it done that doesn't mean that you have to like be in like a like a frantic like you know horrible State all the time it means it means focusing on what we need to be doing and not allowing yourself to get distracted by by negativity or by um
by things that don't matter you know by by little details unimportant stuff unimportant details little details as well is is when generally when commenters make comments like lonus feels like he's in a flow state or input pretty much anyone else's public facing name it's really what I think they're generally saying not always obviously but what they're generally saying is like the the personification of this person which is a bunch of people in the company in a trench coat is doing well
if that makes sense like the this person and the supporting teams around them are doing well and to be clear not everything is perfect no right of course not never will be we're not perfect not everything is going according to plan and we still make mistakes sometimes um yep like I think we called a ryzen 7 or ryzen 5 or something like core Ultra 5 285k which is not its name yep yep and uh I also misspoke at the beginning of video where I was like AMD doesn't really make ryzen
fivs and ryzen 3es anymore we were literally reviewing a ryzen 5 my point was AMD doesn't really make low-end chips in their current generation anymore they just like don't bother the earlier ryzen Generations AMD brought their latest tech they brought their aame to budget consumers and now they just don't do it and I misspoke I said ryzen 5 and ryzen 3 when what I meant was ryzen 3 and a very limited lineup of ryzen 5es because they've just kind of hollowed out their low end and I'm I'm sorry I'm sorry um
it doesn't change my point and yeah I should make sure that we're actually you know saying the right words at the right times in the right order um but yeah I think we're um I think we're doing a lot right overall and uh I think that there's definitely going to be some some some tweaks for us to continue to make I think that having the having like the the leadership team in to kind of help focus on the business things that need to be done so that I can do what I do best which is focus on
the content has overall been a very good thing even though it's been it's been a learning curve it's been a learning curve I had uh honestly yeah I mean whatever I might as well just say I had  know somewhat short conversation with another member of the leadership team this morning you know this morning yep we we kind of we kind of chatted through um you know what what my expectations were in in about a certain thing and like what their expectations were and how we both probably didn't meet each
other's expectations in a way that was conducive to putting forward the best work that we both could together um and it was constructive that's good but that's the thing is nobody's perfect yeah nobody's perfect yeah and I I speaking of the nobody's perfect thing like like I said we're always going to make mistakes as a company there's always going to be you know I don't know we're going to do our best it needs to be better than it is right now but there's always going to be
some line here that you know all core Ultra 5 there's always going to be that in every once in a while like it's nobody's perfect right but Community wanted that from us for a while so I've I've been in this honestly toxic habit of checking the LTT subreddit once every couple days in this like what thing is being why are we being called demonic entities this time and it's been a nice shift in the last few months where it's just actually like LOL some meme or like hey this video is pretty cool and it's like
oh we're not evil well I think by and large they figured out that's great they figured out that um we're like mostly trying it's just it was yeah yeah it's it's a lot nicer and you know again I'm not expecting people to not not give constructive or or critical feedback when there is constructive or critical feedback to give Etc it's just it was it was popular and welcomed and praised to crap on us for like a year oh it still is in some places depending where you go to be
fair yeah yeah yeah it's it's like it's kind of comical at this point cuz it's like yeah there are there certain do you have any idea what other kinds of entities there are in the world that you could direct this energy at like are you even are you even trying to find something to be legitimately angry about at this point are you just like have you ever thought about food some random oh man yeah have youever looked at what goes in your food oh wow have you ever looked into palm
oil you know like do you know do you know what canola oil stands for no   it where's its actual name but now it's like Canada oil or something like that no way yeah um I think you made that up where did canola oil get its name from it stands for Canada oil low acid no way yeah a name created by a Canadian Industry Group of rape seed oil producers the canola plant is a type of rape seed that is low in two compounds that when removed makes his oil healthier and taste better probably cuz
saying the name of the seed just sucks want come up with somethingand yeah that makes sense made out of Orphan killing plant yeah I I would I would want to rename that personally maybe we should uh go back to the marketing table you know that would get renamed super fast very quickly I would I would this oil it's going to it's going to going to oil you in the mouth don't worry about it whoa let's let's let's rename that yeah let's rename that but we oil into some announcements oh man
yeah um is that what we're supposed to be doing did we do two merch messages we did one merch message for 45 minutes and now we're going to do the announcements and then probably move on to another topic oh wow okay okay announcements I can see the Reddit threads now we're already back to being evil again yeah it's a it's a new RW um so why why don't you grab why don't you grab a hood okay because I think it's time to relax and get cozy oh I'm actually yeah this is great we went all
in on making your new favorite hoodie the aply named super soft hoodie it's made of a butri smooth fabric that our fashion team absolutely fell in love with along with a brushed fleece inside that feels Luxx curiously soft it also features a custom big chunk draw cord with an LT logo engraved in the end that adds a nice little accent hold on I'm going to go to the Luke cam you want to show them the big chunk no too comfy oh my God okay um he's really going to be like that about it what big chunk I
wasn't even paying attention the big chunk draw cord oh these are sweet yeah sure yeah there you go there's the big so they're like actually huge yeah like the the metal at the end is it's she's Chun she's chunk do we have do we have an example of like a normal sweater I don't know cuz these These are actually like I have big hands big fingers that's my finger next to it yeah they're they're chunky they're chunky you'll have to take my word for it um and of course we have a nice soft Kanga pocket
to stick your hands into and something that we go out of our way to add on our hoodies a more secure pocket for your phone or earbuds you want to show them our classic phone pocket there it is basically we wanted to make a hoodie that you didn't even have to think twice about throwing on we even chose a color that works with just about any outfit like if you throw the tech bro vest on top of this guy you're looking snazzy and warm oh okay he's going to do that it's available now at lmg Doggs super
soft which this is apparently a thing I had to get educated I this is a thing huh I didn't know that people wore vests over sweaters okay yeah it's called a sweater vest what are you an idiot no it's not it's not called that sweater vest is a thing it's a vest that's a sweater so yeah tech tech bro he going to be boiling in like 4 seconds but I'm going to overheat he'll wear it for as long as he can and die yeah we're in the studio we're under the lights it's not it's not a good time for a warm boy like
Luke to be wearing something like that how quickly do you think Emma will steal this oh oh I I were you there Dan will it even make it inside the door the second I even felt it I already was here and I was like I'm going to have this for the WAN show and then it won't be mine anymore like yeah immediately when I get home it's gone which which kind of sucks cuz it's actually really nice yeah got him but um anyway all right so here's the uh here's the photo shoot for it super

fine I I I I can use paint here we go what about what about second one there we go okay so so hold on I've got a plan for this though remove the background there's a plan yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so I'm going to just give it the old M oh sh yep well what oh man the okay yeah here we  uh good luck with this okay what oh uh okay I think I'm about to  so uh I mean you know um from far enough away you go pretty far yeah you got to go pretty far away you gotta go pretty far
away from far enough away you have now hit the bird yeah well uh oh I need a license plate okay I need a license plate on the front because I um and after you do license plate I think I'm officially bored yeah that's fair yeah next you get to check out notepad which would be even more exciting no I'm not doing that I can do that do you want me to do that do we have this is neat though I like a lot it's local I understand it's not as good I realize that it was local it doesn't seem impressive well someone
in FL J said it is I don't I'm I'm pretty sure it is this is a Snapdragon Y which is so like that's cool I like local of this stuff that's awesome so even if it's not as good that's fine I mean it's pretty cool yes that that's a license plate on the car it sure is that's a hood ornament it's also on the car that first face might have been a little cursed but it did kind of look like it was a guy sort of he was in the car somewhere I mean he he might have had the shifter
like wedged between his butt cheeks but um he not going anywhere yeah that's safe that's it for safety yep what if you got in a crash you don't want it to accidentally go backwards when you meant to go forward yeah yep that's why you got to look both ways at the same time  right yeah he's safe he's a safe driver so um notepad seriously is there anything to that is important to look at in not I don't know it does like generative stuff if you want to just like talk about it you could show it I
don't know if it's here's what I'm curious about why are we putting development into notepad and killing wordpad why didn't we just kill notepad and make wordpad better like what was the what was the rationale here maybe someone from Microsoft anyone from Microsoft in the chat can you want to tell me why notepad was the focus please anyone I feel like they killed the word pad because it was probably harder to maintain you think so and then then they were able to just ignore notepad cuz
there was nothing going on so it wasn't going to break but they aren't ignoring notepad they're like making not I'm saying why why they made that decision in the past oh maybe but then people like me just been very exclusively very committed relationship style using notepad++ for like a decade and will never go back so just like word p I know it was I know they killed it cuz it was too close to word but I needed way to open docs without yeah having word like they're just pushing me straight into the arms
of Google for one time in the last 12 years I've had to open a Word document I don't have word installed I have no reason to have word installed I would still like to be able to open this document yeah that's what wordpad was for yeah it was fine it was not bloaty it was fine open docs is a thing yeah that's fine but the only reason I don't have word is because I'm just setting up this computer so I don't want to install any software I just want to open this bloody document cuz it has the seral for the
piece of software that I'm installing or something like it's just I don't know n all right let's do another topic yeah so yeah Ms pain it's something Luke what do you want to do AMD Rockets forward yeah let's do it according to Mercury research amd's desktop CPU market share has climbed 10% in the last year this has manifested most clearly in widespread reports that the ryzen 7 9800 x3d has sold out at retailers throughout Europe and North America and I mean I'm not surprised if
you ask anyone what CPU they should get if they're a gamer they say whatever the like best x3d chip is and that's just what it's been for a while um anyways uh they apparently sold out within minutes on Amazon and Best Buy wow uh new has claimed that they are out of individual units of the 9800 x3d but they they are for some unexplained reason still offering the 9800 x3d plus motherboard bundles that's not an unexplained reason at all I can explain that they need to sell motherboards yep and AMD in
there probably they're regretting it now um AMD in their sort of um time of being NE necessarily Pro consumer um created this expectation of their motherboard sockets lasting for a very long time so they've created this environment where they launch a new CPU and there's absolutely no accessory attached sales just new CPUs yep um so new is like yeah you're buying motherboard and a lot of times Ram some of their bundles have motherboards and RAM that's how they get you yeah uh
further there have been recent reporting that amd's data center business unit has started out selling intels for the first time in its history though this comes with some caveats roughly a billion of amds 3.5 billion in data center sales is accounted for by uh machine learning machine learning Mi uh accelerators an an area that Intel doesn't particularly compete in uh without that key $1 billion Intel's 3.3 billion Remains the top spot Intel knows i' I've heard I didn't dive into it I've
heard the the the most recent gen of Intel server processors are actually quite good despite their consumer being uh Intel knows that they have messed up um I think it would be pretty hard to not know that at this point but okay um Intel knows that they messed up in an interview with Hot Hardware VP of technical marketing Robert HCK acknowledged the launch of aerol Lake didn't go as planned citing a series of issues uh the company has now identified at an OS level and at the BIOS level um
and saying that the performance we saw in reviews to be very clear no fault of reviewers was not what we expected and not what we intended um can I interject for a moment the expectation that you're ref referring to as not what you expected or as I've been or as I've come to know whatever it doesn't matter the point is this is good I can't remember the copy pass I have I have like 300 confirmed kills yeah yeah yeah yeah you you little sh sorry another copy pass don't worry about it um the point
is what are you talking about yeah that that whole line was like What if you guys didn't have partner boards and you guys can't like launch a game and like no offense to our team but compared to the kinds of engineering resources oh that Intel can afford we just a bunch of random Bumble FS playing with gaming computers like what if you guys can't contact gigabyte or MSI or Asus be like hey bro do you mind sending over a motherboard so we can put a CPU in it and maybe open a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] game and see if
it like gets some FPS the the tools for evaluating this stuff they're they're all free what are you talking about to be clear I believe him I believe that this whole thing was super rushed I mean and I believe that they they absolutely didn't do the planning that they needed to execute this launch the way that they needed to execute we did not get the 265k yeah we had to go buy one after the fact which to be clear that's I can afford yeah I I went I bought I I bought 10 7800 X 3DS or whatever it was the
problem is the availability the problem is that our job is to bring you guys information about these products so that you can make an informed decision and Intel didn't deem it [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] necessary to send us probably the most compelling chip in the entire stack so our launch date review just doesn't have any data for it over what like seriously like like bomb cost of this chip what because how many people were going to need to buy them just send us like send us like 80 bucks worth of
sand and heat spreader so we can have the numbers for the people if it's really that important to you we can send it back yeah really honestly what were you thinking sending us the 245k and the 285k and not the middle of the road what were you thinking Bud yeah yeah this didn't go as planned the performance we saw in reviews was not what we expected dude the last minute changes that we getting from when maybe what they expected two years ago from this launch maybe I don't
know but if if that expectation was set anytime even sort of recently like what  about anyway okay um yeah I didn't even notice this our own notes have despite their own AOL Lake launch benchmarks highlighting the new flagship losing to the 14900 K 950x and 795x 3D and then we have links to their slides like yeah like it was my understanding that they knew this doesn't make much I didn't want to talk about like meetings that we had from them but like what is this statement here we go where's uh
yeah they're literally like yeah we're on par but like lower power and also we like lose at a lot of games which it's like okay but like personally I think that's fine it's just not exciting for me to buy it but like you know if you're like hey this is a massive generational change for us we didn't take as much of a step forward performance- wise as we had hoped but we saved a ton on Power and we're hoping that uh we're able to you know but like literally slide you have you lose in five games and you win in
four like stop it three no no this one counts 4% is that a oh they didn't make it blue all the other ones are blue I don't know I dude I don't know okay sure it's lot of really nice praise for our graphs lately um in especially that that last video so you know shout out um yeah shout out Sammy other more different Sammy than the last Sammy that I shouted out today um shout out the team for making graphs that are better than Intel can make yeah boom roasted yeah because Intel is kind of a big company I mean
not as big as they used to be but they're big well what what what what maybe they maybe maybe they shouldn't have cancelled and sell extreme Tech upgrade maybe that was where it all went down downhill honestly that was that was the beginning of the end I think the timeline of that lines up pretty well yep if they had just if they had just stuck with Intel extreme Tech upgrade this never would happened mhm yep MH MH mhm mhm Su Zen Kitty says salty Lin is I'm I'm not salty AMD picked it up right
where they left off and I don't know if we've ever told AMD this but they pay more well what it was an established series by that point Intel had the benefit of that they took a risk on it yeah and then when AMD picked it up it was like well we know this is an absolute Banger so uh time to Pony up yeah so what you it makes sense I feel like we've always been pretty open about that kind of stuff no man I I I don't know we're we're we're we're we're highly transparent company and um you
know some people will attack us for that they'll they'll look for points of they'll look for for gaps in the armor and they'll kind of try and try and wedge something in there and I think but I think most people I think the silent majority sees what we do and and sees what we're what we're willing to talk about and kind of goes okay yeah I think I I think I have the measure of who these guys are and what they're about and that that's the way it is I mean look I've made it very clear at every
stage that I'm not friends with any of these corporations that we cover I never will be and this is transactional they want exposure on our Channel exposure to our audience we clearly disclose what is paid and that's it there's your talking points it's separate from our from our opinions it's all on the it's on the up and up uh what else do we want to talk about today oh this is so cool this is so cool YouTuber ibof RCC has created a custom PCB add-on and swappable SSD modules for M series
MacBooks this is so cool check this out okay uh blah blah blah the design isn't finalized it requires a second Mac to run Apple configurator to complete the setup because I don't know Apple hates their customers who knows but the DIY m.2 Port was demonstrated to take modules up to 2 terabytes and hit similar speeds to Apple's own soldered storage because of course it does because it's all just hooked up to pcie anyway these days because that's what everybody's using for everything and
this distinction between oh special Apple SSD and other more different SSD is completely unnecessary other than so that they can sell you an SSD upgrade for $200 for like $19 worth of nand um anyway ibof found that strangely the MacBook requ requires the SSD to be installed in order for the battery to charge which they said was just another reason why the SSD should be replaceable currently Apple charges the same amount for two 16 gigs Ram 256 gig storage Mac minis as it does for a single Mac Mini
with twice the amount of RAM and storage so literally it's costing you twice as much to just upgrade the RAM and storage as an entire machine with half as much RAM and storage now this is cool um curiously there was a that the posts about that had a lot of traction seriously it seems that the new M4 Mac Mini does have a single removable storage module however Mac Rumors notes that it's likely that the controller for the storage is still embedded in the S so limiting DIY upgrade and repair
similar modules have been found in the Mac Studio and the Mac Pro anyway I just want to I just want to show this this is  cool I hate that this Innovation which is super cool is necessary I don't understand why Apple hates their customers so much and I don't understand why their customers continue to bend over and take it and be happy about it but the modding is really cool and I've enjoyed that on this show and in the last show we've been able to highlight some cool community modders
that are finding ways oh sorry sorry sorry his mod was on the MacBook that's the Mac Mini replaceable module from Apple sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry that that was the wrong pick I was showing hold on hold on I'll find it  guys I have something to go over when you after you find that I thought that didn't look right I hadn't seen the uh I hadn't seen the M4 Mac thing yet you muted me yeah you you played that audio oh yeah yeah yeah I I hadn't seen the I hadn't seen the M4 Mac Mini one yet but
I thought that man that it's not what the thing looked like is it yeah here it is dude so cool so you guys got go watch this uh here Dan do you want to throw the throw the link in everything but float plane chat I'll throw it in float plane chat bookmark this go watch it later dude how cool is that yeah love it sick I'll check that out yeah okay you brought up our graphs looking nice and you thought they were better than Intel's well I mean it's not that I think they're better than int that Intel
hates their graphs aggressively that we're better at Intel at everything that Intel does that we also do um kidding um Can my iPhone just like chill out and stop interfering with my mic yeah um okay I think I'm done with the iPhone I'm wondering yeah when are you switching off you said that theek ago oh okay video shot um okay witness witness you got some you got some silver spray paint yeah yeah yeah uh I interested in your thoughts in how much this adds or doesn't add to the 
okay did you see no watch keep watching keep watching keep watching wait for the next one he's I'm sure he's just talking right now yeah whoa you see what do you think if it's very little work what are your thoughts then  oh yeah if it's very little how much work do you think would be defined as very little work um um like having the basically having the graph be anim like this one the phone that we're actually talking about gets like kind of inserted in stuff like that so here's my thing um I think if you
have a video that has I would say less than half a dozen graphs then by all means spend the extra 15 minutes that it'll take to do this to each one or five minutes or whatever it is if you have a video that's like a CPU review and there's 20 30 graphs I for the reason why I'm asking is basically when when Labs is exporting yeah uh graphs and charts and stuff it would be exported in a different format mhm because it's like okay do we export the AI file so it's modifiable by the
editor or do we export just like a PNG MH um I think it looks pretty nice I think it looksy I hear what you're saying when there's when there's like like the the the the most recent CP vi video that we did y like the amount of graphs that were in this that could get that could get cumbersome I could see that and the thing is that there's probably there be a lot there's also a lot of lines I'd say a solid 75% of the time on LTT here I'm going to bring up your laptop here
I'd say a solid 75% of the time on LTT when we're uploading a really graph heavy video it's an embargo video yeah so we're pushing we are time constrained we're already we're already crunching yeah so if you tell me yeah we're going to add something unnecessary we're going to animate it we're going to make it pretty we're going to make it shiny I'm going to say give me a really really good reason and I'm sorry but pretty is not a good enough reason in this case I don't think that
um I don't think that I see a clear enough benefit now if your team can figure out how all of that just happens automatically and there's some kind of like slick web interface F or whatever where you just kind of say like highlight this one and then it just like runs a magic behind the scenes animation thing or something I I don't I don't know this this is the one of importance so it does some yeah I don't know we can explore that type of stuff that is not what that looked like to me that looked
like that wasn't I don't believe that was that that looked like after effects or something like that I don't know yeah yeah I'm I'm not sure exactly what they used for that gave the file um the only like honestly and the other thing too is like there's a little bit of if it a if it ain't broke don't don't fix it in in my response as well people are super happy with this there's things that I would do differently um I prefer a highlight compared to a DOT I prefer a box I vastly prefer a red
wireframe box I don't I don't want to actually highlight it I want it to be around it but I was told that the audience largely preferred the dot even though for me the dot is much more difficult to track because it moves in multiple on multiple axes um but you know this is this is one of those cases where I'm not just going to I'm not just going to impose my will because at the end of the day who's our boss audience to you just knocking down what I'm setting up you're not allowed to say
anything yeah you'll just you you'll just knock down everything you know what fine I'm going to give the hints anyway it's not me and it's not Taran there go ahead you can do it again it's Dan it's the audience I'm not liking the projections of where we're going I want more Luke huh more Luke in videos huh huh um I'm down put me in coach going to strike the L show okay yeah anyway um yeah no I yeah it's it's cool but I just don't I just don't see the um man what would I compare this to that
I mean that Mac address video only had like three graphs or that's the thing so yeah it's okay yeah it's like I could see on a more like Lifestyle Channel they're also really early in the video mhm so that's that's something that you guys will now that I'm going to say it you're going to notice it we make much heavier investments in yeah like you have to more expensive shots locations props um in in the first like few minutes of a video compared to what we're willing to do toward the end we
aren't operating on the kinds of budgets that someone like uh you know a Mr Beast might or whatever so that every every second of the video is designed with the expectation that you you will be watching it and you must continue to watch it we're just it's it's like yeah realistically not everyone is going to be into this server network card so we'll do everything we can to hook you and if it doesn't work it doesn't work we're we're kind of okay with that protect the server network card from incoming
hackers and win a million do the server network card is in a pit the pit is full of snakes there's a train coming what are you going to do the Train's on fire this is just tech support saw now I don't even watch Mr Beast videos all of that guessing is just from his thumbnails oh yeah absolutely oh boy um your files are stored on the server it's running right now you must pull out the hard drive while it's running I hired seven xcia members to try to break into your server room can use keep them out for 24 
minigun all right what are we supposed to be um I don't know supposed to be doing topics guess keep doing topics until we go to after dark Nidia says 100 hours of gaming ought to be enough for anyone wrong I mean I'm not necessarily fake news I'm not necessarily proud that they're wrong but they are wrong wrong Nvidia announced a few changes to GeForce now their game streaming service the majority of which were upgrades the priority membership tier has been rebranded as performance and now have a
max resolution of 1440p instead of 1080p while remaining at $10 a month and it also comes with an ultra wide option super cool wait 100 hours monthly oh they're like actually wrong people are actually going to be upset about that can you stop getting ahead of things no however both the performance tier and the $20 ultimate tier will now have a 100 hour monthly limit which Luke spoiled what which Nvidia says I'm learning about this right now it is doing to avoid Global price increases
because some random people are putting in 200 hours a week the limit works out to just above 3 hours a day which Nvidia says accommodates 94% of their user base nonetheless some users 6% of them uh did the math for them there uh were extremely unhappy and expressed doubt that 94% of GeForce now users were using it $100 a month or less I have some bad news for you guys Nvidia is probably not like you you actually have a problem you win in those gaming lobbies cuz you don't do anything
else yeah um which isn't a problem it's okay to have a problem that's not a problem it's just you can quit you can quit anytime you want yeah uh Nvidia will charge $3 for an additional 15 hours of performance and $6 for 15 hours of ultimate so basically you're paying a third you're paying a third of your monthly rate for how does that math work it's more expensive oh yeah it's more expensive why is it more expensive that's stupid you think it would be less expensive yeah no you think it would be more
expensive because the other one is subsidized by the people who use it so little no no that makes sense yeah it would be more expensive so that's probably closer to what it actually cost them which interestingly probably gives us some insight into the actual math for how much people are actually using the service compared to um like if you if you use it so if they can afford what what was it a 100 hours a month for 10 bucks and another 15 hours cost them $3 then basically what
that means is for every person who's using it 100 hours you've got people who are barely touching it uh the subscription using Z hours yeah in order to have that Math Workout U well but very very interesting Plus there some profit margin baked into both calculations probably mhm um yep live streaming is extremely expensive none of this surprises me at all and especially when you make it like difficult live streaming it also doesn't surprise me at all that um you know now
that you're locked into a subscription service that Subscription Service would look to alter the deal um this is why we should probably you know refrain scrapyard Wars uh like you know a mediocre PC rather than buy into a subscription service that can be yed on us at any time I thought you were going to said put up the cost of a Flo plane subscription yeah yeah spend your money on float plane instead got them oh how much does when cost asks Luca 103 a bunch I don't think we know exactly do we oh no you do
there's ways to figure it out I don't know off the top of my head it also changes like per episode cuz we'll we'll stream for 2 hours then we'll stream for 4 and a half so like I'm going to start sending it at 40 Meg can you got sure it actually like why don't we just do it won't make a difference to be honest no twitch will freak out oh oh yeah well yeah but that's their problem multi streaming it's not a I mean because what we receive from here oh yeah that actually oh yeah we
transcoded anyway yeah who cares garbage out though less garbage in less garbage out let's do it at 8K 8K W show that actually reminds me man these c200s have been absolute just tank work horses yeah here forever yeah we we used to use these for like trade shows and stuff and uh we ended up not getting a lot of use out of them there but boy have they ever been great for the WAN show look at that  like I've got a c100 at home uh yeah they're undestructible great little
cameras yeah yes I think these c200s are like eight grand a body though but you know maybe more there's no way they're worth that anymore not anymore absolutely not okay yeah I I think we did pay quite a lot for them um speaking of qu paying quite a lot for it uh the Dow drops Intel Intel has been removed from its 25-year position in the Dow Jones Industrial Average I think we hinted to this last week but it has happened I guess uh The go-to Benchmark to measure the health of the US Stock
Market being the Dow Jones Industrial Average uh this likely indicates that the maintainers of the Dow Jones believe that Intel's recent struggles are skewing the average in a way not generally reflective of the market as a whole and they were like damn we can get Nvidia in here and then they did that its position has been replaced with Nvidia which the S&amp;P Dow Jones indicates apparently views as a more accurate reflection of the chipm sector to that I don't necessarily agree with
an anomaly as Intel has been over the last little bit yeah they're just on the other end of it yeah which I understand why you want that but what you're saying just isn't true anyways um yeah discussion question uh is isia really the company that's most reflective of the sector no nice it is a good discussion question we just got to it too early um oops a network along your skin researchers at Carnegie melon University have developed a method of transmitting 40 MHz RF energy along human skin allowing the
user to remotely power extremely small wearable devices that otherwise could not fit a battery such as a patch that logs Medical Data W this power could be delivered from head to toe from a power source worn Elsewhere on the body startup exan has created a prototype yr chip that uses a similar method to send bluetooth SL WiFi signals through the body 's skin thereby connecting multiple devices without broadcasting a wider potentially insecure signal this would likewise allow users to share a connection
oh oh through skin to- skinin contact ex like a handshake or a high five you could literally like handshake someone and like exchange contact information wa like if you had yeah some like wearable handshakes Isn't that cool whoa you touch people says sinful hands I mean yeah well Geeks are it's kind of funny that yeah someone whose name in chat is sinful hands says ew touch people mhm just kind of works it does it works  sorry rude so the discussion question here is what kinds of wearable devices
can you imagine with this technology I mean medical ones I think are obvious we can kind of what about embedded ones too embedded in the skin well I don't know the signal goes along the skin so you'd almost have to have I mean that would be kind of cyber Punk looking right cuz you'd have all the contacts and traces on the surface and then it's just like you know buried in your muscle somewhere or whatever else like a uh man I don't know like could you could you cuz like if you had a a heart rate
monitor yeah that didn't increase the bulk along your body that could be kind of nice yeah that'd be pretty cool neuro amp what are you guys what are you guys talking about yeah if if you had a heart rate monitor that was powered through you I guess and it could maybe like uh remotely transmit to your phone or something so you could still check what it's reading be interesting I mean yeah you so powered tattoos that'd be cool e ink tattoos that would be so cool okay now people
are getting me some some good ideas here imagine a tattoo that changes based on your heart rate yeah and oh my God yeah you're could to have like a a little display in your inner inner wrist what about earrings with lights on them dude you could have comp yeah that' be sick you you could have complicated like tattoos that reveal different details based on other powered jewelry or like oh dude you could have so you could have like a necklace that like changes color with your mood except actually you know
not like those like cheap mood rings or whatever actually based on something but that is like actually based on like your anxiety level and stuff like that like and and sure yeah the privacy issues you know people would do it you know you know people would do it internal cardiac monitors dude this is so cool internal I mean my thought is like I'm just surreptitiously touching the back of your neck and stealing all your data and stuff stuff like that or I like I shake your hand and why you got to go there
with it who you don't even have the courage to show your face telling us all your ideas about stealing other people's data and you can't even okay yeah there he is apparently this is a thing already internal cardiac monitors yeah I think so implantable Loop recorders put them in your heart right because they just run on like super super long life batteries I guess um but but this the cool thing about it is that you're doing networking and power just over the skin so you can just have like a little pack
on your wrist like where a watch would be and it could just power and communicate as almost like a like a smart home hub like a smart body Hub what if it's in your back pocket and then you just sit down on a wireless charging chair whoa yeah butt charging whoa whoa I mean that would probably be actually a really good idea so is that like a penalty like if they if the center gets attacked the quarterback just like runs  what are we talking about uh anyways um steam moving on yeah steam recording super cool
feature um steam is officially launched built-in game recording which allows Gamers to record their sessions without using a second app players can start a recording manually or set it to start automatically and there are likewise options to restrict the length quality and storage space that steam can use these settings can be configured differently for each game however the accessibility of these recording options and the broader audience of steam users might cause problems for users who are
less familiar with things like SSD degradation as pointed out by /c crore spectacl steam game recording has a max right rate of 50 megabits per second around 22 12 gbt per hour if it was used regularly at the highest settings this could cause significant SSD degradation over over time notably the highest rate quality on nvidia's own recording feature maxes out at 150 megabits per second which is significantly higher but is also something that you generally um is generally a little more techsavvy to
access rather than just what you know your your kids using the family computer are going to be able to figure out how to configure our discussion question is is this a realistic concern for most people and um I'm of kind of two minds on this on the one hand yes this will compare to how the average user is expected to use their PC and what SSD makers have been targeting over the last 10 years with the move from SLC to mlc to TLC to qlc to even PLC flash um with far far less endurance as we as we move
to each new generation but higher capacity meaning that you're less likely to override it but then now that we're going to override it we've we've we've been building toward we've been building products for this Paradigm where people are like kind of occasionally copying some footage or downloading a new game but generally speaking are barely even touching their Drive which is pretty accurate for the most part yeah and then we're adding we're throwing this into the mix I think I do think that people
who didn't think they needed a premium drive with better endurance are going to suddenly find out oh I do I do need a premium drive with better endurance however the other side of me wants to point out that it's been studied a couple of times small sample sizes on unfortunately so I don't know how reliable and how trustworthy it is but it's been looked at a couple of times by I forget which Publications have done it where they've done endurance tests on ssds and found that in general they
actually last way longer than what they're rated for pretty good yeah so I also when I use uh Shadow play I just write to my hard drive sorry I just got to move my leg guy but yeah yeah you should probably just use a hard drive for this in a NZ ideally but most people most people don't have a Nas I mean there really hasn't been like a a diyas software that is easy enough to  uh that just anyone who could build their own PC could just install it and be good to go and configure everything
and all the shares just work that's that's the one hopefully theoretically I just invested in Pro MOX oh yeah sure that's easy and approachable for every man yeah yeah  that voice is dance like I am screaming inside I am also dying oh it's  go Dan switching it over pushing the buttons all right we got a lot of merch messages today oh not not too too many not too many I think we're doing pretty okay um let's see heyo dll notice the Apple watch accompanying the switch to iPhone lus what do you think of it so
far um considering how amped I was on SmartWatches at the start like I loved my Pebble um I have just kind of completely fallen out of love with them and maybe it's because the product category sort of moved away from me maybe it's because I moved away from the product category like it it feels like at the beginning they were about getting notifications without taking your phone out of your pocket and in some cases as they as they got a little bit more sophisticated interacting with those
notifications to to make them go away and and you can still do that like being able to get a text while I'm while I'm on the court at the gym or something like that and uh you know fire back a quick message uh it's fine it's good but all the trying to do too much all the functionality that they've added since then around you know telling me to stand up like sure yeah I can't right now I'm in the middle of I'm in the middle of podcast recording like you know like it doesn't it doesn't have the
awareness to just make the the cameras the table everything we should just make everything stand and every 45 minutes yeah yeah let me get let me get right on that oh yeah um so all this all this extra stuff that they've added the health tracking it doesn't it's not meaningful to me I mean when I'm a senior citizen and I'm worried about you know fall detection or whatever else yeah maybe may maybe I'll be more more interested in something like that but the health tracking that especially
Apple has been doing is really cool yeah it's really cool I think it's not necessarily relevant I think plof made a really good point in his uh script where we were talking about their most recent event uh where he was like yeah it's funny how the older Tim Apple gets the uh the more seniors health tracking makes its way into their product be fair it's also aging generation Wern countries absolutely the most affluent generation in the United States is the Baby Boomers and they are they're
getting older they they be old they're getting older yeah so I it's nice to be able to tell the time quickly and conveniently on my wrist you can do that with a lot of things I don't like having to charge it every day that's a downer um you notice I'm not wearing it today I just forgot to put it on and I didn't notice until someone asked me what time it was that was really the only I don't know maybe part of it is that since I first got a smartwatch I just am like on my phone a lot more and
that that's that that's probably a bad thing maybe I should get in the habit of using my watch to interact with notifications if it got you off your phone more often which reduced the total phone and watch usage time then I think that there's value there but if you're just replacing phone time with watch time one to one I don't see value there personally I don't use any of the other apps like to me the whole um like I am exercising right now this is the type of exercise I'm doing until you can just
tell that I'm exercising with all of your Advanced sophisticated measures uh uh sensors and everything what what are what are we even doing here like I it's it's to me it's like counting calories like I'm I'm logging the thing that I'm eating and and that's really useful for a lot of people depending on what your goals are 100% 100% depending on your goals that has a ton of value for me it has I am not even close dude I can go take something out of my freezer and think okay I need to go into my food
checklist app and I need to update the inventory in the freezer and by the time I have put it down on the counter I have completely forgotten that I needed to do that expecting me to count calories or remember to like log that I'm about to start ex it's not going to happen the only way I was able to count calories was when I had pre-planned what I was going to eat for the entire day and I never deviated cuz then it was like okay well I could put in my calories for the next week you know like it's it's
figured out already um someone says they really like it for sleep tracking um dude if I have to the only way that can remember to charge something is if it's overnight so yeah there's people at work here that have an Apple Watch charger on their desk so they'll take it off and they'll put it on the charger so that they can use it for sleep tracking I would leave my watch at work every other day 100% there's absolutely no way that it would make it home five out of five days in a
week I'd probably leave it at your house half the time I visit you oh yeah dude you would leave your keys at my house if you were able to leave without them like yeah 100% that would be a hilarious troll sometime to just leave your key in your car and then just like see if you leave without your keys cuz I I bet you  probably all right what else we got okay let's see archive hey dll my friends and I have a long running tradition during a land party on Black Friday every year
what are some of your favorite memories Gam names and food to have at a land party vanelly says new watch charges so fast I literally only put it on the charger when I shower and otherwise wear it 24/7 bold of you to assume I shower  day only only exercise days which is at least every it's about two out of every three days so I'm not a complete I'm not a complete like Barbarian or whatever but um yeah no my my life is not routine enough for anything that doesn't fit in the very limited routines that I can
manage um starcat one says shower every day man you you know you don't have to right just I'm just saying I'm just saying you and and it's totally fine to shower every day but you also like don't  fine I'm not judging yeah for me honestly it depends how stressed I get oh stressed sweat stinks oh mine is I'm sure everyone is but I only really have experience with mine mine is brutal dude  chilling yeah it's not a big deal slather on another layer of deodorant yeah like honestly doesn't really matter
if if I have some like really serious conversations boy I need to shower like it's it's not it's not an option past a certain point yeah oh man um LAN land memories games and food dude uh I think it was like COD 2 which I had never played um I got a bunch of copies of it from work cuz there was like a Cod 2 like GPU bundle and we didn't move through them all I was like can I have some of these discs and they were like okay so I showed up at this land and I had like eight copies of COD 2 and we
completely lost track of whatever the objective was supposed to be and we started playing this like King of the Hill except it was like at the very top of this water tower and there was like over half dozen of us it was functionally impossible to get to the top of it I think it it happened that way because someone got up there unnoticed at some point in the match and just started like spawn sniping everybody um and we were like what the heck that's a good spot I want it and it
just devolved into the the longest like completely no there's no scorekeeping because it wasn't part of the game mode of the game but the longest most ridiculously impossible King of the Hill match that I've ever participated in custom goals custom rules all that kind of stuff those are always like the best way to play games it's it's more fun my my favorite land memory and I'm I'm not even going to remember it correctly because it was from so long ago but uh my birthdays when I was in high school
were always land parties at my parents house and one year we went really hard on Halo 2 custom rules versus and we if I remember correctly we we had like it was a birthday party so we we tried to go a little bit overboard and we we had people bring like couches and TVs and stuff from their houses and we put if I I think I'm getting this right I could be wrong I think this is how it worked I think we had two TVs and two couches in the garage and two TVs and two couches
inside and there was one team inside and one team outside and we had the a tournament of of Halo 2 on one particular map that I'm not going to remember the name of um and it was it was either like swords and shotguns or I feel like it was swords and Rockets but I feel like we played more swords and shotguns but I don't know I don't remember why I'm thinking rocket but it came it was 4949 there was two players alive and it came down to the the there was one with a sword and one with whatever the other
weapon was I think it was a rocket and they both attacked at the same time and nobody knew who won the game until the score screen came up no way and the house just exploded it was crazy it was so cool it was so like oh man like H it was great I it was really it was very fun and like even every part of that land those types of lands are fun cuz like people are showing up with couches in the backs of their like their parents' van and their parents are like I don't even understand what's happening
but I mean at least you're not like doing drugs or something so fine and then we're like finding ways to to network these these two Xboxes together and we're not only planning on playing Xbox we also have another Network going on for all these computers and we're all learning how this stuff works buying switches from ncx doing whatever getting stuff going like the whole thing is just super fun I don't know those were those were good times I feel like kids are kind of missing out on that my my son
was playing rocket league with one of his friends and I was like hey you never invite me to play games and he was like okay yeah my dad's joining us and they're like okay sure whatever we'll carry uh you know how bad I am at Rocket League I did one useful thing though what' you do I don't know I don't remember I like hit it somewhere that was useful and then we scored oh okay don't worry about it anyway the point is um his friend pulled off what's it called a reset or something like that a
reset sure yeah so he touch your wheels to the puck while it's in the air and then you get another jump I'm assuming that's what happened so uh it was with the ball it's not right I play snow day anyway the point is you have to touch all four wheels to the ball while you're in the air and then you get another flip while you're in the air which is beneficial in some way or something yeah and he was really excited about pulling it off or whatever  um he was sitting in his house by
himself yeah and we were on a Discord call and so you know that was cool but like it's cool it's not the same it's different um yeah I feel like things get diluted right and like you think it's the same and a lot of people don't do land parties anymore cuz they're like oh we could just play over the internet and stuff but it's not it's not man and no one can cheat in person which man it's such a problem online now well you you can but it's like it's a lot harder not with friends
like you can but you won't but like I mean that's yeah and there's even some fun in that because then I don't know I find the setup of this type of stuff interesting I know not everyone would but like the whole idea of being in the garage and stuff was there is no screen peeking do screen Peak you'd have to run through the house like it's not happening but you can still hear each other if you look the door is propped open so you can see each other but the screens are this way to each other right
so you you can't you can't see the screens but you can yell at each other and do whatever yeah it's it's good times yeah all right hey DL how's your day going it's been a long week it's been it's been a week when and what are your plans for bonus spin items I have so many stickers yes I could just get more sticks uh hope you feel better soon um I don't know I think we wanted to do some like little vinyl figures at one point I know we're going to do more pins vinyl figures um honestly Sarah would
know this so much better than me maybe next time ask when she does like a design stream or something like that CU she's she's in the no when it comes to  that are you asking her now should I move on no no I'm I'm I Sarah's off work no hey hello D from Australia any thoughts on the 9800 x3d not being in stock anywhere was the release rushed in your opinion not nearly as rushed as core Ultra 200 series but um I feel like every product release gets kind of crunched and rushed to a certain extent
it's at a certain point you you have to you're working with Retail Partners you're working with all these other people there has to be a certain point in time when you launch the thing yeah there's deadlines and no I mean it's easier to not have those types of deadlines when with things like independent game launches cuz you set the date but in this situation like there's a lot of moving pieces you're screwing a lot of different people over if you move your date back so yep or
forward or wherever like changing anything really disrupts the plans and Distributors retailers and in such a globalized world right there's there's always a time zone where it's highly problematic for someone to be having to  now hey D now that you have some new cats when can we expect the next Linus cat tips video I uploaded a short for some reason I was feeling just inspired to and one of them like grabbed my feet from under the bed and I was like that'd be funny and then they didn't really do
it the same way when I turned on the camera and then I was like ah this wasn't really worth it so I didn't bother doing [Laughter] anymore that's where I'm out on that fair enough yeah hey D have you heard about the iPhone users having all their notes deleted after accepting icloud's new terms of service I had 6 months of important notes not backed up due to my 5 gigs of iCloud being full wow I have not heard uh but hey it just works uh dude I feel like I'm going to make some enemies with my iOS 18 iPhone
16 I know you will video I um I am I am certain I cuz man I uh like there's one point where I'm just like I think the next time someone tells me it's magic it just works whatever I I don't know if I'll be able to help it I might just laugh in their face like I it it's just it's such a it's such a like galactically stupid thing to say at this point and I'm not saying that Android is perfect and just works and I'm not saying Windows is perfect and just works I'm saying they're all trash they're all
human they're all full of bugs and problems like let's just let's just not pretend that's that's it let's not pretend that because someone says it so that it must be thus Lee like that's not how things work if something like uh and I think the thing that I was going off on was uh the way to sign in to your Google account on an iPhone um which I know how to do and and we've talked about and I figured out but it is just to say that that's intuitive good design is just so utterly
incorrect um but I just I don't really we're clearly not living on the same Planet speaking the same language so I I don't even know how to talk to you like if you think that going into the Apple Mail app in order to sign into your Google account systemwide is intuitive or good design it's it's just not it just isn't um and it's funny because I was reflecting on it some more and you know how the settings app is where it used to be before that if I recall correctly it actually used to be in the initial setup
with am I am I remembering incorrectly cuz I I seem to recall that it used to be I think that was the case on Android oh was definitely the case onid it's still the case on Android but I recall seeing that uh like like Google Microsoft that that interface right when you are setting up the phone initially um yeah no it was yeah it's it's it's amazing yeah people are saying yes yeah maldar the first says wait do they not just have an account section in settings no they do
not it is not there and the people that are like well you're just used to Android no apple used to have it you could be used to literally any other phone and that's where it should be yes yes they do not have it and yes that is on purpose you guys so so whenever people say to me yeah Apple's just like it's more intuitive they're just wrong Apple's design can be wrong and there's a lot of things they did really well intuitive is subjective though isn't it because it could be
intuitive to a different person who has different expectations and different approaches but you can measure these things so one of the ways that I measured this one was I checked the number of ratings on the app store for the first party Gmail app and the first party Google Calendar app because if you'll recall what I wanted to do was I wanted to use my Gmail app and I wanted to use Apple's calendar app because I wanted to try it I I don't I don't actually have any attachment to Apple's
calendar app uh but I wanted to try it out but what I'm not interested in using is Apple's mail app I I don't like it I've never liked it um I prefer to just use the Gmail app and what I found was that the the Google Gmail app had 2.2 million ratings on the App Store the Google Calendar app had like "100,000 so what I can tell you" objectively is that my setup where I wanted to roll the Gmail app and Apple's own calendar app is clearly a thing that people are doing 20 times the download rate of the
Gmail app versus the Google Calendar app so the number of people replacing their email client on the iPhone compared to the number of people replacing their calendar client with Google's first party Alternatives or third party Alternatives rather yeah but email is something that's like like more important it's it's it's less replaceable than calendar because other people have your contact no no all I'm saying is is it wasn't intuitive for me necessarily and neither would it necessarily be for a
lot of people to open up Apple's mail app and use that because clearly lots of people don't use it they use the Google one and clearly not all of those people also replace the Google Calendar app they want to do exactly what I wanted to do use the Gmail app and the Apple calendar app right 20 times as many ratings so and you and you can't you can't do what you're you sign oh you can but if you sign into the Gmail app it doesn't sign you in systemwide in order to sign your Google
account in on an iPhone you have to launch Apple's mail app and sign into your Gmail there okay there's nowhere else to do it what is the system what other things are handyman saying this isn't true um what what other things are you trying to have logged in I guess well I want my I want my contacts to sync I want my Calendar to sync I want I want my Google account sign things like your your phone yeah you can do it in the settings no you can't here it is in my pocket there's a
bunch of different people saying it right now I think this is going to be the biggest problem with the video you're almost going to have to have like an unlisted companion video that goes over like just like actually it really is this stupid here's the here's the defense lus cam settings here we go okay all right so here is y here we go just making sure there's nothing particularly okay here we go here is settings accounts no no third party accounts just iCloud just sign in with
apple nothing else here's the rest of the settings app settings Apple account iCloud that's the same thing isn't it there is but it's not you can't sign into to Gmail there settings Apple account iCloud mail but I don't use iCloud settings apps calendar accounts settings hold on hold on hold on hold on settings apps apps where's app Okay calendar um right below calculator  button should we like go through so hold on a second hold on a second is your  intuitive to add an account to that app
if you're an iOS user and it's worked that way for 10 years like yeah but it didn't use to how did it use to I don't I never I've never want mainlined an iPhone there used to be in settings An accounts parent menu I handyman I don't think he's saying that uh you didn't show him two weeks ago he's saying that that doesn't seem intuitive I'm saying  intuitive so we will have to do can you not get there in the app or something or like what's the no you can't that you definitely cannot so that feels
unintuitive to me not be able to do it in the app you can get there in the mail app not in the calendar app but if I'm an iOS user am I used to going to that settings page to do things like that so here's what happens here's what happens when you open mail and you aren't signed in you are prompted to sign in so that thing that we got on the other page yes here's what happens if you open up the first party calendar app and you are not signed in yeah CU I'm assuming it just uses
like a local account which again this is what I was kind of trying to point out earlier is like ad calender no nothing there add no that's an event but but people are a little bit more uh is temporal the right word like like are kind of whatever compared to an email account sure but so hold on but the part you're missing is I'm signing into my email but I'm using the Gmail app I don't want to use Apple's mail app yeah but like I'm not interested in it I don't necess if I sign into my Microsoft
account on my phone I don't necessarily want to import my Microsoft calendar into my calendar app no but you can be prompted what you do or don't want to sync when you add an account agree but does it work that way like what's is there a default calendar app on oh it would be the Google Calendar on Android Android yeah yeah I don't know that it asks you if you want your Microsoft calendar stuff in here add another account can I add a  info Luke Su and stuff he's cing it's a
Google it immediately assumes a Google account um manage accounts on this device so that should that should bring you to where sets page but it it's not actually it's not calendar specific it's just like everything no but you would go in your calendar app and you would tell it which calendars you want to sync I'm in my calendar app though and add another account is just Google accounts and then I have manage accounts which just brings me to All General accounts Sor what's the question though
it's there's no there's no prompt to add the Microsoft account you're saying you're saying it would be more intuitive if there's a prompt I'm saying I don't think there's a prompt on Android if there's a prompt to add what though the the Microsoft Account oh the Microsoft account no or I would say a Apple calendar thing but I don't have one of those so I can't no no I expected account management the place I expected to find account management was under my name here at the top sure oh whoops dang it
I'm going to figure this out cam there we go the place I would expect to find it is under my name here at the top where my Apple account and my iCloud is I would I would expect to maybe find all of my accounts there uh I might expect it to find I might expect to find it under accounts like under you know General accessibility uh you know Siri you know all my accounts here um those are places where I would expect to find systemwide uh accounts that I log into that work AC across multiple
apps what I wouldn't expect is for the mail the the default mail and the default calendar app to operate completely different ways in terms of adding a new account so when I when I click on mail it immediately prompts me hey do you want to sign in to one of these types of accounts and we've got important thing important account types like AOL for example in there uh when I go into the calendar one itps for so the only real point that I have with the calendar vers one is that
they behave completely differents after I've already like gone into my my settings menu and what would be the most intuitive setting they different ways is the unintuitive portion after I've already gone into the settings and gone okay where the devil do I sign into my bloody Google account mhm yeah I'm just saying it it's not prompting you for  either um Ry saww says it was much better in iOS 17 they created the new apps menu at the bottom of settings in iOS 18 if I recall correctly the whole
um finding finding settings under apps has been a thing for a really long time uh like I man I forget there was something years ago that I was trying to figure out how the heck to do and it turns out that it was like oh you was it was it something was I trying to change something on the camera or something I forget what it was but I had to dig into apps in order to change something that that seemed like it would be sort of fundamental to the system I know sorry I so the so the goofy like hiding
settings in under apps thing um even though they are systemwide and not necessarily specific to that particular app that's not new uh but I don't know to your point I haven't used iOS 17 so I don't know what they moved between I think you just think that they should be which is fine if they affect more than one app yeah but that doesn't mean they're systemwide it means they affect that means they aren't that app that setting is are you saying one setting is changing things systemwide no I'm saying
when you log into a Google account yeah but I don't think you're logging into a systemwide account on iPhone well okay well sorry we're using the term systemwide very differently what I'm saying is that you are logged into an account that is inherently logged in the second you open up another supported app that uses that same login if I log into my mail account immediately my calendars will sync my contact authenticated and all that okay okay okay okay so so that's that's what doesn't make sense to
me why I have to open Apple's mail account to do that or to your guys's point I have to go dig into Apps find something that happens to be Google will will Chrome work no chrome doesn't work I can't log into my Google account in Chrome brilliant um I'll have to find a different one docs docs doesn't work docs doesn't have the login drive maybe drive uh the login for what though for my Google account I I am not logged into it but like so but if I go to mail if I go to hold
on da da mail now I can log in my Google account and it will work with those other things can you can you view Outlook through the Gmail app I don't use Outlook so I don't know yeah like I I don't know if maybe you can I don't know if you can add third-party apps to the the Gmail account so I think the fact that theirs is clunky what apparently you can really you can add Outlook to the Gmail account oh oh wait oh okay yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah okay I don't have it set up that
way yeah yeah no the Gmail the Gmail app is just a mail client multifunction mail yep yeah 100% like what I'm looking at right now is if and I don't want to show you guys sorry if I go add an account yes this will eventually load and it's it's only Google accounts yeah so okay fine if I go manage accounts on this device y it brings me to password pass keys and autofill and it doesn't bring up things that could sync not if I use that phone then I would say that that's trash and that's not intuitive yeah okay
so my point is not that Android is better yeah my point is that that is terrible and is not intuitive if I wanted to log in an account if I had never touched an Android phone or an iPhone before and I wanted to and I wanted to get get my like Google Calendar and that was like the first thing that I wanted to do where do I go from here how would I how would I do it from here there is literally no way to be prompted to sign into some other type of account literally no way I'm not going to lie
I'm immediately lost because I I feel so lost the second I touch an iPhone that's not an iPhone problem that's a that's a me problem but um yeah I would personally like there to be a setting in the app somewhere I generally like it when I can fully operate things from within the app I don't like it when I have to go to external settings on on anything whether that's a a desktop device um any form of phone whatever it doesn't matter so the you just fundamentally don't understand how this
is working it's not a systemwide account what you're saying is false I believe uh if I want my Calendar to sync I have to  app really yes now I was shown that other way I can also into right so I can also go into settings  calendar and I can add a calendar account  here so it's not going through the mail app but but it's still it's still a lot of clicks clunky that's what you're saying and it was a very different interface compared to when I went to the mail app and I was immediately prompted
to sign into my Gmail so if you open mail first the way that you're being trained to interact with the phone is not the same as when you open the Calendar app correct yeah settings apps calendar accounts make sense to me though it does make sense to me too but his point is that when you open the mail app another first-party app that is highly related to calendar I would say um it doesn't work the same way yeah so he just just in case you didn't see that he clicked on the mail app he's not currently
signed into anything so it immediately prompts him to log into stuff when he clicks on the calendar app there is no prompt now I have an iCloud account because you have to sign into an iCloud account in order to like sign into the phone in order to set up the phone as far as I know can you set it up without an Apple account maybe you can I've never tried um so that's the calendars that it's pulling it's pulling like ancient Apple calendars open open calendar I saw this button earlier but I
didn't really think about it open calendar click on find it go away click on calendars at the bottom calendar at the bottom here we go and then I think I saw it was like uh add calendar yeah yep uh nope add holiday calendar add subscription calendar and family calendar what's just add calendar what's  again so is it fixed on iCloud can you    a calendar can be local to your Vice only yeah I pointed that out earlier um mail is not just local yeah yeah yeah um I don't know I I get why I understand
what lonus is saying I also get why it might not work that way um I would like that add a calendar thing that we just did it it literally shows an account line that's like it's it says account and then there's a grade out text on the side that says iCloud and I was like if that just was able to be whatever you wanted then or it opened a prompt to log into another account yeah sure whatever yeah that's what I would try to do if I wanted to log into my calendar app I would go to my calendar app and this is
exactly what I tried to do I went into my calendar app stop it I went into my calendar app I went to calendars I went to add calendar pretty intuitive I went to add calendar pretty intuitive and I was like and now there's yeah which it feels broken almost there's there's a line that says account and then on the right it's grade out and says I calendar and he can't interact with it at all what's up with that that seems weird is something wrong no set up Google in settings mail then turn on everything
then in calendar tap on the word calendar at the bottom and add it there which is exactly what I've been trying to say so that makes it a global account if you do it that way well not Global account but it it makes it so that your like access your Google crap will syn yeah see that's wacky I'm sorry but that is you're right I missed something it actually doesn't change my point at all that these two systems behave very such a blood bath of a video very differently  other you should do like oh man it might
be brutal it might suck yeah I think it' be kind of fun if you did a stream like whatever the duration of the video is after the video launches you start a live stream and then just basically do this  actually real time the um actually comments you're pissed about Apple fight me live bro like I don't know it' be kind of interesting thank you m everyone saying he's wrong is nitpicking the minutia and missing the entire actual point missing the forest for the trees as it were you guys what like what do
you want me to say you guys are right that I didn't think to go digging into a submenu of a submenu of a sub menu instead of just opening the app and signing in the way that I did in the other one I would hope that's what that's the problem skill issue to sign into mail I just open the mail app and I sign into mail which will also allow me to sync my contacts and my calendars and and my my Google stuff that I need for work if I want to sign into calendar I open calendar and it's a complete dead
end uh handyman saying because on iPhone all settings are expected to be under settings apps that's just Apple's approach may not like it but it's their way of doing it yeah there's lots of settings that are not under what happens when they're not matter Tim said does it matter that Apple's guide on this explains it well and I found it quick I think good documentation matters and then he linked it I don't think you should need a guide for logging into your I think needing a guide inherently
means it's not intuitive if we're using the word intuitive for what it's supposed to mean um yeah so be overly defensive line is here but um the intuitive using or based on what one feels to be true even without conscious reasoning so needing to look up a guide  man anything to do with iOS man is uh it's I don't know it's spicy it's just a it's a really funny thing because I um I say look I uh I think hot dogs are unintuitive and people go hamburgers are so much less unintuitive lonus
luses HG the ingredients slide around I think they're both unintuitive I think I think there's problems with both and I think to I think to I think to make this argument that this is that this is good design is just um like I don't really I don't really know what to tell you if I can and and you say look it's the apple way that the settings for it are in the are in the apps part of the settings menu okay so is the account that you're logged into a setting yes or no I think I would generally think so
sure so then for the mail app it should be in the settings of the mail app it should not prompt me when I open it then it might even be useful in my opinion to make it so that uh and I think some apps do work that way maybe not in the Apple ecosystem but if it was like we you're not signed in press this button to go to the settings and it like opens the settings app and like makes a little bit of a display of like sure but it doesn't do that yeah and that's the problem Avon
fox says it's not that it's that you say it's trash cuz it's not for how your brain works is insulting for PE to people for whom it is um when something when when UI or ux is inconsistent that's bad that's measurably that's measurably bad that's not that's not the goal and because we're used to something does not mean that it's good and when I say something's bad it's not personal the fact that you're used to it or you like it it's not personal it's literally my job to point out things that are
unintuitive or that aren't good about technology something that I will never understand though yeah is and and this is again coming from Android brain because it's the only thing I've used um my mom always struggled with Android she would find ways to email me text messages is uh wow like that's kind of impressive there is weird like no but she could not send me a normal text message I would just receive emails that were text messages and like I don't I've never actually even done that yeah like
it's it's weird it's not a normal email it's not you know she sent an email with text in it no it's a text message in an email right like as an attachment yeah or something it was very odd it was years ago but it was very weird and she had lots of other crazy weird s with her Android phone and then uh she was working in the movie industry for a while and they had like standardized on some iOS stuff I don't remember what it was um so she needed an iPhone she got an iPhone instantly
perfect in power user no issues I remember you telling me about this because to her the whole like like like uh throwing away an app was just like super intuitive instant Y no thoughts immediately worked like the most intuitive thing you could ever imagine and then I try to go do something on her phone I'm like I don't know what's happening I set up my aunt with an iPhone years ago because basically I didn't want to coach her on how to use her phone yeah and it's been very
painless it works so like I they got something going on um um so people are people are pointing out things that are just um like I I I don't really oh man I don't really I don't really know what to say to you so Zen THX says mail prompts you because it has nothing to load if you aren't signed in but okay please my problem was never that mail prompted me to sign in he liked that part if anything that's good yeah my problem was that when I did the same behavior the same user behavior and I opened my
calendar it did not prompt me to log in and had absolutely no way for me to log in and no breadcrumb Trail for me to follow to log in nothing if we agree that the account you're logged into is a setting and if we agree that Apple put settings under settings apps and the name of the app then we agree that the mail account that we log in should be there only there with no way to link to it it from the app itself but that is not the case therefore the mail app follows a different set of rules from the Calendar
app guys are we there yet did we get there nidex or N idx I don't know said I think it's hubris to not ever look for help in the modern era and has good docks and he's talking about the fact that there's a good dock on how to do this one of the problems that you guys are some of you guys are really struggling with is the word intuitive if he has to look up a help DOC for something it is not intuitive to him flat out there's no there's no other interpretation of that if he has to look
up a help do for something it is not intuitive for also I did figure it out I figured out to log into the mail app that's not the problem Oh Boy Cape says when will you have a video criticizing Android he had many tons it's it's amazing for for years for many years it's amazing the selective The Selective perception that people have but you're insulting my My Tribe less this entire video was dunking on the deplorable state of AOSP yeah that might not have been the best video
example to bring up it was 2 months ago I I I understand that not everyone agrees with the premise of the video yeah but the premise of the video was what the premise of the video was you guys aren't wrong that is stock Android it is stock Android whether you like it or not I just don't know how applicable it is because it doesn't apply to anybody but that was our Point yeah our point was that sock Android's kind of dead and we discussed some of the reasons that it's kind of dead for users yeah yes 
uh I'm trying to remember cuz I'm pretty  I'm pretty sure we've done rant Style videos on both IOS and Android or have we only done you know what no we haven't we did um I really wonder if you should somehow I don't know how you would do this is the video already shot uh partially I wonder if you should somehow get like a subset of you know those videos that are trending right now iPhones are just better they put yeah six years ago there you go uh they have like somebody in a
chair with a table and another chair across from it in the middle of a room and then a circle of people around it and Android is just better all those people in the circle versus the one person yeah yeah yeah that's already on the calendar oh okay I don't so I I feel like you should like basically get a subset of like Apple Fans I can think of one T3 Theo oh we could definitely find some and then give them your talking points for the video and then fight their talking points like in the video
because I i' i' I don't know honestly that probably won't even help anything no it won't help it won't help anything Luke I mean the fact that people don't think I criticize Android is all that you really need to know about the sort of selection bias of um the perception of my takes on these things I have been hyper critical of Windows Android iOS Mac OS basically like I said my entire job is looking at things and going this is what could be  them I also highlight things I really
like I just I'm just trying to take because I I know this obviously this video is going to be a blood bath so I'm I'm just trying to figure out like how do we how do we how do we pull all the iron out of it and make a sword um how do we like how do we do something cool with that basically so like there's the the stream that starts the the total duration of the video after the the video goes live um there's this like I don't know picking like five Apple creators and then having them fight you
on it or something um change my mind style I don't know yeah I think that'd be kind of I think that'd be kind of fun yeah cuz especially like it could even be genuinely helpful cuz as long as people come in with like an understanding that you might end up agreeing to disagree then it's probably just going to be like a good conversation I don't know separate what his personal opinion and fact the whole conversation we're having right now is that that seems to be a very difficult thing like I I'm not
going against Avon Fox here to be clear but that seems to be a very difficult thing with a lot of topics and this is one of them for this this is definitely one of which is just baffling to me because so weird at the end of the day if you ripped my Android phone out of my hands I'd use an iPhone yeah like I um there' be things that bother me about it just like there are things that bother me about my Android phone um tacky the penguin says you're really straining for aat which is not an expression I've
heard before but I think I kind of like it you're straining for aat if your biggest issue with iOS is how you sign into calendars it isn't it's just not intuitive who said it was and what I and what I said was anyone who tells me that is intuitive I'm sorry but I I I have to take exception and then I laid out why would you take the biggest exception with this issue I laid out the only exception you have in very clear like like the like in very clear mathematical terms why it's not
intuitive and how the one app behaves differently from the other app and if we accept this rule that the account we're signed into is a setting and settings can only be here and are not linked to from the app then the fact that one behaves one way and one behaves the other way is not compatible with each other and and that is not intuitive and pretty easy to solve as well actually extremely easy to solve yeah it is it is it is so easy to solve and is so intuitive to solve in fact some people
who opposed my criticism of Apple in the chat today were saying it's so simple you just click add calendar but it wasn't there yeah why wasn't it there I don't no it seems like something's wrong cuz like why why would that line even be there if you can't do anything with it and that's where like my brain feels like it's broken and maybe this is Android brain I don't know because I I I expected I would be able to click on that and it would list the various systemwide accounts that I have
and there would be an account add account option maybe it brings me out to some other menu and I have to add a systemwide account there's 10 trillion authentication steps and it puts its fingers into everything in my phone and whatever else but like that's the flow that I would expect I would not expect a uh a line that is completely not interactable on a page of inputs that's not something I would expect like ever to be honest Apple was forced to make setting up mail as easy as Apple Mail
great okay so you're saying then that the fact that they work differently is because Apple put user hostile design that's not the argument you wanted to make in their calendar app and left it there because they were never forced to change  it  yikes why are they like this and now they want to change the  well you got to go to settings and then there's the change subject app settings which are only in settings yeah but it's in the settings of the subject app not in the global settings oh and it's under
a hamburger menu I got another merch message for you here we're going to be here all night and Luke's birds are going to get sad lus do you want to move on we can keep talking about this if you want all right cool lus I need paint my house it's only "uh 1,150 ft people tell me rolling looks" worse than spraying is it worth buying a sprayer just for a onetime use rolling be okay get good at rolling uh it's not that hard um basically what it just comes down to is make sure you apply
enough material and then kind of spread it out and level it out without um pressing too hard and then make sure that you've got a light on nearby cuz while it's wet it's really it kind of has a Sheen and it's really easy to see any spots where you've got too much paint built up and it'll drip so make sure that you go right away um and and kind of level those out without a ton of paint on the roller before moving on to the next area um cut in the edges first even though it's like tedious and it
feels like you're not making any progress even though you're doing the vast majority of the work you're covering the minority of the wall and then uh and then do your uh and then you're rolling after makes the yeah the remaining a lot easier yeah use a drop sheet no matter how careful you think you can be use a drop sheet because as you roll the roller it turns obviously and when you got paint on it'll flick out little bits of paint so as long as you have a drop sheet down there it'll
grab everything why would you say using  unintuitive I I yeah sure I'll I'll tell you paint sprayer operation is often not very intuitive sure I'm just messing no I'm good I I I will I will die on that Hill the Apple One honestly doesn't matter to me that much but I will die on the paint sprayer Hill Del M was like I  you fair enough oh man okay uh B this is a hard end of the show being seeing the hoodie all week on tech and gamelink and couldn't wait for it to drop the wife and I are suckers for cozy
clothing line what's the next step in foldables that makes it mainstream I man I don't know for apple to make one and I don't think they will uh it's been rumored for a long time they're clearly looking at the technology they'd be crazy not to be looking at it at the very least but they obviously have a lot of work to do on making their signin process consistent from app to app so they still haven't figured out how to make the camera BMP they only have one developer so got to give them time let
them cook yeah currently they're working on the calendar login um we'll have to come back to foldable compatibility they got they got T9 dialing nailed though nice good job yeah they did it deserves a promotion then they'll have zero devs I actually I actually love it I love T9 dialing it's so great the um the way that Apple handles all your different um phone call accounts so to speak your different voice uh communication methods is amazing here call me call me on the
phone sorry I'm just very tempted to Doo said a good one which was uh why are you saying that flat screens are so [Laughter]  okay okay so so so check this out uh yeah there's no okay so it comes up like this this right and then if I want to answer then I just you know hit my button or whatever okay call me on teams now we'll be here for a half hour no no  cool I hate teams so much you really do okay so this is cool watch this how cool is that the interface is that's really nice
identical that's genuinely very nice and the best part is if I go into my call log CH both that's really nice yeah that's intuitive that's very intuitive very intuitive objectively intuitive genuinely very cool I actually I am envious of that feature it's especially nice uh like for carplay because I don't have to think about what slightly different interface might come up like when I get a WhatsApp call in the car on Android it sucks yeah they have different bring up a little thing swipy
things and whatever yeah annoying yep so it's very very intuitive okay so Apple people are you okay now are you good that is genuinely like as someone who doesn't use iPhones that is sick and I wish I had that are you good are you okay are we are we over the calendar thing probably not and how the settings are not in the same place and that's objectively actually kind of stupid but but this isn't this is not stupid this is really good well they are they are in the they something that's not no they're
not in the same place they are but they're also sometimes in a different place but not they are one time in a different place yeah yeah yeah which is except when they aren't in that different place yeah which is not intuitive yeah but this you know what makes something intuitive when someone who's never seen it before is like whoa that's really intuitive yeah that was pretty intuitive wasn't it yeah and oh man not having to like bananas sometimes swipe left and sometimes swipe out of a
circle and sometimes press a circle on Android the call receiving like button it's just different depending on how someone's calling you it's incredibly stupid we concede the calendar for the acknowledgement of call history the Apple nation has accepted the Diplomatic oh man so yeah I there's lots of things that I actually love about it that are objectively better dude the dedicated um the dedicated voice input button at the bottom of the screen that's just always right there whenever
you have your keyboard up and you don't have to long press and it does punctuation automatically which is super cool there's there's tons of stuff that's really good I've I've got a I've got one my swift key one so I use a third party keyboard right ah I've been using the same third partyy keyboard for so long I don't remember what normal one is so I use a third party keyboard and mine puts it way across the screen but with apple regardless of whether you're using a first party
keyboard or a third party keyboard there's a voice input button that is independent of that and that sits under it which is really intuitive sure there you go we good you got a Bonus one got two things now yeah you got a Bonus one you owe the the Android Nation something is there a next topic no there's no other topic this is it leave uh okay that there isn't Carson asks uh in your  kidding they want balance float plane chat wants balance they want a negative  home oh man I want to try one honestly I've
never done it an iPhone yeah I tried an iPad and then immediately threw it out I was going to say I feel like you'd go insane I would the iPad we're not talking about this I love the iPad shut up L dude have you ever used an Android say it is the superior TBL only with extreme custom firmware it's not even close no lonus says someone who practices 321 backups are M diss or Blu-Rays viable I bought some recently to backup archive some important stuff but now I'm wondering if my efforts are
better spent elsewhere um very viable no M disk is totally a different class of storage devices tape are you familiar with them uh yeah but is he like actively using them uh well you don't they're just like an archival grade DVD essentially yeah yeah so if you have like uh like legal documents or something like that I would say out of tape M disk Blu-ray throw them on M disks that's that's the way to go for something that you really want to not rot um I would trust that more than a
hard drive in storage that's actually been a big problem for um data recovery companies is some of those drives are getting so old that even if they're brand new and sitting in storage they're just like they don't last forever whereas M dis discs I think are rated for like a thousand years or something like that I don't know that they'd actually last that long but they're rated for an extremely long time What is tape rated for um well it's more that it's more physically fragile a disc has no moving
parts so I I would be personally a little more comfortable with with m um it's also like you can just get like a fireproof file cabinet and just you could store a functionally unlimited number of M diss in that compared to like tapes yeah um and and the tapes would store more especially like more modern um more modern tape formats but if you're doing legal documents yeah then it's it's purely archal tiny files yeah and yeah they're small files anyway and if you're going back to and and
having having like like smaller amounts and just like a ton of them in and putting labels on them versus like how much how much stuff do you have to back up to this one tape before you finally put it in the archive I'd almost be afraid to like have a pending have enough data pending that I'm I'm going to fill up a tape before I can put it away you kind of get what I mean don't you need special software for tape as well that remembers where all the data is on the tape itself you need uh and oh
and you need an expensive uh reader and writer whereas mdisk can be written on not quite commodity but slightly more expensive burners I I didn't realize actually I yeah I didn't realize quite how not as long tape lasted as I thought yeah no  though cool I don't know just put it in an S3 bucket and let it be Amazon's problem to delete all your data is it is it is it is it not intuitive it's not very intuitive I just put everything on iCloud I mean if it lasts a long time they should call it Lisk yeah
but then they might think it's like lineus dis yeah might not be very intuitive no I'm a small vintage Tech YouTuber "with 1,000 subs and you guys are a big"  dis yeah I mean that might be a little unintuitive though because if the association is also Linus then people could get a false impression I mean you don't know well I guess well I kind of know oh all right then hey Von Fox what  dis it's okay dis moderately acceptable  the oh man okay all right hi yes Dan sorry hi I'm a small
vendage YouTuber uh with about a thousand subs and you guys are a big influence to me would you ever take a small Creator and have your team punch up a vid to see how much Pro editing can  views H interesting uh it's more than just editing I mean it's writing hosting editing topic selection thumbnail there lwi did a really interesting experiment a while ago actually where um he tried to how successful he could be as a new YouTuber using none of his contacts not using his own likeness
his own face or anything like that uh basically trying to pick a topic using I think it was like someone else's voice and doing a like image SL video with voice uh with voiceover thing I don't know I don't know if how I would find this uh lwig someone already find the link holy Cy dude yeah that was fast thanks nerdy or nerd okay um lewig I made a secret YouTube channel to prove it's not luck this was wildly successful um this video is genuinely super interesting he talks
about uh topic selection um he talked about how how he was able to promote it so like he wrote this video the title is really good how adore made this man a million dollars like I would click on that it's that he knows so it'ser named M I don't think he actually used like technically Insider knowledge that someone else couldn't know I don't remember I watched this a long time ago so he kind of artificially through his own prior knowledge created a very meticulously researched video that
someone else could have made yeah I I think that was it I'm pretty sure um and then he he shows about like promoting and stuff too so creating the channel he goes through all those details making a thumbnail BL blah blah blah um and then at some point in time I don't remember where it is yeah he he like promotes it because he chose making a video about a streamer who does reaction videos so that he could link it in their stream and they would likely watch it because you like if you if we if we if
someone linked us a video like hey someone made a video I don't it's it's likely I don't think it's likely watch on not for us but a lot of other people we're not that edgy and especially not right now um but a lot of streamers would so he links it to them and then they actually do watch it on stream at some point um that gets it a bunch of traction people liked the video he tells them to go subscribe whatever and it starts the channel off and it's it's like it's really interesting because he
genuinely goes through all the steps um yeah this is this is like M kif watching the video I guess yeah that's him watching it I don't remember if they actually show the like metrics of the channel what's the fair use situation of lwig using mizkif's reaction video of  intuitive um yeah I don't I don't remember like how well it did but I mean first time video and we're talking about views from different areas in in the thousands like that's pretty cool yeah that's very cool so I don't know you can do it I
don't necessarily think it's like just particularly having good editing or just having particularly good something else you need to bring everything together um for it to be intuitive yeah I mean I think that I think it would I think it could be I think it could be an interesting experiment but it would have to be we'd have to be Allin like you'd basically we'd basically have to like like breing bring a production crew to you you'd have to kind of tell us okay here's five Concepts that I have um we'd
kind of have to massage them and go okay this is your best one this is probably your strongest angle for it oh one and a half million views okay I mean it's riding on the back of this video which has 6.5 million views hard to evaluate now um so we'd have to come all the way out there we'd probably have to kind of use our process right you'd tell us kind of everything you know and then I would lay out all the like the intro the story beats the conclusion we'd figure out how
to package it can we make a YouTuber you would yeah you would sit there and you would read the you would read the the script but I I don't know if uh if you're on float plane you might have seen this before um but there's a there's a behind the scenes of me working with Ryan Shrout and Tom Peterson who both at the time were at Intel I think shrout's moved on I think tap's still there um but basically there's a behind the scenes of me coaching them on their part in our video on Intel Arc uh where
effectively I just say okay repeat exactly after me and what's really special about this product is and what's really special about this product is so essentially like like like showing them the exact intonation that they need in order to make the delivery a little bit more Dynamic and engaging so I would probably have to do that unless you're amazing at it already which you might be I'm I'm not you didn't even say exactly what your channel was so I'm I'm not sure what it
is and then from there we would have to kind of show you okay well what does it look like to put together all the guidance for the visuals that are going to support this then we'd edit it then we'd edit it um and at that point I I don't know it's tough like um we haven't really answered your question like how much Pro editing drives it because there's so much more to the editing process than just the edit so I don't know what to tell you yeah lus what advice would you give a
young Canadian business owner I'm from  run to LTD store and get these good deals  run it's been a long week uh be prepared the whole world let alone let alone Canada is in um has been you know in not great economic yeah space for a while now um this a new thing everyone talks about the impact on consumers of inflation because most people are consumers rather than business owners but businesses are absolutely impacted by it as well yeah and and and on both ends right because on the one side you've got your
suppliers or your partners demanding more because of inflation and then on the other side you've got your uh your labor force demanding more because of the impact of inflation on them so in a way you're kind of caught in a squeeze if you increase the price of your product some people might not be able to afford it anymore despite everything else because they might not be getting raises from their companies to keep up even if you're giving your people um raises so you're you're you might have less less
um revenue and haa asks uh lonus and Luke Trudeau or Pierre yes no we have a deao two-party system Luke no I know but yes wasn't it so cool when he was like going to get rid of first pass he was like it's done dude getting rid of it bro it's obviously really stupid and you all voted me in for this reason so I'm definitely going to do it I am uh and then I didn't I know that there's been plenty of other things hell yeah that Captain JT has um has screwed up deem but the one that I am actually by far by
far the most angry about is first pass the post it enrages me as well like election reform is something that um you know I would think that Canadians and Americans uh the need for election reform I would think is something that Canadians and Americans should probably all be pretty aligned on at the citizen level um and the fact that they that he promised he was going to get that done and then was  psych not cool JT not cool br not cool bro there's like like we there was a our own Province for the Americans
that's the same thing as a state well it's not yeah that's fair yeah anyways it's like a state except it's like it's actually part of Canada instead of like wanting to be its own thing completely yeah yeah but except for Alberta and Quebec they also want to be their own  completely except for a lot of the anyways yeah I'm not sure how stoked the Prairies are on the whole like Commonwealth either but you know whatever yeah BC kind of hides on the other side of the Rockies and pretends we're part
of Washington yeah yeah we us us Washington State and Oregon State as far as I can tell like like if the whole if the whole rest of the world went to crap I think I we could probably get Yukon in there like I I think if the whole rest of the world went to crap we could all probably kind of come together and be like Pacific Northwest Land rainland yeah yeah we like it wet um uh what else I going say yeah we had a we had a provincial election here recently and I I was looking into it cuz I was like I
want to be an informed voter and I I found the like the platforms page for the three parties he sends this to me in the middle of the night he's like oh my God like what are you talking about the the like it it really felt like genuinely someone in grade four was like um this would be uh I don't know they like asked chat GPT like how should I make a bad political campaign and they were like I don't know do this and then they actually published it like it's stunning that people put
this on paper and I mean that for both of the main two parties dude think about it when you were in grade 11 grade 12 okay and you like put together a project on something and you like did some research or whatever and you did a presentation at the front of the class it seems like it went further than those that as far as I can tell a lot of people never really progress past that in terms of like their research and presentation and D data compilation skills and and and you you would think
you would think but of all I mean you know these are people in like a position of you know where it's really important for them to be able to do this that's been a wild realization like as an adult and it it still gets me it still gets me often where I'm like oh like this person's coming from from I don't know this this company or this this area of whatever educational background and and you you start conversing with them and you're like oh okay like this is going to be great I'm going to like I'm going
to learn so much it's going to be so so useful or interesting or or whatever the scenario that you're in is and then you start actually working with them and  okay you're just like a dude well everyone's just a dude yeah like that's the thing right all right like we I don't know it's funny we we we leave you know school where we look around at all our peers and we're like everyone's just a dude we're like and then we go into the real world and we're like oh you're a librarian and you're a dentist and
you're a bus driver and you're a this and you're that and it's like no no no no you're all just dudes you're doing those things the hope is that when you're in high school you're you're like progressing so much year to year that when you leave High School I think I think there's probably still some amount of assumption that like you're really going to be progressing a lot so like if someone worked in a field for 20 years you're going to expect like this unobtainium feeling level of of
expertise and that does exist sometimes it oh it totally does for sure Luke I don't know what was more enlightening for me when I had children and realized that kids are just tiny adults yep yeah sorry I keep or when the inverse dawned on me just a bunch of really big kids walking around and to be clear to be clear present party included I not some kind of paragon of maturity let's be real here oh yeah dude I still I still feel like I have honestly a lot of the St the same wants
and desires and inverse not Converse that I did when I was 15 14 honestly like you know the approach might be different dude we crystallize like way younger than I think people are comfortable thinking about yeah like going to my 20year high school of reunion I'm like yeah did you go yeah why not I haven't gone any of them yeah hot take don't be too cool to go to a reunion it's not even that I just yeah not what no it totally is I've most of the people that I've talked to about it
it basically boiled down to like I'm too cool to care about this no I I I'm still in contact with honestly a lot of people from my high school sure so like I don't know we'll like go have a campfire with like 20 of them this is my reunion but that's not the reunion yeah that's not the point of it I'm not saying I'm too cool for the other one I just don't care but it's not because I'm too cool I  cool I just I'll let you guys unpack all of that I'm not going to go yep yep I'm not interested
yep charge nuclei says it's because everyone else is less cool deep blue v says sure Luke sure no I just fox says which makes you cool I think if you're not in contact with a bunch of people from your high school could be good to also in the age of Facebook I think that's another big change cuz there there are people from my high school that I'm not actively in contact with but every once in a blue moon I'm like I wonder what they're up to and then I go click oh and then I'm done I didn't need
more than that I don't know look I I only stayed for about 15 minutes because well because uh it was one of my kids birthday party that day okay and so I was like well I I I'd like to go I'll go show my face say hi and you know see what see if there's anyone that I recognize um some of them I didn't I I like I had a pretty big class and I was a loser so like I was actually not cool you had a pretty big class you didn't go to like a I thought you went to like a a farm School basically well yeah well
were you commuting at I had to drive a fair bit to get there it was like 20 minute drive how big was your gr your your my uh well when I say pretty big class I mean for me to remember all the names and faces like our our school was "a about I want to say about 1,500 or" something like that so my class was a few hundred people I think yeah I think you're at a bigger school but part of the problem for me is that um I was in the like I was I was kind of in my like streamlined pod um so I was taking like
challenge courses and AP courses so I saw a lot of the same like 25 people and I saw very little of the rest of the 90% of the class oh interesting I saw I saw a lot of those folks and like I took metal art and Jewelry um we had a really small believe it or not so we like we only had one AP course if I remember correctly it AP English oh yeah okay like there wasn't like so you you were often like I was quite mixed amongst everybody we only for AP I think we only had English as well so challenge
was just our internal like uh name for like a slightly more challenging version of what is essentially the same curriculum never whereas AP is its own like separate entity that like organizes things oh Dan is saying we're over time oh we're over time yeah um you okay L uh I am still good but not for like a long time okay cool yeah I just needed to check in yeah no that's good we just wrap up pretty soon here yeah yeah I don't know I'm not like against it I just I just don't
care got Facebook spoken like a true cool guy sounds like a very cool answer I met somebody oh my goodness oh my I met somebody from you know it's like whatever man like yeah we're all just kind of going through life I'm just not that into it I could go to the high school reunion or I could do it but like I don't know or I could do something way more important and sexy could hang out with my beautiful partner and my my birds and my cool uh my birds are pretty cool okay my cool
friend I I met somebody at the gym that uh I went to something heavy I went to Elementary and Middle School with and that was cool but they don't do like Elementary and Middle School reunions like those people I actually don't have contact with anymore any of them so you would go that was pre you would go to a grade seven Reunion yeah actually interesting because I don't remember almost any of their names I don't have any contact with them anymore because that was pre Facebook and stuff you know
what's funny is I actually had the exact same thought like two weekends ago I was back in Ladner and I was at Shy's bar and grill with my my grandparents the kids great-grandparents and um of it this is more true and the the waitress bore a striking resemblance to someone that I went to school with the age wasn't right like they were younger but I was like holy crap I wonder if they're a relative of of this girl I went to school with um I I didn't want to ask cuz people don't interact in
person anymore yeah and it'd be like a weird thing to ask someone speaking is weird hey do you have a do you have a relative named whatever like you look like someone I know it it almost seems like a pickup line you know oh yeah really I don't well you never know people people apparently just like don't approach each other in person anymore so so anything sounds like a pickup line I I would think so fair enough and I was just like it was unnecessary I don't actually care
that much so I I wasn't going to like say anything weird uh aroth says yeah that's a fair concern in my opinion make as advis says I accidentally picked up a girl that way okay so there you go I'm apparently not completely crazy I do think it would have been fine I was there with my wife and my kids and my grandparents like yeah that kind of diffuses a lot of that clearly I'm not making a move but never underestimate how scummy a dude could be so and and modern relationships sometimes exactly
who knows exactly very who knows who those kids are actually born from yeah yep um what about second wife say mine still anyway uh the point is it it made me think about someone that I hadn't  Aude would because came on theels Aunt ran into the mom of like my Elementary School BFF who was like oh yeah he's like moving to North Vancouver and like has a kid and stuff and I was like it's crazy to think about what you know um yeah like I I don't know I I think that'd be cool like I left I left my
Elementary School my first elementary school after grade too so like being able to be like hey remember me no I have I well I   cool I don't even want to like tell this story I mean I think you're committed now so let's go cool guy I think it was grade one I kissed some girl W that's pretty cool like who the heck was that you kiss girls you don't even remember them and this guy says no I really don't think I'm that cool Dam damn I don't know to you guys I've held so many hands
I don't even know I don't even know how many hands I've held if I remember correctly I've had so many cups of tea if I remember correctly one of us was like hurt or something I pulled on so many pigtails my God if I remember correctly I'm just going to go for it any anyways and uh whichever one actually like initiated it did so because like their parents would do that when they were hurt to try to calm them down so it wasn't it wasn't we're in grade like one it wasn't what he thought
wow he's he's been emotionally intelligent and caring since wow my look at this guy God you're cool God you're so cool I can't you guys mind Paradox says yeah definitely friends from grade school I'd love to see again but High School no interest in talking at all to any of them now I have now I now I have a hypothesis here and that is not that the people you went to grade school with are like better in some way but rather that they were at a stage in their life where they hadn't turned into
completeing [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yet that that makes the the elementary school reunion interesting though I see okay cuz you didn't get to see that process so it's like what what happened in the Gap how did you get why how do you look like this basically yeah how do you go from like that kid that was fun to play soccer with to like I don't know who  stop oh man yeah okay uh what what's going on more we got yeah I got more merch messages okay we got some we got some cool people sending merch messages
yes how many is there left you wish they were luk let's let's try to let's try to power through these a little bit okay I wish there was Marino underwear available they're wonderful do you know why some websites don't let you open certain links in a new tab I hate that oh my God I know as a habitual control clicker it's infuriating when I can't I hate it so much also middle clicking does the same thing and it's my favorite I hate it so much I hate it so much okay so watch this watch this okay so if I'm
in the dashboard and I want to switch accounts and I right click and I right click to oh my God I left clicked okay it doesn't matter the point is if I want to switch account and I right click I want to open an tab where am I opening a new  intuitive I love this man not me just making sure you can do the yes that works okay cool all right good so V Vindicated uh is there any pricing available for the commuter backpack I'm hoping $150 or less so I can justify upgrading my upgrading my
wife UPG to my upgrading so I can justify upgrading to my wife from the $50 back crab I'm still using from high school it's just that is what it says that is what it says this is the least intuitive merch message I've ever read to my wife upgrading to my wife from the $50 backpack where are you storing things in your wife that's H that's quite the upgrade though from I can't do this um not a very intuitive upgrading from my wife upgrading my wife from the $50 backpack I'm still using from high school okay I
hurt my hand I'm not surprised it's not too bad it's not too bad um uh we're not announcing the pricing yet I I we announced that a little early I think the backpack comp B well we got a we got a we got a wait list we got an email newsletter got yeah no no we got to drum up we ordered a few oh based on the newsletter or just preemptively just based based just based just based not on anything just based like on a like on aing Turkey based yeah yeah get that meat yeah yeah get 
gravy okay we need to get out of here this is what happens if we go past 8:30 next keep going ah hey was using my LTD stubby to fix my dishwasher before W show uh how well can I expect it to hold up to water I don't know you tell me it should be fine the bits might rust a little bit because they're like iron and stuff yeah yeah your Sha's okay yeah yeah just based it  shaft all right keep roll all right sorry sorry the last one I got for you  with your focus on transparency will
there be any more how LTT makes money videos I know were used against you but uh can you look past that I really hope that people were not here during the start of the show Chad understood it apparently but yeah um I think someone internally pitched a little while ago it might have been Adam I think it was Adam I'm not sure don't don't quote me on that I might be wrong about that someone pitched it internally a little while ago I think we are due for one um I don't know guys like it's uh it's
one of those things where someone in philine ch said wouldn't the old video still basically apply no I mean and that's the thing right and that that's why has changed that transparency is not just once right like if you if you have a a window in into the front of your house right and you open it for a second and then you close it that's not transparency that's a glimpse you know uh transparency is a process it's a mindset it's ongoing and um and so I think in the interest of
transparency yeah um I'd like to do another one but after sort of experiencing the way that people take what I say in those kinds of behind the scenes looks and extrapolate or um or twist um what saying to turn it into something that I didn't say I don't know it it definitely it definitely makes me like that one time that you said that the iPhone was an un unintuitive mess yeah and had no redeeming qualities yes like the time I said that um it's really challenging right because I I can't reasonably
expect people every individual person out there to be familiar with everything I've ever said right and so you'll see like bad faith statements like lonus always criticizes the iPhone he never criticizes Android so mean um and I think this is one of those content pieces for us that um have a super high potential for that for people to see just this and and not see the bigger picture or to see it and not believe it and um and I'm putting myself in a position where they just
wouldn't have been thinking about it if I didn't bring it up I think that's probably the biggest Danger is I talk about like you know I talk about the sponsorships or I talk about Integrations or I talk about merch or I talk about float plane or you know all the other ways that um that lus Media Group makes money and you've got you know the people on the one side that are going that couldn't be all of it what are they hiding right and then you've got the um and then you've got the
people that are like oh my God I can't believe that they make so much off of like sponsorships and merch that they can pay like you know 100 people um I didn't you know I didn't think about that before I thought that you know lonus was just my friend or whatever and it's like bro why is it a conversation that I'm even opening up at this point like during W you know two and a half three hours into wano or whatever we are right now what are yeah we're three and a half hours into W show it's like yeah
fine we can kind of talk about this stuff because realistically the only people are going to make the make it past me insulting their precious iOS are going to be people who I think can at least based Android users let's go I think our people who can um see the bigger picture of what we're trying to say and see that you know for all of our flaws we're trying and it sort of take things um take things that we say and take the things that we  um with a positive with a set of positive
assumptions rather than a set of negative assumptions whereas like a Mainline Channel video it's not really like that so we'll see uh I think that uh right now this is not a good time of year to go bug the accounting department to create a bunch of extra like presentation slides for us they they've got sh to do um got a lot of new good but new goalposts things to work on yeah but maybe next year we'll see okay uh can Cano asks timeline for backpack carabiners you should have them 
support and I'll see you again next week  bye dude it was so hard not to talk about this oh you can't lean over here I know  fine I know right
