Jake Bell appreciates Cutting Edge technology but doesn't like to look at it hence the dinosaur man music discs and is this your phone brother I don't make many calls so his goal was simple to spend every last penny of amd's "$5,000 on a sick Tech upgrade that I" wouldn't be able to find I accept your challenge no all older more stolen how about down here Pok√©mon Ruby my favorite one Tech deck you're not going to find anything what about this Wireless Communications device uh actually this
is pretty old yeah it's got the new Wi-Fi 3 aha I knew I'd find something old record but about a new video game that out damn it there it is how is this hidden you've got so much stuff there's a pinball machine how is this the stealthy upgrade okay we're going to figure that out but first we got to roll that intro  AMD ultimate Tech upgrade is back which means it's time for another giveaway they're going to be giving out three Sapphire Nitro plus RX 7800 XTS it's a great card for 1440p high refresh rate
gaming with 16 gigs of video memory all you have to do is check out our Twitter which we're going to have linked down below for a chance to win thanks AMD for sponsoring this series and for giving away cool stuff in all seriousness this probably is a good time to explain what's going to be stealthy about this setup my understanding is most of your upgrade is going to end up hidden inside the pinball machine that we definitely didn't accidentally break as we were bringing it up the stairs
Elijah there's no video proof you have no evidence it was me true you do have my track record though did you really put extra holes in someone's wall again into his house did Elijah work on this what won't be hidden is all the stolen goods from the office that uh yeah you trying to stand in front of it really I'm getting a collection the fact that you're collecting it doesn't make it not taken debatable the UK would like a word backpack that's not mine I think that one's mine that was mine another LT
backpack also not mine one Jonathan Horst hosted of Mac address help me I have no explanation oh my God there's another one of these green water bottles you have every size mhm there's no way anyone actually bought a homepod this has got to be from the office Christmas party I've got three pictures lest in my house this one's my favorite what the hell it's in your bedroom you got to remember who you're doing it for well not not it like who you wake up for in the morning see I thought he was talking
about this one and I didn't want toake acknowledge it no the top one what they're the same Spot the Difference ones have been kissed twice as much hey guys and you're having fun but can the first thing you upgrade please be the Wi-Fi network uh yeah let's do that let's let's do that now oh wow that'll be a big upgrade we're going ubiquity with the U7 Pro Wi-Fi 7 baby can you tell Jake help me with my list of things to upgrade yes I can the ubiquity are is real to go with that
we've got a UniFi Express so this is going to be your router looks like an Apple TV uh let's go ahead and do a quick before test you have gigabit internet and this is your Wi-Fi what are you doing brother not downloading question for you this has only got two ethernet ports on it one going to the ISP box and then one presumably going to our U7 Pro but Belle has a wired computer right here do we have a switch we don't actually have a switch but these can actually work in mesh Network oh is this also Wi-Fi 7
yeah this is Wi-Fi 6 oh this is Wi-Fi 7 but they can run in a mesh mode that sounds like an unnecessary compromise I also have a switch Belle has a switch Belle has a switch let's use it this is part of the upgrade no you just have a brand new inbox TP Link switch no I just keep the boxes for everything really yeah my closet full of boxes and all my dresser drawers you got to keep boxes for everything what if you want to sell it oh we're zooming now pretty much a gig that's more like it
that is not pretty much a gig but that is more like it let's go ahead and get the U7 Pro connected and see how fast this thing can zoom though lonus wasn't wrong I did kind of break it carrying it in but we're going to fix that right now with some wood glue kind of oh I got to siphon it stop what it's not coming out and if I bang it it closes it it's oh no what are you doing oh I see getting glue out I just need a chopstick or something oh we got incest here I incense sorry okay we we got to get it into the
crack yeah it's in there no no you had it in there no it's not in the crack I'm in the crack Elijah it's not in the crack oh do we just nail it in oh it's in oh is it yeah it was me oh it's smoking unplug what did you do what I plugged back in to test if I could get it working was this cable uhhuh and this ribbon cable okay I did not touch anything else when plugging it back in and I saw the smoke coming from the bottom corner here it's dead this right here is an HDMI port but this cable is not an HDMI
connector do not plug into TVs this is a pretty common thing especially with smaller companies where they will reuse an existing standard port or cable because they know that it's reliable but Carrie completely different signals or even power over it and I think what happened is we created a power Loop where we powered this board and then output power into this board in a way that it was not intended to be powered and fried it the good news is Elijah is not actually dead he'll be up in a
moment and we are going to proceed with the rest of the upgrade and then Elijah is going to fix it that will be his Redemption Arc and we will shoot that at the end Elijah can I give you a task that has no electricity yes sir can you please wall mount that AP also hey can we do a speed test on that AP now let's have some good news I'm really sorry Belle dude your Wi-Fi is bugged 900 megabit your ISP is fine this is what I get for trust and Jake tyy now it's not  door it's a frame it's the frame TV from
Samsung okay chosen for its matte screen clean aesthetic before this I had an s95 B why black rectangle on your wall ugly matte artwork pretty you didn't I went from a 65 in s95 B to this 55 in Samsung frame with the teak frame that goes around it I'm so unhappy right  go boys nice that's pretty sweet the matte screen is really nice I got to give you that thank you I just want you guys to know you're doing great I keep hitting my head on this stupid wind chime stop that looks flipping awesome
let's get this cable managed a little bit we got the LTT store cable ties it's going to go in the pinball machine this is going in the pinball machine everything is this shelf will not be here what else is going to go in here the Apple TV the computer itself what yeah oh I don't know if that's a good idea you guys why uh ventilation well funny that you say that we actually had Justin test fit everything beforehand I was just about to pull this top off and you'll see what
we solved for ventilation we've got two no a fans in the front here and then we've got one in the back as well as an extra hole for cables to run out okay I don't think that's going to be enough we did it like this because it would be like kind of cleaner I didn't want to punch more holes through it well you know what it's a pretty minor thing to go in here after and put in a couple more fans okay okay cool they're only fans realistically we weren't ready to install this yet anyway because that is
not a Radeon 7900 XTX Bel do you want to get me your new GPU Phantom gaming thank you you're so welcome wait what is this this is a 39 90 yeah you already had a pretty decent GPU I got the only thing better fair enough all right I like your broken pcie bracket if there's anything wrong in there it's Chase's faults he built me this PC cuz I don't know how to build a PC well here why am I doing this then time to install a GPU well there's a broken bracket in there you're setting
me up for failure no no it makes it easier where'd you get this is this even new this looks scuffed yeah but curan again you told them to get you a us naaz I will put up the parts list right right here so you can see oh it's literally quite Dusty yeah it's got dust bunnies in it it's I mean 12 tabes of you know NAS drive storage also did you feel that power button truly awful that's what these feel like they have small fingers so I guess it it's easier that's this kind of switch well no you can't press
it like that you got to use the Fig it's not for your thumb yeah well while you're installing the GPU I'm not installing the GPU you're installing the GP are you sticker bumping this sure it's really good though really fast great for 4K gaming I mean what else can I really say about it what else do you want out of a GPU it's great for high refresh rate 4K gaming all right holy this thing is big is this bigger than my other GPU I believe so yeah I mean not that it's a competition but yeah it is and I'm
winning oh these are your stickers for the qap ooh all right going straight for Bobby Hill yeah no I shouldn't because I want Bobby Hill on top okay wo W you can't plug it in yet you're missing no oh there you go can I pull it into a different one you could but I wouldn't why because that top one is pcie Gen 5 the card's not pcie Gen 5 but yeah it's also using 16 Lanes directly off of the CPU and so those are your fastest lowest latency bestest Lanes this actually the first time I've seen
the screwdrive screwdriver shaft extension where can I buy it short circuit.com Bella is the channel manager for short circuit by the way yeah that's why he's wearing the short circuit T-shirt oh you're wearing short circuit too oh yeah look at that we're is the best merch we have I know you were feeling some trepidation before but am I  stickers you didn't even take off the like instruction thing on the side well I'm going to cover it that's a sticker all right balls I will have you know I
am taking so long because I'm trying to do a good job and let me tell you you certainly are trying how's the computer doing we're going to post it right now and make sure it works all right what the hell is that picture about why do you look so unhappy about the money B why do you have the official short circuit account on your computer Resident Evil 4 great game you can buy that right uh it I have short short circuit has I think technically you're actually not supposed
to do that is there something Elijah and Colin can work on right now uh I have a really big mirror that I can't hang by myself it be great if they did is that part of your upgrade yeah of course you're just getting free labor it was not part of your upgrade is it smart yeah it's a smart mirror what smart about it I could check that I'm looking smart how many holes are you going to put in it twice as many as I need to when I asked if you had mounting hardware you just brought over a bag of
everything that you've probably ever mounted before yeah why would I throw it away no but I I need the specific hardware for it uh there's one so it will not be good on the wall so why don't you just use those Anor things cuz it's like really heavy and there's only two of them oh no there's three what's the worst that could happen I hope it falls on you good all right well hey hey hey we did it and I didn't drill any extra holes come on in Belle take a look at your mirror wow it's a little
high it's really high it's not like an inch too high it's like six in too high yeah the best part is if you want me to lower it you're going to have two big ass holes in your wall oh that's fine that's pretty unbrand we did a great job that looks so sick there you go should we maybe set it up yes it should already be preconfigured raid five correct perfect that means he can lose one of these drives outright like just you know lose it I mean I mean if it fails anyway the
point is that he won't lose any data in that case and that'll leave him with 9 ter terabytes of usable space we were going to put that inside the pinball cabinet but then thermal concerns also yeah it looks great so now it goes on the Shelf yeah uh oh my gosh I thought he was going to throw the camera next what is this membership nice yes thank you I can read I mean does Samsung expect you to buy the TV and then buy artwork they would like that but luckily I take pictures so I'll just use my own
art oh okay cool let's see uh hm good job did you take it on an iPhone 4 listen this is helping cuz we have new camera stuff from andd all right let's go have a look at the camera stuff then uh you just got an alpha 6700 is this good yes I was looking at a couple different options cuz I want something that can do video as well as photos we'll do both very very well and then I got myself a uh fixed prime lens as well really you have one good lens and you went with a prime yes I do a lot of street photography
now you have to put I was leaning face down brother what his did you get his butt in it yeah no you didn't you need to get a belt he didn't I I did Pan over and zoom let's take a picture of the audience what that that's not that that's not how that works don't you hate it when people take way too long to press the shutter it's so annoying oh my God he finally bled got him that looks like it's on purpose though I also got a shotgun mic oh wow you got to be careful don't keep that
loaded wow my head looks so small I just have a giant head I'm sorry okay what's up Gamers today we're building a PC in a pinball machine and we're going to spend $100 let's go and then cut if this computer doesn't boot now because you're finicking with it it's going to boot watch it's going to boot here we go do you want me to push the button do it here we go do it you coward pretty cool eh yeah pointless but cool what do you mean pointless why is it in here it was Biz idea is that the theme
of this instead of the stealthiest it's the stupidest upgrade no Dennis's upgrade already exists okay fair the original plan was to actually have this in the top compartment here the one connect box yeah because we wanted the HDMI ports to be facing up so but that's really stable now so well I mean it is if you don't move it I mean we can put it down here there's just not a ton of room yeah we'll put it up here sure wait you're going to VHB it like just with tape yeah
cuz the only way it's going to I take no responsibility for this I'm washing my hands symbolically washing my hands I may have found a solution wait the glass is going to be on yeah it helps with air flow no it doesn't yeah it does yeah I was going to say how would that help with air flow it doesn't it's not how it works then why do any computer case have glass on it dust what because people like to look at their stupid RGB lights B I would like to apologize for your upgrade being stupid what's the
plan for the one connect cable it goes down to the radiant heater and then just up or yeah that's how it was explained to me okay and then what is the plan for  Sonos oh my God you guys didn't think of this did you we have a long HDMI cable really yes that's the plan yes this seems to be screwed directly into the drywall and also the threads are to Al stripped out of it I can't even remove the screw you just pull if you unscrew the top one you can just pull yeah I see yeah wow what a good shelf we're going
to need some cable ties wow this looks like ass we'll fix it fix it Mr Tech tips I can't fix this I need a cable cover okay cable ties hit me you know what's funny is Elijah unironically did a great job of installing that AP and I think we're going to have to move it into the arcade cabinet am I going to get any cable ties at some point ow yeah I deserve that all right while there working on all that I do have some miscellaneous stuff like  this no I just want to hear the reason
you have a 7900 XTX and you're going to play on that so I would like to know why so I love VR I've had most VR headsets so when I saw the quest 3 I was like there's my next next headset the only problem is is I want it for AR I actually want to learn piano a bit more officially instead of just knowing songs and there's a past through game that teaches piano no way all right let's see it the only problem is is that now I've tried the Apple Vision Pro and I don't think I'm going to like this anymore
because the Apple Vision Pro is awesome have you tried the quest 3 well there's more to do on the quest 3 so I'll give it that but uh I see the pass through is not the same that Apple Vision pass through is insane but this has games yeah and this you were able to afford all the rest of this stuff mhm so the reason why I got the ubiquity was because I wanted to do airlink using the quest 3 so I can play my PC VR games on this without a cable and it uses Wi-Fi 6E which obviously my $30 dink router
does not do okay so so let's see it just like that I'm in the metaverse nice wow it that didn't feel good that was like motion sick already hands are really weird you even well it has to decide like what camera is showing your hand so it kind of warps around okay I almost missed but the hand tracking for like using menus so none of the rest of this is getting well mounted hey also you do know that you're supposed to have like 6 in off of these heated baseboards especially in the
winter right uh they don't work they don't work no I'm just cold all the time I see yeah this looks too small for my head now this looks like it's for children dude you know you have this on upside down right no okay Bobo VR cuz this is the it's just this is wrong they've sent me something wrong cuz look at this is supposed to be over the USBC cable hold on one moment please stand by there you go now it's right side up  every can you tell what I'm playing he definitely needs help with that I got to
slow down it's going too fast how do I choose speed slow down please help me if you didn't know that he was doing lessons right now you'd think it was just some kid at the airport like okay this seems like user error Bell can I try uh B uping the demo wait it's not lined up with the keys well there at least part of your problem every single one of these lines is at the halfway point between two keys so always go to the right and now the keyboard is here okay fine you can get a
Vision Pro if you want let's go like I'm not paying for it I just mean like I'll get it I'll understand you'll get it let's go okay hey you bought some records huh let's change the subject oh yeah the first one you've seen I kind of got it as a gift to form you to me to symbolize when I beat you on the Black Friday stream oh I got you this how much do you think I paid for it I don't know 30 bucks $400 I also bought this limited edition numbered 121 mint copy of Empire the sun
walking on a dream and how much you think I paid for this one with the lenticular display more yes but only very slightly it's also pretty much $400 he spent 20% of his budget yeah I also went over by about $500 so I pretty much just bought one of the you brought wow so you actually spent $500 of your own money to meme on me yes Hey where's your Bluetooth oh it's over here okay also we need networking it's coming out of the TV speaker is that a problem go no here we should out the TV
speaker what's it supposed to come out of the Sonos is it supposed to look like this in here how do I plug that's why you wanted to move it close to the wall before anyone got a chance to look in there we still have to put this in no I already have an Ethernet in there where well where is it the white one it's not going to reach Elijah oh crap you're right a damn it I also got an Apple Watch I got this series 8 uh 45 mm we it was from inventory we only had gold which I is
not my preferred color but it does look pretty slick and I do VR in the mornings I mean we got a gym membership through work now so maybe not as much but it'd be good to track my heart rate see how I'm doing also got an expensive coffee grinder spent about like $400 or $500 on this so I can make espresso espresso do you need $400 of grinding to make espresso honestly for a good grinder that can do espresso and pour over or anything like that you pretty much are spending hundreds of dollars
unfortunately honestly every time I do it I get so mad there Elijah you happy lus I haven't I haven't been happy in about 25 years jeez perfect in between all this chit chat Colin managed to get one thing done today he built this ottoman Colin no it's for this oh oh wait what's it for oh is that new no but this goes with my other well I guess the other final couple objects no we have a pillow a pillow a lumbar pillow if you want to put that together I'll grab the other last thing it's from doen dooen which
means it's art it matches my uh uh tissue box how much is this pillow I paid $80 for this pillow and uh cover people say our screwdrivers overpriced well  true if I win I get a bigger discount on the Apple Vision Pro we're not even selling the Apple Vision Pro well went from okay you could buy it to not that big of a discount to not selling I don't think I ever said any of those things 530 frames per second let's go go away rat okay my God stop bothering me fine I'll leave not you surprisingly
even with the game running over there this is uh not loud guess that's what a layer of MDF will do for you oh yeah those intake C fans are working though a few moments later we're back we got Belle an actual arcade cabinet this time instead of the pinball machine so upgrade I don't know it still has actually the pinball buttons on the side which is pretty cool so you could play some pinball games made by the same company has way more room to fit the computer the one connect
box and the Apple TV as well as we ran an extra HDMI cable out the back in case a friend brings over like a Nintendo switch or a PS5 or something or if a friend comes over at all but you know are you okay with the arcade cabinet it's like you know uh we also did some cable managing and I had some other things show up but uh I think all we have to do is game make sure it all works yeah let's game make sure everything works and he's happy with arcade cabinet you know now that I'm sitting down Bell is this
really the optimal sitting and gaming experience with the TV all the way over there I mostly just watch NBA but again I don't want my TV to be the center of my living room like I'd rather sit across from my friends here in the camera and have a conversation with them than like watching TV I see so the TV is definitely second I'm purposely like this all the time say hello to my big friend Mama Mia now that's a spicy meatball we actually scaled our game down to 1440p 120 cuz
Bell only has an HDMI 2.0 cable well I wouldn't blame the cable it's actually the TV itself is only HMI 2.0 which I know it's not great it's a great TV it is a fault though uh so you can either do 4K 60 or 1440p 1220 why again did you change to the frame every point you keep bringing up is making me wish you didn't change it looks so good when it's off and I want my TV to be off big black triangle is ugly okay well anyways we're playing cyber Punk at 1440p with pretty much
everything maxed out we have motion blur off and we're averaging it seems like 110 to 120 FPS in game and some busy areas looks really good yeah I really feel like I am a cyberpunk 2077 I got to say this didn't go according to plan but I am pretty happy so I just want to say thank you AMD thank you Elijah I forgive you man thanks buddy thanks so much for watching if you want to get your own 7900 XTX we'll have a link in the description and uh who's AMD upgrade should they watch next Adam
but CW Adam oh yeah his retro stuff was awesome and Taylor Swift Center yeah
