what is up everyone and welcome to what I hope is going to become a new trend on the W show we're on time we are early oh now think about this if we could be this early for a consecutive year we could like make up we could we could make our way back to neutral that's a that is a good point we've got a great show lined up for you guys today of course our headline topic is Adobe getting their Just Desserts of finally getting at least some attention on some of the um if not illegal at least very
anti-consumer and offensive billing practice that they had billing practices that they have participated in over the last little while I got signed out of Google docs right as I was saying that so Luke gets to pick three topics today no Luke Luke it's your day it's your day to shine uh the Snapdragon X launch was not quite what people had hoped but uh there are there there is there is some good news uh also Nvidia Bec the world's most valuable company didn't they already become oh yeah continues to do
extremely Nvidia like things we'll also discuss and uh soft develops real time emotion cancelling Tech it was a very very short break but his brain was like I have done two topics now surely the intro will come   Today's Show is brought to you by Squarespace MSI control D and of course our chair partner secret lab uh why don't we jump right into the big Adobe topic first assuming that I can find it ah yes okay no I don't want to do that what I want to do first is I want to
talk about the moment when I realized Adobe had completely jumped the shark so when we were in the in the early but not quite like ridiculous growth phase where we added like 50 people in 18 months or 24 months or whatever it was but but when we were growing at a pretty steady clip and adding creatives to our Cloud um I don't I I actually don't think of our team as a cloud of employees that's that's actually super weird they're not sperm um I thought you I thought you going 
anymore I haven't slept much okay oh man the point is the point is that when we were when we were growing at a pretty steady clip uh one of one of the things that you have to do is is you have to add seats to your Adobe Creative Cloud subscription right so every time we would add a new person part of the onboarding was for us to to grab a new Adobe Creative Cloud subscription and uh set it to their email and they would have you know two concurrent logins and and all those all those rules and
everything right but then one day something bizarre happened uh someone left or was fired or something I I can't remember but but for the first time in forever um our our headcount in the in the editing department or in the creative one of the creative departments went down by one and I was like oh okay I was the administrator of our Adobe account at the time and I was like well surely this is no problem I will simply go in and you can't remove a seat when when you when you just like
when you're an organization that has I mean at that point we probably had somewhere between half a dozen and a dozen seats or something like that and when you're an organization that has a bunch of seats when you add another seat it you you you can't cancel it unless you pay I think I think you can pay like a um I think you can pay a cancel yeah an early termination fee but that that blew my mind the fact that adding and adding seats was like permanent like if you if you're company didn't just grow
forever that that was it the whole seat system is just crazy to me in general like there there's a lot of enterprise software Enterprise SAS solutions that operate on a seat system and it doesn't make any sense to me at all of course that's not the part that's necessarily illegal let's get into why Adobe is being jointly sued by the US Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission alleging that the company imposed a hidden early termination fee and complex and challeng ing
cancellation process upon subscribers violating the restore online Shoppers confidence act wow what a catchy name which is been around since 2010 so it's the hidden nature it's the dark patterns that were present in the signup process that made it so that and you know what truthfully if I had read the entire terms and conditions I probably would have known I probably would have known that I was signing up for a one-year subscription not simply adding another seat to my to my monthly bill that I was
that I was paying cuz from my point of view I I wasn't terminating anything I was just altering the deal pray I don't alter it further you know like I was just I was just changing the amount I was paying them per month um but from their point of view no no we have a dozen individual year-long contracts and I don't know whichever one you've canceled is whichever one has the longest amount left on no I actually don't know that part um I do wonder how that works though now this is pretty
cool oh right so I was going to say sure I could have read all of that but realistically I was running a a a fledgling business what I was going to I was going to spend a bunch of money on a lawyer that we can't afford to read to read a Ula for me or I was going to sit and waste like two hours of my day reading a Ula they know that isn't going to happen and that's why they hide these details in these in these verbose documents now this is the most interesting part of this because some
like company uh having deceptive or misleading subscription practices is not exactly newsworthy but what is really fascinating about this to me is that the lawsuit is targeting specific Adobe Executives maninder s son president of digital media business and David wadwani the VP of digital go to market in sales I I don't I don't follow this as closely as you know some legal Scholars probably do so for you in the comments thank you for your scholarship in the field of legality um and I I appreciate
that you've noticed this before but I haven't noticed this before going after a company while also specifically naming individuals who would have had to be complicit complicit in these practices it seems I love it it seems good I love it I think it's good why do you get to why do you get to just be like well no a corporation is a person and I was just the like shoulder skin cell surely you can't convict me of murder just because the right hand was all stab stab stab  stab there should be some accountability
for the individuals in these organizations that are making these decisions enthusiastically yes I I am I am happy anyway uh the US doj and FTC alleged that adobe pushed Creative Cloud subscribers into annual plans without disclosing that canceling the first year could cost hundreds of dollars under the leadership of cherina Khan the FTC has been cracking down on deceptive practices like this last year they filed a similar lawsuit against Amazon for their Prime Membership sign up and
cancellation process which was awesome I'm I'm super happy about this I think this is absolutely fantastic um it turned out we didn't end up canceling our subscription because we knew we were probably going to hire someone because we were growing and that is exactly the kind of I'm going to say it outright theft that these kinds of practices allow where I signed a deal not understanding the terms not because I'm an idiot but because they buried it somewhere knowing that I would be sort
of an idiot some fractional amount of an idiot um but but aren't we all justifiably idiotic there I need a shirt that says that on it I'm an idiot in a way that I can really that I can really put my  behind so they they took that money from me because I didn't properly understand the deal where I paid for nothing for some period of time until we actually added another person a lot of people are saying they would buy that shirt the jokes on you Adobe because at that time
we were using our second signin to have twice as many editors as we had licenses get owned Yeah Yeah I broke your terms of service and I don't even feel bad also we used pirated CS6 for like the first probably year or two I don't remember when we actually first US pirated Sony Vegas before that if it helps was that real that was paid oh yeah yeah no I actually I am one of the dozens who purchased Sony Vegas movie studio I kind of liked it yeah if you don't do anything special in it at all
it's really easy to use you can even do some like kind of some speci things in it the fact that oh man the fact that adobe software has so many tiny tiny little icons and I I get it I get it Ma macros and and and hot keys and everything are are absolutely an essential part of using this software but imagine for a moment if you know there were certain manipulations that I could do on the timeline that just didn't require me to click on a teeny tiny little indicator button and also
didn't require me to press anything on my keyboard and the whole thing was just a lot more casual I actually I actually quite liked uh editing in Sony Vegas yes it's owned by magix now um who is Magic Vegas someone yeah it's Magic's Vegas that's a worst name yeah I I assume that there are lions involved  it my brain is so tired that I was like Sigman and Freud no wait sigfreed and  one why don't we do another topic oh fantastic my brain doesn't turn on before noon at the best of times last
night I was up pretty late working on a a slideshow so I am I'm in a I'm a Vibe today my my hair is as flat as I feel tired come on let's get this some let's get this some elevation here that did not work at all okay well you work on that I'll go with the Snapdragon X launch Snapdragon X launch not quite Microsoft's Apple silicon moment but hey they they sleep and wake real good which is actually I mean I mean that's a that's a win that's a genuine W I'm I'm honestly that would make me consider
switching right there what do I even do on my laptop browser stuff like nothing yeah do I look as tired as I think I do I think we sort of both do I think you probably look a little bit more tired cuz I probably got a little bit more sleep but nice but yeah what were you up so late doing oh just being me I wasn't up near these ladies okay yeah so just dumb yeah nice yeah justifiably so though right yeah yeah  yeah but like I mean yeah this this is just me in the I'm actually not kidding
get back to work turn off the L show you can watch later you're being a very bad example okay go Optics yes it took me like six years of that speech to get it you'll get there eventually yeah man oh the dude the conversations I used to have with this guy be like look okay if I like slip you a power supply or something like don't don't make a song and dance of it because like we can't give a power supply to everyone you know just like you're going to make it so that we can't do this is
why we can't have nice things because as soon as as soon as people make a big deal about stuff it's like okay well look we can't give out a 100 power supplies every time you know we we we do something it's like now people aren't allowed to borrow stuff from the office anymore yep way to go Luke I think that was mostly camera stuff wasn't it um it started with the camera stuff because camera operators would borrow things and it was mostly fine except that all of a sudden we had so
many creatives and only so many cameras and all of a sudden we're sitting here going okay so sorry what are we going to create like a like a sign out sheet and like a prioritization system and and one of the big challenges is that if they don't have actual third party insurance for the shoot that they're doing which mostly they didn't because it was like Little Indie projects and stuff if they don't have it legally I actually am not allowed to just like take it out of their pay or whatever right that makes
sense they they can they can voluntarily pay it back and and I could choose to accept that but if if something gets broken like from from a legal standpoint here in BC I can't just like dock someone's pay to be recompensated for something that they broke or lost it doesn't work that way so the liability of having people just like borrowing stuff all the time and the tracking of it was all of a sudden going to be like a substantial amount of someone's job and we're looking at it going like how
does this how does this make any sense so foret it all right Snap Dragon X sorry I go on no worries yeah the the first co- pilot plus laptops powered by qualcomm's arm-based Snapdragon X Series chips officially launched on Tuesday and so far reviews are tentatively positive praising the arrival of Windows laptops that actually sleep and wake properly but get ready for the caveats the only full reviews on launch day were for the Asus viob book S15 featuring the lowest tier Snapdragon X Elite the X1
e7800 can I interrupt for a second as part of our briefing with Qualcomm um this part clearly did not make it into the sponsored piece that we did on the launch um but as part of our breeding with breeding with qual Lord as part of our briefing with Qualcomm um I probably I probably let them have it for about 13 minutes on their naming scheme for these things yeah during your uh dude you let them have it for 13 minutes yeah yeah during your what yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah oh no no no that was much
less than 13 minutes are you kidding me do you know how happy Ivon would be if I could go 13 minutes no oh no um so that is the dude that is the actual model number of that of that chip X1 e-78 D100 is a is a consumer facing model number I'm I'm not even I'm and and I was like no you guys need to change that now and they're like what's wrong with it what does it even stand for so x1e I'm assuming is like X1 Elite yes but then what is 78 and 100 so I didn't even realize they all seem to end in 100 I
didn't even realize until we were doing our briefing with them that there are uh that there are that there are are various um bins of the of the various Snapdragon Elite chips so here you go here's the here's the skew lineup uh from like some article or something that this this just demonstrates my point so so it's it's Snapdragon X1 Elite and Snapdragon or Snapdragon X Elite and Snapdragon x uh plus I've got I've got no problem with that that's fine and they were like so yeah so what's wrong
with it it's Snapdragon X Elite and Snapdragon X+ I'm like nothing that's great that's basically like your you know your good better best it's your it's your it's your I5 i7 it's your um you know uh your your your regular your Le your SE your touring or whatever you know coming back to cars it's you sure that's fine you got your different your different trim levels you got your different your different stratified product Lines no problem what the ever loving is this so I'm like okay no problem we got
X1 Elite I'm with you here then we've got a designation okay so we got 8480 and 78 so these are three different bins of the chip that run at uh different clock speeds that ironically if I'm kind of looking at this okay so the 84 is is four more than 80 and it gets 2 GHz more but oh oh no but the uh but the GPU is a lot faster and then the 80 is is only two more than the 78 but it's clocked like way the crap higher on two core max turbo on the CPU but it gets the same GP what does this mean also why is there
a random 100 at the end I I think you can either keep the the one in between the X and the e or you can keep the 100 you got to pick one drop the other um I I do not understand uh the 100 is probably the generation I don't care but then what's the one in between the X1 basically I what what I told them was I was like look have you ever been to London Drugs London Drugs is a regional sort of I don't know what they they sell everything they have like bag chips and cosmetics and TVs like a really
expensive corner store that also has a pharmacy some small appliances like it's it's I don't know it's kind of a weird it's kind of a weird chain uh they they seem like they seem like kind of cool people sort of cowboys but like in a cool way anyway London Drugs everyone London Drugs seems like Cowboys like I just mean like you know like yha you know they yeah they yeah exactly they're cowboys um so I went into one recently to buy a television for my grand parents they just needed a bigger TV so that
they could see the picture on the screen and they carry a handful of Brands and what I noticed was that hey it's been a while since I've been in a small Regional electronics store cuz you know I used to work at one and then I had no reason to go to one after that and I was walking I was trying to compare TVs to each other because i' been out of the loop for a little bit on on on budget TVs like I kind of know what's going on at the high end that everyone wants to talk to you about at a tra or whatever
but in terms of what people actually buy I was like okay well I'm just I'm going to need to kind of refresh myself on uh you know does this one how many local dimming zones does this have and um does this one have how many HDMI inputs does this have that that kind of thing and as I went around and I looked at the little the little product cards right I realized that they weren't comparable to each other at all they told me basically nothing um and so this was custom like
this is our version of whatever well it just there was no consistency so so Joe in the warehouse might have printed up this one and then Sally at the in the in the front might have printed up this one and she didn't look at what Joe did so she just kind of made up her own list of key important specs uh so so they weren't comparable I see okay there it was so hard to compare and realistically I I talked to I talked to Sally uh no it was some dude I don't remember their name but I talked to
someone I was like this is even less helpful um but that's what that's what a lot of people are dealing with when they go to when they go to buy something and frankly the big box stores are not a lot better and so like I was at a Costco and I was comparing the cards on the different PCS and TVs and stuff just cuz I was thinking about this afterward and I was like yeah it's it's better but it's not consistent either and so what I was talking to them about I was like look this is confusing this is going to
end up on there like what does it mean and they like they brought out their decoder sheet kind of like Intel has for for their product names and I was like right but the consumer's not going to have that so basically my problem so far because we haven't gotten through the rest of the topic is I would like to see a coherent naming scheme I would like to see I would like to see these you know what I give up this is the same company that just has Snapdragon 8 gen whatever
I actually no forget it let's keep going it's just not going to happen yep carry on okay most performance and efficiency benchmarks have it matching or slightly exceeding Intel and amd's current competitors which is good to hear it usually beats Apple's Bas M3 in multicore but is worse when it comes to single core performance and efficiency gaming performance is still in question the co-pilot plus PCS are not gaming laptops but despite launching a dedicated website to catalog game
compatibility early reviews noted games like OverWatch 2 and Witcher 3 performed much worse than their ratings would actually suggest some reviews covering the faster x181 100 wow that sucks uh and the X1 84100 have started to trickle out but truly comprehensive reviews are in short supply I want to see the 100 dropped Qualcomm if you're watching this just lose the 100 and we're good X1 80 and x1e 84 would have been great and then when you go to Next Generation just makes it make it x2e yeah perfect and it
would be solved yep according to Windows Central's Zack Bowden many media Outlets only received review units on Tuesday thanks to Microsoft's last minute recall of its recall feature that is a funny line but yeah it also something that actually happened uh Microsoft has also reportedly changed co-pilot from a locally run to a progress web app removing its ability to control Windows settings which um is less convenient but probably good for security with that said sorry I'm totally going to tangent
again sure we did a super cool video this week that's not the show it's sort of the show it it's an integral part the part of the show people care about oh right we did a really cool video this week we got our hands on a hard drive that contained basically every malware known to man oh yeah yeah yeah yeah so you know about this um well I know about both the hard drive and the fact that we have it yeah um yeah is your team like terrified that that is sitting on a shelf here oh no it's like a thing you
can just get those I know yeah yeah yeah but does it bother you that it's just like here and someone could like grab it and do something with it not really doesn't really matter you can download all the same stuff it's from place called VX underground yeah it's cool yeah super cool uh a little a little sketchy I actually I I we don't really know anything about the folks that are behind it so I'm not there is no recommendation here uh just we bought a hard drive but but it's cool and it's
a it's a really interesting tool for like learning about how this stuff works yes and I will tell you that I you know fundamentally understood you know how things can get pwned and you know people can you know remote access whatever what you know remote access Trojan you know rat or whatever I'd never seen the  um we fired up the bore rat rat and like oh my God the the fact that co-pilot can't change your settings anymore or whatever it's like honestly probably kind of irrelevant like yes more attack
vectors is more bad it's a different way in but realistically knowing that social engineering is so much of how people are get and the fact that an application like this exists that allows you to do literally anything to the Target computer you can do anything you can bsod it for fun you just like you can do anything so guys check out the video it's going to be it's going to be a lot of fun um but basically what I'm saying is yeah it's probably good that co-pilot is not
going to be an attack Vector less holes in the Swiss cheese less holes in the Swiss cheese but realistically there's a lot of holes in the Swiss cheese yeah they don't call it swiss cheese because it's a solid block right now Mo modern Windows machines with Windows Defender are pretty good sure it's a lot better than it used to be yeah like actually oh trust me I know I mean I I I I remember when you couldn't have your network Port plugged in while you installed Windows XP if you had an old disc because
otherwise Blaster worm would literally infect the system just randomly before you did anything faster than you could download an antivirus [Laughter] program oh man um okay where was I know uh Microsoft also reportedly changed co-pilot oh right no already read that the surprisingly incapable new arm chips are in danger of being overshadowed in a couple months by Intel's very impressive looking lunar Lake and amd's ryzen AI uh 300 laptop chips not to mention M4 MacBooks expected in the fall wait hold
on yeah can we actually give Apple props for what their chip names yes they're good yes they are good they're good they're easy to understand extremely what is an M1 Ultra quick a a better M1 sort of it it well okay I haven't followed it at all okay so an M1 there's there's M1 plus M M1 M1 it's either Pro or plus uh M1 Max and then M1 Ultra is two M1 Maxes okay so basically they've got they've got good better best Ultimate which is totally fine you've got you've got M which is you know what it is I don't
know it's Apple M silicon don't worry about it and then you've just got a generation name it's funny because apple is both the best and the worst at this stuff even the I even as bloated as the I give it a good name or just don't actually name it at all as bloated as the iPhone lineup has become with you know Pro and plus and pro Max pry easy everything has a clear meaning what is pro it means it has sort of something extra that probably most people don't need um it got a little bit confusing when
they when they did that generation I forget what it was where they had both the what was it the eight and the 10 and then they like skipped nine or something like that when they had the X the X yeah cuz but at least there was a reason for it it was the 10th anniversary and the the the 3G and 3GS sort of generation had gotten a little muddy with respect to you know what gen was what and they were kind of like they were they were almost like like fixing it um and and okay there has been again a little bit
of muddiness where sometimes you know you get a generational number on an iPhone but it actually has the last gen chip that the current gen is like that if I recall correctly where only the the like Pro got the the current gen chip okay so things can get a little bit confusing shootting log though but year to year it's very clear exactly you know which which one you've got and then they've got if you're buying an iPhone then they've got stuff like the Mac Pro they just keep calling it Mac Pro
and I'm expected to know what what portion of which year it was released I'm I'm supposed to keep track of that like that's absolutely ridiculous so I I don't get it because clearly Apple knows how to name things so that it so that you understand that there's like a benefit to upgrading to it but sometimes they just don't want you to know that you just have MacBook Air and it's like okay yeah I've got I've got MacBook Air why why can't I install a modern browser on it uh what is his name sebas contre
hter we got the Europeans in the chat today there's going to be some names I can't pronounce very well nice um he said but the but the processor completes the name now uh this is the Mac Pro with  Chip okay well then does help a bit that helps a lot that helps a lot so hey kudos for improvement yeah yeah way to go yeah I'm happy to see it there are a lot of Mac Pros that do not have that in them though just to be clear yes all right continuing not to uh so there's the new Intel and AMD uh laptops coming
and also the new M4 MacBooks are expected in the fall a new leak indicates that Qualcomm uh has more unannounced X Series CPUs coming although they are on the lower end of the lineup so it probably isn't good matter um we should stream this time of day more often what the heck we have like significantly more viewers than usual is it just because it's abnormal I have no idea nice nice nice nice nice um yeah we were spoiled by Apple's amazing arm transition that was wild um Qualcomm
might have overhyped these we also don't know how the better tiar chips are supposed to perform uh we don't we don't even have a clear idea necessarily of of how all the different devices with this chip are going to perform because uh qualcom allows their Partners to run the at wide range of different TD uh T they don't use TDP they use total I don't care a wide range of total power envelopes um I'm still I'm still pretty excited just because a lot of what I do I don't
need to game um I need working sleep and wake so if that's working great that's a W for me I need great battery life and I need to I need to run a browser um so I am definitely going to start I'm I'm going to daily drive one for some extended period of time um and we're going to see how it goes I'm I'm pretty excited apparently qualcomm's exclusivity deal with Microsoft is coming near to its close and mediatech is interested in moving into the space so it's not even just going to be
Snapdragon whatever- 100 whatever chips uh we might also get some mediate Tech chips and if anyone for mediatech is watching you have an opportunity today to have a coherent naming scheme that might literally win over customers reflect on that yeah  money it's Ohio uh skibby or or something no I was just like you know I genuinely don't know what those mean like a coherent cache oh it's yeah I don't even deserve  Bell uh all right what are we supposed to be doing Dan nice the muted Bell um you can do
another topic we could do a couple merch messages up to you oh why don't we do a merch why don't we do a merch message let's do a merch message all right so if you're not familiar with the show merch messages are the way to chat with us don't do a super chat don't do a twitch bit uh yes I've I've seen some criticism of merch messages recently yes the minimum is higher than those other methods is it yeah cuz I think this the the cheapest thing is a $10 gift card and you could you can send a super chat
for like a dollar or something like that um so you're right the minimum is higher but that's by Design guys we want you to get something for the money that you're spending which means we actually have to like produce something and ship it to you and all of that stuff um because we don't want you just throwing money at your screen and the reason that we don't want to take your you know couple of bucks is because if the difference between two2 and $10 is a lot for you I don't want your money for real I I I
actually I I actually don't want it um but if you want to shop on the store go to LTT store.com in the cart uh there will be a box whenever we're live where you can leave a merch message it can pop up down there on the bottom of the screen hey thanks Logan M oh look at that Dan replied to this one so he might give you a reply directly he might forward to someone who might know the answer to your question better or he might curate your message for me and Luke yeah hold on second we've got we've
got someone in FL float plane complaining to coo says but lus I want to burn my money that's totally fine just burn more of it and if you can't afford to burn that much of it then that totally fine don't burn any of it I'm trying to be a good influence yeah good influence yeah all right hit me Dan show us how the merch messages work sure thing hey dlll line us with the announcement of fantasian Neo Dimension being released on multiple platforms are you going to replay the game on
different platforms with the updated features no it's easy I enjoyed the game um I enjoyed the so so for those um for those not familiar uh fantasian is a kind of under the radar um jrpg that uh involved uh I'm going to butcher the pronunciation but uh here noobu sakaguchi and noou umsu but basically like OG Final Fantasy um lead and OG Final Fantasy composer is kind of all you need to know uh really really unique uh VIs visual style so the environments instead of being rendered oh man this is this is
horrible here we go the environments instead of being rendered are handcrafted diaramas that were then captured and then the um the the rendered elements they are I like that style it honestly is enjoyable just walking around in these environments it's absolutely incredible I do wish that they weren't so limited by the hardware that they were running on because uh the game was an apple arcade exclusive for uh I mean it's been at least a couple of years now and I was so excited for this
game and that I I was like on it like I I rarely I'm like okay when's this game coming when's this game and then it's like oh it's Apple arcade exclusive oh it's Apple arcade exclusive basically forever I think this is the first time in my life that I have bought a console just to play a game I went and I bought an Apple TV something or other Apple TV 4K or something like that at I went to Costco I bought a stupid Apple TV so I could sit and play this game is this the only thing you ever used it for it is
the only thing I ever did with it and it now is not even plugged in anymore U so I played through it and I loved how delightfully old school it was because it really was like a like a Back to Basics music's beautiful the environments are beautiful the combat is is is fun it's got this Dimension system where as you're walking around you get Random Encounters just like a classic jrpg and there's kind of too many of them just like a classic jrpg but the the main character has this device he
carries with him that allows you to just queue up multiple random encounters so as you walk it's just like you got a random and the Monsters just go into this like weird alternate dimmension and then you can fight them all at once and that's kind of nice actually that makes some of the attacks that have like these long arcs or like these uh shoot through abilities and stuff like that make more sense cuz instead of fighting two to five at a time you're fighting like 20 to 40 at a time and they like spawn in
as you kill them and stuff and uh I never I never really stopped enjoying the combat which was pretty unusual for a jrpg where a lot of the times it's just like okay well just max out flare and then I spend all my money on like ethers and then who cares anymore like this is just this is just tedious at least the loading times are short because it's an old one on sness or whatever like oh man playing on like the PlayStation PlayStation 2 is painful sometimes yeah anyway the point is that
uh the combat never really got old um I will say that there are some things that were less delightfully retro like I I I wouldn't say that you know I'm the kind of person that is going to you know boycott a studio over over a less than modern representation of say for example women um but I will say that even even to even to me I was kind of like these women characters were written by men you know yikes like the level of I get it he's a he's a studly guy you know the pro the protagonist character that I
get to you know play or insert my myself into the role playing game you know role um you know I get it but the level of fawning here is uh wow and to be clear it really isn't that different from the kind of media that you know the the other side will consume right like the whole point of Twilight is that kind of an ordinary young lady has these supernatural beings vying for her you know right like we get the same level of ridiculousness both ways but it just felt a little much for me in this
particular in this particular game and they have a philosophy for boss fights that I think is both really cool and also kind of um kind of frustrating so in a boss encounter you kind of have to figure it out you can't just go in and hit with your hardest attacks and just and and and watch the attack pattern you really do need to change up your party a lot like it it's one of those games where you've got a big roster and you will use almost all of them in every boss fight or you're or you're pretty
much doing it wrong that's cool um but what I found really frustrating was that you often wouldn't have time to figure it out it's one of those games where the only way to figure it out on a first playthrough is to read the strategy guide ahead of time and some of the some of the things you would need to do would involve not just making sure you have the right characters in your roster but making sure that not only have you leveled them up suitably like that specific one but you've got like
that specific branch of the tech tree to its credit you can Respec your Tech Tree anytime you want but there is a lot of micromanaging very tedious and and not just tedious but like and and the creative thinking is kind of cool but the way that um the way that so many of the bosses can just one or two hit wipe you or just like you know three hit Wombo Combo you no matter how many Buffs you had um and how long the fights go so I I'm I'm I'm no I have no problem with it both ways okay give me a long drawn out
tedious boss fight I'll fight a boss for an hour no problem or I will fight a boss where there's like a gimmick and once I figure it out like it's over don't give me both I don't want a gimmick that I have to grind through for an hour oh like there there were some that were that were really quite like that and part of part of my problem is there's a part where your party gets split up and there were two that you're like supposed to find first but for whatever reason I didn't I found a bunch
of the other ones first so they were way underleveled and then I came up against a part in the game where there's a couple of boss fights that I really need them leveled up and teched up more and it and it was really tedious to to grind those levels because of the way the EXP curve works for what you're fighting and how much exp you get anyway um I made it I made it to the final of the like three or four stages or whatever it is of the final boss I died at that point I had
already been fighting him for like an hour and a half or something like that and I was just sitting here going like I I get it I don't need to play the game again but I also would recommend it if you do enjoy classic RPGs um I felt the game needed a little bit more play testing um I think that part of it was just to Phill opical difference it's intended to be hard do you think it it might this new version that came out might have addressed that it does it has like a like a normal which means
Normie difficulty mode uh so I think it's coming out for switch and then there was a steam DB entry for it a while back but I actually don't know if they've made any announcements about it formally so I don't know if it's actually coming to PC or not I forget what the question was I'm assuming um I'm trying to look up the like YouTube announcement trailer I'm assuming at the end it'll it'll show the things it's launching on are are you going to replay the game on different
platforms no yeah that like my saves on Apple arcade I guess so if I wanted to New Game Plus it I have no idea if I can export that I doubt it got another one for you here lonus my steam deck doesn't work here you go you can have mine L laap there we go there oh look at that switch PS5 PS4 Xbox series X and n and steam kind of crazy that they're doing this through Square Enix I think Square Enix is helping with the porting don't don't quote me on that but um my understanding was at some point there
had been like some kind of falling out at some point um so that's yeah that's pretty pretty wild Life's too short for grudges man yeah yeah yeah there's a quote from Fallout New Vegas that I've always really liked um oh oh oh oh I can't switch it back there we go that's okay we share we share here you go all right where is it no no no no no I didn't want it on my screen uh lastly Waging War against good people is bad for the soul this may not seem important to you now but is the
most important thing I've said it's a good quote yeah good quote yeah I like that yeah I like that I should um I should have my extended family play uh what was it fallout Fallout New Vegas Fallout New Vegas yeah that that' probably be kind of interesting let me get on that yeah oh boy um are we doing another merch message I got another merch message yeah we'll do one hello guys anod Dev here oh hard at work making the next game look good nice have you played the other titles before 1800 what was
your favorite setting excited to get my hands on the screwdriver so uh oh do you remember you watched the lwig bro versus bro right yeah um I actually I don't know if this made it into the cut for bro versus bro but I didn't hear anything about ano in it it no no not ano related uh it did make it into the uh episode of the yard that I was on of wait hold on sorry of course the anod dev is watching now that makes sense nice okay sorry keep going um so so I think it made it into the yard
where I basically told him look I will play you uh any Halo game as long as it's Halo Combat Evolved or Halo infinite he's like why those two I was busy I was like because I've been because I was busy for a long time in between multiple kids in a company things happen I just had a lot you and I I was you know I was in a a very Whirlwind relationship even before that like you know I was I was pretty into Ivonne when I met her I thought she was pretty darn cool um so I spent a
pretty into her now I'm pretty I'm pretty into her yeah um yep yeah I'm she's great you know so so I just I had a lot going on in between Halo Combat Evolved and Halo infinite and um ano yeah same story I have played 1602 ad which was the the the like westernized or well further westernized name the the north Americanized name of of ano 1602 and then I have played ano 1800 and that's it I I I briefly pirated the like futuristic one and I only played it for I I just didn't really
understand how um not obvious the grid was uh like the building grid compared to 16002 yeah and I didn't have a lot of time in those days that I wasn't busy playing Left 4 Dead 2 with my wife um and so I just I kind of dropped it immediately but I really enjoyed both of them and I really enjoyed the the differentness of both of them um 1602 had land battles I don't know if you know that I did not they were kind of bad interesting um and and having played 1800 I don't even know that I would
necessarily want that they weren't that practical because like man taking taking territory by land was so expensive oh I'm sure because you could build instantly and there was no penalty for building like next to an incoming Army so you could just hoard a little bit of brick and Cannon and then when they make landfall build towers yeah and just annihilate whatever's there and then cannons like Siege cannons were ridiculous like you would want to have like a handful of Cavalry but then you
would just have you would just like roll your Cannon slowly across assuming that they they can't Tower you and then they would like one hit anything like it was it was it was pretty broken it was it was an RTS made by people who have read about an RTS in a magazine once like it right no offense yeah um 1800 is fantastic we both really like it but it was cool it was cool and it was different and then ano 1800 didn't have that at all and that was super cool and that was super different and I love both
of them in their own ways I I absolutely love them I forget what the question was have you played a previous ano the only previous ano that I had played was ano 2070 okay and I did not enjoy part of ano though is having someone to kind of hold your hand I think so through the like figuring out the economy and figuring out trading I played 2070 and I was like this is a weird game and I don't like it and I'm never going to go back to ano again and then lonus was like play 1800 with me or something and
then I tried it and I was like this game's actually really sick and now I even play it single player every once in a blue moon yeah it's oh it's so good um and man the soundtrack for 1602 absolutely slaps yeah it's so good I'm genuinely very excited for for 117 the theme fantastic having played 1800 the theme of Rome I think is going to be amazing yeah um I'm very excited and having like actually given 1800 a proper shot because I bet you when I played 2070 I didn't really play for very long
yeah I probably got it on like a Humble Bundle or something out and didn't it a fair Shake because I actually went back to it recently really yeah just to give it a shot again or what just because I I was wondering like it's funny that this question came up because I was wondering what like my more recent thoughts would be about this game if I gave it an actual Fair shake and I went back to it and it's so old at this point that like it was a little rough it's from 2011 the quality of life
has improved a fair in 13 years but I bet you if I gave it enough time I probably would have enjoyed that game but the concept of how it works was similar enough to 1800 that I was like 1800 is just just a better game I might as well go play that because it's not from 2011 y like it's it's not really a dig onone 2070 it's just I didn't feel a need to play that game it had no Nostalgia factor for me but I was like okay this was a good game I just didn't  oh more topics sure we can do more
topics Dan Nvidia becomes the most valuable company for a few days immediately tries to Strongarm their Enterprise customers totally sounds right on Tuesday Nvidia became the world's most valuable company surpassing Microsoft in market cap as it passed Apple a week before I oh man Riley puts in a little note here wow I guess Gamers must really be picking up a lot of gpus sorry uh yeah not not not even a little uh perhaps in hopes that what goes up could just keep going up Nvidia is
reportedly trying to pressure Partners like Dell HP Enterprise and super micro into buying complete server rack designs from Nvidia starting with the gb200 this would deprive these companies of the margin they usually make from designing their own racks we've heard that story before and that is why I don't actually know this but what I do know is nvidia's Manner of Behaving and that is why EVGA is no longer in the GPU business because Nvidia slowly carefully Generation by generation extracts more
and more of the total value of every dollar coming in to anything that has anything to do with one of their Solutions until there is absolutely nothing left for their so-called Partners um they and I've I've told them this to their faces and they they even have sponsored us recently I've told them they are the cheapest fing bastards that I have ever worked with um yeah cuz they they've been they've been very rich for a very long time it's just reached a whole new level lately but they the
the I don't know how difficult how how difficult they can be sometimes in what  um partnership um in in a partnership relationship it it can be can be very challenging and you know don't imagine for a second that they're the only ones I think I just I just rag on them a lot because the disparity between um how how well they do and how hard it is to sort of it seems like the better they do more they want to be difficult to work with and and I don't think I don't think it and I don't think all of I don't
think it's wanting to be difficult to work with I think it's just um thinking and in many cases rightly that if you want to play with our ball you're going to have to play with our rules I get it it's not like it's not an attitude that people can kind of understand it's like so I'm so I'm sorry you want to you want to build Nvidia gpus well like we we have all the Nvidia gpus and if you don't like the way that you know we do GPU partnership you're more than welcome to go make Arc right like it's
not yeah they technically have competitors but they don't really I'm sure it was going on before this what felt like the beginning of the end to me was when they started controlling how Brands could do box art that was like a big sign of like oh boy that was a public facing sign yes in the background all kinds of other things were going on I remember when hard ocp back in the day uh blew the lid off of project Greenlight where they were also controlling how their board Partners
could build the cards and validate the cards themselves um one of the ones that drives me absolutely crazy do you know why the framework uh 16 has an AMD GPU I've heard the story but I don't remember I don't know this for sure because you know what to Frameworks credit they don't tell me anything and I don't mean that no I mean that in a good way no I was gonna say like didn't you basically ask for that um I guess sort like indirectly whether I did or not though it wouldn't have mattered
me asking for that was just a demonstration that we aligned um but I I actually I was chatting with the with the CEO at computex and uh I was I I was just ripping him about something I can't remember what it was but uh basically I I don't even know what my Shares are worth and so he he was he was joking he was I was joking with him I was like you don't tell you don't tell me anything man I don't I don't even know how much my Shares are worth he's like oh I I can actually get
you that I'm like no forget it it actually doesn't matter um but the the point is that anything that is bound by NDA he intentionally keeps me kind of at Arms Reach oh good even compared to other investors in some cases because he recognizes that I am a member of the media and even though he trusts me he recognizes that his agreement is that he won't talk to a member of the media about this so it doesn't matter if I also happen to be investor he's just not going to do it and I respect that I
actually I actually really like that uh because you know someone someone who like you know is trustworthy but like tells you something is not trustworthy right yeah so I legitimately do not know the answer to this question but what I do know is a lot of things about Nvidia what I do know is a lot of things about how other partners have found working with Nvidia um so what I will tell you is that my best guess this is a very educated guess my best guess is that the reason that the framework 16 has an AMD
GPU and has no Nvidia options whatsoever is that Nvidia won't allow their Partners to build a non-standard form factor GPU they they don't care if the engineering is fine they don't care if a customer wants it they don't care if there's more you know uh repairability and sustainability in this approach where you don't have to swap out your entire main board if something goes wrong with a you know a GPU memory die they don't care about any of that what they care about is controlling the
ecosystem and they have decided they've been man they've been trying to kill mxm for so many generations so that's that's the old kind of standard mobile GPU form factor that manufacturers like clo have been relying on for the like big fat desktop replacement machines for many many years um but they've been trying man they've been trying to kill that forever and imagining for a second that Nvidia is going to allow some you know new form factor to to pop up is just I mean it's one of the things that I told
framework when I first heard early rumors that they were working on a gaming laptop it's it's one of the the first things I told framework is like look how are you guys going to do a GPU like I don't understand this product um and as it turns out they managed to get AMD to play ball or at least one of amd's Partners to just you know YOLO it and do it but invidious Partners don't dare step out of line and it's one of those things where like think about think about if you met a couple
okay you don't have to see what he does to notice that his wife never speaks yeah you know or like flinches at times little things like like there's a lot of signs that can that can tell you kind of what's going on so the fact that none of nvidia's Partners say anything doesn't mean that everything's going great yeah um yeah to be clear that's a good point to be clear our new contact there has been great we're back there's we're back engaged with Nvidia right now just like
every company there's there's really good people there and there's there's really not but it's clear it scales a lot it's clear the the relationship Nvidia cares most about is the one with their shareholders and you know what to nvidia's credit they're doing real great by their shareholders right now oh yeah they are I I can't even man that stock split dude at the rate it's continued to go up I'm kind of sitting here going are "we are are we going to get above $1,000" again like what is going on here like I
man I don't own any Nvidia but I sure wish I did at this point good Lord um hopefully not for long and we'll we'll we'll see if they tolerate me you know saying this about them sometimes I wonder because I know I know Jensen knows who I am uh like we've met before and stuff like that sometimes I wonder does he hear me talk about you know nvidia's tight grip on its Partnerships and does he go oh L is being mean to me or does it go lonus gets it that's how I do things I'm not sure I genuinely suspect it's
that he it's not like he shies away from being like yeah a a strong leader and you know what in a weird way I kind of if he does own it like that I do respect that slightly more cuz it it is worse in my opinion you like no no I don't and then you just do it anyways okay so if he owned it like that's still bad I agree with you that hypocrisy makes any crime worse yeah I'm not saying it's a good thing yeah yeah but I do agree with you yeah hypocrisy makes any transgression
much much worse but if he did watch this and was like yeah yep that's how we do it that's how we that's how we've crushed it since I founded this company and that's how we're going to keep crushing it we are you know one of the world's most valuable companies we have like one product okay they don't have one product but they have gpus and GPU accessories essentially right um that melanox acquisition man looking when I saw it I was like that seems pretty smart you know data center you know
communic I didn't know where they were going with huge that was so much bigger than I realized yeah  so when does Nvidia just like acquire AMD there's no way antitrust wise there's no way they could do it even sort of but like Nvidia plus AMD I feel like that's something that they super don't want to do oh no I I don't think they want to do it they don't they don't actually want to be a monopoly but I'm imagining what a what a Powerhouse that could be not that you know what maybe the x86 license just
doesn't matter anymore though cuz that's the kind of thing that you used to kind of like think about five years ago is like oh yeah man like what if n had an x86 license you had an x86 license cuz like how many years you got you think x86 has left on it did you see framework I'm so excited has a risk five board is it in the dock I'm actually not sure we can talk like want to buy one I think it's more exciting to me than like a switch is really it's so cool so so I I I asked framework because I like just
asking questions I know I'm not going to get an answer to uh I asked framework at computex if they had anything coming with the new Qualcomm chips because on the one hand it's obviously a turning point for the PC industry we're turning in some direction here and I I was and actually I continue to be pretty jazzed about it I'm there's going to be some there's some early growing pains for sure but I'm I'm legitimately excited about Windows on arm uh so I asked them I was like hey are you guys going to
have Qualcomm Snapdragon X chips um and they were like Hest you know I can't answer that and I was like all right um but what they especially didn't answer was that they were just like you know leap frogging going like oh man arm old news we're going to have our risk five board so sick we have a topic in the dock for this framework risk let do it now then at another risk 5 laptop too a company called Deep Computing is creating a framework laptop 13 mainboard powered by a star five JH
7110 risk 5 processor it's a developer focused product aimed at making tinkering with risk 5 more accessible still it's one of the first instances is of a consumer focused product built with the risk 5 which is why I in particular am excited which FYI is a fully open architecture so anyone can create their own processors without paying a fee so cool so cool but look there's another one too the siped lm4 a compute module is a small board with a t head th 1520 risk 5 processor I still like it better
than qualcomm's naming scheme yeah these are both somehow  British oh no oh man um anyways you can get that that tead processor in there uh spiffing Brit in a computer uh that can be used to power various PC form factors like the lii book 4 a the discussion question is I lack any context necessary to understand the capabilities of these processors but I'm sure they're pretty neat it's very cool that they're showing up in consumer products that is really cool and I'm way more excited about them now that I've
seen the accelerated uh trajectory of uh emulation yeah so yeah risk obviously risk five is is is not as simple as just taking your x86 code or your arm code and just you know plopping it on there especially things as complex as operating systems and games um it's it's going to be it's going to be slow but if we look at the at the accelerating rate of change so the the like accelerating acceleration or whatever whatever the point is that no no that makes accelerating rate of change yeah no I
know it makes sense but it's just like yeah yeah yeah if we look at the the the accelerating rate of change in in development of emulation and in the in the portability of software by by portability I mean from   for think about it yeah I think I see it it's weird it's a weird thing to think about but if it wasn't for the iPhone would we have ever gotten a big B enough platform that real developers like big developers would have made team viewer and Adobe Adobe Creative apps and and
and all these things even even like being I mean you can SSH into service from your phone would there have well I mean you could do that you could do that on you know a Blackberry or whatever but the difference but the difference is that what Apple built was momentum they built and install base that led to very significant development being done for arm U that led to very significant work being done on porting applications from x86 to arm um so obviously this is not a solo
effort thing but if we were going to look at sort of a if we were trying to find a turning point you know back to back to turning points again man the  freaking incredible um and so and so looking at how long that transition took until we went oh yeah these These Arm chips are great why don't we just you know put them in a laptop and looking at you know how far away we are probably from someone being like Oh well if it's great in a laptop why don't we just throw it in a small form factor desktop
and then I think you can kind of see where we're going from there right um looking at how long that took and then looking at the momentum risk five has right now you know we got a game Run on like a random risk motherboard with like an AMD GPU in it running Linux right Tanner got like trucker simulator running or something like that so sick and it looked like butt who cares was terrible it's so cool but the fact that it ran yeah this is this it's happening right now man it's it's it's exciting um and I
think it's super cool that framework investment disclosure not that I haven't talked about it plenty on the show so far today I think it's super cool that framework is ending up you know in as part as part of this transition I mean they didn't make the board themselves but like they're they're a platform I guess I guess if you want to make they're an enabler if you were going to make a motherboard thinking oh yeah I needed I need a mother I'm going to make a I'm going to make a laptop motherboard
and I want there to be some hope that there's an install base for people to put it in yeah who else but framework yeah I didn't even maybe I did think of that but it's not something I've thought about in a long time the idea of third parties creating motherboards for  laptops I wonder how hard it would be to do this is interesting you know that like uh you know someone like an Asus or like Zotac or whatever you know they do board designs like all the time for gpus that just never make it to Market
because Nvidia won't Greenlight it or you know whatever else um I wonder how hard it would be to make like a like a 4060 mobile GPU like to just get one made like if I just bought a 4060 like desktop card or if I bought a a lap like a 4060 laptop like I actually Wonder obviously I couldn't do it myself you need like design docks and stuff like that but I wonder if I could find someone who would stealth there's no way it would be affordable but that would be a banger video how
crazy would that be if I was like there is no reason Nvidia couldn't make a framework GPU and we like went to someone and like quietly made one and we're just like like look I I'm sworn to secrecy I won't I won't tell Nvidia who made it for me I wonder if you could work with strange Parts um probably probably we wouldn't need to not not that not that I wouldn't be down love Scotty yeah but the way to get it done would probably just be to go to a partner directly and we we know the major board
guys like it should be fine that'd be so cool that'd be pretty sick uh Noki says I mean it is possible yeah exactly most of the board is just a bunch of power regulators and mini caps and resistors yeah we know it's we we know it's possible like yeah oh oh 100 100% possible it's just you know not exactly within our capabilities I'm assuming at least who knows days it's not yeah we got some we got some fancy people here though oh kingpin's apparently at p and Y now yeah oh wow
okay speaking of people who know a lot about board design cool all right what's up what's up next let's see you could do more topics we got some time for sponsors oh we should do sponsors yes let's do sponsors let do sponsors the show is brought to you today by Squarespace have you been trying to have you been trying to Bob Ross your business's website but it just ends up looking like a fishing site Dan's Bakery click to view $75 is that a potato or bread I really can't tell it's

prep things but uh yeah I think the I think the sponsor talking points did not get the usual once over got some merch messages for you sure hit me Dan actually this one's for Luke not you oh fine hello w. DL question for Luke any fun stories from op sauce get a chance to meet up with nerd Forge or other creators I drive by the Cow Palace every day but sadly couldn't make it myself Cow Palace was cool that was a good venue for it uh I did meet up with nerd Forge they were
awesome I had never met them before so cool I wasn't in office when they did the thing so cool very cool people was very happy I got to meet up with them I got to meet up with a bunch of other creators as well which was fantastic um probably the coolest individual moment did you see the yard boys yeah I got to meet them for the first time too which was cool um the the coolest moment was when Adam Savage said his thing um when he saw the screwdriver the stubby so we brought the like three
well we uh Sebastian and tinan brought the the 3x stubby oh they're from the Creator Warehouse engineering team yeah and uh Adam Savage was very happy to see it which was yeah Sebastian was telling me he's like it was it was pretty cool just like no you didn't yeah and no you didn't yeah it's cool there's a whole circle of people and he spotted it like through the circle and then and then got all excited apparently he loves the screwdriver which I'm finding out for the first first time which is super cool
yeah yeah massive very much so massive kudos to the team yeah I I I was thinking like okay it's because my understanding of why like I form lines at LTX is just really hardcore fans go to LTX and really hardcore fans watch wow I don't really show up in much other content and haven't for years no but there also are old like kind of Evergreen videos with you that have millions and millions of views and there some residual like oh yeah that guy I went to open sace and was like I'm
going to do a couple panels and it'll be cool to like go see the show no one's really going to know who I am I made it one booth onto the floor and had a line for three and a half hours then someone had to pull me out of it so I could go to a panel and then that happened again nice I got to see two booths because it was the first Booth I saw one time and then the first Booth I saw another time and then rest of the show was the thing is like it that crowd though right like
lowkey you and your team run one of the I mean maybe not you know maybe not top 10 but certainly top 100 like video platforms like on the internet float plane there was a surprising amount of people that when you know you like maybe ask a couple questions and stuff when you say hi that we talking about like the engineering behind float plane yeah which is interesting I don't mean by necessarily yeah I don't I don't necessarily mean by you know number of creators on it CU we aren't top anything
for that we we only have a small handful on there but in terms of bandwidth served um it's actually decently high flow plane is like a decent Siz platform um and and you're you and your team are like what 10 people at this point barely on float plane a lot less than that oh yeah that's that's true the ones that actually are dedicated to float plane it's more like five so yeah yeah and one of them is only like halftime so yeah I mean that's that's something that this crowd would think is super cool yeah we
had a lot of conversations about that too I had a couple people that guessed how many people were on the team and they were like like 10x the amount that it actually is um it's a super good it's an awesome team it was a very very cool event um the speaking of the panels are the recordings anywhere I think so actually I think you might have to pay to access them I'm not sure um but yeah the William Osman and his team did a fantastic job as far as I know this is only the second one and it doesn't show
you'd have no idea this was the second one it feels like a fairly mature show we should have them do our shows maybe there was there was some takeaways in regards like if we do another LTX again there's things that they did that were really good there's also things about LTX that I think might have been a little bit better um there was there was positives and negatives all over the place but Open sauce was a really really cool event not only did they have the main stage and the secondary stage so
they had a lot of panels that you'd be able to go to but the the Creator Museum was such a cool idea where like I'm I'm sure someone on the team organizing the event understands that a lot of the people that would be interested in going to that event are creators and makers of some form whether they are creators and makers that post YouTube videos or not who knows but they're creators and makers so they had this idea of the Creator Museum you could bring pieces to just show people um and I I believe the
Creator Museum was not a paid placement thing that's super cool it's like I just have something neat I want people to be able to see it you could just have a little area um and they had tons of stuff in there that was super interesting that I didn't really get to see but I heard through the grap find there was super interesting things uh  rice so it used it used like a a camera to track the shrimp around a fake submerged little kitchen and then it would like uh I think recreate the
movement in like a a walk thingy that's frying the like just hilarious maker stuff um I I yeah I don't know really cool event tons of really cool things to see if you follow maker creators uh or Tech creators or whatever on YouTube a lot of their stuff was there MH people would bring like these cool projects that they spent like months making and they would just bring it and you can you can touch it and use it and in some cases like ride around on it cuz there was like rideables that people had just
made so cool super super cool really really cool event so I don't know if you're interested go next year it's fantastic hopefully I'll be there and I'm trying to convince some more people on the team to come down so yeah I'm taking vacation next year nice I'm definitely going it was really you would really like it I I've been following basically everyone there for forever amazing it was great um next up this is a question I've been getting a lot actually do you plan bringing back the
older older water bottle colors which previously existed uh I have no idea I'm going to be honest with you I don't really know why we don't have any water bottles in stock I think it was a whole like we were trying to we were trying to get our stocking strategy sort of figured out and then we like didn't Place orders for a bit and then maybe fulfillment was slow I actually have no idea what going on with water bottles you might have to  some just reducing some of the colors do
we yes we have some oh wow we have very few colors yeah I believe colors down but we have the classic we have the stealth we have the black and gold we have the black white and black and then we're sold out on the Atlantic blue okay but we used to have like a ton of colors whack ton of colors do we also just buy one of the capacitor ones these ones are so fun these don't sell like they do but like at a trickle the capacitor it's a it's a big capacitor it looks like a big giant
capacitor on your desk how do you not love it anyway uh oh do we have any like store news or anything like that oh yeah there's something under your desk oh my God we're finally launching this how did I not talk about this in like the first 5 minutes of the show it's under your desk are you taking it home I already have one that makes sense cuz of course I do I'm getting a cat on Monday oh you are yeah oh congrats right you're like yeah yeah I remember that okay yeah vag and ambig I just I don't know I
want to say it's vagan ambiguous don't continue yeah exactly yeah that's fine we're good it's fine just fine yeah this is it the Retro monitor pet [Applause] cave how cute is it look how cute it is it's a little CRT monitor that's a a little cat or dog bed and uh and Lloyd made it look like a little monitor look it has it has little ports and it has a little has a little z13 power connector and I forget what this barcode does yeah can you scan that probably Rick rolls you I don't know uh and then on the
inside it's it's static oh it's static fuzz and it's got a little dial interface that's pretty good it's a little CRT Monitor and oh oh and and looks very comfy and thoughtfully designed as always oh smart so the pillow is removable in case you your cat you know is it looks like a like a Minecraft shirt incontinent um and also this side okay okay hold on touch it no no not with your hand what no no no face oh with with with his hand uh okay yeah yeah yeah go go go ahe go ahead and go
ahead and touch it yeah is it soft that is soft it's soft okay okay now touch this side that is less soft yeah okay but I feel like if I but that's by Design deposited liquid on it it would go well well no no no no it's not waterproof but what it is is um is less hair uh ah nice okay so depending on like what type of cat have you might want to flip it yeah so you can flip it depending on what's better for kind of your situation and it has a convenient zipper to pull out the pillow and you
can you can wash this separately or you know if it comes down to it you could just restu it with you know something else if uh which it it might which which might happen um it has little uh little grippy dots  bottom kind of try and catch the Light here yeah it has little grippy dots on the bottom so it won't you know accidentally scoot around and you know why this took so long packing figuring out how to fold it down this is you collapse it yeah it comes collapsed so this is what it looks like
right when you pop it out and if you want you can steam it and you can get it like looking real clean but the initial packing solution from these guys it would come out looking just terrible and we wanted the unboxing experience to be a lot better so figuring out how to nail  was everything everything takes us like  obsessive how sturdy is the top oh guys it's it's it's it's like collapsible like a cat is not sitting on the top it's it's for going inside they'd probably enjoy jumping on it and getting
enveloped Maybe not maybe not the first time yeah definitely not the first time um anyway it's $49.99 hey my birds could stand on it and it wouldn't collapse and I guess I covered all the other talking points on my own uh get your pet off your PC set up and into their own is apparently our our tagline for this thing let's go ahead and how cute is that picture that is ridiculously cute a I love it there you go so we'll go through the product pictures retro monitor pet cave our pictures are getting a lot
better yes it's nice great job great job team oh my god get in there so cute H oh look at that we got all the man our our photo game is getting so much better dude yeah so much better why aren't there more cute cat  though okay sorry sorry sorry sorry I think there's oh oh oh interesting this is so more news yeah this is not LTT store related but we are doing a garage sale for the first time in nine years eight years can I go buy stuff I don't see why not uh July 6th from 10:00 a.m. to 2 p.m. at the LT Labs
building we have 400 plus items we have keyboards mice headset speakers computer components LTT store.com items will not be available for purchase we do not have inventory of that here this is just a garage sale of just random stuff we need to get rid of um you must park on the street somewhere or Uber or something we don't have parking for you so you'll have to go on Google Maps and the parking on the street is rough it's terrible be prepared to walk be prepared to hike yes um and it is credit debit
only we are not going to be taking cash so there you go guys garage sale uh it's coming July 6th um yeah I guess I guess staff can buy stuff it's it's probably going to be like reverse auction style kind of like we did it last time so you know how an auction you start low and just go up high so this in this case I think we'll probably start with I'll probably I'm probably going to be like running a lot of it and I'll just be like I don't know I think this is worth 20 bucks oh I can
also just do that if you want um 12 who wants it what would be kind of funny is I I could help you run that and then if prices of certain things get low enough I'll just be like well I'll take it just leave your credit card with Ivon yeah swipe it I've putting this one in the [Laughter] back all right that's fun uh people are asking is it worth flying here I I no I mean no the the amount you're going to spend on the plane ticket yeah is going to make the discount on the items yeah
just buy yourself a stick of ram yeah like you're good you're good you're good buddy that's not how you Bargain shop yeah let me fly somewhere and get a  car okay I mean you know people like do travel for shopping sometimes yeah but not for like that I'm just saying I'm just saying it's totally a thing I I I don't know I get a kick out of it when people are buying like commodity stuff they're like oh yeah I'm buying jewelry I'm like the price of gold is the same everywhere in the world what are you
what are you talking about yeah any who yeah all right I got a couple more for you here unless you want to save them for later up to you yeah let's save them for later I think sounds good I think we might sell a few retr monitor pet caves now uh yeah yeah they were not registering on the most popular item list and now they are number three soon to be number two with the way that things are going so uh let's go retro monitor pet cave let's go uh all right topic what do you want to do our our I
think our last title topic main topic call out topic whatever SoftBank developing realtime emotion cancelling Tech okay this is the smartest use of AI that I have seen yet yeah I think people are going to work around it but but yeah actually how will they work around it uh we'll I'll get to that all right Japanese well only sort of working around it uh Japanese Tech Giant soft bank has announced it is working on emotion cancelling AI technology that alters the tone and pitch of angry
customers in real time making them s found calmer when they call customer service Representatives the project is designed to protect workers from customer harassment a press a pressing issue in many places but one that's referred to specifically in Japan as kasu Hara which just sounds like customer harassment but not English uh but it doesn't change the words being spoken and for service reps being told to deescalate angry customers not getting the full context of what's being
said might make that job harder one redditor argues this is treating a symptom rather than the cause likening it to foxcon factory to a foxcon factory in China responding to distraught workers throwing themselves out of Windows by surrounding the building with Nets back in 2017 I don't think it's that I think that's a pretty drastic comparison I I I don't agree with that comparison at all I think that some people are just jerks Y and if if you could just if you could just make a customer service agent's day
a little bit less unpleasant that sounds great I don't think you're going to be missing I don't think you're going to be missing any context you would need oh no I'm I'm worried the only thing I'm worried about is that if this if the knowledge of this thing existing becomes widespread people are going to become more colorful with their language to compensate I I doubt it yeah I think especially when people are angry they're going to talk in in if anything a more natural way they start start getting
into like almost autopilot range mode yeah like I no I actually strongly disagree I think that this is a win I think that oh no I think it's a good thing I'm just worried people are going to try to work around it and use worse language but overall I think it's a good thing yeah I I don't think people I I don't think the average person calling a customer support line and yelling at someone is going to be that smart like coherent enough to do that I I I have this theory that a lot of anger is
actually not anger it's just misunderstanding I think that if we if we understood a situation there are many times when it wouldn't be as necessary to be angry about it think about the average customer support ticket though Luke I'm not talking about being angry okay about about inquality in the realm of customer support okay I mean just the just the kind of like the stuff I've had to see Joe deal with exactly exactly right and to be clear the vast majority of tickets he deals
with are fine there's just every once in a while stuff that's just like what is going on EX so so if we think about when I talk about anger I don't mean I don't mean like a deep a deeply held belief in In fairness that the world is not you know living up to that's that's not what I'm talking about I'm talking about  my phone's you glass is broken maybe if I didn't do that to it you know my glass might not be broken right he actually huged it at the ground phonies um that was that was real like
I'm I'm talking about I'm talking about that kind of of just like irrational anger right where where where realistically if you if you stopped and and slowed down and thought okay what is the cause of this situation I'm finding myself in it might be that I'm not careful MH it might be that I need to do a little bit of introspection or I also think a lot of the time that if if you're calling in and raging at customer support which is not okay for a variety of reasons I'm sort of almost hoping that a
lot of your the rest of your day was like really bad and it's just being yeah this is like a a venting situation which is not how you should do that but like yeah so so anyway I think yeah exactly I think a lot of I think a lot of anger is just being um kind of dumb or or like emotionally what about when you're yelling at the YouTube people on the phone then which YouTube people haven't you done that before yell at them yeah or wa write angry emails I guess I mean I've certainly written I rate emails
but a lot of the time the thing that I am the thing that I am frustrated by is pretty justifiable okay like so when you write I rate emails it's not here well do you want oh absolutely oh I I never said I'm not dumb sometimes okay I wear that oh dude I wear that on my sleeve I'm not perfect yeah yeah I'm not perfect um but I think there's a big difference between the kind of temper tantrums that this is designed to mitigate versus like writing an email um so so I so I don't think it
changes the point that like that sort of just you know not understanding cuz a lot of the time what people are mad about is they like they don't understand that paying for express shipping doesn't mean that someone was standing there like looking at the at the incoming orders and being like okay there it is throwing it in a box at 3 in the morning on a Saturday right it just means that once we hand it to the shipper it will go that leg of the journey faster right we would run into that at NCIX all the
time people be like express shipping says 2 to 4 days it's been 5 days we're like you place sir sir sir sir sir you place it at 11:59 on Friday yeah okay we sir sir sir we don't work we sir sir sir I'm GNA have to ask you sir please calm down right oh here's a question do you think it's going to run all the time or do you think it's going to detect oh I think it would almost certainly detect because I think if it ran all the time that would kind of suck cuz if you're just listening to like
monotone robot voice no I literally all day if if it works well it would detect when and then kick in y and people are saying like people will change their their language to be more colorful to make their point I think there's no reason it couldn't detect that too oh sure yeah just like it says it's not going to change the oh it could bleep though it could bleep swear wordss sure why not yeah I mean I think this will this will create like almost more fun water cooler talk I I think it would be
pretty entertaining to be the team in charge of creating the list of words and phrases that are going to be bleep like man I'm so so wow that's really interesting we're allowed to discuss this right now I I I just I love the water cooler talk idea of just like man I had the  off oh I love that um pretty sure there's already a good dictionary for that says Omega total yeah urbandictionary.com everyone knows  man man I had I had a Zoomer say sweet to me the other day is that coming back I don't think so
I think it's just his like second or third language probably learned to speak English from Millennials y 2K fashion is coming back but it just like it blew my mind cuz I was like I'll pick I'll pick you up in front of the building and they were like sweet sweet I like sweet aren't you like 10 12 years younger than me what I I have you seen that uh Y2K fashion yeah so there YK fashion again fashion from the year 2000 oh when you say Y2K I assume you mean like the Y 2K bug oh okay that makes sense um but
nobody called the year nobody refers to the year 2 as y 2K that's fair come on um 2000's fashion then okay there's like I don't know what it was on cuz Emma showed me I know lowrise jeans are back probably Instagram or something um but there's this there's this girl talking to her mom about modern fashion trends and she mentions y 2K fashion and her mom's like wait what is that and she's like oh you wouldn't know it's  new and you you can tell like it definitely wasn't a staged video um cuz
cuz the daughters like mildly annoyed at the conversation cuz she's like oh my goodness like you wouldn't you wouldn't know you know what's hilarious is Fashion's always been cyclical to a degree I thought it wouldn't be anymore because the internet but look but hold on but hold on look at how the cycle of everything is speeding up speed the new cycle is faster the meme cycle is faster is the fashion cycle so fast now that instead of coming back around to you know what was cool right before or after
your mom you're actually coming right back around to like what was cool when your mom was cool at the same age whoops yeah I mean it seems like it cuz that that seems weird to me there was some stuff that was pretty dumb in the early 2000 remember those jeans that didn't have the seam down the middle yeah those were horrible those were dumb there was there was some pretty dumb stuff but overall if everyone just kind of dressed like the early 2000s again I'd be down me too I also heard that
people are partying to blink182 music and stuff dude all of I'm like super down with all I think I think I've had this conversation with you already about how like new music is really struggling because of streaming and algorithms and just kind of and and the the the Aging libraries of established artists are being sucked up by like yes VC Capital VC Capital backed just like holding firms and like pretty much the value of old music for the first time ever is greater than the
value of new music like I put on I put on just popular music on some random streaming platform and it just plays stuff that I'm like whereas when I listen to stuff that my mom and dad listened to I'm like that's very different yeah um but as soon as everything just went computerized well okay yeah we're just playing around with new ideas of what we can do with a computer essentially and I know the obviously there's going to be Niche genres that are different or whatever but at the end
of the day a lot of the a lot of the popular music is still going to be like you've seen that bit I forget what the guys are called but the every so every popular song is like three chords or whatever yeah yeah it's funny but yeah and that's that's not going to stop being a thing because there's actual physiological reasons for it like the the resonance and like of those cords like feels good in your body and stuff like it's a it's a whole thing um so it's not going it's not going away but
um yeah I was at a I was at a dance recital for one of one of my progyny and the main the main act from like the the senior kids was a dance off between M&amp;M's and M&amp;M's um so they they they played a variety of like and when I say &amp;m music I don't mean anything he's done semi- recently I mean like hi my name is really what my name is like like like old like 1999 1998 emm music wow and then uh they had the other team of dancers um being like I want candy so they were
M&amp;M's and M&amp;M's and they did kind of like a like a dance battle between it was it was pretty cute um anyway I'm  going why why is this this doesn't make any sense it does seem kind of weird right like I don't know I had a I had a theory very temporarily that people were partying to blink182 so that the like uh Millennials next door wouldn't get mad but I don't know I mean I'd Rock up to Blink 182 apparently Simple Plan like just never got uncool like really Emily
s and I were bonding over like loving simple plan on the way back from our trip to see the steam deck cuz we I forget why but we ended up having to drive um and we ended up stuck in the car for you know 3 and a half hours or something like that um I don't know that they like still still are I was just trying to see if they still release music we both we like super into simple plan in high school and I'm like dude we are not close enough in age to be into the same stuff in high school
she's also a Gilmore Girls fan which also ended way before but Simple Plan didn't end like she was listening to new simple plan in high school and so was I so she didn't even know a lot of their old songs and I'm like dude dude and she's like dude this is great they have a they have a song from eight months ago that has a million views that's not like insane for music these days on YouTube nope but it's not it's still a million views yep for a band that's been going this long that's like pretty good and
they make their money touring anyway like like any small a lot of their videos are touring videos for sure like any small band like I I I saw them live at the Croatian Cultural Center yeah to give you some idea um it was awesome super intimate venue nowhere to sit I prefer those by a lot it was great I saw them again I saw them again at the Pacific Coliseum and it was fine yeah not as good but like Croatian Cultural Center dude it was awesome I I I actually just think I might be over going to Big
concerts so I agree but I I am I am agreeing with you even more em and I went to go see the stardew valley concert wait Simple Plan is opening for ail she was in town I was like I found out the day before the show and I was like f you want to like go cuz she's got a bunch of AAL in her playlist right now and she was like I don't know maybe maybe not and I was like okay yeah sure forget Simple Plan if I knew Simple Plan was there too I think that might have pushed me over the edge sorry go ahead
uh uh right yeah em and I went to the the stardew valley concert and it was in a very surprisingly small venue I guarantee you they could have booked one significantly larger and still sold out uh because they sold out like fast but it was great it was awesome and a big part of the reason why it was awesome was because it wasn't huge I saw the Bare Naked Ladies um at a WWF not World Wrestling Federation World Wildlife Fund um at a WWF benefit concert in like a small one of the like
small Vancouver theaters so it was like 400 500 people or something like that mindblowing so good and then I saw them again at like GM place or whatever that arena is called now and it was like I can kind of I can kind of make out like uh the weird guy who ended up being like coked out doing his weird like kick dance or whatever like I don't know it wasn't wasn't that great and thank you Duke of Gondor I agree my conu shirt is sick um my my sister made it for me she had kind of a thing where she would um
she would go to thrift stores and buy unloved things that had something wrong with them and then she would combine them into something that someone would love and uh she actually made me a couple of so you can see it's uh hand stitched kind of poorly cuz she was just like I don't know whatever uh realistically it looks like it looks like it was meant to look that way yeah realistically any any amount of remaining life in this is more than it had before uh so she actually made me a
couple of these uh one was this cuz she was just like yeah I don't know you like the Canucks cuz I was pretty into I was pretty into the Canucks back then and it was hard to buy merch with the old logo and I liked the old logo more the old logo is sick and um skate very CL she did me another one that was uh she found a marine land shirt you know that aquarium water uh exhibition like that Park that was in Niagara Falls Ontario or maybe is still there so she and I did a cross country trip with my mom when I
got my driver's license and um oh you drove yeah kind the day I got my license you across the country yeah nice um and and my sister went too because she got her license at the same time as me actually even though she was older and so the three of us went across the country um one heck of a way to learn  worries want me to cover something or you good anyway no I'm good okay um so one of the places that I wanted to go was Marin land and the only reason I wanted to go there it was like my one
request okay so my mom wanted to go to Halifax and eat Atlantic Lobster okay I yeah we're going across the country but we're not going to eat Atlantic Lobster good goal absolutely um and my thing was I wanted to go to Marin land and the only reason that I cared um it was that they had this super catchy jingle on TV when I was a little kid it worked the marketing was effective yeah so they just had this like this uh this catch this catchphrase in the jingle everyone loves Marine yeah I
remember it you know the one niagar niag think Marland is the place to go seeing friends you miss a great big kiss everyone loves Marland yeah so so that's the only reason I cared that was so well done um oh my goodness so yeah it's an ear it's an ear uh what What's it's an ear worm for sure uh so anyway um we didn't get to Marin land because my my birthday and the start of the school year lined up in such a way that our trip was pretty short yeah and we made the difficult call to not go down into the
into Canada's penis and uh and visit Niagara Falls um kind of true yeah and get  anyway I mean they definitely put more of their culture in us than we do in them so yeah yeah um any any who we didn't make it so so many years later she came across a random marine land t-shirt and so she she cut it out for me and made me she also made me a marine land shirt and the reason I don't have that one on today is that I um I actually wore it so much like it was this obnoxious bright orange T-shirt
with like a sort of poorly cut out and that was kind of the vibe yeah like it was kind of her Jam right was that it didn't look it didn't look like it was supposed to be like that but it looks like it was done on purpose that's that like I I it feels like a design so I just had this random marine land logo on the shirt and um and that's the story I forget why I'm even I oh I foret am I even talking about this story oh yeah someone said they liked my conu shirt thank you very much so that's the
memorial I'm attending today yeah yeah um AMD publishes bad benchmarks sure AMD released benchmarks for their New Zen 3 chips the 5800 XT and the 5900 XT apparently bin versions of the 5800 X and the 5950 X which claim that gaming performance is on par or better than Intel's 13th gen I5 13 600 KF and the i7 13700 K respectively they achieved these misleading results by pairing each CPU with a three-year-old entrylevel GPU the Radeon RX 6600 which effectively neutralizes the performance
difference of each CPU by heavily GPU limiting their tests Hardware unbox called out the bogus benchmarks and published results of their own tests using both this RX 6600 and the RX 7900 XT which showed significant differences in the performance of the various CPUs when performance uh when GPU limitations were less of a factor and the discussion question is is amd's marketing lying about the performance of their CPUs or simply setting up a scenario that points uh paints their Hardware in the best
possible light does it matter I mean it matters um it matters but it also is why we have Independent Media and why we we need to take the funny thing to me about this one is that AMD doesn't like have to do this yeah they're doing really well in the CPU game right now and I it's it's so seems like an unnecessary risk back to my qualcom meeting it's um you know when someone's coming in from a position of strength um like they are you know with their battery life claims and all of
that hey go to sleep it's very rare it's very rare that they they are the ones that are are fudging you know like Nvidia was in such a dominant position for so long that they started actually creating tools like their pecat which completely changed the game for power monitoring for gpus their FCAT which completely changed the game for monitoring uh frame times um they they came out with these tools and equipped Independent Media to better validate that their solution was way better and
that was in their best interest so so normally when you're in a position of strength you're the one who is like working hard to make sure that independent media coverage correctly identifies how much butt you're kicking yeah right it's very unusual for the leader to come in and just fool around like this and this is one of those ones that I kind of look at and I go there's no way that the technical people liked this like I I've met plenty of people at AMD over the years uh
there's no way the technical anyone liked this I don't even think that this is particularly aligned with amd's overall Behavior as a company so I have a hard time believing that top brass thought this was okay this seems like one of those slipped through this seems like one of those middle layer things where someone in a with a with decision-making power of some sort was like some bonus structure they were trying to hit something maybe they're trying to they're really trying to sell
a bunch of these chips for some reason and pushed this through and AMD needs to go back internally and figure out what happened here and make sure it doesn't happen again yeah no this is this is over the line for me for sure this is past this is beyond presenting your product in the best light and this is this is into misleading territory this does look like I I just found the actual chart uh do you want to go to my screen I know why it doesn't I still have a  suspicious what all results are up too yeah
yeah it's pretty suspicious they have other charts as well uh I don't remember exactly where they are there we go which also feel what pretty  chart all results are up to Again by the way yeah sure all right 100% of what uh the 13600 whatever KF y yep all right what else we got oh DJI drones oh is it oh it's it's it's Wan after dark but it's not late so what are we calling it when afternoon but it's not afternoon yet we can do topics for 6 minutes let's do that all right okay the US House of
Representatives approves a bill that could ban the sale into use of DJI drones wow I didn't know that second part not just the sale you can't even use them oh the countering CCP drones Act passed the house as part of the 2025 National Defense budget and that will place DJI on the fcc's covered list Banning them from sale to any entity receiving Federal funding oh okay the features that sparked concerns of spying from us Regulators were first implemented by DJI because of us
regulators and government pressure it's uncertain whether the FCC would also ban DJI drones from using regulated Wireless frequencies should they do so DJI would effectively be blocked from operating in the US and existing drones could be grounded wow uh discussion question here is at what point are American Regulators shooting themselves in the foot there is no us made alternative for consumers and DJI is like 80% of the Drone Market yeah neat they might be trying to
make one um if you if you've been paying attention to the the war in crine um there's a really crazy documentary out called um is it Darwin Darwin Ukraine yeah if you just YouTube Darwin and Ukraine you'll find a scrips news video which is a really crazy like mini dock on the Drone warfare that's going on over there um and there's really kind of wild things happening as well to the up armoring that's happening to tanks and other various armored vehicles to defend themselves from netting hanging
off of them and stuff like that and just like extra plates that are offset from the tank it's like there's all this crazy stuff going on um so owning drone manufacturing and um having that supply chain in your own country might actually be something the US wants and this might be one of the ways that they try to strong arm it is like open up a big Market segment so that some us company can come up and start making stuff right I don't know that's some pretty uh I'm stretching the theory there a
little bit but I wouldn't be too surprised just looking at the things going on it's not the craziest thing I've heard yeah uh more random stuff what do you want to do gaming Roundup where's that yeah David threw this in Nintendo Direct Legend of Zelda Echoes of wisdom is the first Legend of Zelda game where Zelda is the protagonist except it's the third time she was the main character in two different CDI games that Nintendo's hoping we uh had forgotten about it looks similar in style to 2019 links
Awakening remake but differentiates itself with a Nifty Echo mechanic that allows you to make copies of certain objects that's cool pretty cool Metroid Prime 4 still exists we got to see the first gameplay Snippets it's coming to switch one but hard to believe that what we saw in the trailer is actually running on that Hardware so good luck everybody and there's a new Mario Party called Jamboree hopefully it doesn't suck seven boards with two returning Classics over 110 Mini games 20 player
online multiplayer in the cathon mode but will they still make you sit through a tutorial every time you play Only Time Will Tell probably lots of RPGs like Mario and Luigi brothership fantasian Dragon Quest 3 HD HD 2D remake and HD remasters of Donkey Kong Country Returns and Luigi's Mansion 2 in other gaming news get ready to be mad Todd Howard says he wants to make annual DLC for Starfield will Luke Play No got him the next line says maybe they should focus on making players happy first to
stop the recent review bombing due to monetizing mods yeah yeah yeah if you want to cyberpunk your game you need to make it good not just keep working on it uh Beyond Good and Evil is getting an HD remaster for its 20th anniversary and the original has been pulled from storefronts and the sequel is still never got released oh it's pretty funny uh okay okay the last news topic that we have here is banana last week we brought up banana a steam game that has now touched first
place on the steam charts for current active players in this game players click a banana to try to earn banana skins that can be sold on the steam Marketplace some had speculated early on that this game was a scam or some form of Market manipulation even more so once they found out that one of the devs these Lions had been involved with a steam Market Bitcoin cam /bg before Banana's co-owner aesthetic Spartan released a statement on their Discord server saying we did not know about this
until recent videos started to point this out and we had a talk almost immediately with the whole team about the situation what do you mean whole team the whole team uh we gave him the chance to explain the situation to us and we know he is showing remorse and is sorry about what happened in the past since then the banana team has parted ways with these Lions adding that his inventory was cleared out of out of bananas to help calm any concerns with the community discussion question banana has
said they assure you this isn't a scam and they do have big plans for content for this game in the future what do you think their plans could be you literally click a banana well I think it's more skins I think it's more skins and maybe peels but a man there was a pun there  clearly off my game today that was a good pun though you you just got it a little late yeah you really slipped on that one oh o that's a Bruiser oh oh no Megan stop I hate it here oh man okay I'm like
scared there's more coming um what like  puns oh oh um I think I think really if they wanted to do anything other than just add more skins which is probably all they're actually going to do the only real route forward is just Cookie Clicker it even more how do you Cookie Clicker something more just partially automate the game oh God make it so that you can buy like banana Farms make it go faster make it so the game only automates if you're willing to let your GPU mine crypto in
the backg around yeah yeah for them yeah but they'll give you skins yeah yeah banana coin yeah here we go they should they should make it so that uh the upgrades that increase the the automation rate instead of like in cookie clicker where you just like buy them with cookies in this game they should be tradable so you can buy them with dollars what do you call like a counterfeit   anymore oh uh all right I think it's time for afternoon which is what we're calling after dark today so I guess hold 
idea I think Luke is going bananas oh  no oh oh it's brighter oh wow oh wow hey look nice D thank you oh you added the flying stuff when did you do that that was Conrad we have flying toasters for this week and uh I believe we also have the new after dark afternoon sponsors okay I legitimately don't think we should use those because that there could be a copyright concern there explicitly said don't do you got to ask me before you do that um anyway I think it was actually Dan's
idea to turn up the lights for after oh no I think that was L that was me I played it off cuz it seemed more fun in the moment that you made it up on yourself yeah that's that's why I that's why I did that it just seemed it seemed like you know it whatever the point is Dan want to hit us with a merch message for oh that is really bright and uh the heater has come on or the cooler has come on as well I'm going to just take cu the light's like trying really hard something like that I guess oh I think
that's part no no I forbid it I want it at full brightness yeah done yeah it's just it's part of the vibe it's mid day it's hot out we need a fan yeah exactly yeah oh I forgot about the OLED safe going to move we can hear the fan yeah cuz it's it's afternoon yeah it's the sun that's what the sun sounds like 100% what's up LDL this one's specifically for Luke knowing that you played a lot of tarov and other firstperson Shooters have you tried body Cam and if so what are your thoughts on the game it looks
crazy have you you seen it I I saw the early previews and I saw that it's out now we've talked about it on when it looks wild I haven't had a chance to try it yet okay I'm try it this week maybe cuz I'm I'm excited to hear your thoughts on it as well I will I I will try it before next W I will I'll give you guys that because we we've talked about this on way a couple yeah just like he's going to finish Final Fantasy 6 yeah yeah just like that I this is the first weekend I will have been home for in a month
interesting so cuz I mean yeah you have to be home to you know play a what's practically a mobile game at this point sure kind of yeah sure kind of maybe if you weren't such a cheap then you would have a I don't know a steam deck or something that has made it more complicated up next yoyo yo. dll question for Luke again uh what technology have you used in your weight loss or fitness journey I want something for tracking my heart rate that isn't a watch to use my kettle bells this is going to make you
disappointed quite genuinely for a long time the extent of the technology that I used was a phone so that I could have airpods in listening to either podcast or music and quite literally a pen and paper um you really don't need much tracking your heart rate one of the fairly easy ways to sort of Do It um is if you have to breathe with your mouth open you're probably in zone two so you're doing good if if you can get by just breathing through your nose that's like not a super high heart rate generally um so
try to push it like a little bit more if you're trying to get like cardio out of that situation um and if if it gets to the point where you have to breathe through your mouth then you're you're pushing yourself a bit you're probably in zone two there are exceptions but for most people if what you're trying to do is get in better shape then whatever time you spent earning money to buy whatever Gadget you spent time shopping for you should have just been you worked out Y and there's ways that are
super simple like if if you're very not in shape go for a walk not even a like highspeed walk just get outside and move and it'll be a million miles better than what you were doing before um there's there's another one where like if speed is an issue like if there's issues with with I don't know something and going fast is a is a problem so the walking is good and you're trying to up it but but jogging is like an issue for some reason you can crank the uh the angle of a
treadmill in the gym and then stay at a walking speed but have an increased angle and it's way harder and it will it'll crank your heart rate up uh it'll use muscles in your legs quite heavily you can you can just walk at like 3 kmers an hour on a treadmill but have the angle be really high and it'll be difficult for you um but yeah honestly I didn't use much I didn't use a heart rate monitor I didn't use uh any anything really way too fancy I just got out and did stuff and saw results and
was happy lonus you once mentioned cats being like lightning in a bottle can you please elaborate also howdy Luke well think about it this way lightning very dangerous lightning in a bottle not very dangerous like you know those little like plasma globes that they have at you know little like science exhibit I think you could like just buy them on at like dollar stores now and stuff like that um so what I what I like is very very dangerous stuff but like cute sized and so to
me cats are basically that they are such a honed killing machine like the the I I love them I think I think they're beautiful everything about them is is designed to as efficiently as possible um remove the entrails of anything that they decide to remove the entrails of they are apex predators and the only reason that a house cat isn't is its size and so you know I like things that if I was much smaller so if I was this big that bottled lightning would be very dangerous and in the same way if I was
this tall my cat would would not be fun my cat would be terrifying oh yeah but because I'm much larger than it it just my snugly hello [Laughter] baby that's what I that's why I want a Main a good answer yeah I've always wanted an animal in my house that if I sleep in too long it'll just probably eat me the fear makes it fun funny hat says house cats are one of the most efficient Predators with an extremely high success rate small things don't let your house cat Outdoors unless you don't like
having birds in your neighborhood it's actually a problem yes decimated the population I've also I've got a message here that's not a merch message from James stri uh you know him yes uh wondering if you guys want to discuss this on the show oh what is the audience think of us playing homage to Corda crew VFX artist react thumbnails by copying their thumbnail style in our Tech experts react thumbs did we do that would that be perceived as homage or ripoff stealing I don't know I think
it's fine I don't I don't think Nico would care I think that's sort of how YouTube has sort of always worked yeah I don't know I I mean you guys let us know but I I I don't even think that's a question I think I already I think I thought I already told James just do it because our clickthrough is not great on that video but it's a great video and people love it so I just need more people to click on it yeah yeah as long as our color is different I don't think it really matters hi it's not like they
invented the concept of like people react to anything anyway in fact famous ly Fine Bros tried to trademark React videos at some point or like the react branding for videos and it failed miserably and everyone hated that so like no it's it's very much just a genre at this point in yeah don't do don't do the yellow outline yeah don't do a yellow outline cuz that's their that's their that's clearly theirs that that feels like brand identity stuff don't take that yeah hi DL would the Snapdragon X Elite
have been better received if it had been marketed as a low alternative rather than all of the hype of an x86 killer is this the Gen AMD wins mobile um I don't think that well I mean it depends because amd's success in Mobile comes more down to how much Fab capacity they've booked than the strength of their design they've had a stronger design for a couple of gens now and yeah just it's you you can't you can't build out an entire mobile product portfolio based on amd's mobile chips because they just don't
they don't have enough of them at some point you're just not going to get a shipment not everyone can do that all at once they can't just you quintuple or I forget what their market share is in Mobile but essentially they would have to like five plus X their their shipping output in order to just completely displace Intel whereas Intel has their own Fabs right so it's it's just not that simple um but in terms of like winning the the battery life and performance man like I've been using a
flow x13 for the last little bit and it just it just kills dude it's awesome and that's that's an AMD based that's an AMD based to design and if I didn't have that 47d GPU in it it would probably be even more efficient I oh that merch message got archived I was kind of referring back to it because my brain is slow no no it's fine it's all good um I think that I think that overhyping things is bad but I also don't know if if it was a tactical error on qualcomm's part because I think that the the
percentage of people that watch a Dave 2D video compared to the percentage of people that saw the hype machine um is probably much lower and I think overall the message is actually going to end up being correct for the majority of people who would buy a thinlight laptop so that's a that's a major thing to consider is that something can be true to one person and not necessarily true to another I could hand you a Chromebook and I could say this does anything that you would need to do with a computer
depending who I'm talking to that's either very true or very false or somewhere in between right and I think to the Qualcomm customer for this thin and light design what they're saying about being an x86 killer is very true I think that there are ways that they could have tempered expectations particularly on the gaming side yeah um the gaming well we'll see you once more Ben benmarks come out but yeah it feels like it's going that direction overall I'm still pretty optimistic and on the
gaming side we actually have a stream planned I believe we're going to be doing it next week where you guys are going to be telling us what games you want to see yeah so we'll be we'll probably be doing yeah like merch messages for people to let us know what game cool um and we'll just we'll just be trying stuff it's going to be yeah it's going to be fun I really like the whole like live benchmarks of a new thing concept I think we've been talking about that for years I think it's great
h w show uh afternoon is brought to you by PPN head to pav vpn.com Linus for a special deal we got a little QR code there so the number man the number of people that watch on their TVs just keeps going up so just yeah just point your phone do a QR code pretty wild hey I get it now yeah TV viewers why would I ever do that YouTube is like taking over the TV crazy it makes sense yeah living room strategy is like totally Shi huge for them right now yeah anyway wild you sign up for Pia
you forgot to use the code no you uh L xfn 724 you can you retroactively add it unsubscribe from Pia resubscribe with our code Pia is not going to like that no problem actually they're probably not going to care I don't think they even I don't think they even watch our spots yeah okay go ahead yeah yeah Hi D I work for an automotive OEM as a troubleshooting engineer since starting I have noticed how little some people know about areas outside their own are other areas in Tech uh like this oh yeah
oh yeah uh that's how the world works and the the big the where we really run into trouble is when people assume that other people know anything about their little bubble that they live in or care yeah that one's rough yeah yeah cuz the truth is I suspect you have a decent amount of problems with that actually yeah probably in the automotive industry there's probably a decent as a troubleshooting engineer don't care the number of people that want to hear about like oh man the number of people that
want to hear about you know this this like switch failure that you know you spent three months chasing down or whatever like I care I think that's super cool me too thank you for doing that work yeah I appreciate you but a  [Laughter] like next up okay let's see lldd when trading a phone in I always format then max out storage with Linux isos and then reformat uh been called paranoid but with the recent Apple issues this is an effective way to protect personal data well I don't know if that would help
with the recent Apple issue because I thought that was things getting restored from iCloud anyway so um no uh for flash storage to my knowledge if you do a secure eras which formatting a phone should do there is absolutely no reason to fill it up with Linux isos sounds fun though hello funny names here lonus have you noticed any changes in viewership in recent weeks I feel like my YouTube homepage has no clue what I actually want to see lately yes um YouTube's going to be up for a visit
uh very shortly and I plan to have some conversations with them uh about some of the trends that I've noticed recently where um it feels like they have an extremely extremely fast burn on new content where they'll put it up they'll promo it and if it doesn't go absolutely Mega Banger viral within a day they're just like you know what forget it and I'm having so in general that absolutely seems correct I'm not saying I disagree but they seem to have weird cases as well well we like I've had one
particular video that was suggested to me on the day that it launched and it is now 4 weeks old and it has suggested it to me every single time I've loaded YouTube since like what I'm clearly not clicking on this I'm choosing not to click on this every time that's tough why are you still serving to me so I'm also noticing so what I'm noticing is the curve instead of looking parabolic right and and approaching an Asm toote it goes up flattens and then in some cases very slowly like doesn't quite ASM
toote so some videos are still doing okay um but a lot of them are just um so so YouTube has this metric in the dashboard where they tell you out of your last 10 uploads what the one that you just uploaded is ranked and it updates it constantly because it has to be relative to the you know hour after relase right if it's only been up for an hour obviously it would be the worst out of the last 10 because they were uploaded you know anywhere from a week to 3 weeks ago and they've got lots more
views right so it's so it's relative to the original upload time and for the over the last couple of weeks since computex we have had many like not one or two or probably more than more than five I think yeah like many we've had many videos many examples of videos that have started out above the fold you know like as a top five and then flattened out and gone like bottom two bottom three yeah over and over and over and over again and um I don't know if it's related but do you remember that
video I showed you of that crazy underhand picture that I shared with you like a long time ago I think so where he's got this like yeah wild deliver and then he'll throw it behind his back and the batter never even knows he like Rel releas the ball like yeah okay I was trying to find that video to show chewy and I kept search you probably heard me like raging about this after softball yesterday CU I couldn't I couldn't find it I kept searching like underhand history weirdest picture like I I kept I
1920s 1930s like I was I I I I kept searching for every search term I could possibly think of to find this guy and it kept just giving me like MLB highlights or not not even like that modern like like a video from eight years ago but but 100% MLB no matter how many times I searched underhand softball softball it didn't matter it just kept talking about what's it called so there's overhand there's sidearm and then there's there's there's like a there's like a like an overhand pitch motion but like under or
something it's called something it it kept bringing up stuff about that I'm like I am looking for not that and no matter what I searched for it was bringing up like the same half dozen videos I was in a meeting with Taran yeah trying to find one of my like ancient like seven or eighty old videos as an example of something really quick yeah and we kept on talking about other things in the meeting I spent probably 20 25 minutes trying to find it I ended up getting the Search terms right and it
just wouldn't show it to me when I finally found it I had the title I was searching for the title of the video and it wouldn't bring it up but it would bring up it was all line ofcp stuff yeah but it was just all within like the last however many months it would not find like almost exact word for word title that I was searching so I've told them this before but in the in the early days of them responding to Tik Tok they um I think I felt they leaned too hard into immediacy the importance of immediacy
and I think doesn't feel like YouTube I think they've gone down that path again where it's like no YouTube is a repository YouTube is not about only what's been uploaded in the last little while that's not the point of it anyway uh for those of you who are wondering it's about a half hour video um I I think this is the one that I watched let me just see if I can find it um this might not yeah this might not be the one that I actually watched about him let me let me see if I can find it let me 
um anyway whoops look up Eddie fainer absolutely incredible I forget whose video on him is like really awesome it might be it might be this one from Tony something uh no someone did a whole history on him but he is the wildest pitcher that you've ever heard of if you don't care about baseball or softball at all doesn't matter um go go look it up you know what maybe I'll find the exact maybe I'll find the exact video the one video that's doing pretty well on him is from a couple of years ago it's called
why you've never heard of the best athlete ever um I don't know if this is the one that I watched that was so good though I actually no I don't think it is anyway oh someone's calling uh yeah please text me cool see you later all right what else we got lonus what is your preferred flavor of Halo C 2v2 4v4 or 8b8 do you have any strong opinions on spawn killing thanks so fun fact um I didn't have a lot of money and I didn't actually buy Halo C I played the demo which had one map Blood Gulch
the best one so it's okay and had one mode Capture the Flag the best one so it's okay so I just played Blood Gulch V8 Capture the Flag um until my my my wrist was raw from rubbing against my  go yeah hey on the subject of borrowing things sorry one sec is that coming through I have no idea maybe I can hear it but yeah we have a little bit of a different feed you going to go scream at them uh I just want to make sure that people don't like say stuff that shouldn't be on way you know okay cool
cuz it's they like lunch time that's true uh hey on the subject of borrowing things from the office what has been the most painful item that has gone missing from inventory oh the most painful by far was the um 8 gpus 8 gpus server um that went missing from  away the 8 gpus or eight C uh eight Gamers one CPU the like super micro multi-gpu server how do we how do we throw something like that away dude if I knew um I thought you were going to say the Pippen oh yeah that too I thought it was
called The Pigeon and then someone in chat said Pippen and I was like our at Mark Pippen went missing I don't know  sad especially because it was in like perfect condition man I I I still can't find the right Eddie fer video there's one that's like it's tough like HS of him like training on stuff it feels like we lost like an encyclopedia of of humanity to a certain degree cuz like there's there's old videos that are important that you like can't find anymore which isn't how it's supposed to
work it's bad it's bad I've also personally found that I'm actually like less motivated to watch YouTube things these days which seems bad for them so maybe they want to address that um because it will forcibly you know only give me the new things or randomly decide some video they're just going to recommend to me for a month straight without me clicking on it um is resulting in a lot less like rabbit H holding like my favorite thing to do on YouTube where I like find some
weird section of YouTube I haven't seen in a long time that's not happening as much cuz it's not suggesting me these like weird off-the-wall things that hasn't happened for a long time I Used to Love YouTube and now it's just even even one video that I've specific searched out it's now recommending me things that it thinks I want to watch instead of allowing me to to do that yeah like you have to click on a subtab that is uh about this topic and it's not always correct n don't like more icky yes uh
this one's for Luke are you done ff6 yet I've been playing it with my daughter we are going to finish it before you at this rate lonus thanks for the sweet merch uh products yeah I'm home this weekend I'm going to try to play it but now I got to play the now you got to play the other thing and then you also have to do that other thing as well so yeah never uh how would YouTube function with Linus's CEO this is great uh would people be mad at YouTube being public with lonus being transparent about
projects as opposed to the secret approach YouTube takes with experiments I just wouldn't be able to um I like I like legally they would have a lot of obligations um around secrety that I just wouldn't really be able to uh yeah that that I just I wouldn't I wouldn't be able to be transparent about I dll my city just adopted AI in its non-emergency 911 line to ease work of the 911 operators as they are underst staffed if it hears certain phrases or words it will transfer you to a human
thoughts uh uh really doesn't seem that great hey lonus how did you find C of stars I loved it my kids were really into it which was great now that fantasian has been allowed out of iOS jail are you going to pick it up again um no I'm not we talked about that earlier um what was the earlier part of that question uh SE of stars I thought SE of stars was good it was shallow um and I don't want any spoilers but I didn't like one of the directions they went  yeah hey D my pet bed comes in time
since moving in with my girlfriend to  perfectly oh good thanks for that Luke yucky uh question for lonus did you ever work on side projects that required money investment but wife didn't agree or trusted sure you're looking at one right now no no she she she AG oh man um no we we we we believe in getting aligned on things right so if we don't agree then we have to keep talking about it until we agree so either I'm working on the side project and she agrees or I'm not working on the side 
yeah what do you guys think of the treatment of AI as product versus a feature of a larger product it seems to me that AI forward projects are uh AI forward products are finally dying off and we can get back to real Tech man finally dying off is a strong statement to make while basically every startup is just trying to like be an AI startup and know we'll figure out what to do with it later yeah um no I think we're very much in the thick of that by the way I think the video I'm looking
for may just not be available anymore cuz I found someone that has a playlist of a bunch of like Eddie fer videos and um maybe it used like copyrighted footage or something but it was it was way better than all of these cuz it had like a ton of him just pitching just like like wild pitches it was not wild pitches like what it means in baseball where you like throw it way away from the base but like just these Wicked crazy pitches uh but yeah I suspect that maybe it's just been removed so that's
really unfortun because it was a really awesome video and there's just not enough about this guy he's super cool sup boys question for Mr LEF fronted I think you previously mentioned you played rugby if so uh did you enjoy it and what position did you play I did I played eighth man which uh I've heard I'm I don't really have the build for but I was I I definitely did well enough um my school was really bad uh but it was fun the the the people on the team were fun um we had like our whole maneuver was
this this guy named Jesse would get it as far up the field as he could and then he would pass to me and I would get it up as far on the field as I could and if that didn't make it pretty much the whole way we pretty much would not score a try that was like sort of how it worked but it was entertaining the team was really cool um I had a lot of fun and I enjoyed the sport I just you know we just weren't great but it is what it is and last one I've got for you here hi Dan Dan's boss and Dan's boss's boss
majority shareholder uh with that's a good one with most companies in the semi late stage capitalism blatantly disregarding consumer rights is legislation the only  yep yeah yeah that's it that's all I got I mean we could ask consumers to band together for our rights and boycott  comp good luck oh yeah that's hilarious uh all right well hey thank you guys very much for tuning in to the WAN show we will see you again next time um different bad time but the same bad channel channel yeah bye 
I'm so annoyed that I can't find this video I I I think it's gone and like I'm so annoyed that I can't tell if it's gone because I can't tell if um if this is just bad yeah
