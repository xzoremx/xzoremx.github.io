ah sometimes I just I get tired of the go go go lifestyle I just want to get comfortable put on an old hat grab some big league shw and mosy on down to Bratislava with a truck load of Widgets or should I say mosa on down since they paid the bills for this sick Trucking rig and I know what you're thinking Euro Truck Simulator really but at the time of filming this 12-year-old game was ranked number 26 on Steam by active player count and you know what I want to see what all the fuss is about so join me as
we trade our high octane gasoline for  road the R3 racing bundle from mosa is their first officially licensed Xbox set you get this aluminum steering wheel with a direct drive wheelbase steel gas and brake pedals and a desk clamp of course the main attraction for us is the ability to customize it both in software with their mobile and PC apps and in Hardware with their expansive ecosystem of sim goodies of course we can't really get to any of that until we have a base to build around and for that we've
chosen the GT Elite light wheel plate Edition from Next Level racing we wanted something that was easy to use reasonably lightweight but sturdy and adaptable it's made of aluminum Extrusion and just want to shout out next level racing who were like we got you fam when we asked them to send this over this is going to be a really good starting point for us some assembly is definitely required but at least we get to skip a couple of steps because we won't need the adjustable pedal Mount
that changes the angle here since we want a more upright flat trucker seating profile uh question for you guys is there a reason this is dirty as all heck uh yeah I was living in labs for a couple weeks while I was testing everything out and then between me using it and everyone else it kind of got a little dirty ah okay well that's a good sign when it's fun enough that it's not clean anymore for its big ship day now the Keen ey among you probably noticed that the R3 bundle we said we
were using doesn't have a clutch pedal but ours does that's because adding on to our R3 is as simple as grabbing one of these SRP clutch pedals moving everything over and and you're Off to the Races or deliveries as it were all three of our pedals feature High Precision hall effect sensors and on top of changing the layout you can change the configuration adjusting the output curves of the pedals in their software since we were down here by the way we also added their mosa Performance Kit to
the brake pedal I mean don't get me wrong they're good out of the box but this gives the brake a bit more of a realistic progressive resistance we're going to have links to all this stuff in the description by the way now it's time to mount our our wheelbase to our Shelf the R3 base offers 3.9 Newton me of torque and has broad compatibility on PC with presets for many of your favorite Xbox racing and Sim games wouldn't have minded if more than two of the screws fit the cheese plate but seems like it's on
there pretty good right that's not going anywhere oh yeah that's not going anywhere now normally you'd Mount this really at any height you want but you'd aim to have it around level with the ground but for us we're going to tilt it a little bit back to get more of an authentic big rig feel uh what are you guys thinking for height uh when I was testing I had a straight 90 vertical what shut up not even joking okay I'm super into it let's do it all right all right should we put it on the ground to
determine height here what do you guys think what do we do the seat first oh no I've heard about this seat there's this company called vivor as far as I can tell their product portfolio is made up of whatever the hell we felt like making I mean they've got everything from ultrasonic cleaners to kind of dangerous sounding High Press compressors anyway uh this is oh wow the base of the seat I guess yes here's the rest of it oh boy so here's how it works you adjust the tension with this little lever right
here depending on your weight and it's like uh you put the seat on it calibrate it and then it kind of bounces uh yeah I couldn't exactly figure it out either um as far as I could tell is once you had your tension set you just lift the seat up and it gets locked into the sprung position okay and then when you sit on it you kind of just like bounce up and down a little how does this Mount uh so we got to pull these screws off on the side here sure and then we're just going to Huck it on there Huck it on
there stop some bolts in okay now technically this is designed to go in a forklift or in a tractor but we just kind of liked the vibe you know like it's got an authentic feel that money just can't buy did we really have to buy this Jake kind of went crazy on the purchasing oh it was Jake yeah I knew it is just under his purchase approval limit that's why I didn't know about it oh am I able to just slide this on there or what yep that's all it is okay you ready Jordan yep help me line it up oh
that was going to watch I was ready to watch not to help okay hey nice see look at that great oh yeah now what's this lifting business we got to do yeah guess we got to bring her down now what is with the size of this seat how is that adult size oh oh so you see it just disengaged and now you lift it back up and it locks back in yeah but it doesn't it doesn't spring well you got to be heavy enough to make it spring Let's Get You On  quality okay oh I guess now is a good
time to take a closer look at our wheel too so it just goes on with a little there you go twisty on like that and okay this is this is quite vertical is  oh yeah okay yeah I see it 22 programmable buttons paddle shifters going to have to lose those immediately but I do like the radio button uh breaker breaker we've got a yeah I don't know trucker lingo  is oh God you were rolling on that all right well anyway oh oh we're going to need a screen we got that oh hey look at that
it's a Justin he's just in time I bet he's never heard that before either no never for our displays we chose what we had lying around in the warehouse from LTX that's not what Jordan wrote in here but I'm pretty sure that's the real reason anyway it's a TCL S Series 4K 55 S4 something something the point is it's great bang for the buck at 350 Canadian rubles with low input leg entry level HDR okay it's 60 hurts but realistically do we need High refresh rate for Trucking does this seem a little high oh
I mean no I get right it's all about and find out right right right it's it's trucker ergonomics so I'm looking H actually no it might need to oh how hard is it for it to come down a few inches it ises not oh good let's do that then okay come down a couple more inches I  say Jordan I mean that's not bad actually did I say Jordan Justin you did days around here well look I just I've been called worse used to yelling at him it's like with kids like occasionally you'll just be yelling at one of the
kids and no matter who's in trouble you just say the name of the biggest Troublemaker oh yeah that's good hold it there hold it back it up back it up all right what you don't want immersiveness Jordan I don't want to punch the window now you're probably wondering about the system that we're using to power such an awesome looking Sim rig and well it's whatever we found in storage it's a a star Forge pre-built that with a 12900 KF and a 3080 TI is more than enough to handle Euro Truck
Simulator based on these minimum system requirements our pal at Logitech sent over g515 tkl wireless keyboard and a pro X2 super light wireless mouse um this setup is not the most optimal for this kind of keyboard and mouse realistically their little like integrated trackpad combo thing might have been a better choice but hey're we're going to make this work launch it you cannot move freely about the world because you don't have a truck I tried to buy us a truck but Tanner put us into
debt okay I sort by price I mean yeah how about ice cream all right uh who doesn't like ice cream offer expires in 5 minutes like is this in real time yes like these are real jobs like in the game world yeah yeah what don't let anyone down God no pressure wait what There She Goes going yeah but I'm not I I didn't put it I uh oh well I didn't use the clutch I guess I don't need it hey cool it's time to make a delivery use the route advisor to see where you are and where you need to
go there's more gears than one by the way I yeah well I'm in the I'm in the parking lot Jordan it also red lines at "2,000 RPM so you don't really got a lot" to work with oh wow yeah how about that oh my goodness also there's a gate there I mean yeah but like I'm A semi- TRU what does a gate mean to me oh okay apparently a lock not even a scratch on it look at that  boys we're Trucking yes indeed we're Trucking okay this really feels like a hack with all of this paddle shifting though well we
do have a shifter right here I mean come on please oh that's that's not quite your style hang on hang on oh Bo jeez why are you trying to distract me here I'm driving boys oh God which way am I going how do I signal oh we're I know I know what you said which way am I going I asked how to signal I know which way I'm going oh God which way am I going oh God which way am I going how about this oh no way yeah yeah that's more like it wow where did we get this it's from SIM
panel oh and then the custom length rod and adapter were made by me oh right on this is great so what we just take the  I got you wow wow oh dude buddy wow that is so cool um hm that might be a little far yeah it's okay we don't use seventh anyways it's fine oh okay sure okay yeah let's go right there do we have a base yes well he doing that let's give you a keyboard stand oh that would be really useful is that in the notes am I supposed to say anything about it it is in the notes somewhere okay it's a
keyboard stand from Next Level oh it's from Next Level there you go is there a reason we didn't put that on in the first place cuz you wanted to do a zle set up first oh well that's what you get for listening to me I know right we should know better by now but that is a lot better now what all right so this is the fun part now we got to roll through all the gears Okay click on the thing so you can select the button joy for where it says joy button 14 click that right okay so you just put
it into first yes no reverse oh bloody and so you got to push down over yeah there you go you got it I've driven the  before riveting uh I did not see if there were any cars coming before I decided to start making this turn I could really use a bit of a wider field of view do we have any more of these TVs handy we might just go that way am I in third oh fourth you're in fourth it says over there as well uh yeah if that's easier to read how am I only going 23 km an hour you're very slow there's also a red
light coming up I mean it'll turn green that's very confident have you I think it's going to turn green I think it was green oh dude you get a ticket you lost 80 what the heck yeah you think that's funny Jordan you think that's funny oh oh well I guess I better break oh my God she takes a minute to stop oh okay yeah we got to get some more TVs yeah I need more TVs there's no way I can play this with less than three TVs  unacceptable okay yeah that looks pretty good to me close oh yeah bud oh yeah bud
I mean hold on a second Colin uh he does his best can you lift it up a bit up up okay no no no I'll do it forget it wow boy is that ever something okay we can get these angles a little these angles are not great I'm working on it what you guys do over here I'm working on it you're making it so much worse Jordan no I'm not yes you are you can't see what you're doing that's fair uh okay that's good then you got to bring the height down a little no stop it's ever so slight you know what
it's good it's good it's good don't touch it anymore mimer isn't going to matter yeah it's fine oh my God this is more like it dude now I can see where I'm going let's turn this bad boy on red light she's yellow no no we could do a rolling stop we could do a rolling stop okay hold on rolling stop uh 80 EUR baby no what no no no I I stopped I stopped I stopped brother it was 80 no did said it yeah where in the in the corner what no I no you blew past the line man well yeah but
the line is I mean it's arbitrary it's paint fun fact fact I failed my first driving test road test for stopping past stop lines I think four times I just see them as more of a suggestion I mean I can't see for past the thing without if I not pulled out a little any more monitors oh I'm taking this exit right away okay dude I'm only going 37 km an hour you're not very fast yeah what the heck you're supposed to do 80 here it says 80 yeah what am I in did I put it in reverse oh we stalled it did I just kill
my car truck oh my God I'm going to have to start on a hill I don't want to start on a hill you're in E I'm an eighth oh gosh darn it second all right there we go there we go that's what I need second second you've driven before right I driven before never anything with gears this short oh my God I'm supposed to be going 100 that guy just about hit me he's all over the road okay here we go am I in seventh now okay I really don't like the indicator on this one okay buddy move move move move wait where am
I supposed to be going oh my God I'm supposed to take this exit no no I got this i got this i got this i got this I'm just going to she's she's rev tur to as she's revved a little high she's revved a little high she's revved a little high you got this okay uh which way am I going I know oh my God I got to go to the right okay this is where we fail okay the road's optional the road's optional uh what what probably like Fifth Fifth or something am I in fifth I'm in fifth oh man I think I landed I
think I landed the gear there so what happens if I do hit someone I don't know go for that tanker yeah I want the tanker hey buddy get off the road that's my ro oh jeez the tree yep I found the tree let's finish off the setup and we'll come back to the missions tomorrow boy this is quite the get up where' you even find a belt with a big L on it Amazon I love what you've done with the cockpit though are these my jars inde why do I have so many can't stop Trucking addicted to the shindig I guess
it's time for The Full Experience now oh I thought we didn't get it okay in the time we've been working on this mosa released a truck wheel and we I was told we didn't get it in time this is so cool oh we upgraded the base as well I guess the point of that is just more modularity or or do you just need the stronger base to account for the additional don't need it but it gives you more force feedback oh this is so cool okay now you have some different controls you're going to have to learn
you got to use your panel box now oh Lordy so accessory one is going to be your electronics on so now you can see your dash it lights up now just turn the key a little bit you don't have to hold it and your engine's now fired up no way how fun is that did you configure the lights and Pie beams and stuff yeah yes oh no way I could see it okay it's time to really truck parking brake is on so you got you got to pull your parking brake no you got to pull it pull it says  right map there still oh oh oh oh no way
oh the map's on a tablet yes oh that's so cool it's running an app called simhub where am I supposed to go um unfortunately it actually doesn't give you your GPS direction so you still have to look at the one down to the car there oh no way going the wrong oh I could look at both Maps well no no I'm turning around I'm turning around brother I started out with man why is anybody playing a Sim game about driving a truck and now I'm sitting here in this rig and  awesome you're going left at the next
intersection yeah I'm going left at the next intersection also feel free to skip gears they do in real trucks anyways oh really yes I mean and actually nine times out of 10 when you're shifting gears on a real truck you don't use the clutch either what yes no way I'm joking you're just rev match oh wow I mean I won't be doing that but sure okay okay we're going straight to Fourth we got a we got a signal can't see my mirror well good luck everybody oh wow a dick buddy but Hey where's the where's
the horn where's the horn I'm driving here so I'm going to toggle this thing and then I'm in eighth hey there there we go okay I'm not in the lane but I'm in the right gear going right oh you got you got to tell me a little earlier son I am a truck driver I go where the open road leads me and I signal because I'm a professional driver this is incredible the only thing it needs is like like a vibrating seat that would be freaking awesome yeah that wasn't in Jake's budget yeah you know what's really wild
I feel so immersed in the game right now that when I go to turn left or I go to change lanes I want a shoulder check no I'm I'm serious though like more screens for that this is so cool approach the entrance gate to get a clearance to bring the cargo to a particular spot may be a good time to adjust the marking the spot where to stop the truck oh boy okay well surely what could go wrong only take a couple hours trailer Delivery where do you need it let's play it safe sorry I'm in a hurry now I think we got
to go where do you need it confirm proceed to unloading area oh man no problem bud am I in Reverse um I'm in Reverse right now yeah you do appear to be and I stalled it no the other way damn it You' backed up before right yeah I have okay I used to actually drive our our trailer all the time I know this oh my God you know what the issue is is it just takes so long to correct I was turning it the right way I just didn't account for how ridiculously long it takes to course correct my goodness how do people do
Now right you're in the wrong lane there but dude I'm working on it oh God what just happened you just hit a cow no I  I have an Innovative new idea okay they can just go around to the back of the  everything okay okay here we go this is it we just got to take her in for the landing no no no no dang it dang it we no no that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay we're good we're good we're good okay so we just need to straighten her out a little bit okay there we go there we go and then I
just got to all over in just tap tap tap Tapper it's raining down I mean how do I tell if I in it'll tell you there turn green yeah woo now you got hit the trailer unattach switch on the button box trailer unattach decoupling nice there you go l 61 hours so this is how you end up with negative money the last thing I told Mazo we'd mention is that the Xbox wheel is modable with different frames around it and on PC you've got all kinds of different options for wheels that can go
onto their wheelbases if you guys enjoyed this video you might enjoy the time we checked out a $30 racing setup "versus a $10,000 racing setup that was a" lot of fun
