here in msi's Booth they're showing off everything from laptops and monitors to car chargers but what I wasn't expecting was for them to get into a new category  paint yeah I pulled you into the video just to make that joke sorry cliff in all seriousness though the MSI claw does a lot more than just change the color of the existing handheld gaming systems on the market from the outside yeah it Bears a lot of similarity to a system like the Rog Ally or the steam deck but on the inside it is running Intel's
allnew core Ultra Series processors which promises some pretty interesting benefits I'll get to that in a bit first I want to talk about what's special about the outside but first this message from our sponsor headphone juice is not something you should be proud of these are your typical headphones that accumulate heat while you game e wikied cushions add a cooling gel to their cushions to keep your ears sweat free you can easily replace them on your headset check out wikied cushions and
the link below while you can get get hall effect joysticks as an add-on for consoles like the steam deck MSI has opted to go for both hall effect joysticks and triggers right out of the box with the claw I wasn't expecting this move after valve stated they opted not to use hall effect joysticks over reliability concerns but given how much I prefer using them it's definitely a welcome one to me even if uh I don't know something could go wrong at some point other than that they've ticked all
the important boxes dual stereo front-facing speakers that are not covered by your palms love to see it an integrated fingerprint sensor in the power button a Micro SD slot that uh hopefully it doesn't overheat and good enough feeling buttons and ergonomics that I don't expect this to be an issue whether you're more of a rested in front of you gamer sit it in your lap gamer or just hold it up gamer whether they came up with that on their own or uh borrowed from their competitors I don't know but
realistically at this point it doesn't matter because there's one other standout Fe feature that I absolutely love to see because they've gone Intel they have an integrated Thunderbolt for Port which means that like the Ally you'll be able to run an external graphics card on the claw but unlike the Ali you're not limited to asus's proprietary XG mobile Graphics interface now Thunderbolt does have a disadvantage this is Thunderbolt 4 not Thunderbolt 5 so it runs at half of the total Bend
with the vusa solution but as long as you're not hooking a 4080 or a 4090 up to this thing you can still get a healthy Graphics boost by docking it to a GPU and a part of what enables that is the strong CPU performance of the meteor Lake core Ultra 5 or core Ultra 7 processors that are at the heart of these things which of course we're about to take a look at here no no you're not going to break that one what you can try this one I want the real oh is this just a dummy one no it's actually functional
oh well then why is this a sacrificial lamb because this one is more important okay fair enough to even get to open it for you guys at all I had to sign away my life they said they want two free sponsored videos if I break it yep but you said this one's not important not as important after all the shenanigans I've gotten up to in their booths over the years I'm surprised they're letting me do this at all but I couldn't resist an opportunity to show off the very early prototype of our Precision screwdriver
kit coming soon to LTT store.com and besides a big selling point of competing handhelds like especially the steam deck is the ease with which they can be opened up and upgraded or repaired so I would like to see if that's something that can also be said about the claw we're off to a good start six screws all of which are the same oh and a fairly easy single piece back that gives us let's see wo a dual heat pipe cooling system love to see it my goodness no what I didn't even think
about it but that was running Assassin's Creed Mirage and I could I mean I'm in a show Flor but I can barely hear it ah not bad MSI not bad there's actually a lot to appreciate in here for one thing look at this battery I was wondering how they packed a 53w hour battery into this thing and I guess the answer is with a really funky shape but that's a really good thing it contributes to a really even hand feel and Intel claims will give you a full 2 hours of battery life running Full Tilt
at the 35 W maximum TDP that this thing will do when it's running on battery power they claim more like 8 hours when it's running in the 10 wat endurance mode and there's more good news the Wi-Fi module is not soldered and we saw the importance of this when valve upgraded the steam deck to the steam deck OLED and we saw a dramatic increase in download speeds when they went from Wi-Fi 5 to Wi-Fi 6E of course that's going to be less of an issue on the claw in the first place because it ships with
Wi-Fi 7 meaning you're probably going to run into a CPU bottle next for downloading games before you max out your Wi-Fi as an added bonus with that chip while you can use the 32 mm headphone microphone combo Jack it's Bluetooth 5.4 meaning that with a compatible headset you can expect much lower latency even over traditionally kind of crappy Bluetooth coming back to that CPU again there are two different chips that you might find in the MSI claw the cor Ultra 5 135h or the core Ultra 7
155h both of them have two of what Intel are calling low power efficiency cores which are basically just the same as their regular efficiency cores but built on a different process and tuned to handle background tasks they both have eight regular efficiency cores and then the difference is they have either four or six performance or pees so depending on the AAA games that you might want to play it could make more sense to go for the 15 155h especially given the relatively low difference in price end
of q1 at three different price points starting at $699 with the middle one looking like the best one in my mind because that 512 gig SSD can easily be upgraded just by removing a few screws and popping in a new 2230 m.2 SSD oh and all my excitement about the speeds and feeds I kind of glossed over a major detail the screen is 1080p 120 HZ and should reach a peak brightness of around 400 to 500 nit so about what you'd expect for a machine of this class just like you'd expect this segue to our sponsor
