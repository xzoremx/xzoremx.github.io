buying a PC part by part can be tough  branding it's impossible to know what's good especially if you've been out of the loop for a while what is the difference between a ryzen 77700 and 7700x should I save the dollar is an expensive motherboard really faster and what's better between super an XT I know I'm just going to Mosey on over to New Egg and round up the best rated parts and see if the herd mentality steers me wrong or lands me kneed deep in manure but first I got to

you could actually buy the stuff so drum roll please your CPU of choice is Intel's core i7 12 700k I got to say way to go herd I mean a couple of months back when we started compiling our list we were a little surprised to see you all sticking with tried and true 12 gen but since then it's emerged that 13th and 14th gen Intel chips have been susceptible to random crashing and even outright failure so we give up some speed sure but we've still got 12 stable cores in our socket for around 260 bucks
not bad in fact the only thing people didn't like about it was that it failed to boot and then boots all right then our other Contender for the best rated CPU was the AMD 7800 x3d it ties the 4.9 egg rating but given that it shares its 636 reviews with two other chips we couldn't very well give it the win even if we'd like to it is another $100 and actually has four fewer cores but those cores absolutely Excel for gaming and its am5 socket is expected to be supported until at least 2027 making it
a no-brainer for the gamers out there after adjusting our search parameters to include only compatible LGA 1700 boards msi's Pro z690 a Wi-Fi ddr5 is our big winner now this one's another aggregate review score so it's kind of hard to say which of those boards are the best reviewed ones but it comes up first in the results compared to its product page siblings and it gets wait only 4 and 1/2 eggs Yep this is our first piece that lands outside of our 5 egg Target but as it turns out that's as good as it gets
for a motherboard and it might be all right I mean MSI won our shootout a few years back when we tried 10 boards with one CPU and it's also got a healthy mix of features with lots of IO pcie Gen 5 for our graphics card decent expansion for later RGB and Wi-Fi 6E so what's not to love about it well according to our one egg reviewers the ones that don't work next up comes memory and after much deliberation we settled on the 64 gig Fury Beast kit from Kingston why deliberation well none of the 5A gram
kits had a lot of reviews so we sorted by rating and lowered the threshold to 20 which put this one on top unfortunately it's my first real displ I mean it's not bad but does the average user in 2024 really need 64 gigs of RAM "and at 6,000 megat transfers per second" CL 36 it's not the greatest performing kit either especially given we're spending $220 bad reviews here focused mainly on their instability though realistically that's probably more down to their motherboard choice or the memory
controller on their CPU anyway another disappointment for us was our store because while it is an m.2 nvme Drive which should be plenty fast for the modern gamer specifically it's the Samsung 970 Evo plus 500 gig that's not a lot of space for the modern gamer our one or two egg reviews here focused on its a lack of longevity lack of longevity and especially lack of longevity though it is worth noting that none of those reviews have shown up recently and we did find some Forum
articles that seem to indicate that s might have patched some bugs in this particular Drive speaking of situations that have changed recently our last part before we unveil our case is deep Cool's AG 620 Tower cooler you um can't buy these in the United States anymore on account of deep cool allegedly engaging in selling to Russian businesses and whatnot but before that happened we bought this fine 5A cooler for just $61.50 since it's no longer listed on the US site though we had to go to the
Canadian website to get screen capture of the reviews where there weren't any reviews below 4 eggs no complaints you know what else you won't be complaining about our new Intergalactic GPU poster from LTD store.com and the best thing is you can buy one without supporting the Russian war machine woo now let's get all of this into the case nice the fractal meshify 2 might not meet our 4o egg threshold anymore but it did when we ordered it and come on Joshua D that has nothing to do
with the build quality of this fine case it's got loads of room to work in rubber grommets for cable management it comes with fans and thanks to its mesh front panel it should keep our components nice and cool also luckily for us while it is on the expensive side at $160 the light tint teered glass window option that we got is still on sale for just 110 complaints about it mostly centered on its lack of E ATX support a lack of support for 420 mm radiators without removing the front fanss and
some stripped screws now to get things powered up with a power supply from oh of course it is SE Sonic it's the vertex "gx1000 this is a 1,000 wat 80 plus gold" fully modular power supply and what's not to love it was even on sale for 170 bucks when we bought it I think the only real criticism that I would level at the herd here is that this is kind of Overkill I mean I haven't shown you guys "the GPU yet but we do not need a 1,000 W" power supply and we could have saved
some money if we'd gone with an 800 watt but I'm not the one making the rules today folks now the astute observers out there are probably yelling lonus that's not 100 reviews you cheated cuz you love seic so much but you know what I say to that look again boom the only one egg review for this thing was from someone who ordered the plat Plum rated variant but got gold and that was probably new egg's fault that is some fine power supply making now it's time at long last to talk GPU
love them or hate them Asus takes this one with exactly 100 reviews on their 470 TI super OC Edition there's a lot to like about this guy 16 gigs of vram an elevated boost clock fourth gen tensor course third gen rate tracing course it's a great card no matter which brand you buy it from and Ours was on sale the one egg reviews here had to do with a DOA product and surprise surprise a lack of customer support and would you look at that it's a pretty nice build at just over
$900 we've spent a lot of money but we've also got a very competent high-end gaming rig it looks good it games good but does it compete good you see I've been hiding something from you this whole time we built a second PC with our own choices with the goal of bleeding excuse me I mean beating the herd and okay we went like $9 over budget but come on it's going to be the best $9 you ever spent cuz I think we did awesome here we've got a one tbte Gen4 Drive instead of 512 gigs we upgraded our CPU
remember of course we were looking at Parts before for AMD launched ryzen "99000 and put the 7,000 series on promo" but we've got half as much RAM running at a much faster speed and the best part Gamers we squeezed in a 4080 super instead of that 4070 TI super now we did compromise a little bit on our eggs most of them are in the 4 and a half range but some of them are even still five egg products so we didn't do any weird bottom ofth Barrel dumpster diving in order to save that money but enough chitchat
let's see how we did we'll kick things off with good oldfashioned cine bench and wait why do you get the good one cuz I chose the good one mind you I mean it's a miracle even finish the run so yeah make sure mic code update is available now but uh anyway my 12 gen one definitely works yep but what about games what do you want to start with Counter Strike Counter Strike two that's it all right now I'd like people to note that just because he gets more kills than me doesn't mean that his computer
is that much better than me he's just a much better gamer oh we're totally in the same match let's go where you at brother I killed huge reaction no oh I'm dead too we died like nice I just got three in Rapid succession here I'm catching up it's over what yeah match is over oh are we in different matches we must be cuz my match is over I thought it looked like the same match loaded in at like the exact same time you know what we haven't been doing paying attention to the frame rate oh right uh
wow they're really close I'm sitting at like 270 FPS I mean mine fluctuates a lot it goes from like 220 to 320 293 280 290 see let's see your kill to death ratio though oh my God that's the real Mark of a gaming rig yeah that's how that works I'm a little surprised that you're not getting any extra on the 280 super this is 4K basically cranked right yeah but Counterstrike is really CPU bound and as much as the 13 700k is a little better than it's not that much better right and certainly not in like
single threaded performance my GPU peaked at 62 okay so they're pretty close yeah mine's also around 62 okay all right let's Halo infin Halo infinite sure where are you okay all right let's go let's go okay I like this gun uh okay I'm at 120 you're at one oh yeah I'm clearly in the lead it's not a lot I would say that it's enough that in a pretty bad sit situation you're going to have a slight Edge for smoothness but both of these are extremely playable yeah I don't think this one's going to
be that close I mean with Ray tracing on I'm actually losing right now get out of the way buddy hey hey I'm driving here okay you know what now it's pretty I am winning like I know we're not in the same spot but I'm getting like 30 pretty consistently oras you're at like a consistent 24 that's a pretty solid machine man they're both good yeah they're both good that's a quite a bit better measurably better I mean okay when it's this low of an FPS yeah 7 FPS 6 FPS that's like more than 10%
yeah but they're both around the same like realistically 32 to 27 FPS if I had both of these in front of me I wouldn't be able to tell okay okay yeah you're right look all right all right you built a better machine you want a cookie yes give cookie please dudee I can't even like aame that's not good yeah what are your 1% not great oh yeah see my 1% are pretty consistently 30 30 plus whereas you're dipping into like 24 territory for your 1% lows that's that big difference right there yeah
realistically you'd be pretty happy with either of these I think the herd did a great job but ploof system does show how important it is to prioritize a bigger GPU and faster memory I also think we could have gotten better bang for the buck if we didn't care about buying into a modern platform something like a 5800 X 3D with some higher end ddr4 and a cheap am4 motherboard makes for a wicked value gaming system and would give you even more money to spend on your GPU so
yeah it's a tad overpriced for what you get but you can't fault the quality and if you want to buy anything that you saw here today well except maybe that deep cool cooler we're going to have links in the video description and the big conclusion here is that in spite of all the attempts to spread misinformation online reviews still largely serve their purpose you just might have to sift a little bit and do some research to really find the absolute best bang for your buck oh and make sure to shop
