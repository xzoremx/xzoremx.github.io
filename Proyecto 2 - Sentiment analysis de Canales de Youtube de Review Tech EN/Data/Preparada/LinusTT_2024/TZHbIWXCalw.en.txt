what gaming PC can you get for about "$1,000 to start we're going to use the" gigabyte b550m motherboard it includes 1 GB ethernet Wi-Fi and Bluetooth and two m.2 slots for your ssds the brins of our computer is a ryzen 7 5700 x3d it's brand new from AMD it's so cool they're still supporting old platforms our CPU Cooler is a little bit on the cheaper side but that's not a bad thing the Peerless assassin 120 is one of the best CPU coolers on the market for this price for our Ram we went with the T Force
Vulcan Zed we got two 8 GB sticks at 3200 megat transfers a second for our storage we went with the Kingston nv2 1 terb you want to make sure you install it in the top slot cuz that gives you the pcie Gen 4 for the case we went with the Cooler Master q300l it's a little bit simpler has everything we need and left us budget for the other more important parts to provide the juice we got the Corsair RM 750e fully modular power supply RX 7700 XT it's got 12 GB of vram cuz eight just isn't enough
