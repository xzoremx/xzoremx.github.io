picture this the year is 2102 you're sitting down to play some video games when boom suddenly a radioactive bat appears outside your house and the worst part the radiation made your computer blue screen right in the middle of a raid with all of your friends well fear not because Fallout 76 sponsored this video to find a solution and we spent their money on a pallet of lead to build the radiation Pro gaming PC really Alex yes and the best part you can play Fallout 76 for free until October
29th did that actually tick just now  [Applause] timing radiation surrounds us at all times and for the most part that is totally fine in simple terms radiation is Just Energy being moved from one place to another waves or particles like light from the Sun or the Wi-Fi in your house where problems start occurring is when the energy increases enough to become ionizing radiation knocking electrons out of an atom or molecule in a video game say Fallout 76 that could cause a beneficial mutation but in the
real world it's far more likely to cause cell damage or cancer and if that electron happens to be inside your RAM or your CPU it can cause a bit to flip turning what should have been a zero into a one or vice versa in 2024 there aren't too many places where you can go that the levels of background radiation are in immediate danger but ever since the nuclear apocalypse on October 23rd 2077 The Fallout Universe has been regularly experiencing unsafe levels of radiation and it gets worse given that
the goal of Fallout 76 is to Nuke a radioactive bat keeping ourselves protected while we do that is key now for players there's a lot of options rataway radex and even vegetable soup but for their precious gaming PCs there's sadly nothing to demonstrate what might happen in this situation we'll be using our Luma field CT scanner which is capable of yeting enough ionizing radiation to see through steel it is entirely possible to kill Electronics if you leave them in there long enough and if you put running
Electronics in here they'll become pretty unhappy pretty quickly allow me to demonstrate gerer   sec I assume that noise is bad yeah let's see what we can do about that the first and easiest thing to do to increase your computer stability is to Simply accept that sometimes poo happens and account for it for Mission critical uses like scientific Computing Financial systems or data centers they use registered ECC memory which doesn't just send the data from your CPU to your RAM
and vice versa but also extra bits that can be used to validate that data a super simple example could be if you wanted to make sure that your two twos arrived in one piece you could instead send two two 4 and then also tell the computer to make sure that 2 + 2 equals 4 if something goes wrong and you got a two and a three you'd know because it would equal five in practice ECC algorithms are much more complex but they're beyond the scope of this video if you want to learn more Derek from
veritasium has a great explanation in his recent video on QR codes in ddr5 there is some inherent error correction which some memory vendors will mislabel as on die ECC this isn't true ECC and you can see that the real stuff has extra chips four for storing data and another for error correcting but buffer DCC has a different key and cannot be placed in consumer motherboards unfortunately we don't have any unbuffered ECC here today but realistically in the radioactive Wasteland of Appalachia just correcting
the occasional bit flip wasn't going to cut it anyway we need to stop it happening in the first place and you don't need birth control when you're wearing eight condoms bring in the lead did you write that or did I I wrote that okay cuz I don't remember approving that in the script but that's "very funny here we have spent $1,000 of" bethesda's money on 300 lb of lead then $600 on shipping that lead and then $800 on a safety consultant we gave us this nice booklet on what you need to know to
not get harmed by aformentioned lead am I supposed to have read it uh this page that I marked is the only important one good Lord this is a classic case of the cure being worse than the disease you do not want to mess around with this stuff man this is freaking heavy oh where the heck do you even buy 300 lbs of lead metal supplier just call them up ask for it that's about it which is kind of crazy to me because this stuff is way more dangerous than some of the things that chemical suppliers do restrict
access to you have a business address you can get basically anything you want they'll just send it to you I did not know that anyway we need to make sure we don't touch it lead is a poisonous neurotoxin that has no no safe exposure level whatsoever it also gets absorbed into your bones and stays in there for decades with a halflife of 46 years meaning that people that were alive in the 70s before leg gas and paint were banned are still actively receiving lead poisoning from their own bodies explaining
Congress lead poisoning can lead to learning difficulties irritability mood disorders poor memory loss of sex drive infertility and many other bad things lead use was also estimated to have decreased the IQ of the average American by Four Points while its use was still common place that was a difficult torch for the new generation to carry but somehow they managed it fun fact by the way going to an indoor shooting range even just once or twice a month can expose you to enough lead dust to cause
problems so what you're supposed to do is put on those gloves and then these gloves those ones are doing the protection these are for cut protection so that the lead doesn't like cut you oh sure okay should we in the bay n probably not the worst thing that we can do is stir up dust which is why we're not in there where the air flow is really good dude this is hilarious yeah the Safety Committee kept on trying to get us to do other things but it's just way too funny to have to 
this you know I didn't see anything in the work safe handling stuff about just it being fraking heavy wow it's got a cool bluish Hue to it yeah I've never um done this the thing that you need to be careful of is the lead oxide so if you look if you do that oh yeah there is now lead on my finger this is totally fine as long as I don't now lick my finger or go for a smoke or anything of that sort can you pick your nose I wouldn't recommend it theoretically lead is highly malleable
and should therefore be pretty easy to oh wow it is that's really easy yeah okay H is that enough to start I imagine do you want to explain these tools to us professional this is a leather punch we can't be drilling into the lead because that creates dust which is bad so we're going to try and use this leather punch to make holes in it I think it's going to be difficult and annoying we're going to cut the lead yes by just punching holes in it there are other plans we can like put spikes through
it but this if it works will be the easiest so we'll probably want like a/4 in maybe a little bit more of overlap on each side okay we'll kind of take the pieces of lead and like overlap them and then tape them we'll tape them yeah we'll tape them do we have lead tape we have aluminum tape but that's why you overlap it okay okay wait oh so I don't have to use the stupid leather punch we have Snips we have snips Alex well but we still need to put holes in it I thought you wanted me to perforate the thing and
then just like bend it I was like this is the stupidest plan ever okay there okay fine no so we're going to metal yeah no it makes way more sense but we're going to use some bolts to attach it to this sure fine yeah no that's fine just wear the leather yeah yeah no I get it I get it now I thought you wanted me to cut it with that that would be awful yeah I know it would be really bad oh wow dude this is somewhat easy it's like cutting plastic heavy heavy plastic that is one ragged ass line but uh progress
okay ow oh did you cut yourself uh no but that does seem like a concern I have no idea if this Splinter could penetrate anything cuz it's so soft but um if it  dude it's so heavy but that's a feature not a bug lead's density is what makes it so effective at blocking radiation effectively nothing can get through it so making our system radiation proof is just putting a whole lot of mass between the source of the radiation and our sensitive components definitely need to Mark out
some lines and do a cleaner cut but that'll be easier now that I don't have to contend with the entire roll of lead as I'm trying to snip through it okay I think the key is just being willing to bend the crap out of it while you're cutting it and then bend it back when you're done cuz it's really not  just boom flat trying to line these up pretty much perfect here because while good enough would be good enough to protect the computer it's not going to help us get the actual bolts through so I want these
to be very very well lined up okay there's your first lead plate wow that's heavy like I know in my head that it's heavy but like wow that's really heavy it's like the gold controller yeah like cognitively I understand that there's different densities of materials but damn like is it a problem that we're going to have just like steel bolts and we're going to have small holes in our plating probably there we go oh this is the outer plate okay that makes sense  yes with this
overlap what's your plan when the side panel overlaps and the top panel overlaps we'll just do like overlap overlap overlap overlap just stack them on top of each other and probably just whack it with a hammer and add some aluminum tape I don't think that's going to be as easy as you think that is I don't think it's going to be easy oh well okay then we're on the same page how is this so far off dude it's not aligned at all okay yeah well that's actually good news the fact that this
isn't wide enough means that our two tall side panels will fold over very nicely yeah so we can just put it over top that's easy yeah no problem done our incompetence worked out for a change sometimes you can air or stack in the correct direction hear me out strategic overlapping we take this top piece off Yeah we actually cut it flush to the front yeah we do the side panels next and it like wraps then we do the front panel huge and it wraps around the side panels and around the overlapped
top and we use the bendiness and then for the back we basically just cut little AR armor pieces for all the parts we don't need access to and glue them on sure double-sided tape okay that last part was where I was testing to see if he was just going along with everything I was saying cuz that's terrible so tell me something yeah should I just go for it sure okay I'm going to shape this then do I want a whacker a yeah we need  whacker with the two sides it's kind of coming together like visually right
dude actually making the PC out of lead may be the best way to make it look like it's from The Fallout Universe yeah we probably should have bolted it before we whacked it mhm shoot Alex Andrew called it uh she's not going to go deep enough not quite now under normal circumstances I would just take my side panel put a new hole in it that's closer to the edge but being contaminated and not being able to touch any of our stuff is pretty freaking Inc convenient right about now question for
you can we just take a nail and our contaminated hammer and just send a hole through this thing probably yeah okay why don't we just do that then contaminate One Nail instead of our  okay okay memes aside though are we expecting this to work like do we know you know how much radiation can slip through a small Gap obviously this armor is not going to be perfect every single time that a radioactive particle hits your PC or yourself there is a chance that something bad happens and so by
doing this we might not 100% eliminate the chances of something bad happening but it's going to be way lower like think of all the areas where theoretically a particle could come through yeah it's basically not this is one of those projects man where like you're in the planning stages and you're just like I don't know is this just really dumb and we shouldn't do it or is this really done and we should totally do it this is definitely the ladder okay so what did you say the side
panel has to go on before the top panel right right whoa jeez I almost lost control of it as it was coming down okay did I get it oh dude she's latched nice easy so we'll Bend this back and then we'll  after okay so we'll fold these over on the front we fold question for you yes the bomb's not going to go off under the computer do we need armor on the bottom or could we have some ventilation are you determined to kill this thing I guess we could just attach a fan on the
bottom that would probably help it A a  lot all right it's basically done it needs a little bit of finishing work to look more complete and together but we can do that on Tuesday after it's not  weekend I might have missed out on some of the finishing touches here but oh oh it's heavy I guess I get to do the big moment have we weighed yet we have not we did a weigh but I have done some trimming and stuff dude she's thonk look at her go like damn all right good god I've gained weight I'm
174 lbs and I guess I probably uh shouldn't touch the lead actually let's uh I mean a little bit of lead is good for you right no it's like iron a little bit of iron in your diet a little bit of lead in your diet little bit of iron great a little bit of lead oh goodness your Dy it get it lead in your dye it okay it's F I got it I got it I can do it I can do it I've got this I've got this okay I'm just going to get  table okay what what did I say that was 174 oh my God I'm at 150 now I still
have my other foot on the ground just put it on the scale here we go here we  2642 please don't drop it no no I got it's rolling away I got wo that was 90 lb dead on wasn't it wow is this even safe to put in the Luma field I don't know they still haven't gotten back to me with a maximum allowed on that well they should have thought of that before they sent us a Luma field all right here we we go oh do you want to play games on it or throw it in there first oh we got to play games on it yeah
we've got to play we got to prove it's a working computer yeah okay also there is a guer counter in it right now that is on okay I haven't heard it in a long time I I should think not any brilliant ideas for how to turn it on oh my God a nail really yes I mean it's better than what we had for the PCS in the back of my van which was just nothing can really feel the lead you know like it's got that lead feel like the Ley goodness okay ready boom oh it works perfect dude it actually works really well no it
actually works perfect why are you not working still I may be able to reach the onboard HDMI Alex which on board really helpful from a troubleshooting standpoint I just can't get any pressure on it oh I got it okay okay so the HDMI is in oh thank goodness that HDMI port was right there if it was anywhere other than right at the bottom of the iio I wa why did we go on to the BIOS and not windows I don't know oh God oh God where's your boot devices there's no storage Alex oh there was something remember Alex
yes the nvme carrier wasn't in quite right and I thought it was fixed but maybe it is not well it  not well I guess this is getting finished tomorrow here it is Big Moment does it still game I couldn't help noticing that it's running great now yeah but um is there any air in or out there's a tiny bit of air that's getting in the bottom but who cares we have a reserator all the Heat's coming out of here well all it has to do is run the game oh before we do that I did scan it
in the Luma field do you want to take a look I do hello Mr camera uh I'm very sorry  there's the picture oh so it worked yeah you can see this little bit here where it didn't quite hit it the rest is the computer Flawless Victory then yeah nice let's see if the computer still works or realistically more like if it ever worked I think its problems are nothing to do with radiation exposure and everything to do with the fact that it is in a sealed container yeah do we tell them that we had to take it apart and
put it back together cuz the pcie bracket fell out no okay I guess we did let's see how the game runs on our machine wow CPU GPU temps not bad give me all your stuff hey get me that rad X hey get go on go on get go go go on get pilgrim how much more do we need to play to prove that this system actually totally kicks ass we're not getting a ton of FPS but that's our older GPU right like our CPU is at 52° and our GPU is at 43 and if a nuclear bomb goes off it'll be fine it totally will unironically survive as
long as it isn't in the blast radius yeah we should mention that if you are skill challenged like lonus you can join up with your friends so maybe one of them is good at the game I'll Dodge you I'll Dodge you oh yeah and while you do that I'll talk about the playable character that's a ghoul we probably could have worked that in a bit better whatever look at this computer the ultimate Fallout 76 PC you've outdone yourself Alex I've really done myself on this one this was so much work oh my God it was awful
it was terrible work but it has the world's greatest power button yep if you enjoyed this video because you love seeing me and Alex have things go according to plan you might enjoy the one where we tried to repair eight dead motherboards that we bought on eBay it was fun it was fun
