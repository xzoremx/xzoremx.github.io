ah my first day off and however long  relax all right all right I'm up and if I'm going to be doing Tech stuff anyway I might as well hang out with my peeps from you know float plane YouTube Billy Billy me and you were here cable management time and more now that this TV is unexpectedly no longer a business expense I was thinking maybe we should mount it to the center of the wall and not with drywall anchors so we're going to pull it off and throw it back on with a sheet of plywood which
will be great uh I mean it was probably seismically safe just like this segue to our sponsor SE Sonic their focus plus 750 W power supply is fully modular and features both an 80 plus gold efficiency rating and a 10year warranty learn more and pick one up for yourself at the link in the video description realistically you guys want to get out of here probably pretty soon so let's get this off reposition and get you guys out of here are we doing this thing yeah please don't hurt yourself again can you not
where are we going with it though um that's a good question I think that's probably our best bet my side's stuck oh heyo oh boy how we doing how we doing buddies we're fine we're fine we're fine don't worry okay it's coming down man that was much easier this time I wasn't here that's all that holds this thing up and the screw doesn't get tight enough to keep it from rotating what look at these tggo BTS it's not even wiggling you were worried that it wasn't going to hold up
and it is I was more concerned about seismically stable than whether it was actually going to stay did Elijah work on this what the heck no I didn't this is terrible like what we' got a glory hole here and everything doesn't go anywhere there's no glory oh yeah oh my God I'm helping Elijah can we have like one of those blankets please yes sir well no I mean you were asking for it yeah this seems fine seems fine did you want to patch and paint this before we do anything
what do you mean this is patched oh yeah oh it's so lovely look how patched it is this is the first thing we need to deal with we've got our scary 240 volt to standard North American adapter cable here but unfortunately with the bulky ends it doesn't fit through the conduit to the TV which is why it's running through a hall I just need to remove LTT the end of this Cable store with the Twist and loock connector.com with my trusty screwdriver go ahead and remove that sponsor block then I got to
transplant it onto this after we've run it through the walls El you ready to climb through the walls always am I love the enthusiasm but that's really not how you pull cable through a wall what climbing through the wall yeah well how do you do it then I know it's we're working with him if there's one thing I know about myself it's that I never know what I'm going to do so I ran conduit between here in the mechanical room between here and a potential TV location up there between here and potential
projector location up there and between here and that closet over there so we're going to take this 240 volt power which I unexpectedly needed cuz I bought a Chinese TV and we're not going to put it there we're going to put it here you want to help feed this to me the idea is that we're going to carry this all the way back to the mechanical room now we got to lube it up why there's some '90s there's like 390s here so it can be a little bit challenging especially cuz there's already some
stuff in there I was kind of joking but I've never actually pulled like cable through conduit as long as you have a pull wire it's super simple if you don't then it can be a little bit more complicated kind of fishing a thing through but basically all we need to do is take the end of this and a new pull wire so that we will always have a pull wire there and tape them to the existing P cord which not going to lie little confused right now uh I'm going to go check the other end okay nope moves
freely from this end weird new plan Elijah okay we're going to take a cable that was already in there that has an extra 30 ft on it long story and we're going to use that to pull the other wires then pull it back okay it'll be great do you want to pull or do you want to push uh I will push I feel like there's less responsibility actually pushing is way harder cuz you got to manage all of this without getting tangled up then I will pull cool okay time for Luby Merson to do his
work Elijah were you you know going to pull it I think I think it's this cable coming out right here um um Elijah I don't know if I'm supposed to be pulling yet oh I'm stuck ah he's calling me hey buddy hi were you going to pull on the cables at all or I am pulling okay yeah you got to pull with your arm strength it's like 20  this oh wait hold on I got a Lube bit I  sec Elijah just can you relax and just pull the cable I'm trying to pull the cable okay okay hold on let me pull it
back a bit then just pull evenly and slowly like like how you're pulling a cable okay not not in a jerking motion I'm not doing it in a jerking motion can I try sure please do please do try get stuck yeah like it it like it I'm stuck at the same spot for a while she's going hey we made it you know what I think the problem was as soon as most of the inside was lubed it was smooth sailing it's just that these Corning cables have a bit of a rubbery sheath on them compared to a a pole wire
which is slicker and designed for this so I think it was getting quite jammed up in there all right nice okay that's it guys please tell me it's going to  rack yeah Elijah don't worry you wait for me I'll get this tape off well it's your house yeah by the way a big one for me when I'm pulling cables resist the temptation to put two different pieces of tape on it resist because when you're unwrapping it you will be very unhappy uh were you guys sure this is going to reach to the rack oh I didn't realize I
need to go all the way down there oh yeah she uh she sits she sits but barely we're just going to move the rack there Jake was giving me a hard time about not putting down the feet keeping it on Wheels ha who's the idiot now Jake Checkmate boom right there awesome should have measured that before we put it in in the wall okay our plan is we're going to do the outers with normal screws and then the inners with legs leg I mean we could probably just use normal screws for everything right fine your
wall yeah I mean realistically it's going to be better than what we had which was drywall anchors good ones  anchors if you want stands right there if you wanted to have a mark That's like right here yeah it's not my house so [Laughter] he laughs but then that's actually what  Elijah oh he really is me yeah you really Elijah that one  [Applause] verb  I'm these are the do dads to keep it from whacking the wall and we didn't put those on before because we were told it was just temporary I wasn't entirely
sure what they were for and the manual is in Chinese yeah I I don't read that really yeah unfortunately you look like you would read Chinese I read a Chinese  [Laughter] the were we going to run that HDMI cable as well balls yes where's the pulling stuff ah theoretically again the cable that I had running along the floor is long enough but I'm not 100% sure Elijah's first cable pull this is so sweet okay what am I doing am I just like pouring it on like sauce like sure okay you show us how you would Lube
something well I I have no experience you got to move your diamond play button what a 1% issue to have the Lube's not coming I'm trying to get the lube out it's not laughing i' I've never done this before bro just just just just get Lube on it and then I'll pull it you got to keep putting Lube on while you feed it really the whole time yeah the whole time why so that it continuously has Lube on it yeah give me to pull back or nope oh uh yeah I got it all oh okay cool got it uh I felt it oh yeah it's
there I just can't can't okay do you is it there though I feel it's I feel it but it it keeps disappearing I don't know where it's going uh sorry maybe it's going back up into the conduit yeah I think so that can happen sometimes on the toilet you just got to make sure stop I don't think my fingers are do you have it though no I my fingers aren't long enough well okay is it there or not yes it is there I keep how about now you're a jerk I was like I don't know where it's
going okay TV back on wall TV back on wall ready 1 2 3 how can you guys say this is not 400 pound I'm pretty sure the Box weight was right oh guys it's not centered I'm kidding I'm totally I'm I'm totally kidding 100% kidding it's it's perfect  hands let's get this HDMI boy over here you can pull it out more maybe I just need some lube oh I have it upside down I am going to have to clean this thing yeah actually it's got a ton of fingerprints that's going to be a bit of a chore
it's going to take a minute you know first world problem sorry I need I need an hour to Cle clean my TV with that off the honeydew list it's time to take care of something that I should have done a long time ago what is this there's no charging cables for the headphones so they run out of battery half the time there's cables all over the place and the risk of accidentally unplugging something with your foot very high so we've got iicon on one side we're going to have all the power bricks
for the monitor or the icon itself all in the center and then on this side we're going to have our power bar or whatever side is closest to the outlet that makes it best I can't see through the cables they're everywhere I'm in jail are these metal oh perfect they are okay so just for something simple like this I probably won't need that 3M backing I can kind of just get it all bunched up put in our little comb here and stick awesome yeah I just don't want a dangling for someone
to kick or something like that that's pretty good so Glenn was just asking me like what actually these little iicon silver docks are that I'm plugging everything into in case you've missed it in a past video lonus explained that it passes all of the USB from the computers that are in the server room to a similar dock like this all just through the fiber cable here which is actually pretty sweet you can get all of your front IO your rear IO a USB just coming right through this fiber cable which is
kind of the only thing that makes it a cool setup all the heat is over there everything else is a mess and it's chaotic man I'm ready for this got my cable ties and different lengths got my cable arches and different sizes H why is this wall plate just hanging out step one is to fix these display port wall plates that we set up ages ago with these extensions the shorter the run and therefore the less loss we have the better with these fiber optic cables that are running through the walls and
then we should decide on one orientation for these so let's go uh cut off up cuz we're tops when it comes to cutting Corners that's how you can remember I rely on little memory tricks like that when I'm doing a repetitive job otherwise I have absolutely no chance like half of them will be one way and half of them will be the other way boy if you want to put that on the wall you got to take the outer plate off first what what Elijah told me to put the outer plate on I told you to put the
outer plate on well how are you supposed to screw the inner plate on if the outer plate is on well no it goes through the inner plate no it doesn't what no there's two screws there's the long ones those go in the inner plate and then there's the short ones that go through the outer plate are you joking right now no I'm not that's what I did with that one well what how' you I was like I told you I was like oh it's not centered and you're like oh it's fine what what do you don't no don't investigate now I
didn't know what have you done over here nothing nothing nothing you know have you ever heard the expression she doesn't find you handsome she better find you handy or something like that yeah yeah which one are you thanks buddy I am none oh I see what you did so I did it right no oh no no I see what you did I didn't say it's right you had three extra screws and a miss a misalign thing and you okay well no if you get it in and extra screws are just bonus this is for all the Zoomers out there there's four
holes that matter okay you got your inner ones okay those go into here I'm starting to get it now I was so confused see when you said it wasn't a line properly they didn't cut out large enough drywall cutouts for all of them so I thought that that's what you meant cuz I thought these holes were the ones going into what you're screwing into now no but these are just to go onto the display port now what I was kind of thinking for all the random cables under the desk was we could just take one of the Mondo
extra large ones okay and then just like hang everything from it and just as long as it's toward the back you won't really see it y that sounds good to me cool one of those things with cable management is it always gets really ugly before it gets good so but once it comes together it comes together really quick well it's not about the look under the desk it's about the look of under the desk man this looks so much better from when you don't do that yeah well that's fine yeah which
is the goal right yeah that's why there's sit stand we can keep lowering it keep going down until it looks good I know you got these as well yeah where did you want these these hold both your headset and controller right yeah these are super cool I didn't realize when I bought them from the pictures on the website that these are just 3D printed I noticed that yeah yeah the point is they're cool they're 3M mounted I don't see I mean I'm sure we could put a screw in it if they end up having a problem
but I was kind of thinking like oh there but not there I guess like there sure right then I'll do that I'll do this one cool we'll see who can be done first it's a race I can't get the I can't get the three can't how close to the front are you oh I already I already put it oh interesting okay so you're aligned with the front yeah sure yeah that was not what I meant but close enough not going to lie kind of sick um how's the cable go the cable cuz you said you wanted to
plug the cable in but the cable for the controllers is right in the top middle yeah so I was thinking about that just now I have an idea you're probably not going to like it oh that's definitely 3 pin quality that's not that bad right no no no and then just have to kind of you know or something oh so you don't ever want them Wireless they're all going to be wired yeah they'll just be wired all the time okay I think the idea was to have these hubs on top of the desk cool so I'm kind of feeling we scooch the
desk pads right aligned but then with like maybe like a 1 cm Gap or something like that okay and then these hubs can sit right there and we can just uh double-sided adhesive them I have a variety of options for mounting the hubs okay this is super cool stuff it's like a micro suction surface oh I've seen you use it before yeah if the bottom of them is smooth yes this could actually work really well cuz it's non-permanent but I also have um double-sided tape and not a word command
strips oh my God it's gone you're not supposed to do that that's not how you use command strips yes sir well now that lonus is gone he's trusting me to drill the hole ow I just stepped on a cable I'm the responsible one I think I did somehow a way cleaner job than your dad did mine looks fine his looks like someone chewed through it before your dad gets back let's pick up all the garbage cuz I think we' gotten to the point where like the cables are all organized okay that's just making more
garbage I get what lonus has to deal with now it's like dealing with me hey nice fantastic works there are no cables running across the floor there are no cables running across the floor fantastic Elijah's just finishing up yvon's machine and the only one we didn't get to touch today is mine but uh we which we did on purpose so we could show you guys the contrast between the before and after so conveniently ah I'll do mine later what can't wait till later is telling you about our sponsor Dennis
