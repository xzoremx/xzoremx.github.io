Christopher 1995 asks what are the stupidest upgrades that people buy and I got a couple good ones for this memory now memory can make a big difference to Performance but only if you need it if you check your system Ram consumption and it's well under the amount you have installed adding more is going to do absolutely zero zil NADA for you another big one is I hate watching people buy Overkill coolers for mid-range performance parts if you're spending $300 on a GP and then $100 on a water cooler for it
buy a $400 GPU it's going to perform way better shout out nexo for sponsoring this short
