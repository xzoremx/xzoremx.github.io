draft the ultimate phone but you can't choose the same brand twice for my first pick I'm choosing the screen from the s24 ultra it's highz AMOLED and it's got that cool matte display so you can see it in any weather for my camera I'm going with the red magic 9s Pro no camera bump that's all I need to sell me on a camera okay you can have it cuz for camera I'm choosing the pixel9 pro it is an amazing camera and AI oh AI oh my God for design I'm actually going with what I daily Drive the OnePlus 11 I love the
kind of plasticky back the green colors plasticky back you can have it I'm choosing the Oppo Find end fold for my design it's a shorter like passport style fold that opens in the landscape it's funny that you chose fold cuz for my screen I'm actually going the Microsoft Duo 2 you also get two screens with that just with no fold crease for gimmick I choose iOS I want my phone to run iOS but be a foldable well for my last gimmick I'll pick Motorola stylist the G5 snore comment who won
