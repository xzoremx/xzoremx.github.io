if you know anything about Linux you probably know how overwhelming it can be choosing the right version or distribution I mean look at the comments on this video where a small handful of people are only mildly upset that I didn't pick this one cuz it's for gaming or this one because it's more of a stock experience or or this one because it prominently features Justin Bieber that's right friends today we are going to be scouring the darkest corners of the internet to find some of the we
weirdest Linux dros and while some of them seem like stupid gimmicks because they are some of them have very good reasons for being the way that they are and the first one is behind this Windows 11 PC that we're going to be using to compare the exper there's nothing behind  this what Windows was Linux the whole time no it was just a bit yes it was Meet Linux FX it might look like Windows 11 sometimes in the very worst ways the good old control panel but under the hood it say Linux as any
other Linux let's take it for a test drive um okay I guess we're getting  FX so while this is called power toys it was based off an older version called power tools but then they kind of got in some trouble trouble because of Microsoft's licensing and like stealing the name essentially uhuh I found out later that this Linux FX drro actually has had a lot of issues with basically just rebranding names and stealing IPS and stuff oh so they've tried to get around it by making it as similar as
possible but not interact the same way as possible cool it's funny because they they go out of their way to add basically what looks like the control panel and then don't make it work like the control panel at all okay but hey I can rightclick this and configure my network connections y oh okay hold on this one I can interact with this looks and feels about like the current iteration of the start menu for Better or For Worse yep I can open Thunderbird mail you want to know my
favorite part you know how I said that they were kind of getting in trouble for stealing things yeah go change the wallpaper oh yeah yeah cuz this is obviously stolen yeah uh okay yep do you notice there's one wallpaper here that you might recognize at the very top wait it ships with this yes by default when you install this it includes this as one of the wallpapers  lines bro why does this one exist well if you want to convince people to join the Freedom Movement you have to offer
more than just the savings of not needing a Windows license or costly Apple Hardware you have to offer familiarity and some dros like this one aim to do that through a combination of similar design and strong documentation and Forum support it's kind of a one two punch of come on in the water's warm ooh  Brody oh I just heard we've gotten nine more of these to experience including the Justin Bieber one and I was like segue seg segue oh like seg seg seg no MSI with its onepiece perforated front
panel support for both AO coolers and big beefy graphics cards and patented DIY friendly design their MPG gungar 300r airflow is the ultimate choice for gamers check it out at the link below  ultimate if our first Linux was neutral good willing to break a couple of eggs to make a freedom omelet our next two are definitely chaotic evil bibian and Hannah Montana Linux which were built on puppy lucid and kubuntu respectively let's start with bibian and I've been asked to wear headphones which is
troubling so you can right click on the desktop if you want to look into some  um if you can't tell this is very old by the picture of Justin Bieber yeah no tattoos even no fresh out of his baby facee paint I guess can you  um my goodness look the mouse sensitivity is a little funky okay just   M oh Canadian flag I seee where this is going our one Canadian artist you're going to notice it's very stalk there's like not much to do when this operating system came out it was honestly meant as
a joke yeah you just plug it into someone's computer you reboot their computer so the next day they go to work they have Justin Bieber blasting music or I can't hear any music though am I supposed to there should be music coming out of this one oh neat yeah again also very old if you can't tell based on the picture of Hannah Montana yes I think you mean Miley Cyrus but yes no that's Hannah Montana she's like my age she was a children's entertainer well that's basically what you do
now I actually like this one over the bebian it feels a little bit more fleshed out as a desktop yeah I think you could actually use this if you really wanted to although you wouldn't want to unless you had really old Hardware I suspect which is fair enough but given that's true of most Linux dros you'd probably choose one that has unique features that have real world benefits like say for example vinu OS a build for the visually impaired that is based on Ubuntu and features a screen reader to read off
what the user clicks on or hovers over as well as support for external Braille displays uh by the way those are wildly expensive but hey if it means people who aren't adequately served by mainstream osses can use a computer that is absolutely great oh there's a challenge cuz we've been having audio issues let's make sure our actual screen reader Works uh okay so just try clicking or hovering over something window that just said window window I see yes this needs to be better
yes do you think that you could map wanck with your eyes  window um no okay that's fair In fairness it wouldn't be intended to be used with your eyes closed necessarily uh many people with visual impairments are are are able to see somewhat um however this is just window not helpful so I think the original developers started getting you to a point where maybe you could install this and then if you knew enough get a couple more plugins to help you get there but as as it is right now it is not very
good about this computer to help check men system settings check it literally just reads off everything and it's very overwhelming I feel like this is the most Linux thing ever panel window panel page TBL list panel clearly vinx wasn't able to reach the lofty goals of its creators but I would be curious to know if there's anyone out there who is using Linux as an effective Aid whether it's with plugins or applications or another Dro that you're aware of that's a little more ready to
go out of the box let us know what you're doing with it and if there was a steep learning curve or if it was just something you could jump right into speaking of learning Ed YouTu education Linux so Linux then their mission as stated on their site is to bring the freedom of the Linux desktop and the vast library of Open Source education software to the classroom blending both software and games they aim to bring back the old feeling of going to the computer lab at lunch and trying to beat
your friend's high score in Math Circus you want one of the games I do yeah so there's a ton 100% games well okay there's look like real games let's Okay Ed you so there's summon mathematics matics here we go tux math let's go I played this at work just to test it and then I went home and played it for about another 30 minutes really arcade uh yep arcade game works and then you can start with space cadet that's just the first one you can start with Ranger that's the third
one start with Ace that's the fourth one all right get ready okay what what so you got to got to answer oh my God who I mean who knows 19 times two out of the oh oh okay there you go yeah whoa that really quickly escalated what just happened keep going whoa okay 8us -20 jeez let's go okay uh oh crap that's not -6 oh there we go okay I I read it wrong okay sure uh uh so what that 45 what the hell is 126 ID -9 is there uh what what do the math um is there irrational like can I is
that a real number4 what do you mean -4 you can't divide something by negative a number - 60 um um - 30 n no 29 damn it oh no look at tux he's running away convert all this is actually a really cool tool you can convert anything to anything that's amazing so from kilometers to grams I mean doesn't mean it'll work but it gives you the option to have anything Apparently one kilometer equals one gram so aside from games it has those types of tools as well I actually want you I I wrote it
down here so I didn't mess up the word hold on can you find the ecliptic obliquity of the sun there's a dedicated app to help you find that of course there is but it might be a science yeah um just chill uh I mean sun is definitely involved in whatever this is oh it is this it is this app but you kind of messed up by clicking on the lens you need to actually click on the sun itself because what this does is it puts you in a geographical location close to you uh at the time of day where you're at so
not necessarily the same day uhhuh and the sun will be in the appro position as to the date you are at or the time you are at you can click on it and find a bunch of stats about it it's actually kind of cool  lonus okay in all seriousness I cannot see the sun right now it's raining and miserable and cloudy okay the app has a purpose tux typing let's go I can't read  they are very spaced out oh my gosh it's it's actually really hard you go ahead you can't even type yeah he has to go over all my
scripts no that's not it I just mean you're slow if you read them for me I can type them Court okay flood food damn it Stoke floor cello cell green damn it Elijah sorry sir it was actually pry pretty cool the amount of apps they had yeah and while you could make the argument that these simple apps could just as easily be loaded on a machine with Windows 95 it also includes more complex software to run basic simulations calculators that can graph in 3D and even electrical engineering programs to
help you map out a PCB or circuit board on to Red Star OS which first started development back in 1998 but has since had four major revisions including updates as recently as 2019 what is red star OS you might ask why it's North Korea's operating system of choice based originally on Red Hat Linux redstar took on a more Windows 95 look before ending up I don't know old school Mac OS according to a study back in 2015 red star OS is very tough to tamper with as when it's connected to
the internet it will check for system changes and essentially brick itself in the event that someone tries anything it doesn't like like gaining rout access or deleting files they also found that it tags western or outside media that was passed around on USB sticks to help track its location and lock it out unfortunately we're not going to be able to test any of that since that would mean connecting this to the internet and you know what I think I'll pass uh I still think looking into
an OS like this is cool though because we can see where the priorities are for a user base that only has access to certain software I see you managed to get some Western media on here yeah when I was trying to test it I was trying to test that tagging of the watermark because they found out it actually goes on the metadata of the file but again that only worked when connected to the network and again you did connect it to the network no I never connected it to the network I see so can I change the
language to English or like no but you can select the country as Canada cool we can use Google Translate on our phone oh right hey look at that that there we go hey in Korean star is the same as star in English is that just taking the image of the star and just making it a different star I I don't know I don't know but it's good it's cool uh oh wow oh okay uh computer information here we go we have 3.45 gigs of memory and now we know that it essentially is just a strip down system
as well with an internet access you have a web browser at the bottom a media player to be able to play media just probably not Western media right a calendar that has all the holidays stripped out of it right it's just a calendar right because why would you need holidays yeah I don't need to know when you know July 1st is right wait no that's can oh yeah Canada yeah sorry I thought it was America you're not secretly American are you I have a couple challenges for this one
I'm supposed to try to delete a file apparently yeah so try to delete something that would be integral yes on the system maybe an application or something okay you might have to use the Google translate and this might take a while electron hydroxy group also known as a calculator uh okay well let me see if I can figure out how to actually open a file browser like can you yep okay all right I'll find it I'll find it oh well here here here I can just cheat I'll just take a file that I already know
okay yes I would like a hint files are  god so let's delete a default application seag Wang office processing yeah time to go buddy a lot of the default apps will not even give you the option to delete no thank you sir I simply will not oh no oh it just won't let you access is denied okay how did you manage to get it to Brick itself I didn't that was the requirement for the internet if someone gains root access it basically is pinging some Home Server that Home Server will go whoa something's wrong
and issue a command to reboot it at a stock State wow so it turns out Linux is sometimes about the freedom and openness to oppress your citizens um let's move on to something more positive shall we suicide Linux you have got to be kidding me is that that's a thing yes sir technically this is not a distribution like the ones that we've shown so far but there was no way we were not going to include this it's a Debian package that can be installed onto your OS that makes it so that if you mess up a command any
command it immediately wipes your drive and if you're wondering why this exists  alone sorry uh it's actually based on an autocomplete function that was originally intended to help people who mistyped a really long command maybe they misook the s for a dollar sign and then it would actually help complete the command well then user q&amp;m had a different idea instead he had it just resolved to rm-rf slash which means remove recursive so all of it subfolders and force meaning it doesn't ask for
confirmation then that slash that's the top level directory so anything below that great but that's how I asked why fun all right what's the challenge all right I got three you're allowed to use Google because you might not know the command off by heart install an application okay I want you to create a new folder somewhere and then I want you to change your time zone okay using the  uh sure I made a directory cool you want  it he deleted something and and then just retype the exact well I'm
thinking I'm making really sure I don't screw this   on this is the point I'm making there's some very very long commands that you  Linux wait it should have deleted by now it should have killed me I didn't even notice I typoed that um why do you think oh it should have killed you wait is it just a delayed death it might be taking its time I think I'm dying right now yeah yes that looks very not great and as someone who has killed Linux before what is the point of having 
oh um hello let me tell you yes do it I say this is about what it looks like stop can't believe that would happened so fast if you looked at that and went dang I am not into that kind of pressure got to type everything perfectly or my stuff gets deleted maybe I'd be better off with something that doesn't save my files in the first place hey we've got that too that's where tiny core comes in it is a 16 megabyte distribution that yes my friends even includes a graphical user interface to put that in context
the highest quality photos taken on a Galaxy s23 Ultra can be double that size for just an image it also sits only in Ram and doesn't write to the boot drive by default meaning that every boot just reverts back to its stock State now of course a prime use for this is loading everything up the way that you like it and carrying it around on a USB that you can take from computer to computer and we've got a challenge for this one as  in I'm going to plug in this USB mhm wow
you already got it that was really fast I was going to say mount it but I didn't even get to plug it in yet okay okay 128 megabytes of ram I mean realistically anything newer than a Pentium 2 is going to have that anyway so that's still pretty darn impressive a lot of people actually use these types of os's for like a POS system oh that makes sense right so it's picking up any mirror downloads to make sure your drivers and systems are up to date got it okay comes with terminal yep and
terminal y you can have any application you want as long as it's terminal well again like you said this could be used to save things directly to the dis so theoretically this could become a toolkit or again something you take it computer to computer very cool we've talked a lot on this channel about being conscious of e-waist and using a lightweight drro like this can be a great method of extending ending the life of older Hardware Windows 11's minimum requirements for memory are 4 GB
here's a visual comparison showing you just how much 4 gigs is compared to the 128 megabytes that this device was able to run on now while all the dros we've looked at today can be run as a live environment meaning that you never have to install them if you don't want to this next one is one you would pretty much never install but it could be the most relevant one on this list depending on what you're into system rescue is a Linux that is intended to be run off a USB drive and comes packed with tons of
tools to help you diagnose issues with your PC or if you're in it it can be a portable troubleshooting kit that you carry from workstation to workstation to help your clients when say for example their Windows install won't boot it's got drive partition management DD rescue which can help save data that may have been corrupted m test for checking if your RAM is bad rsync for backups and lots more let's give it a shot well I what we're going to do is we're actually going to boot up to our windows I want
to find our file here and we're going to delete it then we're going to reboot into system rescue and use that to recover my deleted files heck yeah show  are I don't get it you delting like fat fingering Oh I thought you were just calling me obese I was like brother what no okay all these pictures are in our pictures folder yes we can see that I am going to shift delete them which in Windows will permanently delete them not put them in the recycle bin see you later buddies oh no technician I
deleted my pictures can you help me all right first thing hit that power button immediately that is correct though because if you rewrite over the data you won't be able to recover it that's right by default it is a terminal like this it does come with a gooey if we just typ start x uh no space you would have died in suicide [Laughter] Linux depending on the drivers you have installed it might flicker like this that makes sense oh okay well that's not what I oh okay well hello this is going
to be our Windows basic data partition so that's there that's cool we found the  folder I I I kind of misled you I'm sorry oh this one actually doesn't have a gooey but I'm saying the other application that are on this does have a gooey so let's open up our Command Prompt so this is if you want to keep track of whatever you're doing I do cool so then you're going to want to find our drive and on this case you're going to want to go to EFI GPT awesome and now you're going to want
to do Advanced that's if I don't want to chat with it I just want to EFI with it I was wondering who was going to make that joke someone had to do it you're going to want to go to undelete there we go bad instructions dick sucking GPU fan I thought you called me a dick sucking GPU fan I was very confused for a second I was like what okay well break me please I found it yeah okay so now you can select using using the instructions below what you want to grab no not the Snapchat data though unselect that you
don't want that it's just because the pictures were taken using SnapChat that doesn't help my case editor cut that it's pictures of my cat I swear not so C to copy the selected files yeah and now you can oh I can copy them some yeah so I'll put them on the desktop sure did it copy everything yeah so it actually copied it right now to a temp location on our USB drive mhm in this case then we could remap our C drive as a file location here and we could copy it back over very cool that right there is why just
deleting your files before throwing out or selling your hard drive is not secure as long as nothing has been overwritten they are still there and using tools like this they can be retrieved now we don't have too much more to explore here that would be funny or experimental but we will leave a download link for this one and all the other dros in case you want to try them which I guess brings us to our last drro Elijah what oh you're not even what are you even doing I'm installing our new
drro or last one I guess all right let's go we're doing wuntu Ubuntu no no ooo I see yeah isn't it cute it's cute I love it this seems more modern yes so this is again is based off of Ubuntu a more Mo you got a dogo Dogo Dogo what isn't it Dogo no well it's like Pogo yeah but it's spelled with two G's isn't a pogo stick spell with two G's no that would be Pogo which is a completely different thing this OS actually again like you said is more modern more up to dat it also com with a lot more okay you don't
need it is oh it is 2 G's Pogo the  poggers that's appropriate that's a twitch term it's snake oh it's snake oh it's multiplier snake oh that's so cool so I can't hit another snake either no is this bone stock it comes with Spotify and steam and cupit torrent and all kinds of things that I definitely wouldn't use yeah sure uh no it's not bone stock and that's why it's just a little bit different [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this is what I'm talking about I am cursed this this is a
drro that comes with steam pre-installed and I managed to break it simply by trying to launch it this seems like a very complete experience yeah it even has Thunderbolt in the settings Thunderbolt 3 support really using Ubuntu as its base wuntu just adds some a nice little theme and then comes with a bunch of apps that you'd probably download anyway it also includes guides to help get you up and running like the one that shows you how to enable the proton compatibility layer for non
compatible gam so you can play pretty much anything you want on Linux big asterisk Ubuntu was made by two students in Spain who wanted to try to have fun making their own drro they started out just wanting to learn how to do it and then it evolved into them creating something that they would actually want to daily Drive which when you dig a little deeper and see how this Dro comes out of the box I get it I mean I'm not like an anime person or anything but this already seems less overwhelming and
in some ways more friendly than some of what's out there of course there are a few things I would do differently which come to think of it how about we make a Dro to call our own that's a good idea leave some suggestions down below of what you'd like to see in an LT distro and maybe just maybe we'll take a crack at Linus Linux Linux Elijah by the way while you're down there we know we haven't even scratched the surface of what's out there let us know if you've got a favorite Dro that
you'd like to see us check out in a second installment all I need now is a segue to my favorite sponsor we interrupt this video to clarify that like his children lonus loves all his sponsors equally including day one Journal journaling is great for creativity capturing moments that matter and uncluttering your brain but one of the most annoying parts of journaling is having to carry a physical book around with you everywhere and a pen day one is an app that gives you a fresh and easy
way to keep and organize journals for all aspects of your life whether you're at an an amateur wrestling show for a friend's birthday or just on a nature walk by yourself you can capture these memories with written words photos videos or audio clips in one place journaling can help you better understand your own brain and create new ways to navigate stress and if you still need your physical journals filled on your bookshelf day one even offers book printing so try day one Journal today go
to day1 app.com LT and use code LT to start your 2month free trial of Day One Premium if you guys enjoyed this video go check out the Linux challenge where Luke and I both switched to Linux as a daily driver for one month and no maybe it is not time we Revisited that not yet when Steam OS has broader compatibility I'm going to do it
