happy Friday everybody and welcome to the W show we have a fantastic show lined up for you guys this week because both den and Luke are in  yeah and they D just trying to fly away apparently they're in good mood so rarely they don't know how to express it so they're just awkward yeah I don't know what this emotion is I'm scared on the show we'll be talking about the video that we did on me taking the A+ exam and the fact that it is down we will also be live verifying whether my
certificate is still active or not if it's not we have to like burn it or something I guess so I I think that's how it works yeah uh we'll also be talking about my experience so far with the iPhone 16 plus which I have a lot of notes about oh like lot oh what else we got this week Luke uh the WordPress Feud is kind of bad news for like a bunch of the internet uh and also a bunch of M1 Maxs are breaking really I guess Apple wants you to finally upgrade oh huh that's one way to do it 
the show is brought to you today by super micro MSI Ridge and of course our chair partner secret lab our laptop partner LG and our rap partner dbrand it's a lot Partners they wrapped our table we have so many partners we're like an open relationship chel look like that one in Seattle but not quite we got a long way to go there's a thing in Seattle oh have you heard of that that Dan why does Dan know about this Dan where did you come from again everybody knows about it we're all we're all in it
uh there's like a massive pole in Seattle or something like that and there's so many jokes there it's like "30,000 40,000 people how big is it I" actually don't know what the real number W okay well why don't we talk about tech for a little bit shall we I originally planned to do only one video on the iPhone 16 oh you're doing more well I'm going to I'm going to talk about it I'm going to talk about it a little bit iPhone Wars the original plan was one video I was going to wait I was
going to use it for like a month wait for iOS 18.1 to come out which is going to have the new Apple intelligence features so that I could do one video reviewing the complete iPhone 16 experience except here's a small problem okay this is my document of notes so far whoa that's more than a video if those are good like you know some times a whole section of notes comes down into like a line but if if those are you know not very compressible that's multiple videos this is one of the buggiest
device experiences that I have had in recent memory W and I shouldn't say it's not just the bugginess either so and you're 100% sure it's bugginess it's not unfamiliarity I'll tell you what I'm about to send a file to Dan that is probably going to blow your mind I you you're sending this file through teams is this teams no what do you mean I'm sending this file through teams no no no no it's a screen recording team or no sorry it's a it's a camera clip it's it's a clip I recorded okay yeah yeah
yeah I'm just I'm just sending a file to to den he's going to play it for the show but are you doing it through teams what yeah okay it doesn't matter okay the sending is not the issue no no it's just a file okay I miss yeah yeah yeah yeah no no no no no no oh dude no I know teams is a steaming pile of fun um I really like by the way if anyone from Microsoft is watching um I genuinely feel like I could be helpful if you wanted to improve teams I have some very easily actionable
extremely massively improving feedback that I could give you and look how good his hair is today yeah you got to take somebody seriously when they have hair this good that's a that's probably a Microsoft thing yeah they probably care yeah they they care a lot hear me out I  Balmer that's why they had all those problems more like Baldur um uh L you can't attack people for like male pattern baldness that's like half of our audience is oh yeah can you not it's fine I thought I was going to be
bald my whole life cuz my dad was bald and I didn't know that's not how that worked yeah I thought I was too because I was told it's the the men on your mother's side and my grandfather went bald in high school oh yeah see my grandpa had hair the whole time from a very young age I was like well that was part of the reason that I would dyee my hair like wacky colors and school I was like while I got enjoy it while you have it I just never cared I thought my dad was cool he was bald so I was like
whatever I'll just be bald okay Dan do you have that file ready for us yep okay uh can he hear audio is that something that we can just do smoothly now or is that is that still hit or miss No it should be should be good to go let's do it okay play the clip okay well if you want I've always wanted to say play the clip play the clip all right let's see uh let's see if I mess this up uh fade   intentional wait is it playing like four songs at once or  334 oh my and that's not that's not a
problem with your car that's not as I've never had a problem with Android auto in my car like that all right um so it's so there's so many layers of problems here that's not the song that was on the display okay it was playing at what sounded like at least double the speed yeah yeah yeah yeah and the counter was obviously broken now fixing it was as simple as turning it off and turning it back on okay right but the issue is that I've had a number of those types of problems here's another fun one uh I was
I haven't daily driven an iOS device in a long time and back when I used to iPhone I used to game on my phone from time to time and one of the games that I liked as just like a pass the time toilet game was jetpack joy ride and as I was going through and Ticking all of the boxes that uh for all the apps that I used to have and just kind of you know Mass dumping apps onto the phone because when I did the uh migration wizard it prompted me for if I wanted to migrate my apps and the migration wizard wizard
is specifically an Android app so it asks me do you want to migrate your apps and I'm like sure that sounds convenient so it'll just like grab Twitter and no it just it didn't install any of them absolutely none absolutely zero um so anyway I was manually installing my apps and like a caveman I fired up jetpack joy ride and I was like okay let's uh let's play this game and I was sitting on the floor next to the cats and I was like to do yeah I am I don't know firing bullets to fire
my Jetpack or whatever and I put it down like this and it auto rotated to the other side and then I went oh shoot I should have gotten a video of that because it wouldn't come back uh okay well that's apparently resolved now the developers over at Apple are working fast they're they're getting it done but and I don't think I've gotten any updates so that I'm just trolling oh you know what I bet it was no I bet I I bet I know how to rep it now hold on give me a sec give me a sec I think I
can probably replicate it here we go okay so I'm resuming I'm putting it down it's going to flip the other way blah blah blah blah blah blah I bring it back yeah it's upside down yeah why is it upside down Luke it's a really cool level in Jetpack Joy Ride where you have to you have to oh well oh I don't know that seems weird you'd think it would rotate yeah yeah you think rotation lock isn't on so rotation lock is on oh but it will only lock one exactly one way that just
sounds like an apple thing I don't think that's a bug no it's it's an well it's an apple thing in that it is Apple obstinately refusing to implement a landscape lock on iOS so iOS only has a portrait lock portrait orientation lock iPad OS and actually iOS on the iPad both support landscape orientation lock but iOS does not so if you have your display locked and an app forces landscape mode you can only hold it one exactly one wait I was going to say I'm steal this from someone in full plan
chat named a unique username but I you're just holding it wrong um classic apple problem the thing is that I'm not because the camera bump is here and if I hold it like this that blows whereas if I hold it like this it's a lot better hold on can I hold it for a sec yeah absolutely I wonder you know you don't have to ask permission right sorry okay and this whole this whole orientation lock I think I disagree really H finger connects there if I go like this nothing touches the
camera uh this is more comfortable you have much larger hands than me which to be clear is fine if Some people prefer this way and some people prefer this way that's totally cool unless your name is Apple in which case that is not totally cool not allowed um and so the so we used iPhones as teleprompters volume buttons are up uh we use tele we use iPhones as teleprompters and so the inability to lock them in landscape and leave them has resulted in us needing to do this really obnoxious um onset maneuver
that we call the dip so every time the iPhone every time one of the camera operators you know let's go the camera to you know do something with their hands or whatever and picks it back up it'll it'll have gone back to to Portrait orientation or whatever and I'll have to be like do the dip and they have to go like this with the whole camera rig and then lift it back up in order to reorient the teleprompter because you cannot lock it in landscape mode and so even apps that do Force the
iPhone to go to landscape mode will leave it locked in the the wrong orientation potentially because it doesn't properly have a landscape orientation lck and dude there have been so many things like that there's a lot of stuff that's really good in fact I would say probably a solid 60 to 70% of this is really good stuff their background playback is so cool so check this out I'm going to I'm going to load something up on my Plex um okay so check this out we're going to go we're going
to go oh and the speakers are great speakers are freaking amazing okay okay that was another thing did you see how I swiped it up and it went up into the dynamic Island sure okay this time it goes to picture and picture I I can't find the pattern here that's probably how much you're yeah I thought that um and then I swiped it really fast and it like totally didn't go up into the island huh so I don't know I I haven't looked it up I will I will figure that out before I cannot get YouTube to go
picture and picture no matter what I do uh but Plex sometimes goes on the island sometimes goes picture and picture but when it is working check this out check this out background playback watch this boom tucked it over there background playback still going there's a little arrow boom bring it back out like that so cool that's neat that's nice if you're into background playback um that's a really cool sort of extra background that you can that you can push your back to and you know what I'm
sure there's variants of Android that do support stuff like that um but this was my first experience with it and I loved it oh I have a whole paragraph on this do you see what's going on on the phone right now yeah camera's open okay this this camera button is probably the greatest difference between how good an idea seems on paper and how bad it is in practice that I have ever seen in theory it's great I want to use my camera I'm like boom camera button let's go I'm taking pictures boom boom
I'm taking pictures with this button let's go you can also click it a little bit and you can like adjust stuff and it's it's super cool you can zoom you can zoom let's go let's zoom in practice the ratio of times I hit it on purpose to times I hit it by accident is about 1 to five cuz every time I hold the bloody phone where else am I supposed to hold it it's got the volume buttons over here the action button over here it's got the lock button over here it's got the camera button where the hell am I
supposed to hold this phone and not have it start changing my volume or locking itself for freaking opening the camera it's driving me absolutely crazy yes I know I'm holding it wrong ghost of jobs I don't care if I'm going to complain about a Bixby button I'm going to complain about a camera button it's that simple um my phone has a camera button I don't have issues with it well how nice for you Dan how nice for you animations make iOS feel freaking slow sometimes like just every single time
you unlock your phone you need to wait around for that oh and the fact that you have to the fact that you have to interact with the screen to unlock the phone drives me crazy can you do it again sorry can I see it again oh well first I have to buy oh my God sorry okay so first you biometrically authenticate I am unlocked right now okay but I have to interact with it again I have to wait around for that animation cuz mine has an animation too but it's a lot faster yeah yeah and you
don't have to touch your screen in order to get rid of the the lock screen so for those of you who are iOS users you can just touch your touch sensor or face your phone and you are just at the desktop you don't have to swipe at it um yeah oh man what else you can turn off the animations in accessibility why does Apple hide so actually I have a whole paragraph on that or Dan good why does Apple hide all the coolest features under accessibility they have this uh they have this new
display Tech that allows them to go all the way down to one knit and apparently we haven't actually tested whether it can do one knit or not but uh what I can tell you is it gets really dim at night as long as you go into the accessibility menu and enable whatever this is called um whatever this little Sun thing here in the control center like why especially if you're going to have the feature in your keynote why why is it hidden in accessibility it's like when for so long
they hid a mouse support on the iPad accessibility maybe it's a bid to try to  options I think that seems like a maybe Apple thing that I I I don't think so I'm going to I'm going to go with no I have considered uh no yeah I have no idea um Android locks them in developer mode yeah but I feel like it has less of them to lock if you know what I mean um I'm going to I'm going to add a note here um check the animation speed thing see if it can be improved um the thing that I'm
pretty sure can't is I'm pretty sure you have to physically interact with the device in order to unlock it and that's the thing that slows me down the most because I pretty much like I I I pretty much need a second hand in order to in order to here hold on I pretty much need a second hand in order to get all the way to the bottom especially on the plus and if you can't get all the way to the bottom you can't just swipe here cuz that'll just pull up your notifications and you can't just go
again it doesn't it does you have to get all the way down to the bottom in order to unlock it another thing that drives me absolutely crazy is the scrolling speed is locked it's gated so when I'm just like scrolling through a news feed or something like here I bet I bet have you tried to daily drive an iPhone like ever okay so just scroll through a Newsfeed and see how that feels for you just like like your open eBay oh and I don't know how to go back on iPhone oh man I got a I got like two paragraphs on
that I already I got stuck in literally less than a second dude that's a user error to be clear but dude I've got I've got two paragraphs on back because how do you go back well there's I didn't see a back there's a gesture there's a back gesture where you swipe from the left oh it's from the other so when you're when you're like in a in a you know browser window or whatever else you just go for okay well I'm not uh oh right I'm not using Chrome I'm using Safari I'm trying
to have the Apple experience okay so I'm on LTT store uh if I want to go back I go like that yeah and if I want to go between tabs I go like that it's actually yeah that's kind of cool um and I have a whole two paragraphs on the convenience of the back gesture when it works because there's still so many apps that use the old iOS Paradigm of back is up in in the top left which is for a right-handed user the single worst possible place to have the back button iOS whether Apple users know it or not
iOS needs a proper Universal back something and so I've started documenting all the times I've encountered when back gesture doesn't go back I wonder if do you think you could I I think you should try to pour through the accessibility options because I wonder if you can switch which side it goes back I will but it doesn't matter because it just isn't I'm just thinking cuz like needing to swipe from the left hand side sounds less convenient to oh yeah it's possible that there's an
accessibility option for that I'm I I'm not done this is just this is raw notes and this is what I would take into sitting down top review and then I would I would go and I would figure out if they're if they're valid or not like I specifically have stuff in here that I'm like um check check into this uh follow this up um anyway so here is a news feed so flip like you're like trying to get past ads and stuff that's too slow it's way too slow it it feels like you oh interesting if I if I like pre reload
some things by scrolling a bunch and then scroll all the way back up uh I can get it to go quick but only for like a little little bit like if you go all the way to the top and then try to crank it'll go it's still not the speed but it feels artificially slowed down what it isn't is the speed that I'm moving my finger yeah whereas an Android phone for the most part will scroll as fast as you flick it I did one flick with my thumb and I got all the way through the whole news real down to where it had to load
more and one just which feels way more natural than I am I am quickly coming back to my old conclusion that iOS is best enjoyed by people who aren't as busy as I am because pretty much everything takes a little bit longer on iOS pretty much everything I do in spite of how slow the note 9 is when I'm not gated by the S so so installing an app for instance is much faster on the I phone compared to a 5-year-old phone or however old that stupid thing is sure um but in terms of just the 
keyboard why can you install third party keyboards yes okay and even swift key I can't resize Oh weird okay and I can't I can't long press for special characters I'm one of the few people remaining on the planet who cares about punctuation and I like actually just literally can't on this thing like yeah I can navigate is that actually not a thing there's no yeah no I can navigate to a submenu of special characters and then what about second submenu of special characters and
I can I've noticed that that drives me actually insane I hate this second I hate the second menu oh my God people are saying you can where you can resize the key it's probably in accessibility options just long press on the key yeah people are saying long press works for them and you can resize the keyboard these are in Linus's defense these are notes they're not done okay hold on hold on hold on no no I'm going to switch I'm going to switch my keyboard I'm going to switch my keyboard right now you guys
are going to show me what are you guys talking about are you talking about like accents like an accent what he means that's not what he means that is super duper not what I'm talking about to hold press what is it four and then you get asterisk or whatever like he wants that that type of stuff hold the bottom left Emoji oh my God it is  like some people are saying accessibility how much better um iOS could  um and isn't okay I'm going to go I'm going into accessibility we're headed
into the accessibility menu because that's apparently where all the good things on the iPhone are okay here we go side button camera control camera control yeah you can just disable that so that might be what I end up needing to do um hearing devices subtitles and captioning speech ex keyboard and typing here we go here we go here we go okay hover typing key repeat show lowercase Keys slow Keys sticky keys it was saying long press the globe I thought that was a joke but long press the globe okay
hold on hold on hold on hack the world hack the world hack the planet long press the globe okay here we go here we go long press the globe okay keyboard settings here we go here we go here we go okay uh long press the globe was apparently a real sentence I I literally thought they were just trolling everything's so OB fiscated okay so I have a one I have a one-handed keyboard here I have show math results um period shortcut slide to type delete SL to type by word enable dictation Auto
punctuation I don't know what you guys are talking about so the bottom options to scoot it to the left or right why would I want to do that I don't think that's what he means by resize oh my God you can resize it as long as you resize it exactly the way that Apple wants you to resize it you guys don't see this is the funny thing is it's just like the T9 dialing thing where talking to iOS users is a little hard they it almost feels like we're speaking a completely different language when I
say resize a keyboard I mean move it wherever the you want and make it any size you want um that is not resizing a keyboard well I mean it is but but not in the way that you meant it's not a stupid feature no it's cool cuz it by shoving it to one side especially if you have smaller hands you can you can reach all the keys significant really more easily and by being able to put it to either side that means that it can work that way for uh people that are left or right-handed uh
especially say if you only have one hand um but what he's talking about is is completely different pug boy asks but how many people really do these things often nobody nobody does them often you do them one time so that your phone works really well for you I'm pretty sure I set up my keyboard like close to a decade ago and just every time I've migrated Android it just comes with me yeah like I don't know I don't remember last time I did anything with the keyboard but I spent quite a while like
grinding on keyboard settings like forever ago found a thing that I like and now I can like go fast and everything seems good oh man this is like such a this is a take that just drives me crazy cin says yes it's a device not for someone like you that's the point I hope they don't make it like you want that would be an Android no what it would just be a better iPhone and and then if you never wanted to turn any of that stuff on you could just not just yeah just buried under settings additional settings are
like basically never bad as long as they're dumped in menus so dump deeper in menus so when I say long press guys you want them in front of the users here let me let me explain what I mean um long pressing for special characters oh my God you're not going to be able to see this well that's it's quite a flashbang you have there yeah I know right so basically what happens is every one of my characters every one of my Alpha Characters has a secondary character on it so Q is
percent W is um the little hat I always forget what that thing's called uh I've got my parenthesis over on the right over here I've got my at on the a uh so all I have to do is long press for 200 milliseconds and I can type that special character and like I dialed that in so mine is shorter than 200 milliseconds so if you type really quickly on your phone then it's super useful to be able to say hey if I hold it ever so slightly longer I get a special character instead of
interacting one two three times in order to type a special character um assuming that it's two menus deep which it sometimes very well can be and when I say resize your keyboard um what I mean is here let me get into the uh let me get into the settings for this this  and I hate actually editing this because uh like once I get kind of dialed into it I'm yeah pretty fast uh when I say resize your keyboard I mean like like that or like that or like that or like however you want basically I I mean
actually resize your keyboard oh reset there we go um I don't mean give me a couple options if I like to type  um yeah yeah four presses including getting back to letters yes you're right so yeah guys um how many times do you change its size that's the whole point you change it one time um and if you change phones for example if you were to go from a regular iPhone to an iPhone plus you might be really used to using a smaller keyboard and it may be beneficial for you a to be able to type
more accurately to just set it to a smaller size and B to get back more of your screen space that's one of the things that blows me away about the iPhone 2 is how how UND the interface is there is no way to change the home screen layout to be a by five tile grid you can't do it it's just by4 it's like okay but I I don't I don't like that I like to see more things on my screen it's like nope nope you can't at least you can have blank spaces now at least you can have at least you can have blank 
um apparently you can touch the one two three button and then slide into the normal keyboard area to get special characters okay let's try that the one two three button and then slide yes you can so that gives you a relatively limited number of special characters because it uses up a whole row with numbers but it does give you the main ones it's slower but it's less slower thank you that's helpful yes that's very that's very helpful to know pretty neat um I was so disappointed though to
discover that uh and yes that works on swift key as well because that is the Apple implementation I was so disappointed to discover that my third party keyboard didn't operate the way that I would want it to because to me that's kind of the point of a third party like if the apple one is super locked down I don't really mind that too much as long as you know you could install another one so anyway there's been a lot of things that have just been a little slower and a little frustrating but
there's been a lot of things that are really good and I realize I've been really focused on the frustrating things um the easy access to the dictation button is amazing uh regardless of what keyboard you're using you don't have to like long press anything it's completely separate from the keyboard it's just down on the bottom and it just works like immediately and part of my problem with dictation on this thing is that it's like old and buggy and just kind of a piece of crap but that doesn't change
the fact that I have absolutely appreciated that I also love the better integration with third party calling apps on Android like teams when you're on Android auto for example the interface is terrible I don't actually think there's a way to hang up a WhatsApp call with my Android phone and my car when I when when I'm when I'm using Android auto like if I want to hang up the call I either have to tell the other person to do it or I have to like do it on my phone which you're not
supposed to do uh whereas on iOS and with carplay the interface other than just saying this is a teams call this is a WhatsApp call it looks exactly the same as a regular phone call which is something that I really appreciate it's a big deal um car kakaro says oh yeah does it callon yes it does hey that's a big Improvement so that's something that's pretty big it won't call almost anyone else um I haven't figured out a fast way to sync my Google contacts with it just yet oh well that's not it so
what's funny is my address book is like uh it's like a a Time capsule from back when I daed an iPhone so I was like who are all these who are all these people cuz I've since purged my address book multiple times um so that's been kind of fun it would be kind of neat actually if there would be a way to be like I haven't contacted this person like show me all the contacts that I haven't contacted in over a decade so and then a purge all but so I haven't okay I haven't figured out the contact sync
thing because it hasn't been a priority I'm not saying you can't do it um but what happened is they appear to have moved it so your accounts menu used to be in the settings menu as one of the like top level things so you could stop it so accounts if I recall correctly and I I I might be gaslighting myself but I feel like accounts used to be here and so you had all of your like third party accounts and stuff now it's not there um and I think the way to sing it is to use
like the um apparently go under the mail section to find accounts yeah that's what I was about to say I think the way to sync it is to use the Apple Mail app which I don't use I use the Gmail app so I have a whole paragraph on this as well where I was like if I use Gmail and I had no intention of using the Apple Mail account because of the way they've changed that interface let me know on this by the way guys did it did it used to did it used to be there like I imagine
it used to because I could have sworn it was just in the top level of the settings menu there was just an accounts thing Sam Phoenix is saying lonus has gaslighted himself it has always been that way it's always been that no Frey says yes it used to be in the main settings yes fight yes there used to be in accounts so as someone who hasn't touched iOS in a while I was able to kind of figure out okay maybe that's it but there is no other obvious place to sign into your Gmail account unless you
use the Apple Mail app which was not particularly intuitive to me sorry one sec yeah uh kin Dej in full plane chat said I wrote an automation that texts every contact I have uh have a great weekend and then I delete every contact  this that's actually pretty funny sorry  uh apparently it's you go to oh my God this is terrible you go to settings apps and then mail and then uh mail accounts once per year apparently that's how you that's how you add a systemwide account there you go
that's where they've moved it isn't that pretty similar to Android no no it isn't uh apparently it's not mail go to okay oh oh well this is so much better okay so if you want to if you want to sync your your contacts Luke don't go to your phone thing not here not here don't edit here don't look for settings oh uh how visible was my screen there not particularly I can check uh so if I just go to contacts here there's no way to do it in here because the apple way is that you go into the settings
menu which of course you can't access from the control center not even by customizing it the fact that they still don't offer you the option to have one of the controls be the settings menu is mindboggling set contacts accounts people are saying yes no no I know okay so you still can't go to settings here from the control center you can't make one of you can make these things pretty much anything you can imagine Under the Sun whoops I keep out of control except settings look at all
the options I have here but one of them cannot be open the settings menu you must access the settings through the home screen and through the settings Cog  contacts and then contact accounts wait but it would work in mail too wouldn't it it should work in basically anyone because that should be that should be an OS wide signin it's the exact same interface it used to be oh my God what just happened hold on a second yeah add account yeah this is the exact same interface that it used to
be it's just that it used to be really easy to find You're Expecting iOS to work like Android no I'm not I'm expecting iOS to work like iOS used to work so that's not really that unreasonable actually um no add a shortcut to control center for  guys use the open app widget I don't  Jesus just passing on information use the open app widget okay I'm assuming there's a there's a widget that opens any app on your phone and then you set that widget to um settings I'm assuming
that's how it works here we go no no I'm going to find it I'm going to find it is it an accessibility shortcut maybe motor accessibility access you a widget I'm working on it I'm working on it translate voice memo screen mirroring capture I'm sure I'm sure it's in here  lock here I'm tired of you guys calling oh here we go here we go here we go here we go okay so if you want to open the settings menu in the control center you  down to shortcuts open app and you can open the settings app
you can't be mad at them for having too many options after being mad at them for not having enough options there we go well I didn't I didn't say it's too many options settings is not an app to me but maybe that's maybe that's me doing Android ISM I don't know I don't think so because settings isn't an app on a Mac okay it just isn't it's on a Mac though I know but I'm just saying you can't you can't you can't Point At You know a platform that literally didn't exist when settings was not an app on
the Mac and go oh well that's an Android invention that settings is an app or what whatever like it's like it's not like Android invented the idea that settings is not an app sure I I don't mind that too much um settings was an app prior to Mac OS 10 was it really someone in I I could have sworn there were settings you could change system preferences app an okay settings is an app on the Mac that is that is wild dude it is still an app Apparently that is wild system settings
has an icon on Launchpad it is an app I disagree settings is an app on Windows is it is it control panel is kind of can you open it from run but it's more of a folder I'd say it's what is control  help me out I don't know the windows okay so Windows okay hold on hold on oh man see settings in an app is tough cuz like here let's uh here let's let's screen let's screen share for a second here I'm just going to make sure this is muted okay okay so Linus laptop okay so this is
settings but I wouldn't say that this is an app you know what I mean is that settings though well I can change settings but if I click this that's an app is this an app yeah I so I think so okay all right settings isn't settings is an app then CU it's just application yeah okay so is so everything's an application then close to it let's see let's see if I can think of something that's not an application there's things that aren't an application that you control through an application
sure would you consider Explorer an application uh yeah you can end the task yes but you actually you actually can't because it'll automatically relaunch because there's so many dependencies on Explorer you can still end it though okay this is true I mean okay so by that logic then yeah basically any process is an app then pretty much but is it though is any process an app Luke I don't know I don't know either uh I don't actually think so because like I don't think like
the like the yeah the service hosts and stuff I don't know if I would consider those an app an application you can replace Explorer with another shell yeah okay okay settings on phone isn't an app what do you mean settings on phone isn't an app yeah I don't think being able to end the task means it's an app technically is there a definition for this I think if you look up the definition of app you're just going to find a lot of people arguing about app versus application and it'll be like 10 years
15 years old when people were still mad about that like I don't I don't think we're going to find any useful discourse about this no but I just I want to see anyways is puffery an app anyway long story short long story short I am Services aren't apps yeah I I feel that way as well but you can end them I was trying to make my argument on like you can end the task so that doesn't work if services darn apps anyways long story short I have a lot to say about my experience with the iPhone he has words
I clearly I you got to work with uh like hor or someone on it though to make sure that you're not just like missing something no no that's that's fine no I'm not I'm not worried about that this is rough notes yeah yeah yeah um let's see if I uh man speech detex yeah oh dude the way it like proactively hounds you about apps tracking you and notifications and stuff is actually amazing because you can 100% configure all that stuff on Android no problem but the way that it proactively is like hey
are you sure you want this are you sure you want notifications here's the ramifications of the data this app is collecting are you sure about that kind of amazing Wicked always thought that was very cool yeah outstanding also uh apple and their privacy stuff is like obviously correct I I don't remember I I doubt this is in the in the doc today but I was skimming through news articles and I didn't read enough of it so sorry if this is wrong um but I think it was like nation state
Hackers from China or something gained crazy back doors to something because government agency was like yeah we need to have these no one else will get them and Apple has always been like uh yeah they will um so yeah as we've said in the past they're definitely correct about that there there's some things that are like like definitely better about the Apple Way um but I also have an Android phone and there are definitely things that are absolutely brain dead stupid about the apple way
and um the fact that we don't acknowledge this is uh I I I I just don't even know what to say like Luke here's a here's an example so if I want to get into my like bluetooth settings like I really want to get into my bluetooth settings so I go my control center oh angle swipe I go yeah yeah it's from the corner you can't do it from the top really yeah well I'm not I'm used to that at this point okay I I don't agree with it I think it's kind of stupid but that's notifications
that's control center isn't it just the left or right side of the island not the corner I don't think so I think it's just left or right side of the island no really yeah look notifications Corner yeah I I'm not I'm not a fan I just I don't that just seems weird I'm not a fan I'm used to it um okay so I open up my Bluetooth I long press my Bluetooth I can configure it so Bluetooth is one of the main ones that I can interact with right away okay so I go to my bluetooth settings finally up
why did it navigate through the menus  that like why seems a little weird I don't know oh man yeah apparently Luke they're saying Luke is right except I just showed you guys watched them oh that time it did it you watched me do it last time I did I watched you do you just have to be more over I thought it was on on this side of the island at all well I'm on that side of the island and I just did it I just it brought down the notification shade so you just have to you just have to be you just have to be
more over I I think it makes more sense to be left or right side of the island not it's it's 75% of this side of the screen and 25% of the other side of the screen anyways  I'm assuming that's because they still want one hand pull down to be able to be done for either one of them I guess but I there's no way I could reach I'm trying to think of the reasoning and that I think that makes sense there's no way I could reach notifications from there um yeah I mean I also don't think I
would bother because if I wanted to see notifications I wouldn't even like unlock it I I would just do that yeah but what if your what if your phone's already open uh yeah would you like quick lock and then check that way getting all the way over there for me though with one hand I'd have to have like a pop thing or something which I would I would not install on my phone I don't I don't really like the I'm not a fan of them I like being able to slide it in and out of my pocket yeah I find it catches on
too many things um the swipe was designed like this before iPhones had Islander notches yeah but Apple has like a monstrously big and good development team and I'm sure they could go I'm sure wouldn't take that much effort based on how long T9 dialing took I'm not actually convinced by the way this thing is causing way more mic interference than just about any other phone we've ever had on set other than my like clearly broken one yeah that's been a that's been that's that could be
a bit of a problem I don't think you guys are hearing it but it's very annoying for us oh do they not hear that I don't think so the buzzing oh they don't write Dan uh it might be processed out um oh they can hear it that's very loud then yeah that one was particularly I think they could hear mine it was very quiet and sometimes if no one's talking while it happens then um then that'll get kind of gated out we hear it but it's not very loud okay yeah it's loud for us we're direct monitoring
yeah it's like quite loud for me crazy anyways time to move on yeah iPhone done yeah now we talk about how the second video I'll be using it for a while oh yeah no I meant for for this part of the show what are those are you cheating on your normal ones what what how could you we're not allowed to talk what why is everyone so like interested in talking about whatever snack I'm having before you got here they were like talking a bunch about the new like gummies well you're cheating on your
regular they're still Welches they're just juicefuls they're like fruit    delicious all right anyways uh my man uh you had another video get taken down yes how how has it was it a month ago since the last one I think so so like none in basically forever and then two in a month so sharpey viewers have noticed that our video about compa A+ certification exam is no longer available on YouTube or float plane without getting into the exact details of why it's been removed let's talk
about some of the reasons that it could be more important than ever to watch our  without naming any names there are what a spin dude there are a lot of ways that um a video's ability to be on the internet could be threatened I think I think that our perceived permanence um or the perceived permanence of of videos on YouTube or of of websites on the Internet or pages on said websites is a lot higher than it actually is is so some examples of ways that videos can be taken down um could
be copyright overreach um so you know whether something is or isn't fair use that's something that would have to be challenged in court that's not the kind of thing that is just oh yeah uh well it's fair use and then yeah I guess everything's chill uh until a judge decides that something is or isn't fair use it's just a defense it's it's an argument um and I think that a lot of what we do could fall pretty easily under fair use uh for example we will and maybe recklessly maybe um you know
making an informed you know risk Choice uh we will we will frequently show like copyrighted films on displays that we're reviewing from our point of view we are not negatively impacting the potential market for that film by you seeing a small snippet of it on a display in the background um we are not using substantial portion of the work uh have you ever had a problem with that no I didn't think so are are well what we have had problems with is watching trailers and ads on Wow constantly which
again I would so stupid I would make the argument is is absolutely fair use uh as as media we are covering it um it's if anything going to have a positive impact on the market for the work um it's highly transformative in nature given that we're not just repurposing it we are we are discussing it um this is not react content where we're just like or chair streaming you know like it's it's it's not it's not that um and and I would I would say that you know if we were say for example
providing commentary on you know a a class let's let's use the word class if we were providing commentary on a class and in order to do so needed to get into of the specifics I would say that we would probably have a fairly strong fair use defense but that would have to play out in court and we would have to have both the means and the will to take it to that bitter bloody end um some of the other reasons that a video could be taken down uh could be you know just like corporate corporate butt covering
um and that can often that can often take the form of like a like a a legal threat or a letter or a uh you know a poite request or you know whatever it is it can come in it can come in various forms and in those cases there may not be any solid Legal Foundation for you know why a request is being made but it might just be that you know there's things that maybe you don't want to go to court yeah that they don't want people talking about and they don't want people seeing and um you know they feel
strongly that you know given enough time and given enough resources they could find a way to make life unpleasant enough that it's just not worth the fight and if you have enough time and enough resources in regards to lawyers you can pretty much always find a way yep and um H I don't know if I want to get into the example that that I would have of something like that that actually happened in the past before a video was ever posted um I just don't feel like opening that can of worms
because the rule that I made for myself about that particular company is that we just never speak their name again um so not get into that but another potential way that a video could go down is not bribery but just companies paying for problems to go away I want to make it very clear about this one that that is absolutely not the case here for no amount of money would we take down a video but um something like this did happen recently with the emulator rugen X where as far as we can tell because it
didn't violate Nintendo's intellectual property in any way it was fully reversed and engineered Reen X appeared to be immune to the same take Downs that took down Yuzu um but what seems to have happened was the um the project owner was just offered a bag of money to  um our discussion question is it a problem for Consumer journalism when companies use copyright protections or other legal tactics to avoid people criticizing their methods and the  presenting we'll let you guys be the
judge we'll let you guys have a little discussion in the comments in the meantime what I would like to find out dude is if I am still A+ certified because this so this is this is from last time what's on the screen right now is from last time we need we need to recheck this is from last week so here's here's my certification and we're going to find out very shortly if  yeah hold on hold on no no no hold on hold on still active oh I'm kind of disappointed I don't want to burn [Laughter]
it uh I don't think it's going to be active for long I can I can tell you that with a fair degree of confidence um maybe the Flames will still burn bright I believe it is extremely important for people to be able to have transparency into how the certifications that in some cases could even impact the hiring practices of you know national security agencies um operate I think that that is uh an incredibly important thing and I think it is uh a public good that outweighs any other concerns I have
absolutely no regrets about making the video that we do that we did and for anyone who watched it I I hope you enjoyed it but it is down and it is not coming back is all I have to say about that from us yes there's been precedent set in the past that when this happens uh people tend to re-upload the things well there's nothing we can really do about that they would have already archived it CU we did not keep any copies no so even the even the source video files we do not have them any yeah yeah
yeah I purged them myself oh did you really yeah good for you Dan mhm people autoarchive all our stuff though so no I command line gone I don't mean internally oh well people have like Plex scripts for float plan and stuff yeah yeah yeah it's pretty wild like a bunch of people have it it's actually kind of inconvenient for our server infrastructure oh yeah we've fixed that problem we throttled it yeah nice yeah we did that like a long time ago nice and people didn't notice for a super
long time because they're all just running scripts so it was still downloaded by the time they wanted it right cuz like it's not throttled that much um I had to ask AJ to unthrottle the office yeah what were you doing when you did that though you downloaded like a ton of stuff I downloaded every single  okay at at once multiple times yeah but that was for work so I guess you can hit the data yeah yeah anyway if you were looking for a way to help us make up for any losses that we might have incurred for not
being able to keep our video up is it time you could send a merch message and we've got something pretty exciting that you can check out this week we did it oh my goodness man oh they're here they're here here look look at how Happ look how happy Dan is this is the second time I've smiled look at that that's crazy o you you've never seen Dan that happy you never have oh yeah this has been a long time coming I'm sorry it took so long but this is such a great picture he's like look at
this you can't see my belt it makes the pocket go away it's amazing it's so nice look the arms fit this is a medium there's it's a medium I'm wearing a medium you want see another happy Dan go down to the last photo oh yeah there too many photos too far wait we have long sleeves as well I'm wearing one right now and it goes to his wrist is about this it's a medium amazing this is never happened I've I've done the laundry like almost every day this week because I took home one of
these and ju every day I'd wake up and be like oh okay well I want to wear it again so so yeah I just I have to buy like a ton of them I guess pretty exciting um so yeah we have tall blank t-shirts and long sleeves it's our signature blank tea uh improved to fit taller lankier builds customade to provide the comfort and durability that we want in a tea available with short or long sleeve oh wait that's in there twice well whatever the point is it uses our tried and true 60/40 cotton poly blend that you can
find on most of our printed LTT shirts we are slowly rolling these out so the initial inventory is a little limited so if you want them get them it's to gauge interest it's only black for now but our hope is to expand our tall lineup in the months and years to come also for the store this week the tech sack is finally back in stock the five star reviewed Tech sack let's go go check out people's reviews great is a diabetic sack apparently oh that makes sense so that's never thought
about that good to know the greatest sack so many pockets I use it as a toiletries bag me too I it when I no not I hold on I was reading a review oh where'd it go I use it as a toiletries bag for travel um thank you Luke thank you for that anyway the point is check it out tchack finally back in stock uh what else is that I think that I think that's pretty much it for the store so merch messages if you want to leave a merch message all you got to do is go to LTT store add something to your
cart and in the cart whenever we're live and accepting merch messages there will be a box for Merch messages you fill out your merch message you place your order and it'll go to producer Dan who will pop it up down there so you can shout out your mom or your girlfriend just getting there and H watching so you can shout out your dad or your boyfriend um okay we we actually we actually do have women who watch the show it's remarkable to me but they they they not very many send merch messages they're
real and I see them I see you thank you um anyway it'll go to Dan who will pop it down here or who will forward it to someone who can answer your question or who will answer it himself or who will send it to me and Luke as a curated merch message and we're going to show you how that works sure I've got a couple here how do you guys handle healthy workplace environments in a heavily Mal dominated industry I'm in school for Cs and work in construction as my day job and it can be hard as a
woman being disregarded Oh you mean like socially healthy work how topic how topical exactly  it's not always that's I mean that's that's not always a guarantee you can ask someone does this work for you are you comfortable with this and they might say yes they might feel pressured into saying yes in the scenario if you are like a their boss or something like that that's a that's a you got to be careful with that line um I mean one one of the things that I like to do is I will
explicitly say if not that's fine we'll do this instead so that there's a clear out give the give the other option I have to confess sometimes I'm in a hurry and I forget to like do every step um yeah I don't I don't know I mean I would say I would say that it's not for any it's never for any lack of intent sorry it's never for a lack of intent to make the environment like good but I mean this is yeah this is this is a great Point poison say seems weird to ask men how they manage like making things better
for women in a male dominated industry I don't know all I can really do is ask questions because a lot of the time I just don't fully understand the challenges and I and I can't unless you tell me and even if one person tells me doesn't mean that that's going to apply to another person you can't you can't really like this is why this is why the entire concept of you know sexism or racism is just so stupid right because trying to bundle individuals into any kind of bucket is just a
complete waste of time making assumptions you will always be making assumptions and so um I I know one of the the main things I've heard is the whole like people react differently to the same thing uh depending on if it's coming from like a man or a woman so like if you try to be assertive as a man people see it as like oh yeah good good personality trait you try to be assertive as a woman and people see you as uh I don't know if I can say this word or not um probably I don't know
um um so I think just try to be careful to not treat the one who's always canel no I'm saying that's oh my goodness I'm not saying that's a thing um I'm saying that's a that's a line of complaint that I have heard uh people in that sphere discuss being a problem at their workplaces so try to you know just treat people the same so if if someone's being assertive treat that person the same that you would treat anyone else being assertive we have someone uh um to make this harder to identify I'm going to say
we at some point had someone a woman in like a supervisory SL managerial basically Who had subordinates who reported to her um and and I remember having to explicitly multiple times make it clear that my expectation was for forthrightness and push back like to me um and that like like that was good and anything else was not good because it's it's possible that's another thing it's everyone comes into every single conversation ever with their own custom baggage um so that person may have gotten a lot of push
back for that type of thing in the past so you have to try to make sure that they understand that that's like something that youa I'm not saying it's a bad thing that that I had to say it I well it is it's a bad thing that this individual had experiences in the past that led to that not being something that they could assume is their is their right in the workplace to to give their opinion in a in a in a in a I wouldn't say like not forceful but in like a I don't know in in a in a confident manner
in a in a in a assertive yeah assertive manner because that's totally fine and that should be totally fine um and you can you can say something assertively but still be open to feedback on it if that makes sense yeah of course you can confidently hold a position and say it assertively yeah and look I mean something Ivon tells me all the time is that like I I I tend to overpower the conversation sometimes whether it's intentional or Not by just being confident in my position being kind of
loud uh being kind of energetic and and um and and kind of bombastic in my body language and bombastic and and so she'll say like look whether you're intending to or not you can kind of make it hard to talk to you sometimes and so you know in those in those situations it's something that I have to be like actively aware of and go like okay this is a this is a modern thing for lonus I've seen him do it here's my here's my take and this is why I think we should do it but um you guys go I'm not married to
it yeah and he'll do that he'll sit back cuz he's like physically removing himself from the conversation because if  himself am I [Laughter] wrong yeah it is what it is well the thing is that a lot of the time the answer is obvious to me which is a blessing because I can come to the answer really quickly but also a curse because I can be wrong like anybody yeah um and you also kind of need everybody to get there um and you know in some scenarios someone might get there before
you do and other scenarios uh you might get there before them and you need everybody to get to at least a similar spot you might not get 100% agreement across the whole board but you need everybody to be you need buying yeah buying is a word that matters to me a lot because whether you're talking can disagree but Buy in yeah if you're talking to a supervisor if you're talking talking to a subordinate it doesn't matter you need to get buyin or you're never going to get anything done
because they will either undermine you or override you if you don't have buyin you have to have buyin that's why I mean I've talked about this on the show before everything is sales life is sales you're selling everything you're selling yourself to your potential partner uh you're selling yourself to you know the and you're selling yourself to your current partner hoping you stay together yeah it's all sales sales never stops you're selling yourself to you know uh the interviewer uh you're
selling yourself to the you know the freaking the waiter at the restaurant why should they give you good service why should they why should they pay attention to I know it's that job but like be a good customer yeah yeah cuz like the I don't know the I find the easiest way to have service workers go above and beyond when they're serving you is to just not be a giant hole they they have to deal with them so often that if you're just like refreshing and you're not rushing them too much and you're just kind of
chilling like usually they're super nice because so many other people are jerks pretty much everyone in the world is nice if you're nice to them yeah it's it's a pretty cool life hack I mean there are exceptions right sure like there are just you know maybe they're just having a horrible day or there's just like not your fault racists and you happen to be the wrong color and walk up to them yeah you know like not much you can do about that there's not much you can do about that yeah um
yeah don't be addict to people who handle your food yeah yeah yeah yeah or I mean just  yeah it's it's just honestly way less stressful of a way to go through life all right Dan um you got anything else heavy for us or maybe something lighter no it's all lighter after this nice yeah that was that was a tough one to start with s like our lanky tall fit uh t-shirts they're not technically lighter they might even actually be heavier but you can get them and by getting them you can
support uh more shirts on the store being made in tall format not that I have an agenda yeah no horse in this race at all buy 400 of each of them that would be cool yeah then we might get graphic ones or other stuff right yeah if these do well yeah uh let's see uh something a little lighter uh during the massacre that happened in oh no wait hold on I'm I'm building a computer to attach to my TV is there a good way to have it automatically wake or turn on when turning on the
TV that's a good question does does does c what's it called C whatever see whatever C what's the what's the stupid HDMI control thing called um think of a way you do it HDMI C is it CC I think so yeah yeah c um does CC work on consumer graphics cards not that I'm aware of hook up that power switch to that computer oh I mean yeah you could split the line to an RF signal you go do both you could buy like a universal remote or something like that like still got an old harmony that
is like my one button power everything on but I think they're asking for cc and apparently some Intel Nooks supported it uh you need adapters but that won't wake it interesting I don't know man I mean CEC is such a flaming pile of garbage as it is like even on devices that support it properly I wouldn't imagine that adding some like weird accessory that like has HDMI pass through and can also like plug in an ether cable with a magic packet or something like I wouldn't imagine that's going to
work I have a switch bot that presses the button connected to home assistant yeah the fact that that is the solution tells me everything I need to know I remember with the Fallout bomb I just split it so that it played the like toy bomb sound and turned the computer on so you just make it do both so you open up your TV you find the power switch circuit you splice your computer power switch into it you're pressing you're you're pressing the power switch on your TV they're using a controller
right you can open that controller up um that is a terrible solution oh it's awesome I like the way Luke works man after my own heart it's totally doable got a string attached to the breaker for the living room hot glue the power button down on the PC danthony says it works on Linux sure but I don't have 3 days to learn how to do it so that's that's tough that's pretty tough um I turn on my TV and use Moonlight to wake up my PC yeah there's lots of there's lots of different ways and none of them are what
you were asking so I think the answer is no it's kind of looking that way I'm sorry unless a wire running from the remote to the computer okay that would be hilarious oh definitely work though so you actually just like when you press that button you like put two leads on it that are they just short and turn on the computer I about a foot switch underneath the couch the problem is with anything like that cuz it's a momentary like like short right yeah I turn my computers on with the screwdriver all
the time that's actually not bad you could just get another remote for your computer Silverstone has that little remote you could do a Clapper you know to turn the lights on and off and it closes the switch uh for the PC you do like a really sick goal in rocket league and cheer for yourself your computer turns off just turns off just hibernates well you could disable the power button to like close down in Windows I vote for this I use uh that looks like great yeah for my lighthouses I have those like
remote things yeah so you got to pull this apart hot glue it to back of the bo from inside the the controller and put it in in your TV remote which is somehow big enough to house this don't worry about it so you 3D print a new TV REM housing yeah that sounds like even more work than a lot of the other stuff no I want to do this it sounds awesome oh my God weekend project I'll uh I'll have done half weekend half finished and then I won't be able to use any of my living  Shu sounds like a pretty good weekend
who needs your living room when you have this project to pay attention to youve just described the last 15 years of life it could be like uh Sebastian's room if you guys watch the Fantastic video Sebastian's uh AMD Ultimate Upgrade thing um where he has 10 million projects going on but it doesn't look like it that was very impressive I think he might have tied it up a little bit for us maybe maybe question for you I asked you to watch a particular video on the channel did you watch it
what video I don't remember this at all how to get a $500 motherboard for 50 bucks oh yeah the motherboard resurrection that was awesome that was like that was a sick video I didn't remember that you even asked me to I happily watched the whole thing that was probably the most fun I've had shooting a video in a very long time genuinely very entertaining to watch absolutely stuff that like I I think it has the you know the spirit of why we started doing scrapyard Wars where it's like you're
finding watching the value ticker we have had historically a problem of our videos having like trackable elements in them and being able to watch like like Alex updating you with like how much money you've saved versus how much money you spent as you go through was mindblowing the the level of wow that board is mangled and then you were able to fix it was mindblowing and the lack of expense in the things required to fix it that that uh whatever microscope yeah that thing it's like 100 bucks under
under 100 bucks I think it was 70 or something yeah by the time you pay shipping and taxes it's still you're under 100 Buck that's not cheap but you buy a broken board you buy that you fix it now you have this tool permanently and you just saved money on the board it was still cheaper that was super cool there's been a bunch of videos that have come out lately that I've just organically wanted to click on and watched the whole thing and was like wow that was really good you guys have been
doing great well thanks yeah um yeah no that was that was a lot of fun and the editors have been doing a great job they've been putting in the extra they've been putting in the extra effort on those like you said those trackable elements I think that was way better in scrapyard Wars 9 than previous ones like tracking the budgets and like what deals we're working on um that was one of the reasons that first of all the first one was was delayed and then second of all one of the Middle episodes
was delayed because I basically sent it back and I was like guys you've done a great job with the time that you had here's more time go to a greater job because it it it needs that and there's another one coming soon that was also sent back to the kitchen for uh I asked for about 10 minutes to be removed from it and then I also asked for the tracking to be to be updated a little bit so it was a little clearer what people are talking about but the good news is that the Final Cut Is Awesome um
they they finally did it you know how we've talked a thousand times and I've rejected the idea a thousand times about doing like a PC build challenge just instead of going out and buying stuff just using our warehouse see who can build the best PC out of like the parts we have here so credit to David he came up with a way to make it not stupid okay cuz you know how my response was always like well okay it's just it's just like go get the best thing like that's not that's not a challenge there's no way to
win there's no way to lose you just get stuff and build a computer it's not relatable is it all brok broken things they had no internet okay so they weren't allowed to look up pricing or information or specs or anything they "had a $1,000 budget with penalties for" going over and the goal was for going over do they have to guess the price yeah oh wow so it was it was an are we out of touch video so they had that's a pretty good angle they had to know the price with no
internet access wow and then they had to um sorry what was the third thing that no internet they had to oh yeah and they had to have the best performance possible so the best performance don't go over budget you can't research online so it was like oh and to get parts because there's a lot of things we only have one of it was a draft system so they were given 45 seconds team one to go grab a part team two to go grab a part team three to go grab a part then team three goes again then team two then
team W and so there were cases where someone something was gone someone got the board I wanted uh it it should be really good I think the I think David and I talked about it and we agree that the original like 32 or 35 minute cut is good but my issue when I talked to him about it was like look there's two great videos here there's one that is super driven by personality and there's one that is super nuts and bolts on the hardware there's only room for one video on the in the YouTube cut it's got to be
one or the other and so that's why we ended up and I kind of went which one is it yeah it's the personality one it's the it's the engaging fun version so what I think is going to happen is I think we're going to get the the the YouTube cut on YouTube and I think we're going to get like the David Snider cut nice on float plane nice um sick so I think that's I think that I think that's the right way to kind of not have that footage just lost to the ether um have people be able to enjoy it because there
is a little bit more analysis and thought process behind some of the parts but sometimes I was just like I was watching it and I like I could feel myself tuning out because of how many you know first word latency uh Balancing Act of the CL whatever like not that I was just trying to come up with something that was kind of jargony but basically just a lot of Whiffle waffling about which one to get and and discussion and if you are super super super techy it'll be really interesting but for the other two
million people that are going to watch the video I think it's just it's not that engaging so we had to we had to give her the old anyway Kaboom pow says I've never heard so much joy out of Linus than in that motherboard repair video this man loves getting some deals that's part of the reason why it was fun to watch those like you clearly cared and really wanted to make every one of them work which mirrors how you would feel if you were actually just doing this dude making
every one of them work was not the goal that was not the plan fair but you cared about everyone once it was attainable I wanted it so bad once it felt like it was in reach dude I would have been happy if I got half of them I would have been thrilled yeah if I had done half of them well I think you still have been profitable on half right I think so yeah pretty sure and some of them weren't like crazy deals either they were all pretty good but some of them were clearly better
deals than others which is fine like if if you were really trying to do this and like make money off of it you could you know spend be be a bit more picky about certain I think so purchases um but it was it was the right decision for the video to try to like push the line a little bit um Steve j3d says I love the $50 motherboard video didn't like the we try and break things for fun one you posted the other day uh we did not try to break things for fun in fact as far as I know nothing was broken that
motherboard what had issues already uh they didn't affect our ability to like play a game and run C EV the indulging thoughts one yeah not when you sprayed water all over it while it was running that didn't break anything no okay and none of the parts that we were using for any of the CRA actually that one might have but none of the parts that we were using were not sacrificial clearly mentioned in the video that those were all parts that were like already having issues and were on their way out y yeah
so so don't uh yeah don't don't overthink it we are not about destroying perfectly working stuff here um and so there's been a lot of pitches over the years that would result in Hardware dying um that would have been videos that would have gotten millions of views that lonus has said no to just throwing that out there shraf 2K says thanks for jacking up eBay mobile prices for their foreseeable future this is a criticism that we get a lot um you know every time we kind of he might be getting but sorry
he might just be ribbing you but yeah maybe but it's it's a criticism we legitimately get a fair bit whenever we do a video about something that's kind of like a like an Open Secret but like a or or like a you know a niche Community or or a niche Community I think probably the best example of it was oh yeah when we when we talked about that modified Windows 8 ISO that was super cool and and all the bloat was stripped out U at a time when Windows 10 was still kind of a steaming pile of
garbage and people didn't want to migrate to it um that project probably directly because of us highlighting it um came under pretty intense scrutiny for Microsoft now I believe since then they've kind of risen from the Shadows with a different method where you download the ISO from Microsoft and then you download a modifier script from them instead of downloading the modified ISO because that was Microsoft's problem you were downloading Windows from them which is bad kind of fair but here's my here's my
Counterpoint I didn't post that on the internet um I didn't make Microsoft's terms of service and copyright and you know intellectual property protection um and what is my job if not to talk about what's going on in Tech and sometimes it's going to sometimes it's going to make you know the prices go up on used Hardware or sometimes it's going to draw unwanted attention to a to a a project but like isn't isn't it my job to talk about what's going on in Tech sometimes  cause sometimes it's going to cause
problems for me careful we have to burn that you can't break it yet um but like that's my job right isn't it yeah no I I mean I defend it I defend it and to be clear sharf was just rubing you or sharff sorry and I think we're going to have a video coming and that's actually the main reason why I'm addressing this we're going to have a video coming that there's going to be a lot of people coming after me for oh for that we will be shedding a light on something that is super cool for techie
people to know um but is like a it's like a secret that techie people know and I think you and I are kind of aligned on that we don't have secrets we have information for the people and that's our job and I don't even know what this is but yeah I agree with that make sure you watch the video when it comes out yeah cuz I don't know if it's going to last do you want to know what this is we'll see no I don't think so okay okay okay yeah I don't think so I don't know we've
been I've been feeling kind of I've been feeling kind of irreverent lately not going to lie one  wrong I've been feeling I've been feeling a little you know it lately um I liked the the video that recently got taken down because I'll I'll refer to it that way to add a little bit of buffer because there's technically two videos that recently got taken down so who knows um because that's been that's been a laughed about non secret for so long yeah and but there's always new people
entering the space yeah so it's also a question that I've received forever like since I was a kid people are like is this thing legit yeah no no one cares so it's like yeah I don't know I'm down with it I was down with it when it happened I think how everything went was fine personally Luca asks are you trying  dude if I was trying to get cancelled  know I don't know man we talked about this a few weeks ago so I'm not going to like get into it again or anything but I I think I'd be I think I'd be a little
more difficult to to you can't kill the Undead yeah that's I was going to say we already came back from the sticks [Laughter] like oh man like it is it is no it is no secret that you know we have you're kind of a Bard you're close to a Bard I thought they died when you gave them healing damage like Works backwards for Undead like it is it is no it is no secret that after July of last year uh we experienced a precipitous drop in viewership and therefore our busness um that we have these graphs are
super informative of like how channels work what things impact their their success and their their non-success and yeah they're they're I I think people would have a a surprisingly fun time actually just poking around social blade and like seeing how different channels do things yeah it's it's a genuinely surprisingly enlightening so this is 28 oh this is this is this is 30 days so we are we are not there but boy are we ever but that's a line that's going up boy are we ever tracking back um and you can
feel it man the videos feel good I know I've been saying that a lot on W lately but like they actually just do no the vi The Vibes feel good I think uh I think it's uh I think it's I think it's good I think things are good oh whoa dude what up what is this streams with Sarah announcement float plane exclusive merch yeah you didn't know about this I did not know about this yeah it's cool what am I what am I looking at this is 48 what the what what the heck is going on what is what is 
this where did we come from I don't know but that was the timestamp we were at Why did um what am I even what do what do they have me saying I don't know uh okay well you know what not sure I think the idea is basically that she's going to be streaming on Flow plane and she's going to take Community input on a design design um and then I think I could be wrong about this it's going to say in the post so you should really just read the post but I think that's going to be a Flo plane exclusive
shirt but it doesn't mean that the design is going to have like the flo plane logo on it necessarily unless the community asks for that um and she riffs on it in a certain way um maybe I should just read the post is on the First full point exclusive merch live you can also contribute to the design in chat Yep this this is the clip lonus and Luke will react to today on Wan but there's an early access to our fellow floaties are we doing that today I don't I think we might to jump the gun oh I think this
is the early axis maybe well okay then great job professional uh yes we were supposed to react to that on way so maybe we should get audio and get that going uh okay hey conveniently we already made sure that audio works if we're watching videos uh on the computer machine uh okay cool I fixed it we did from Dan  um hey Sarah let's do float plane exclusive merch I'm lonus and I love badminton I'm also the average height for a Canadian male my age that's a weird thing to say but sure and make
sure to stream it on float plane it'll be lots of fun uh okay um I'll stream it  star and you guys can help drop by at 10:00 a.m. and where we'll be making our first ever  there Lon is you paid people to make that I didn't lonus Media Group Incorporated did who owns most of that I would never have done that who owns most of that me oh crazy oh that was great Starfield I love e chicken Starfield my goodness I think you like eating hot sauce with chicken yeah yeah it's an important part of the equation
yeah I'm going to be set that up that's going to be so fun I think it's going to be we've done a few of those Sarah has done some in the before I think the uh Gone Fishing original one was done on float plane stream I think the Privateer shirt was designed on float plane stream as well every Halloween we do pumpin caring exclusive so this is this is using our our connector to the LTT store so you'll have to does that finally work it it like exclusive exclusive I know I
mean does it work on like the store side though I know float plane has supported the feature for a long time but like do we finally have integration between the store and float plane we've had that since l TX 2023 to like to do what though to to to make it so that okay so it goes it's one directional yeah so you can log into the store using your float plane account and then there it doesn't know it's beautiful exclusive things given to you because you have it's the best feature
ever you've been authenticated as a Flo plane user what we still don't have um is like if you buy something on LTT store you are granted something on Flo plane it doesn't go the other way it just goes Flo plane to LTT store not altitud store a flow plane we do want to do that eventually but it's far far far far far road map there's uh there's many things we need to do that are high priority from the both the users the creators and the the people running the service that want done before we would
be able to get to that got it yeah just making it clear before people like where is it I want it it's like no it's probably not coming for a very long time 2% cash back rewards on LTT store from float plane Subs when yeah no time soon ever let's say that all right that will never happen cool full plane is too cheap that we would just lose money oh I subscribed a float plane for one month and then bought all the different screwdrivers in a backpack and then unsubscribed wow I just made so
much money it's only 2% if they buy a bunch of stuff I think we still win well if they have a grandfather sub it's $3 that's true and there's payment transaction fees andu yeah the the OG Subs are like really not profitable they technically are are they yeah CU certain costs of things have gone down oh I see yeah okay I think the last time we talked about it it was break even at best it was basically not so much well it also depends like do you do you account for like Dev time I mean
yeah then probably not okay so but the  it's fine it's everything's fine what about us $10 Ballers Luke uh yeah you guys are great those are profitable thank you very much yeah mind you with how much you watch the streams I'm not sure if you individually are streaming basically just completely destroys the business model not that you shouldn't watch the stre yeah you should watch the streams you should watch on Flo plane but uh yeah streaming is super expensive combo is the watches the
entire wow stream every time and every other stream that happens on the platform OG sub oh yeah that one's the like that's the money loser right there that's a gamer move yeah yeah not that you shouldn't do it go ahead we are doing fine to be super clear yes streaming is don't not use the platform streaming is very expensive compared to VOD it can't be buffered essentially if you want decent latency which I think we have on Flo plane um that's a big part of the problem and the beta site now has manual
controls manual controls yeah I've been telling people in the in the fullo chat all day what do you mean by manual controls we had a player limitation for a long time where for live streaming it was just Auto quality oh and people didn't like that because sometimes it would jump too much it would switch too often so on the beta site we added manual controls oh right I'm not on the beta you're doing real time conversion I thought you weren't what you said switching qualities oh for live streams yeah you
do multi not what we're pushing up what people are taking down oh okay okay oh look at that oh yeah there you go so that's a thing now my understanding was that you had to real time transcode all of those at the same time does that still happen yeah okay I thought you weren't doing that that's we're not doing that someone is don't worry about it yeah basically it's not really it's just it's not going to be very interesting for speaking of sites that use someone else's underlying technology oh Noy it's Jack
doerty we're talking about this internet personality Jack doerty this is in the doc yeah a 21-year-old who's primarily known for controversial prank videos crashed as McLaren during a live stream this past weekend footage of the incident appears to show him speeding in rainy conditions while glancing back and forth at a phone in his hand before he loses control of the vehicle crosses multiple Lanes of traffic and hits a guard rail dorti continued filming the aftermath of the accident his cameraman
Michael David who was sitting in the passenger seat had his head injured in the accident and later received stitches at one point in the footage from the crash site dhy hands the device to David who is bleeding from a head wound and instructs him to continue filming when another young man suggests that someone else should take over filming from David seeing as his face appeared to be injured dor prevents anyone from taking over instead giving the concerned man another device to film with and telling
him to make it look good some images that Mr Dy posted to Instagram appear to show him posing shirtless with the wreck note that he was wearing a shirt when the accident occurred some online observers noted that doerty re-uploaded edited clips of the aftermath of the accident but not his actions immediately preceding the crash so it wasn't obvious that he was on his phone this is why this is on top streaming site kick has removed his account and given him a lifetime ban for violating a community guideline
prohibiting Reckless Behavior and the endangerment of others uh so this is actually what I want to talk about have we found the line and if this is the line why wasn't the line setting off fireworks indoors oh did that happen not not from uh whatever his name is not not from Jack no but definitely something that has actually occurred did you see the stuff that happened at twitchcon no oh yeah why kick streamers were just like straight up harassing people at twitchcon cool it's very cool
very cool very cool uh kick is not Microsoft D Starfire not that uh any form of content creation is honestly like just a a Bastion of perfect people um no but I I think kick has a has a  um and the fire the in the indoor fireworks thing was actually not um that that was not on Kick I think that was on Twitch um so I guess I guess the conversation is like have we have we finally have we finally reached the line cuz as someone indoor fireworks thing that was KSI right that was a that was
fake uh someone definitely actually did it at some point I don't know who all right um the KSI won or not KSI yeah sorry kaiset uh that one was I think it was a Mr Beast and kaiset thing and it was faked yeah some someone someone definitely did it at some point um apparently ISO speed actually did it oh says chat okay so cool uh anyway the point is that as someone who grew up in the generation of like when I was when I was a kid heading into adolesence and teenage Hood like CKY to become a man
you have to crash your McLaren jackass back in the day uh Tom Green this kind of like this kind of shock do anything humor yeah um I've kind of watched it progress to the point where you know we stopped doing these things under professional supervision on closed courses uh we started doing more and more not just insane but innan things um I saw this really unsettling footage of uh someone breaking their back doing the milk crate challenge um what is that you stack milk crates to
make stairs okay like you know those Square milk crates and then you see how high you can go except that the problem is that by the time you're high enough that it's unstable you're like 6 to 8 ft up and if you fall onto milk crates um that should give you like a pretty good idea of what's going to happen um and I guess I've just been kind of sitting here patiently waiting for either people to get smart which I'll probably be waiting a long time yeah or for whether it's platforms
or Regulators or parents I don't know for someone to kind of say hey okay um that's the limit that's the limit there it's time to stop and is is this is this finally it so operating your phone while driving is the limit well the thing is that I don't even know if that's and to be clear it was it's dumb and Reckless and cuz you're streaming driving poor conditions and operating a phone and then I think that's already bad but I think it's sort of the which parts are bad because we've recorded
videos while driving so is the streaming portion bad it's the flagrant disregard I think for any kind of consequences um after the fact that's a impossible thing to measure no it's you're right it's totally impossible to measure I mean it's a it's a compound problem I think context menu I think kind of nailed it any one of those things you know I I would say is compared to the kind of stuff people other people are streaming online right because we're not talking about whether those things were wrong and bad
absolutely wrong and bad what we're talking about is streaming while driving wrong and bad the line I don't think it has to be I think if you have a fixed GoPro on your dash and you're it's basically the same thing as it's basically Comedians in cars or whatever Seinfeld like I don't think because I don't think we I I don't think I've ever been in a compromised position driving around for scrap red Wars I mean like it's just hasn't there's this there's this like super lowbudget
Canadian show that I only know about because it was on while I was in a dentist chair and I couldn't get away from it it's called like Cash Cab or something like that yeah here we go is it oh my God it's an American show it's actually a whole thing well there was a there was I have no idea okay well it was definitely on a Canadian Channel and they were definitely driving around a Canadian city and it was like the production value was garbage um so I think it must have been like a Canadian ripoff of it
oh yeah Cash Cab Canadian game show it's called the same thing but there's a Canadian one yeah and it's like probably worse because it seemed pretty bad anyway 200 plus episodes eight seasons yeah wa yeah the Canadian one yeah anyway um you're really trying to get cancelled come okay look I'm not saying that okay the point is the point is that clearly they're driving and like doing a trivia show so it can be done um yeah but not in poor conditions not while alsoo texting not while not in
poor conditions so you can't like this is I think this is the line I keep coming back to is like does that mean that we can't film for scrapyard Wars while driving when it's raining because like I I don't personally see the difference between streaming and recording of OD I think we'd have to use our game sense no there's a big difference between streaming and recording of odod because with streaming okay here I'll show you the difference between streaming and  sure well no because you don't have to
go on your phone I'm showing you the difference you don't have to to go on   doing okay uh so continuing with the show I can take a break gotcha if I if I need my focus you can just be a bad streamer and take a break though but you won't because when you're streaming right but how many what's your  like you're not fighting algorithmically for for for relevance really you don't care um and so when you're streaming there's this constant pressure to be on to be talking about something to be
changing the subject to be you know changing what people are looking at oh my God it's producer Dan oh and he's gone but like I think that's I think that's my where I said like you don't have to go on your phone CU like if you're streaming you're going to want to see chat but someone else could see chat someone else could be producing someone El could be doing these other things someone else could be making sure that there isn't gaps in the entertainment of the stream but that's the problem is
they didn't so it's a compound problem samit has streamed while drifting and not had a problem yeah and and so I'm not saying that just being on stream is necessarily a problem but you have to have the game sense and that to me is the difference with a VOD with a VOD I think it's easier to turn on your game sense and go uh okay I got an update for you um I got to we got to merge onto the highway let's let's let's do it when we're on the highway cuz like I've I've had that kind of back and forth with my
camera operator where like okay one example was I was going somewhere where I didn't want to dox the person I was traveling to yeah I've done and so I was like okay uh I've got to okay write down there's there's a few things I want to address in this next clip if you can note those down um and then I'm going to turn around on this highway so that from the last shot that they see we'll be going in like two different directions and it's going to be super bamboozle um points if anybody like noticed that in
the video it was pretty funny um anyway um so so let's do that and then and then you know what I'm not going to I'm not going to lie to you guys especially cuz in earlier scrapyard Wars you guys probably saw me on my phone while I was driving anyway uh so I'll like glance at it and then okay let's do the clip while we're just cruising at highway speed I am a very defensive driver so I will I will typically not have anyone on either side of me I will always accelerate past
someone or break to be behind them like I never someone feels so uncomfortable I  um I apparently got a ticket and left it in I forgot about that I don't remember that at all that's hilarious um anyway so so I I tend to be a very defensive driver that doesn't I'm not saying good driver guys I'm saying defensive driver ever uh I don't like to be near other things that are moving um and so if I'm at cruising speed and there's nobody near me no I don't think that it's going to be the end of the
world if I if I like glance toward mik Glens for for a second or two you know for emphasis or you know for whatever it is that I'm doing hosting same thing as glancing towards your passenger which everybody does but streaming is in my mind a different Beast unless you're really in a mindset where you are you're not trying to be on the whole time but so many streamers are they're trying to be constantly engaging you probably are trying to constantly be engaging because that's how you perform
in the streaming World which makes sense um Sigma salt says unless you're ignoring chat it's over the line 100% I think that's honestly a pretty good point um where' it go having his friend recording the aftermath while bleeding also didn't help yeah Crystal D said but the issue was speeding looking at his phone um and doing that while hydroplaning and I I understand that my point is that if we if we try to draw a line but the line is like I don't know then it's not a line um so we need to
define the things that that cross the line so like you're saying like maybe streaming sites should should ban streaming while driving I don't know I while being the driver I mean can we I don't necessarily think it's inherently a problem no I am 100% certain that even if I tried to be consistently entertaining I could stream and drive at the same time no problem I'm 100% confident that you wouldn't be able to be engaging and entertaining though with other people in the car though with the other people in
the car easy yeah easy peasy if if there's no one else in the car I do agree with you yeah because then you're you know you're not reading chat unless you're doing something like unless you're like a rally driver a drift car person some doing something unique if you're driving through a city unless your stream literally is like POV driving through City yeah um then yeah I don't know try it I I think I like literally have I I've streamed while snowboarding like I've done weird stuff and it's
never been an issue for me but I also have never had that be my career so I have never cared and if I needed to not be entertaining for a while I would just not be entertaining for a while so I also have that benefit which isn't fair yeah is the line just like committing a crime while streaming I'm that's effectively the line for flow plane you can't break the law yeah that's what we did so yeah yeah I guess there's just a lot of things that like are horrible but and stupid but not a
crime like I I know I come back to this a fair bit but it was just so egregious uh like when Dr disrespect was streaming from the bathroom at I think was that twitchcon or whatever it was like I don't I don't think that's technically illegal necessarily but it just shouldn't have to be you know you shouldn't have to make that law it should just be kind of obvious and I guess that's the problem for me is that we've got people just pushing pushing the the boundaries of What's
um push based on what is NE what is legal rather than what is kind of necessary and and okay to do uh people saying it's illegal as far as I'm aware okay maybe maybe it is so then to record in a bathroom you know like why was this a permanent ban then and why was that a temporary ban I mean he ultimately did end up permanently banned anyway but for a different thing I think yeah oh yeah it was for something else um I don't know man and like should okay should jack doerty be able to you know come
back on Twitch or come back streaming on YouTube like should should because I know that YouTube has policies around off platform Behavior you don't necessarily have to do something on YouTube to be banned from YouTube yeah like is this should this just be the end because I don't know guys for some reason I don't feel like the audience will discipline this oh no they'll traditionally they reward it I've seen people come back from from worse I I don't know when the line when we're way
up here it's hard to tell what's farther and what's not farther over the line like stuff this just obviously wrong if people were still watching this guy after all the stuff that he's done in the past uh I don't think this is going to stop them if anything this was probably top tier premium content which is the reason why we're talking about it now and the whole freaking internet has talked about it and he's getting more pressed than he's ever gotten before despite all the crazy deplorable things
he's done in the past I'd never heard of him I'll tell you that much I have um and if he's able to be platformed somewhere he'll get tons of views this is not this is not generally penalized by the internet audience um there's some people that would be like I I would yeah but you weren't watching him yeah like it's not you I don't know it is what it is I worry about the kind of stuff that like not my kids cuz they like I have access to their watch History I know what they're watching um
but like what their peers are watching  um they are they have demonstrated their truthfulness elsewhere where it wouldn't be possible enough and as far as they know I can access things they delete as far as they know right now in time they'll figure things out better and you know I won't be able to rely on that but for now um even in cases where I can't prove it um and where I don't necessarily have the power to know exactly what happened uh they have shown themselves to be extremely
honest and I and I mean that as a parent with my eyes completely wide open who knows that children are just little humans who lie cheat steal and will even kill um they're they're they're humans they're just people they're just smaller I'm not saying this to to say that the other ones aren't I've just spent more time with this one and he's older but little man is definitely intelligent and clever enough to figure it out if he wanted to and he has um he has bypassed parental controls before and we have
talked about it and he did get busted and that's why he thinks that I know because I did catch him before and it was a pretty clever workaround that I was not aware of is it   on oh man I forget I actually forget what exactly the workaround was I think it was um I think it was that the the screen time wasn't counted if you like quickly locked and unlocked the phone or something like that or like I forget what it was but it was a it was a pretty clever workaround  I I he's at the age now where instead of
the conversation being you need to be 100% honest all the time the conversation is you need to learn the importance of honesty and you need to be man enough to be honest at times when it's hard but no I don't expect you to tell the truth to absolutely everyone in your life 100% of the time and eventually you need to learn the lesson that you shouldn't yeah eventually you're going to need to learn to hold your cards closer to your chest so we've we've he's headed into adolesence and we've started
to have those conversations instead of just I mean it's like there's appropriate time it's like physics right where you learn the laws of it and then ignoring air resistance and everything you learned was wrong yeah and then you learn that everything you learned then was wrong and then you learn that everything you learned then was wrong right like like you know the early conversations with your kids are you know it it doesn't it doesn't matter if you win or lose uh as long as you try
your best well you know probably about a year ago maybe between a year and a year and a half ago I had to have the first conversation with my son so it's coming real soon for my eldest daughter that was like hey what I told you that's actually um in life it matters if you win if you didn't win you lost um and if you tried really hard um you still lost and you know I think it was I think it was after a tournament or something and he was like uh I was tired and to make my point I brought up like some some
someone who lost like a major match and I was like hey look have you seen this uh on the results it says that that the score was this but this guy was tired here look and he goes it doesn't say  exactly yeah yeah it doesn't say his tummy hurt because nobody cares um at some point you're going to need to win and it's not going to matter nothing else is going to matter if you want to win then you're going to have to leave everything else at the door and you can you can understand as well like
you can basically decide that it's not worth the effort that you know that you might have to put into this thing in order to win and you can be like okay I'm going to accept that I'm at a certain level of casualness with this thing but if you're like no this is this is my thing I must win then it's like well then win yeah um put in the effort so yeah we you know and it I I think we were also having the conversation about like school as well it's like look you're right you can you can get a good
enough grade but at some point you're going to have to decide if good enough is good enough or if you want to excel um because like let's let's be real um our kids have ended up with a really interesting mix of of well their parents obviously right cuz that's like how genetics work um and and they've they've got this they've got this fascinating sort of spectrum that they sit on between the things that are great about my mind which is sort of this raw creative dragon energy and the things
that are great about ivonne's mind which is this spectacular attention to detail um and I think they have a lot of potential but I think they have a lot of the same challenges that um I had and she had um and that she figured out and that I didn't until a lot later and that's that it's hard to learn to work hard when you don't have to um and Ivon figured it out still when she was still in elementary school like when she was pretty early she when they when they basically when they started giving out
letter grades was and she got be's and she was like excuse me what the I thought I was an a student and kind of cleaned up her act got it um whereas for me I I don't know I cleaned it up in like grade N I think but then I completely fell apart um when I started dating just just yeah not focused like FL out FL out of University like hard I don't think I really got it until I landed at BCIT cuz I would get really um like touchy about my teachers like I had a terrible grade in
English for reasons that are probably self-explanatory at this point um until I got an English teacher blonde uh until I got an English teacher that was just an absolute badass Mr Thompson fantastic um and then my English grade cranked and I got into AP English out of nowhere I was like barely passing for my whole life and then I got a high a and then AP English the next year and then he was a professional writer for a while which was a choice um and then and that was kind of similar
for a lot of different things in school where like if I had a good teacher I would get like dialed in and do super well but if I had a bad teacher I had this like no I don't like that teacher I'm not going to try which is stupid um Panda asks made my brain happy he any   think I mean I don't know man it's one of those things where it's like it neuro neuro Divergence right and I think that if you want to be at a certain level of excellence in certain things you probably have to be on extremes
somewhere you're probably on some kind of spectrum uh of some sort sick um and it's and it's one of those things where like I've uh I've had conversations with people where they're like okay yeah Linus but I don't feel bad for you because for you you know the hyperfocus and sort of the inability to to pay attention to one thing for a long time and you kind of like are you go off on these tangents it's like a superpower and and you know for me it's not like that and it's like yeah but at some
point you're going to have to decide if you want to make excuses or if you want to win that was a yeah that was a lesson I got from my physics teacher really yeah I won't name him because not a lot of people are stoked about this lesson but it was interesting at the time uh where there was someone in class there was someone in class I have I have certain you know I can't I can't read all that great but um someone in class had a some form of um learning disability I don't remember
what it was and um it was it was constant right every single class when we broke it into doing work this person requested help and the teacher would help them never a problem with that and then they they asked for I think they asked for something else it was like a lower required grade to pass the class or something like that um and he drew like an extremely hard line and he was like no because when you leave this will never be a thing so like you got to figure it out now but he's like
I'm here at all times to help yeah but like you know I can I can help you after class I can help you on lunch I can help you on various other breaks if you take a spare period I can help you during that if I have time I can potentially help you outside of class like I can give you everything but you have to pass the same bar um and overhearing that because you could they were like talking in the corner right but you could kind of still hear it over hearing that I was like huh okay I need to kind of shut up
about my reading thing and like figure it out and to be clear shut up and figure it out isn't the right way either not always get support talk to people you know get a diagnosis you know find resources for me it was the right thing all yes and that's fine but your way your path might be totally different very yeah your path is probably going to be very different it might also inform like you know maybe you should do a slightly different thing yeah I I think the our Our Generation was hammered with
the like everyone can do anything you can be anything like literally we were told we could be astronauts yeah I cannot be an astronaut yeah if I had if I had focused every every ounce of my being on being an astronaut from the age of two I would be no closer to space than I am right now and that is exactly 5' 6 in off of the Earth 59 if I jump yeah and I I think honestly I think that advice was was kind of poisonous um yeah I think so too and I I think sometimes recognizing like okay
um I am I am clearly not good at this thing even if I like it well there's practically infinite other possibilities in the world maybe I should find something else that I like and I can do well that was something that I really struggled with to many we weren't exposed to that much at least I wasn't it was like do you want to be a tradesperson a policeman a firefighter an astronaut or teacher don't forget teacher teacher yeah yeah and like so I just thought I wanted to be a teacher
cuz I was like I don't know my mom's a teacher my stepdad's a teacher my aunt's a teacher every adult in my life like I I just listed all the things my teachers are all teachers I didn't know what people went to business school for until I was in like high school I was like what do you mean you just do like these things yeah cuz it's all anyone would ever tell you you just have a boss and you just do what they tell you right yeah like I I was oh okay yeah you know you figure it out
eventually but it was it was a weird time in regards to communication of what like schools and teachers were telling you you could you could do when you grew up um dland says I still don't know what people go to business school for I think it's for a common sense education honestly a lot of what people seem to cover there is just like how to interact with people how to how to do basic analysis how to generate pretty valuable commun I know I know commun how to generate a report dude it's such a huge
problem how to do a meeting how to sell it all comes back you were talking earlier in the show about how you have to be selling all the time these are these are genuinely very valuable things  yeah um yeah conversely if you find a way to do find a way to love what see reading problems if you find a way to love what does work surrounding yourself with others okay I can't read that properly but yeah I mean there's there's alternatives to everything right like there's um um there's a guy who who doesn't have
any arms and is a uh race car drifting person I think he does literally Formula Drift and he doesn't have arms he steers the wheel with one of his legs and then he manages all the pedals with his other like amazing super sick made it work there's routes for sure I saw this uh you also have to understand that was way harder for him than anybody else and there was no like I saw this incredible video of a mom uh with no arms lifting her baby onto into a seat and then like out
of it and stuff with her legs that's so sick just like from like from a from a chair position like being an absolute badass super without arms but like yeah yeah and like it it sucks that that's harder for her for sure but I think wallowing and self-pity over it isn't going to help yeah might help no might help I don't think so it could you won't know  try let's see let's see if it helps go  okay all right uh what do we do I just want to make it clear that everything that Luke and I say comes
with a little bit of survivorship bias as well obviously we have powered through and succeeded in our respective fields and so you know it's easy for us to say hey this this worked this works great but but I think the most important thing I said was the part where I said learn about yourself find yourself know yourself seek out a diagnosis seek out strategies seek out support find your own path if what if the path that you're on isn't working um understand that you can almost certainly find another path I
think that's the biggest thing for me um is like there's there's things that I wanted to do when I was growing up that I was able to self- recognize like this just isn't a good route for me and there's ways to win that are not being an astronaut yeah and that's okay you don't have to win that hard dude the the need for oh man if you get into as far as I can tell literally any trade in BC you will just kill it oh yeah my goodness you will destroy like it's it's yeah and not all of them are like
excruciating pain and like yeah like requiring a ton of strength like there's a lot of tools that are coming out that are that can help assist with that type of stuff in really cool ways like if you don't even if you don't like getting dirty being an electrician you know if you some of them still get dirty okay some of them still get dirty but there's definitely a lot of jobs where you don't get as dirty like you don't you don't have to do you know residential uh you know plumbing repair you know like
there's yeah there's lots of traits is the point that I'm trying to make here yeah there's tons um hold on there was something here that I thought was really funny stay the path says I can't help but feel like they're talking directly to me sorry 1987 datson in F chat said I'm a lineman in the states and I make over 200k a year the trades are the way I didn't even go to college 200k a year us yeah that's like real money dang yeah like I I don't know there's there's routes there's routes a
lot of like people people troll garbage men all the time dude they make cash yeah and a lot of a lot of the garbage routes this was this was mean sanitation professional sure whatever uh a lot of the sanitation professional routes as far as I've heard are based on completion not time so you'll notice how they they often work really fast oh yeah they get paid the same right so you get a team of PE people that are going to hustle and they finish this 8 Hour route in like five and a half then you just
have the whole rest of the day off and you didn't lose any income kind of a sick job like cool and then if you're a hustler go start a side hustle in that extra 2 and a half hours and then you're just making major bank I don't know there's there's a lot of really cool options like legitimately really cool options especially I find if you look at jobs that are like less traditionally attractive because then there usually isn't as much competition and when there isn't as much competition it's often um
you know you end up making more money for it so yeah um speaking of making money the show was brought to you by super micro look up in the sky it's a bird it's a plane it's super micro oh my God that's right super micro is taking things to the next level with their h14 generation servers powered by amd's epic 90005 processors with a staggering 192 course and 384 threads per chip and powered by radon Instinct Mi 325x gpus these servers are designed to provide maximum performance and efficiency that was an

supported float plane tier we'd have to build an entire new like ad sales department and um no le School said uh as a disabl person I find this more dystopian than cool really oh w h okay this case specifically called out diseased people though not  H well  noted um the WordPress Oh wait we're supposed to do merge messages all right hit us sure message for Luke fellow lisic here uh have you ever read or heard of the dyslexic Advantage no uh what would be a dyslexic Advantage you also missed part of this
merch message I thought thought you'd have a Google of that uh lmg crew keep up the good work and who the f is this Dan guy interesting I ain't going to prompt her at this week lus that was very embarrassing I'm sorry about that um dxic Advantage I have to say I have to say this being a book has got to be the most hilarious thing I'm sure you've seen the fonts that's got to be the funniest thing I've like ever heard that's like somebody writing an ADHD "book that's 12,000 Pages yeah something"
like that um I I would be it would be interesting if it was in one of those fonts that's easier to read um but no I haven't heard of this I don't know um get an audio book yeah uh reviews are really positive it seems wish I read it sooner interesting I yeah I have no idea what it's supposed to be I mean have you found an advantage on your own no okay then I guess you need this book I unless I'm like already doing it and don't realize it or something I don't know but it just makes reading harder may it
makes cooking chicken  know uh up next why does lonus focus on the bill of materials cost when arguing a product isn't overprice if bomb costs exceed the value to to Consumers then the product needn't exist sales data seems like a better indicator of value  so overpriced to me is not a measure of value it's a measure of the price and the price is the price the price of um let's say man oh this a this this a this this is a tough one um value is subjective cost and price is not they
are they are objective so if something has a bill of materials cost of $100 and a retail price of $150 or $200 it is objectively priced within the range of what you would expect based on um how what what uh what a brand would have to price it at in order to account for all of the various other expenses that they need to manage within their business all of their administrative overhead uh customer service uh breakage and warranty and like after sales support sort of all all of that overhead that
they have to cover you can typically expect a markup on a product to be anywhere from like 50 to 100 points bare minimum luxury Brands get away with a lot more than that but that's sort of pretty pretty normal um and and it can even be normal to go quite a bit higher like software companies for example will have margins way higher than that so if you were yeah glasses glasses have have a lot of pharmaceuticals a lot of margin but the thing about pharmaceutical margin and I'm not going
to defend the big Pharma companies but the thing about pharmaceutical margin is there is a lot of R&amp;D that goes in UPF front and there is a need to cash in on that they gone a little far absolutely like I said you'll never hear me defend big far R&amp;D and a lot of things but there can be especially in the past I'd say it's less true now especially in the past you could work for years trying to develop a drug spend millions and millions and millions of dollars and and develop nothing like it
was a it was a a strike ITR or die trying industry I think that with a lot of the new tools they have for drug development these days it's it's less like that um but there was a time when it was like that anyway um so so so the the so the cost of something and the price of something is just it's objective it's measurable um the value of something is subjective and so when you say sales data seems like a better indicator of value I would agree with that I I would agree that if something
sells really well then it's a good value and if something doesn't sell very well then and it either was a bad value or there was bad marketing there could be a variety of reasons that something doesn't sell very well actually there can be a variety of reasons that something sells really well including great marketing and IT not necessarily being a great value but yes I would agree with you that sales data is probably a better indicator of value but value is up to you yeah or it's up to
you yeah or it's up to me no what no well for me to make a PCH my God them and me okay that's it yep value is personal and so if if you if I were to say this water bottle I'm going to price it at $29.99 my cost is $15 you can say um that's overpriced and I can say you're wrong because it isn't that's just what it costs and you might not want one of these you might not think that you know the insulated wall matters you might like to drink out of a mason jar which you can just get with like the I don't
know the preserves that you would normally buy and you can just you can just repurpose it and that's great that costs you nothing and that's a better value for sure but um this isn't overpriced it's just not something that has a value to you so value is subjective and price is objective and that's the difference that took an awful long time carry  sure um I'm at my wedding's welcome party and we're getting married tomorrow tomorrow any advice for the Newly Weds on the day of and for a happy life together
onwards have fun don't what don't have fun that's not what I meant uh don't get married it's always so cringey when you see those like gifts or whatever of like somebody pushing their partner's face into the cake or something like that and then it ruins the whole thing um just don't don't do that don't like don't like push your partner into doing something during the day that they're going to uh regret or might ruin their day I'm assuming uh based on uh you know demographics of our viewership
that this is a dude um if your partner is a woman there's a higher chance that they care about their appearance and stuff so you know be careful don't don't shove cake in their face even if you've seen it on a meme and it looked funny and they enjoyed it uh don't risk it ask first do stuff like  careful it's just a lot of people put a ton of value into this day right so just you know chill and be careful don't ruin it  lot next ah two to three more topics what do you want want to talk about how
about the WordPress Feud yeah okay I'm going to do the background here wordpress.org is an open-source web publishing project which Powers around 40% of the top 10 million websites we assume it is owned by Matt mullenweg who is also the CEO of automatic which owns wordpress.com a fremium web building platform based on wordpress.org all right a month ago automatic sent a cease and desist letter to WP engine a thirdparty WordPress hosting service for using the WordPress trademark on their
site because according to automatic WordPress excuse me WP engine doesn't contribute enough to the open source project WP engine sent their own cease and assist letter and claimed that Mullen WG told them he'd take a scorched Earth nuclear approach unless they paid 8 % of their revenue as a trademark fee or dedicated an equivalent amount of employee time to the project Mullen WG has since banned WP engine from using wordpress.org servers which has broken WP engine customers websites last week
WP engine sued WordPress for extortion further 159 automatic employees who disagreed with Mullen wi's leadership accepted a severance package and left the company which this isn't in our notes but he apparently took to mean that everyone who remained agreed with  works yeah uh discussion question is as much as it's a as much as it's good for people to contribute to open source projects how are people supposed to trust open source projects when the rug can get pulled out from under them at a
moment's notice uh that's true for Clos Source projects too that's just that's  um I don't know yeah it sucks that being said um of like all the times in the internet's history this is the easiest one to Pivot off um so as much as it's you know terrible um I'm sure there are services that will welcome you with open arms Wick squ space how much work have you done on your WordPress impation though no it sucks I'm not trying to say it doesn't suck okay um just as long as you're not
trying to say it doesn't suck cuz it definitely sucks yeah I know it sucks a lot um just I I I think what I'm trying to say is like I wouldn't just automatically throw in the towel um you might feel like you want to do it right now you sure might and I wouldn't blame you but you know uh even compared to like a year ago the the internet is more equipped to move your business off of Wordpress than it ever has has been so there is there is light at the end of the tunnel um I suspect there's even
going to be companies that pop up that are designed to help you with this um and you know you might not have the money to go that route I work for a publishing company says context menu we have over 50 sites running WordPress with hundreds of custom plugins yeah the custom plugins part is that's painful oh yeah it's all it's it's all really rough um like this could actually be a death blow for certain businesses oh it will be I'm 100% certain I don't know for how many but I'm sure it'll take a couple of
them out there's a lot of businesses that uh you know at a certain point they almost become a passion project and it's like I can keep this thing going but that's pretty much all I've got and a blow this big is just going to completely take it out um watch the Fire Ship video on it it was really really good and explained both sides better than your notes did fir ship does good stuff so I'm not too surprised uh maybe if you're interested in in seeing more on this go check out  um
Matt Matt from Labs web says WordPress is an is awful as a product regardless of drama anytime it's the right time to  disagree I would I would generally Echo that sentiment that being said you don't want it ripped out from under you um you would want to migrate off of it um carefully and while taking your time and and stuff like that um but yeah this is this is the the wrong circumstances to be unbg Brady says WordPress is the notepad of blog sites change my mind I won't be able to because you're
unbudgeted it yeah I also don't disagree with that uh WordPress is just uh I think their their time has passed in my opinion I know there's cool things that they do and stuff but they just I don't know man speaking of I can't remember the last time I recommended them speaking of cool things I used to make money through WordPress fun fact really yeah I bought a package of Wordpress themes this was one of my many small business ideas that I had I bought a package of Wordpress themes and then I
would just set up info Pages for like local businesses and stuff because it was really easy I have the theme so it looks nice and I just put their info on it put their logos on it and was like cool m is what it is it was it was uh it was simple it was easy it was good it was fantastic at the time it was exactly what I needed it was the best tool for the job at the time and I would recommend moving off of it now let's move off this topic yeah behold the Cyber cab oh Tesla CEO Elon Musk part-time CEO
held an event yesterday to unveil the company's long-promised fully autonomous vehicles in the form of a new one not the ones he said were fully autonomous before the Tesla robo taxi the so-called cyber cab currently consists of 20 apparently functional prototype Vehicles it lacks any steering wheels or pedals which means it would need special authorization from Regulators despite lacking any driver and appearing roughly the size of a standard car it only has two seats it also lacks a charging plug
and will apparently charge wirelessly musk says that Tesla will launch a fully autonomous driving in t in Texas and California next year and that the Cyber cab will enter production in 20 26 the 10-year anniversary of when he said full self-driving would be available though it could be delayed until 2027 musk also unveiled a prototype for a driverless 20 passenger Robo van which has no official timetable for development or production  2017 uh at Bor something I forget every two or three weeks a tech guy
accidentally invents the concept of the city bus uh yes the event also showed off the humanoid Optimus robot again which musk claims would one day be able to be a teacher babysit your kids and be your friend uh the Bots were shown serving drinks and interacting with guests at the event but these were apparently at least partially telep piloted by human operators following the event Tesla stock dropped by 8% while stocks for Uber and Lyft Rose cool well good luck with that neat yeah
it looks better than the regular cyber Truck Yeah well I mean that's a low bar it's not a truck though yeah but yeah I think it looks neat yeah two seater though that's um kind of a downer what's what's with the like the like Star Wars shuttle looking version this one on the right oh no that's the bus yeah okay so that's what I'm talking about then not the Cyber cab I think the bus looks neat C Cab just looks like a slightly different model X as far as I can tell it looks like between a cybertruck
and a model X this one yeah yeah it's got kind of it's got that angled butt yeah yeah yeah I don't mind it sure I don't mind it looks better than the cybertruck yeah anyway yeah good luck everybody to the Moon dude to the moon or through the ground stock just went down invest now right yeah yeah not investment advice M1 Maxs are breaking since mid 2023 a significant number of M1 iMac users have reported screen degradation resulting in a pattern of horizontal lines appearing across their displays
the issue typically crops up after a couple years of use meaning that the devices are out of warranty Apple has yet to acknowledge the problem though one user reported that the technician they went to blamed the issue on a flex cable powering the LCD burning out because it has to sustain voltage of about 50 volts at the screen's highest brightness setting due to how the devices are constructed fixing this issue typically means replacing the whole screen at a cost of around $600 to
$700 it is currently unclear whether Apple has fixed the issue in more recent generations of iMac and our discussion question here is and this is this is one that I kind of wrote is does Apple get an adequate amount of journalistic scrutiny because it seems like in the last 20 years they have gone from being covered by professional journalists to still being covered by professional journalists but also having cultivated a following of fans um I think professional journalism is I think this
is almost a different conversation it's that a lot of professional journalism is dying but apple is money in it anymore Apple almost uniquely plays the game so well at least in the tech space of of the the sort of the the praise for Access model um if you if you not only it's not and it's not even as simple as if you say the right things about Apple you'll get invited to Steve Jobs theater and you'll you know attend the Keynotes or whatever it's it's not that simple yeah
it's you have to not only say the right things you have to be the right things  to what's the word I'm looking for you you you almost have to have the right Aura you have to that is a trending that is very good good job you've communicated  young you have to personify the ideal Apple customer is what you have to do and I um I almost wonder if that's detrimental for apple puff them in the long term I I don't know if they I don't I mean they get a lot of criticism but I almost I like seeing seeing see all the
seeing all the better things about iOS 18 right seeing how much better it is I don't know if it makes me I don't know if it makes me think that they have heard all the things that they're supposed to be doing and then just weren't doing it or if they were shut off from it and are finally hearing it like I I don't know what it is exactly that that made them sort of ignore these obvious egregious glaring issues for so long like not being able to rearrange your your icons on your
home screen and stuff like that um yeah but people were pointing that issue out even when there was more Negative they were but were those voices powerful enough I guess is the question pretty loud is Apple under enough scrutiny but are they loud in the right places remember you're not necessarily reading a random uh discussion forum on Mac Rumors if you're if you're a decision maker at Apple like the people with access the people who can actually talk directly to decision makers are they putting the
right amount of pressure pressure on them cuz like I'm looking at this I'm looking at this screen issue right when when Asus didn't acknowledge the SD card problem with the Ally we weren't the only ones having meetings with top level Executives basically saying you guys need to do this yeah I don't know if anybody holds that kind of power over apple and I don't think Apple wants that oh they definitely don't but will that be but will that be damaging to them in the longer term is the
question that I'm asking I have a hard time believing honestly any company wants that I feel like most companies will comply with that to try to uh soften the blow I actually disagree um and no company is is monolithic but there are certainly ones that I've encountered that value criticism okay at a high level I think what I was pointing out was the the public nature of a lot of the criticism that happened around Asus I don't think anybody wants that no I don't think anybody wants a media
Firestorm necessarily but I think that um I do definitely think there are companies that really want measured good accurate constructive criticism definitely there are there are quite a few companies that like I don't know if Apple does pay money to have that let alone just want it CMD Kini says who says Apple isn't adequately addressing the issue well they haven't acknowledged it that's step one of addressing the issue and apple has a long history of yeah they they have long history of
ignoring things so hard uh hoping that they'll go away only to finally acknowledge them only if they if they get enough backlash um butterfly keyboard for example bump gate on the the older Mac books like this is not this not a new thing let's let's not pretend um you're holding it wrong yeah yeah exactly verdict one um that's about it Fisker can't sell its cars due to server issues rof this is such a cautionary tale and we should all listen extremely intently for the next 2
minutes as part of its bankruptcy procceedings EV company Fisker has been attempting to liquidate its Assets in order to payback creditors in June rental company American lease agreed to "purchase fisker's remaining 3,300" vehicles for 46 3 million as of last week American lease had paid 42.5 million and had accepted delivery of a third of the vehicles last Friday Fisker revealed that they couldn't transfer the vehicle's Cloud link to another company's servers due to an underlying
technical issue it is unclear how long Fisker knew about this problem prior to  lease I wonder know what that issue is it doesn't matter like it's a bankruptcy thing so just give them the servers the point is well not necessarily because not every car will be owned by American lease there are still end users out there so it could be a privacy issue it could be anything could be a technical issue it could be a contractual issue we don't know because American lease would struggle to run the fleet of vehicles
without the cloud-based features the company has filed an emergency objection to fisker's liquidation plan the doj has filed its own objection based on claims that Fisker has been asking owners of their vehicles to cover the costs of their own recall repairs Fisker also appears to be under investigation by the SEC but the exact focus of the  unknown so here's the problem the problem is not Fisker necessarily here the problem is not just this car or This Server the problem is that this
will happen to basically everything that you own once it is reliant on cloud-based Services absolutely everything that you purchase because is it really a purchase if it just stops working when somebody rent yeah when somebody sort of decides they don't feel like paying for it anymore um I forget how I started the sentence so it doesn't matter the point is that everything is literally one bad decision or one key person being hit by a bus or or one um infrastructure error away from being a brick and this is
terrifying yeah back to Tesla for a minute back to every single day that goes by I like my car more they have done a very good job actually by and large of providing otaa updates to their vehicles going back to pretty much the first ones from day one I said these things are going to be a disaster because they keep revving the hardware so frequently and um the the the ongoing overhead of supporting all of these various uh all these various models and all of these various
iterations of the hardware is going to be completely untenable and they're just going to start sort of deprecating them and it's going to I was wrong they have actually done overall a pretty spectacular job in that in that regard they've done a pretty bad job of a lot of other things but that I got to give credit but that doesn't mean that I was overall wrong about that problem and Fisker is anyone who bought a Fisker or "um 3,300" fiskers is going to is is finding that out the hard way and I'm just I don't
know what to do  me I want to say vote with your wallet but like what what can you even how many cars even are there that aren't basically susceptible to a similar issue like this right now that you would buy new yeah this I wrote this in the uh in the topic doc um this is and applied to basically every car yeah for prep for this one I'd love to have a list of car brands that existed in the 9s and don't exist anymore if you think your car company is going to last and this won't be a problem you are
literally wrong Pontiac yeah there's one uh Mercury yeah nice um is Saturn still around nope speaking of planet-based car company I know right Sab Saab yeah yeah cion not '90s but DeLorean yeah Oldsmobile yeah a lot of these were bought out by other companies but that's sort of what's Happening Here Suzuki pulled out of Canada um yeah datson Deo yep a lot of companies yep I mean some of them have like still exist but have changed ownership like multiple times like jaguar is not a British um car
manufacturer uh who has owned Jaguar I thought they were like Australian or something they became nationalized ized in 1975 due to financial difficulties no no they were British uh but in 1984 uh it became its own company again Ford Motors purchased them in 1999 and then Land Rover in 2000 selling both to Tata Motors in 2008 where's Tata uh India I think okay was it an Australian movie where they talk about it then or something there was there was something   Mumbai wild though right AMC there's
another one um Holden was apparently the uh the Australian one a lot of these  yeah all right what else we got is there good news Plymouth is there good news behold Nintendo's alarmo on Wednesday Nintendo announced new hardware that has spent 10 years developing a $100 alarm clock called alarm Mo alarmo has an optional motion detection feature and will make game sounds when its user moves users can use gestures to enable snooze on their alarm and turn it off simply by getting out of
bed it likewise tracks the user sleep Nintendo suggests not using the motion tracking feature if you sleep with  person tell me the product is only for forever alans without telling me that in addition to this announcement probably KES Nintendo has published a four-part interview with the clocks developers oh um discussion question does Nintendo not understand what people want from them or is there actually a huge untapped market for Nintendo themed alarm clocks that you can't use if you have a
girlfriend I I I just saw this and I was like what like Nintendo has made all kinds of things over the years especially if you go back to their pre video game days like they're they're an old company and playing cards yeah they they they've created some utterly unbelievable products but this one I'm just like why who was asking for this like I could I could I could see if it was a switch dock or something switch do with buil-in clock I don't I don't know they've been interested there's a
there's an addon think you can get for Pokemon go that tracks your sleep there's a game called Pokemon sleep um and now they have this they've been really into sleep stuff for actually a long time this isn't their only thing right now that um deals with sleep elardo says I love Nintendo because they do their own thing without paying attention to Trends sometimes you get the switch sometimes you get this yeah you got to diversify what the I just yeah I mean yeah maybe we should maybe we should do an alarm
clock like I just it it just feels so Random why don't you want the sleep motion tracking of all of your employees in the line of town what make sure you make sure everyone goes to bed on time it's good it'll only work if you sleep with somebody else it'll only work it we need more members of the line of absolutely oh my goodness you we're not doing lonus Town even if I had the money I wouldn't spend it on lonus town that would be embarrassing that would actually be like cringe worly
narcissistic yeah but we all want more so than everything else yes they're going to back me up on this one they hate agreeing with me but guys come on it's it's almost to the point it's almost to the point where it's annoying to type in our website domains CU they all start with either lonus or L every single one of them searching for your name on documents they don't or is is like impossible float plane you can use that against me the one that oh well LTT store LTT Labs
blindness Media Group Creator Warehouse Creator warehouse.com boom short lin.com weird it seems like it redirected to something well it seems like found a way boom got him yeah float plane.com let's go yeah oh look at this video coming young people try Windows XP oh that's actually kind of cool yeah that's uh the question we set out to answer is is Windows XP actually as goated as the people who remember it think it is yes yes you may be disappointed I don't care okay well wrong Windows Windows 7 goat well
yeah yeah but Windows XP is we'll see Windows XP was better because you can rightclick something and it uses it as a click instead of having to left click and then right click that is actually the best thing the problem with the wrong opinions about the people that are going to be in this video um is that they are valuing convenience over quality you are making a lot of assumptions about these people there's only one there's only one settings application for the whole computer
instead of two that are split and then one of them opens another one and some of the settings are in one but they're also in another one but they probably won't have to open on Windows 11 so they'll think that's better I'm just waiting for Windows 12 Intel has unveiled AOL Lake their new core Ultra 200s series CPUs also known as aerol Lake s um have been announced and sales and pre-orders will begin on October 24th for about the same price as 14th gen core chips you'll be getting par
performance asterisk at about half the power consumption of course you'll need to buy a new z890 motherboard since since a lake s needs the new LGA 1851 socket and also z89 boards do not support ddr4 so you'll probably need some new Ram also the performance isn't quite the same team blue admits the geoman of the gaming performance of the flagship core Ultra 9 285k is actually 5% less than the 14900 K but they do claim an 8% increase in single threaded performance and 15% in multi-threaded
workloads compared to 14th gen oh and they have npus but they're not good enough for co-pilot plus so nice so our discussion question is if the performance was identical to 14th gen at half the power consumption would anyone find these chips worth the upgrade upgrade I don't know I think happy about a new purchase definitely I think we are long past upgrading from the last generation product I think we've been long past for a long time in my opinion and I I think we've probably
beat this horse enough talking about the latest iPhones and there was something else that came out recently that I was like yeah I mean I don't think that's necessarily true of everything I think on the GPU side we should expect a generational upgrade for how Bloody long we wait for a new generation of product that's fair you don't wait as long for CPU though I think also it's very likely that a lot of the people watching the show right now um either don't pay for their own power or have relatively cheap
power There Are Places L Euro audience yeah there's there's quite a few places in the world where power costs are like a huge Factor um so you might not care about it but someone else might but that might just mean this might not be for you this product might not be for you you already have a CP that's pretty good is probably not for you um assuming your power costs are also either not way too high or you don't pay for it um I didn't I didn't n Fleming I didn't I didn't mean every one watching
yeah just a in other breaking news yes piracy does cause a drop in revenue for games a peer reviewed study I really don't agree with this study here we go putting that out there a peer-reviewed study compared games with denuvo DRM and found that games where a crack was available at launch suffered an average loss of 19% of legitimate sales in those early weeks compared to games where no crack was available how do you measure that however pirate resulted in nearly zero mean total revenue loss when the
DRM survived for 12 or more weeks because new sales drop off quickly after the first few months according to the study there was no apparent connection between the type of game and its likelihood of getting cracked earlier or later discussion question here is should game Publishers consider ditching DRM a few months post launch hey what would you think of that Luke it's an interesting idea launch DRM yeah and then okay you know it's going to be cheaper now anyway so if you're not
desperate to play it immediately anyway then uh we can just screw off and take our hooks out of your konel or whatever I actually kind of love that it's an interesting interesting way to go for sure I want to see I I really want to  study I want to know if it's time for  Dan I I thought you were asking Luke no I'm not I'm asking Dan I think it should be looks like get out of here soon yeah I will push the button and then I will push these other buttons there's a lot of buttons which one is it well they say
nothing was a problem which is what it is sorry here's the um Declaration of competing interest what what is up with the the capitalization on the word credit I don't know Declaration of the authors declare they have no that means so much okay all right okay make of it what you will you can like it or not like it or believe it or not believe it um I don't think anyone's ever going to agree no on this because by its very definition it cannot be measured no um cuz you're you're talking about
different games now it's like there's so many variables involved with that there are so many variables what if that game just wasn't going to sell as much there  like and you we we know that our ability to predict that is not perfect or else certain games wouldn't be  how about some merch message has do it I've been loving my hat and as if the person who did the study is a developer who made a game so like I'm not saying it makes them bias but I think just having a statement that
says like we're definitely not is also not necessarily Fair anyways what if you just have no DRM and then understand that the people who pirate your game are not going to be the people that purchased it and there will be some probably Netflix didn't lose $2 billion doar in Revenue because of account sharing that was never their money anyway merch messages I've been loving my hat and as a theater Tech I'm sure I'll get a lot of use from a blank black tea question for LL and D did any of you
guys see the Northern Lights last night uh no we we had a we had a solar event a little while ago like I mean a few months ago I guess I don't remember exactly when it was but um I I saw people posting pictures of it and I was like wow that looks really cool and then I went and I looked at it in person I was like oh and I pointed my phone camera at it and I was like oh wow sure looks a lot better in pictures I probably could have just looked at this in pictures and it actually would have been
better so that's kind of where I'm at on looking at the Northern Lights at least this far south this far south it's like kind of a problem they're usually kind of crap um if you're in uh places in Alberta and stuff there's some there's some pretty cool spots cat it but yeah I'm looking through this person's like personal blog and they actually seem pretty cool but I maintain that I don't think it can be properly measured okay yes it can't be properly measured but I also think it's naive to say that
every person who pirated wasn't going to buy it oh absolutely you're definitely losing some amount 20% there's like no way I think measuring it is basically impossible I think we can agree on that yeah I I really don't think 20% is that's that's got to be way too high I don't even think 20% of Gamers would  it that I don't know about necessarily and it's probably changed a lot over the over the years that's why like I would I would think 20% of PC gamers in the mid 2000s probably could
figure out how to Pirate a game yes now yeah I don't know and it it could be very genre dependent as well like if you've got a game that like is super appealing to like Tech heads and Engineering Source you like a Kerbal Space Program or you've like a satisfactory or something like that I would say piracy is more of a threat than if you've got like a hyper casual fall guys you know um assuming we don't need the online whatl blah blah blah but like that type of a game yeah like something more more
casual interesting okay let's move on yeah I don't feel like arguing about it why is it okay that Nvidia locks down every setting and makes everything close Source but it's a problem when Apple does the same thing do you see the value of Apple's Walled Garden as safer when did I ever seem like I was super chill with nvidia's approach we've negatively pointed this out like a trillion times and a lot of people do people dunk on that constantly especially when it comes to their Linux support I have I have
talked multiple times on this show I'm going to say many times on this show about the fact that Nvidia and apple do not work together on anything they do not work together at all do you know why because there is no room that is large enough to fit two penises that big there's no room for them to swing  it won't work can't work they used to there used to be Nvidia gpus in MacBooks think about it what happened bump gate happened and neither of them could admit any kind of failure to each other to the
public and that was it they never worked  simple hello lonus they're they both they both have just a spectacularly arrogant way of doing business um yeah and no it's not good when either of them does it they're they're different in their approaches um I think Apple's is far more anti- consumer like directly to their C to their customers uh but I mean I guess Invidia is is anti their their purchasers of their equipment as well it just manifests far more um behind the scenes because you are not an Nvidia
customer addin board partners are Nvidia customers Solutions providers and system integrators are Nvidia customers and Nvidia absolutely treats them with the exact same level of contempt that Apple does their customers it's just way less visible all right hello hello lonus when purchasing your Thai cant tant were you aware of it sibling the Audi rron GT it has real buttons inside and no Porsche attacks mechanically they are nearly identical I was aware of it I didn't like it as much um also it's really
expensive too what do you I mean it has an Audi tax so right no one at work drives an Audi and I find that very reasonable okay where's even like the locus Locus where's the most local Audi dealership where's the closest one I don't know I mean there there they exist I mean there's defin don't see not even a used Audi yeah I don't see very many Audi in BC at all yeah I don't know oh no it is it is quite a bit less expensive um I admittedly didn't look that oh okay no hold on no no they just
have a sort of different model for it so it only has one trim but then you just add stuff to it so hold on a second if you like add a bunch of like fancy crap to it you can oh you can definitely you can definitely get her like if you want heated rear seats and blah blah blah find Napa leather you can oh no actually no you cannot make it as expensive as a Tian nope not even close so yeah you're right it's cheaper um I went to see it I didn't really like it and I think it's 
simple first purchase as a full-time software engineer gearing up for the home projects to come question for lonus are there any videos similar to the Intel Fab tour in the pipeline Fab tour oh um we're going to look at an ISP oh yeah well that'll be sick sweet yeah that'll be fun that's cool actually that's awesome yeah and I think there's like a oh man what what is what is it again no it's like a it's it's really interesting for some reason uh why is it interesting yeah no it's going to be
really cool I think think it's an ISP or a data center or something and I think it's um I I don't want to say what it is exactly but it's really cool I forget because I think I remember what it is but I don't remember if I think I if I remember right if it's what I think it is it's going to be the coolest thing ever and if it's just a random data center or ISP then it's still going to be really cool there how do current gen consoles use gddr as system why hasn't this been done
on laptops or handheld gaming devices to increase integrated GPU memory bandwidth that's a good question for an engineer um I admit that I do not I am not familiar enough with the differences between regular DDR and gddr enough to tell you why it works fine for a console and why it doesn't work fine for a computer uh my understanding and there there have been computers that do use gdd R memory there was that weird um I forget the brand but that weird like China only console PC that did use gddr
uh We've also seen like like these bizarre um like Frankenstein console boards that uh you can like install Windows on and stuff and they are definitely using gddr um my understanding is it just comes down to that DDR has better latency which is better for running an operating system and G gdr has better bandwidth excuse me better bandwidth which is better for graphics where throughput is the most important thing and these console operating systems are optimized so that
they don't have as many sort of random processes running so there's there's not as much of a hit from having higher latency but beyond that I couldn't tell you and I I I I have to admit I don't really understand why as we make our way into you know dddr 6X um why the latency might not be good enough to use as your system memory as well I mean apple is clearly using shared system memory although in that case um are they using are they using HPM I can't I actually can't remember off the top of my head
right now uh M3 Mac memory type no I think it's just is it DDR why can't I remember right now help me LP DDR 5x yeah okay so it's it's not gddr so Apple clearly uses regular DDR as GPU memory and consoles clearly use   engineers trying again since we ran out of time last week what is one regulation in your industry that you'd like to change or remove and maybe one that you would like to add in my industry a regulation that I'd like to change and remove I hate I hate zoning regul
ations I think they suck I think that if you are you know building something tasteful and safe and um I don't think all zoning sucks mixed residential business mixed residential business yeah but I don't necessarily want like uh highly polluting factories in residential areas yeah yeah for sure no there not all zoning sucks there's value to zoning but I am most zoning on the other hand yeah terrible Downer okay uh I think the one that I would want to get rid of is the I don't remember what it
is but there's some type of claim or something that you can put on a YouTube video where you end up getting people's person identifiable information really if you want to fight it oh yeah that's pretty gross yeah it's a problem like I think some vtuber was going through this recently or something where uh people are putting some form of claim against their account uh because if they want to fight that claim they have to give them their information and they don't want to be publicly
identifiable they the whole reason why they're a vtuber so they can't fight the claim that's super icky yeah it's gross um I mean even for us like you don't necessarily want to give them personal information iron Mouse and fake copyright claim to get personal info yeah yeah some article I was reading the other day yeah it's gross don't do that be yeah that's junky John vuck from Prairie does your interaction or relationship with Taran change after hiring him if taran's no longer working with lmg where
will you find a new CEO who will you trust for such a position um no I don't think that our relationship has changed much we do periodic check-ins where I'm just like hey how you doing more often sorry you talk more often yeah yeah yeah we talk more um but like I would say that the way we interact changes or has changed he's still extremely brutally honest with me I'm still extremely brutally honest with him uh he made an off-hand comment um I I sent a follow-up email a
little while ago being like yeah I was kind of cranky when he said that and he sends me this snarky ass response that was like yeah I can tell when you're sending emails and I'm just like yeah  so yeah it seems fine um as for you know where would I find a new CEO who would I trust for such a position I have no idea I um I I think he has pretty good job security at this point not because everything he does is perfect but because uh you know he has the room as far as you know I'm concern still um I I
don't agree with everything he does I mean I've talked about that a fair bit on the show recently but I do support what he does it's that we were talking about it earlier in the show right um I don't remember the not with thought about Teran specifically um but it was like the whole buyin thing yeah you don't necess have to agree but we're on the same ship y y um I who would I trust I mean if he resigned um I'd probably have to step in until such time as we could find someone
else and I have no idea what that process would even look like I have no experience hiring CEOs um other than just like oh yeah this guy was able to like deal with my Bullit once he should probably able to do it again that was the process last time  know hey guys at Luke as a 3D artist I look for stretched Textures in games to see if the developers put effort into their game does your profession help you in any way judge how good something is in games or otherwise dude I have such a
hard time enjoying certain forms of media now especially YouTube because interesting yeah when I see something that is meant to look like a casual conversation between people oh drives me nuts dude but I can tell that it was filmed from four different angles on three different days not going to lie I get this with you guys sometimes we don't try to hide it dude that that might be why yeah we don't we don't try to hide it for a long time there I don't even know if I could Define the era but
you were making videos in a way that I think you didn't want to or something I don't know how I would even Define it and I could tell and I don't think like almost anyone else could tell but I could tell and it honestly made them unwatchable I couldn't watch any of it cuz I was just like I know for a fact he doesn't want to do this and that just I don't know that threw me off I don't even remember for me it makes me a little bit more sympathetic to uh certain software issues and also
significantly more critical of other ones cuz when like you know how little work it was yeah to to or I know that it was a decision right yep and that'll drive me nuts too sure or I'll or I'll be able to tell you know like somebody just did felt like not doing it so they convinced someone else on the team or something that it like wasn't possible or whatever and it's just like oh I think part of what ruins stuff for me is the people that I'm surrounded with like Brandon Lee used to work here as a
camera op editor before that mostly camera guy um so you know we're having like a cinematography discussion right and um then it kind of shifts into like there's you know and he's telling me like look like as a cinematographer there's certain types of formats I just can't watch and I was like well what do you mean he's like sitcoms I'm like what why can't you watch a sitcom like who cares they make funny joke guy walks in room everyone laughs you know like all the tropes right and he's like the laugh
track actually you know on that anything with a laugh track I can't I can't watch it and then he has me watch this um this edit of The Big Bang Theory without the laugh track it's so rough dude it's and that was that was a show that at least the first few seasons I thought were I thought were pretty funny um they it was it was pretty light entertainment for me like it was the kind of thing that I would watch while like bouncing the baby to sleep it wasn't like you know my my attention was super focused
on it but I enjoyed it and uh and after that I just I I couldn't look at it the same I I just I couldn't enjoy it at all you know they're all standing there silently yeah completely so so part of it is just like the it's it's not necessarily working in the industry that ruins something for me but it's like the the the professionals that I'm surrounded by and sort of their own their influence um yeah totally ruined I I don't think I've watched a sitcom since then yeah yeah I watch an edit of Death Note with
all the inner monologues removed that was awful just ridiculous but yeah there there there'll be like I I I think honestly if anything it makes me appreciate my developers a lot cuz I'll look at other sites and services use it and then be like uh and then look up like how many developers does this company have and be like okay we're doing pretty good [Applause] yeah I don't know uh teams Microsoft teams I always I always give you a pat on the back when Luke is feeling bad helps cheer them up a little bit or
makes you hate teams more I don't know which one it is why why does it not highlight your box when you are talking in a call why are you making everyone go is my mic working you should be able to tell cuz it should highlight just like it does for everyone else that is the worst feature decision in the world why can't I schedule a message to a group chat that I just created why can't I do that why is that a limitation why does that possibly exist you could make an I do that in everything else that has
schedule if this was a free app you could make an argument that it's an anti-spam feature discord's better but teams is a paid app teams for the workplace is a paid app nobody is joining an organization to create groups and spam it and if they are then that organization has some to Fig figure out as I regain control I would like to reiterate that Microsoft if you have any interest I would be very happy to consult on making teams better I will do it for free I might have an in on that
I'll see what I can do we might not even keep using teams um and I even if we stop using teams in the hopes of making it better for all of the rest of the people in the world that have to use your app um I would love to consult for free on making better there are objective and Incredibly easy things that you can do that would make it a way better experience for literally everyone cool nice nice so many people have to use your software for Luke imagine you're hired as an AI researcher once you sign an NDA
they show you an incredible humanlike AGI or maybe they're just hazing you what's the craziest Advance you'd believe what's the craziest advance I would believe like craziest level that they had gotten to that had been hidden from the public and I'm now told is that what they mean yeah let's get that yeah I think that's exactly uh I I think a advancement of what we currently have I don't I would not believe AGI I would be I would be um you know the first time I ever saw a mineral oil computer I traced the
monitor cable to the monitor cuz I didn't believe it I would be doing stuff like that you know trying to figure out what are you what are you doing is there is there a person in the box of this Mechanical Turk um but uh if it was like a you know the the tasking thing that they have now if they had a version of that that was just like very unrestrained didn't have token limits stuff like that was was able to pull on resources way more heavily I would believe that I think the the great I
wasn't asked but I think the the best Advanced that i' believe is near real time latency cuz right now that's a that's a huge like I think that's a huge impediment to making these things believable the tasking how how long everything takes to respond like it it makes the it's not okay think back to when we were hosting the W show remotely mhm during Co oh I see even just the the you know 40 millisecond of a video call 50 milliseconds of a video call is enough that our interaction is not natural is
it fair if it uses some form of like filler or if it reframes partway through in the same way that humans do like what if it h what if it does stuff like that that's the best that I could believe right now is if they could nail down the latency but it would still like say weird stuff and hallucinate and stuff like I don't think we're I don't think we're close to fixing that mhm I I was wondering why all of the underwear are out of stock and say they're not coming back does this mean
you guys are getting out of the underwear business or is it something new is coming uh we have issues with our supplier yet again at what point do you become the supplier we can't I mean we can't we're not a like Fabric Mill no is answer I bet we could make textiles in l no build it bu it no don't do that no no we don't we don't it's going to happen sometimes we just we're having a surprising amount of them at the moment but like I don't   fine tying in from the Creator Warehouse 
no isn't an answer holy moly Luke well played we're going to find a solution it just isn't going to be to become a textile mill that's all and it will take some time yeah we are not dependent on our ability to produce and sell underwear so we'll be fine we have time okay could just buy shirts and cut them up the more the more tall shirts you buy the better looks so turn those into underwear yeah not a bad solution really not a bad solution yeah okay oh man we I even know what the name of the company
could be LTT textile tips yeah nice nice another domain that starts with limes I'm just trying to help you out it's good thank you yeah we need to own all of them I actually have a problem because I often use shorthand to get to domains nice so like Gmail right I'm not typing Gmail just GM enter yeah I can't do that with ours drives me crazy just just set up our set up our shortener our lmg Dogg just make yourself some like had affiliate store add affiliate links Forum I mean you your team
controls like our DNS settings and everything so you could just add some like custom resolving rules and just oh yeah we could do that for the whole company yeah if you just typed it if you just like typed FP into a browser bar you I will do that right now this just sounds like you're not trying hard enough to solve it I I tried to say no was the answer that's my bad yep yeah way to go oops this is not how  Luke your team is looking down on you I got work to do hi LDL how's the bike
painting coming I'm interested in doing a custom paint job on my carhood do you have any tips for someone getting into auto body painting game into the auto body game car paint um don't unless you have many many hours and many hundreds of dollars to invest in it just stay out so close I L did at the end I'm sorry um when is the last time you bought your wife flowers lonus um what she always tells me that they're um not good use of money she is the perfect woman Lego flowers she likes the Lego
flowers I think she does like Lego flowers um last time I bought my way flowers um I'm trying to think I I bought her something random she likes ohenry bars I got her an oh Henry bar a couple weeks ago that's what she likes what did no I I wasn't smiling cuz I thought it was like rule number one is actually listen and actually get them what they actually like that's rule number one yeah I smiling cuz it was cute not cuz it was bad yeah it was adorable lus when you could start
driving what safety measures and rules will you implement Android auto carplay only new car with loads of smart safety features or an old clunker does little man get to drive the Porsche oh absolutely not yeah you got to be kidding me the first thing I did when I started driving was I like hit a pillar in a parking lot like there's there yeah there's no way um I've never hit anything yet no I think if he has I think if he has a big date then I don't see why not but like the
flip side of it is you got to prove some responsible driving before then yeah and the flip side of it is like if she's the kind of girl who's impressed by that is she the kind of girl that um you want around likes you for you yeah you know yeah so I don't know dude and and like and it's one of those things it's like do I want to encourage you know putting on airs that's not his car I wouldn't tell him not to rent a nice car to impress a girl but borrowing your dad's car is not like you haven't actually done
anything really you wouldn't I'm actually surprised you wouldn't tell them not to rent a nice car to impress a girl that does not seem like a lism actually um I okay I wouldn't not allow it I guess like like and it's not up to me anyway yeah right like for sure um and remember rent a nice car to impress a girl can mean rent a limo for a prom that's renting a nice car okay it might impress her like I'm just I'm just saying there there's context where him actually doing something because
remember the thing that's impressive is the effort right and so if you're trying to impress her with your effort which is the thing that I would hope she would be valuing about it right because we aren't all just materialistic here um then you have to actually put in the effort and being like hey Dad can I have the keys is not effort so I would never say don't make an effort yeah but borrowing my car isn't effort yeah working hard and mowing lawns and renting a cool car for
a date is effort unless he had to do those things in order to borrow your car um but then maybe he could get a cooler car by my car I or maybe yeah I don't know it just seems it it just seems lame it seems lame I have so many additional questions I want to ask but they're information that should not end up on the stream so I'm going to leave it there like how long until this is going to be a thing and uh stuff like that which we shouldn't go into till what's going to be a
thing he's driving oh I mean a while like I would expect him to get his license right when he is of age that's apparently not a thing anymore have you heard about that that's interesting I have some pretty strong feelings about that that might not be popular um I I see driving as a fundamental life skill um I I see it as being just an important part of being a competent adult your insurance gets cheaper the longer you have your license so scared that we would have uh differing opinions
Oh I thought you were going to take the nah driving's not necessary and I would have just left and all the Goodwill gone okay goodbye and there's a lot of places in the world where you might never use the skill or certainly not often but then just in case you do your insurance is super cheap look I don't agree with my mother about everything but you know when she was when she was convincing me to learn to drive stick um and I don't necessarily think that most people need to learn stick anymore there
were a lot more stick shift cars back in the early 2000 2000s than there are today uh but when she was convincing me that I needed to learn to drive stick a manual transmission with the shifter um her ration now for it was you don't know where you're going to be and what the Situation's going to be when there's an emergency if the driver is incapacitated for some reason and we need to get to the hospital now you need to be able to drive you need to be able to drive any
vehicle and you need to be ready for it you don't need to be the most practiced operator of the thing but you damn well need to know how to do it and um I kind of carried that with me I I agree I strongly agree um and I think that even if you will probably never drive you should learn to drive yeah uh ver TIG one said being able to drive isn't the same thing as having a license I do agree with that but I don't think at least here getting a license is not that big of a step and the potential benefits
behind it are really big like oh if you do need a car for whatever reason uh your insurance is way cheaper the ability to upgrade your license in case you need to have an upgraded license for a certain line of work that you might need to do yeah it opens up so many work possibilities keeping yourself Limited in that way and making it so that if you do need it it's going to be very expensive um just seems really oddly shortsighted for something that is not that big of a barrier are you always
going to live in a super walkable City maybe you want to move I don't yeah it's it's the arguments look at the cost of housing and stuff lately like you're probably going to move at some point and it's one of those things where not not everybody is in a life situation where they're able to right yeah and the barrier might be too high and the barrier might be too high they might not have access to a vehicle they might not have someone to teach them they might have a physical disability I I don't
know everyone's life situation is there but if you have the opportunity and  disagree yeah yeah like I I knew people that didn't have access to a vehicle in order to take their test and that was a pretty big barrier some of them still got over it by like you know paying a friend to borrow theirs which is kind of sketchy to be clear oh yeah um or or other various options I think there's also places where you can you can rent a car but then renting a car is really expensive um and I think as far as my
understanding goes it's even more expensive when you're renting it for that reason um there's like there's lots of different reasons why it might not make sense but the dip in people getting their licenses does not match um those reasons being more legitimate you know what I mean like that it doesn't follow that line so Arbiter K I don't know if this is true but Arbiter Cas says Gavin Free of slow-mo guys fame is in his 30s and does not have a driver's license that actually blows my mind um I will 
um is in a life situation where he doesn't need to drive himself anywhere  just get it just get it just get it oh my goodness that's uh I I don't know if that's true anyway though UK licensing is it's a very hard test oh yeah we would be put to shame I mean that's not too surprising uh hello hello and be clear there's lots of cities that I wouldn't drive in even though I do know how to drive like there's there's places I've been that I'm just like this is terrifying crazy y so there's that as
well mm there's also places where like if you have an international driver's license you're allowed to drive but like the road laws are so different that you just probably shouldn't yeah I wouldn't even consider driving in like uh an a metropolitan City in like India yeah wouldn't even begin to consider it not not even the rules of the road just the styles of driving are so different so different my goodness yeah hello lldd I'm a power sports student who was told to buy a quality ratcheting
screwdriver Power Sports um motorport okay yeah uh lonus has there been any consideration towards motorcycle riding when designing any products on the store I'd say the only one is the backpack and the only consideration really was that it would fit over like my shoulder pads um on my riding jacket and that uh the Carabiner zipper pulls were because a I thought they were kind of cool I saw them somewhere and I thought they were cool and B because I uh would ride with my rackets my
badminton rackets sticking out of the bag and so I needed a zipper system that would hold but not come apart yeah um but hold but not close completely M um yeah that's about it good evening Daniel Lucas and Sebastian I'm looking to get into swimming as my exercise routine my name oh it is now sorry I keep going curious as to how that is going for you and any tick on getting started um it was great this summer like I actually like got boobs and my cardio is way better um I've switched over to beats
saer now that the weather sucks and I am looking forward to swimming again um next year the only tip I can give you is do it you coward uh it's it's so hard to get motivated to get to the pool even when it's in my back yard it's still hard to like go get changed and like get in the water but once you get going it's um yeah the the relatively long drive to my gym sucks um but the gym that's closer to my house is way overpopulated to the point where if I wanted to do the
same workout that I do at the gym that I go to it would take uh sometimes up to four times as long to the point where in a three-hour period I might not be able to get enough time on each one of the machines to even finish my workout that I can do in an hour at the other gym it's not even worth it I have to drive um the other thing I would say is if you don't want to pull a me and get an ear infection if you're going to be swimming all the time maybe get earplugs or something they're pretty cheap I bought
some like Nike ones and they were like $9 or something $10 $12 somewhere around there and last one I've got for you today hi dll what features are in the works for float plane and are there any features that you would like to implement what kinds of things does the team do for the other companies that's a lot of questions whoa uh could you give us a product road map and uh also a business proposal for the quarter quarterly Business review for what the what's your Q5 looking
like ah yeah honestly each one of those I could make a whole show about um wow the road map I'm not giving you um because I have learned my lesson on that and if we make any change of decision or do anything whatsoever to alter it you'll say you won't be mad people will go freaking nuclear uh you go AP we're working on stuff and it's good yep and people are going to be happy and it is what it is we don't have like you know the the agility or the speed that some notably
larger teams have we don't have feature parody with things like YouTube and twitch and stuff like that and that just is what it is we don't have the the developer base we don't have the armies of developers to do stuff like that and that's okay we still have cool things uh I think FL plane is is good and we're going to keep doing good stuff and it does feel like over time we are trending to getting closer to them which I find interesting um and cool so it's getting it's getting better over time which is
good so I'll say that uh in regards to other things that the team does um that has slowly shifted into more dedicated positions than it originally was so you have people like uh Conrad doing things for LTD store technically the float plane team encompasses the lab's web team so the lab's website is technically on the float plane team um oh did we ever talk about the changes to I don't even think Labs on the uh on the show I don't even think you've seen them all them all have you seen them all when's
the last time you use a site uh uh when I saw us tweet about it tweet about what about the new layout and stuff oh have you seen the page layout though not this have you seen the layout changes to the actual product pages have you seen this yeah where it like animates the hardware notes thing on the left hand side and stuff yeah see when it IT loads the next thing it's like yeah yeah yeah I came on when when we tweeted about it I found out about it in a tweet which is hilarious honest I didn't even know we
tweeted about it oh yeah okay yeah they were like hey come check out the uh I think it's awesome I think it looks great I think it's really awesome looks super pro yeah um I will I will yet again not publicly say the the road map but there is uh something that we're looking into working on right now which I think people will like a lot and it's in the spirit of some of the redesigns we've done to the to the front page and the product pages and honestly I I think it's really sharp um I think some of the
the work that's been done there has been really really good oops I clicked the wrong link are we fans of fanless power supplies this is actually pretty cool um they looked at some articles we've been doing are awesome they at Thermals and efficiency um the answer unless you're a liar or stupid is almost always it's pretty much always going to be it depends it depends so then you got to read the rest of the you got to read the rest of the thing yeah yeah I I really like the the
aesthetic direction that we're taking with the lab site right now I think the changes that were done to the sections of the product pages um even it might not seem that important but even like like this I'm going to bring up my so where it says Hardware notes here it's going to seem really small but just when you scroll down having it do that makes the page feel a lot nicer in my opinion yeah so as you're going through we used to have all the sections automatically minimized they don't do
that anymore um which I think is better um it has that little animation thing so the page kind of feels alive I really really like Dan's whole concept here by other yes uh by by having all of the like picture and Stat information on the right and the write up stuff on the left so it feels like and the write up stays with you as you're scrolling through the stat information so it's just I don't know the flow just feels really good um I'm I really like how the site feels right now
um I think it's I think it's great there's there's still work to be done we need to work on stuff like the uh comparison bin stuff like that um but yeah it's really it's really coming into its own in my opinion so you're still interim head of labs right sure are you applying for the job or like am I applying for the job I'm not applying for the I don't audition I just work here don't audition you take me you don't brother we'll see you again next week same bad time same bad Channel bye 
it's after 8 you need to go oh I lost I lost track and I realized I was tracking oh yeah
