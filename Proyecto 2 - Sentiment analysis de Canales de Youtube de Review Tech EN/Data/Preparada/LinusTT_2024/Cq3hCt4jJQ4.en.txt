you want to build a sick gaming PC on a "reasonable budget but the thing is 1,000" bucks doesn't stretch as far as it used to even a console can cost that much these days maybe the solution is time travel no not literally I mean taking your part selection back a few Generations but how much performance are you leaving on the table I mean 9600 is a much higher number than 5700 so it must be a much better choice right right no and in fact these two CPUs are kind of the perfect springboard for our
little investigation SL experiment here should we just stop buying the latest Hardware to find out we built two entire systems using two wildly different philosophies this one can only use current generation Parts while this one can reach as far back into the past as it wants in search of the best bang for the buck now as you would expect pricing is always changing so if we built these systems a week ago or a week from now we might get very different computers but we're still interested in identifying
any Trends tips and tricks that we can see that might help you get the most out of your next build or even your current one we're also interested in identifying our sponsor MSI power up your rig with the mpg x87 carbon Wi-Fi mother board it supports AMD ryzen 9000 CPUs and Ultra fast Wi-Fi 7 plus it's got RGB check it  description AMD doesn't really do new ryzen 3 CPUs anymore so our brand new pc was kind of stuck with the ryzen 7 9600 X not that that's a terrible thing I
mean when you can consider that it uses Zen 5 versus the Zen 3 we're going to be using in this system you'd think the answer would be obvious but our older 5700 X 3D has two extra cores and is packed to the gills with 3D vcash now this chip hasn't quite achieved 1080 TI levels of legendary but the more than $150 savings versus its bigger brother frees up some very interesting budget for some big upgrades later on that's benefit Numero Uno of the oldest gold philosophy choice not only is there
generally more selection but you can get substantial discounts on new inbox Hardware that retailers are hoping to clear from their shelves that is as long as you're ready to strike there can be trade-offs though for example our 5700 X 3D here uses socket am4 which is a dead end for future upgrades and even for some current ones even if you paired this chip with the best compatible motherboard on the market you'd still be stuck with pcie Gen 4 and ddr4 memory although it's worth noting those
probably aren't major considerations at "a $1,000 budget even our SSD we'd have" probably stuck with a Gen 4 boot Drive even if we had extra money to spend Gen 5 drives cost more don't really benefit gaming and they run hotter at least they do today but who knows what the future holds for devices that'll fit in these slots and being compatible with future Hardware is a tangible Advantage for team shiny here it can also be an advantage today ddr5 all other things being equal offers a small but
measurable benefit over ddr4 and our 16 gigs of tforce Delta RGB fit perfectly in our budget we would have rather gone with something a little bit faster but that kind of trade-off is kind of our point if we want something new we don't always get a best-in Class part it has gotten really hard to spec a well-rounded th000 machine with all all new gen Parts meanwhile in Tardis land though we got that same 16 gig capacity but this time right in the price performance sweet spot with the only
downside being that when we want to upgrade a few years down the road we're going to need to replace our CPU RAM and motherboard all in one Fell Swoop speaking of motherboard this Asus Prime B 550 ma is a pretty good value when it's on sale for around $100 meanwhile this gigabyte x870 gaming plus Wi-Fi 6 ran us $220 that is a huge difference but then again so is Wi-Fi 6 pcie Gen 5 for both the GPU and SSD not to mention an am5 socket which AMD has committed to support until at least 2027 that means
new Chips new drivers and maybe most importantly new security updates AMD has recently said that they will not be "patching ryzen 1,000 2,000 or 3 3,000" series chips for the sink clo vulnerability although they backtracked "on the 3,000 series after some Community" outrage and seeing as the latest 3000 Series came out in 2020 the same year "that we started getting 5,000 series" processors the end of support for our older platform oh not that one this one is probably coming soon clearly that
won't matter when it comes to our next part though the case on this side we've got a random old case that was cheap and over here we've got the fantex eclipse g3a now in terms of size and features they're both fairly similar but with cases the devil's in the details good ventilation Cable Management that's not going to cut your fingers and some high quality included fans very nice fantex meanwhile over here this is what fit in our budget heck yeah cool well thankfully we probably won't need as
much cooling for these components cuz we're not going to have it there is Cable Management though and it's got one  I expect our Corsair cx650 watt to give us a better long-term experience than our $41 thermal T smart 600 watt but it was the only thing that fit in this budget and honestly speaking even our better Corsair could end up near its limit if you were to replicate these builds we would strongly recommend a juicier power supply for both of these systems and if you are by the way we're
going to have all the parts linked down below you'll notice that what's in the system is not actually the 600 W one uh this is such a crappy power supply it wouldn't even boot the system is this over budget now it's a $20 more for 60 more watts seems to be doing the trick um but yeah for our cooler we settled on the thermal right Phantom spirit it's so nice we bought it twice Yep this thing is so good we used the same one for both systems which actually brings us to the big difference
our gpus until the Nvidia RTX 5000 series comes out and I guess also maybe eventually has an option that doesn't cost more than our entire budget we are stuck with the Zotac twin Edge RTX 4060 to be clear it's not a terrible card it's got decent 1080p gaming performance with the usual Nvidia features that turn it into a far more compelling package than its wimpy 8 gigs of vram would normally allow I can see why it's popular compared to its a equivalent but here's the thing this XFX Speedster
Radeon 7800 XT is not an equivalent card we were able to spend an extra $200 on it thanks to our frugality elsewhere so even though it's hard to compare spec for spec across Team Green and team red we can probably expect a huge performance Delta not to mention the double pcie bandwidth of course in theory that shouldn't impact the real world too much but hey why am I talking about Theory time to put these systems to the test representing team brand new will be David while I will be taking our old
machine not because I know the outcome and I like winning because you're old but you mean that one too easy let's start with a cine bench drag race ready  go I'm tired I'm going to sit down I guess I'm the old one my knees cracked I'm totally out ofe he must have been trying to distract from the fact that the all news system is pulling ahead you know what the difference isn't that much especially when you consider that that is two generations newer then I'm not really
sure what I expected cuz I have two more cores let's move on to gaming I love what you've done with the backgrounds by the way Abe Simpson is my familiar follows me around everywhere no one else can see them I would think 1440p yeah that's what I been testing everything 120 that's going to be pretty rough 4060 not my problem I would also be curious to run it at a lower resolution to see if your faster cores are a huge benefit or are they even faster I got x3d uh Your Game just crashed yeah
booted me out we were having some trouble with Expo on this system that's the thing it's technically overclocking we might need to go back to J deck settings that's not going to help your performance numbers but it's the luck of the draw your performan is looking pretty good yeah 350 350 FPS I'll take it Oh I thought you had him oh I missed I I like flinched I'm a I'm a flincher uh well you haven't dropped below 200 and I seem to live there it's almost like having a way better GPU makes a
pretty big difference for gaming who have known Let's test my theory that I could switch to very high and still have better fps than you that's very high yep oh hey I'm winning barely though barely this is an entire Notch up in in-game settings and about the same level of performance and I'm noticing my 1% low is dropping to below 100 too actually yeah my 1% lows are significantly better than yours let's do Final Fantasy 16 next after about a 1 minute unskippable cut scene we can jump right to the
pretty epic icon fight uh that'll give us a pretty good indicator of what our performance is going to be and this is a very on topic game right now since this is one of the big PlayStation 5 exclusives that has just come to PC right on the heels of the launch of the PS5 Pro and so if you guys want us to make a PS5 Pro killer give this video a thumbs up and we will make that happen we wouldn't even need to save that much money compared to this budget with how expensive that thing is oh oh no oh wow oh
no not even 30 that's not close dude that was chugging yeah that was below 20 I mean nvidia's got a lot of cool technology to make up for having an underpowered GPU like frame gen but wouldn't you rather just have more frames this is definitely a game that's designed around upscaling uh which which is a bit unfortunate but this is pretty hopeless considering this is already 1440p but even I'm having frame drops in the video I also couldn't help noticing my GPU is running 20Â° cooler than yours
holy crap there's something to be said for investing in a case with way better airflow I mean I don't know how much it would matter my GPU is pinned at 100% just playing this freaking video this may be an engine but capped but because yours can barely handle it it's running at 100% whereas mine's not that makes a lot of sense chugging dude it's chug a lugging look at that 15 FPS and this is "a $1,000 PC like this is a pretty hefty" investment and you haven't just blown
money on dumb stuff either you've spent too much on your motherboard by getting a top tier chipet second to top tier that's true but other than that you haven't really done anything stupid no I "legitimately tried to make a good $1,000" build it's hard you just tried a lot harder over here no it's just easier there's so many more choices and if you guys think oh you guys just cherry-picked a couple of games that run way better on lineus this machine that's not the case at all David already pre-
benchmarked a handful of other games and even if we were able to get Expo running on this machine it's not going to make up the kind of difference we're observing here it's night and day I'm tempted to turn on frame sure and see if you can even make up the ground using that okay well that gets you there it's noticeably blurrier you can tell that it's lower resolution but it's not bad how does it feel it's pretty good it's pretty Snappy I'm not upset we're making a pretty good case for
DSS this went from a pretty unplayable mess to it's not bad okay what about if we're looking off into the distance okay like how's the water look yours definitely has a a little more uh detailed resolved this is kind of it almost feels less contrasty even though these are the same monitors yep and it's the same in the textures on the character model mhm it's clearly a little bit sharper for me oh yeah you can really see that in the chain mail yeah and to your point oh ew oh ew oh
not good so it can be pretty distracting sometimes and I haven't turned on any of my upscaling if you just want to see FPS number go up I got that too I really did not get a lot of extra frames and I just got a sharpness filter applied to everything dang it FSR not nearly as good hey and I'm getting my 30 FPS cutcenes now I did it incredible deal assassin frame gen really is the compelling argument to make for the the modern gen system and it's worth noting that if you strongly
do prefer one brand of GPU over the other it's not like we couldn't have put an in card in our older gen system we could have gone with 3070 or something like that and you can even get some really great deals on 3080s but we decided for the sake of this video that we weren't going to look at used cards we were just going to stick to stuff that you could buy brand new all that's left now is to answer the question of which of these systems would you buy let us know in the comments the oldie but
goodie or the shiny new toy and also to talk about what we've learned first of all timing is everything thing the am5 platform is coming up on 3 years old with the am4 platform crossing the 8-year Mark just recently so it's no wonder that there's lots of deals to be had here and not so many over here but you can't take that for granted once "Nvidia cleared out their 3,000 series" chards they cleared them out and while you still can find them brand new from time to time it's pretty rare another
thing we learned is that generational gains don't seem to Trump the savings of buying older Hardware at least it's not a guarantee there were a lot of challenges in picking the parts for these there's going to be a float plane exclusive closer look where David's going to be discussing how allowing ourselves to look at used Hardware might have affected our choices either way it's pretty clear that you should not lock yourself into the newest releases PC Hardware is not evolving at the same
Pace that it once was and you just don't need the latest gear to have an excellent experience what you do need is this segue to our sponsor next too their Aurora Pro Ultra short throw laser projector can take that blank screen or wall and turn it into a Wonderland of buttery smooth Ultra Vivid colors it touts a peak brightness of 2400 lumens 4K Dolby Vision support and built-in 60 WT speakers with Dolby Atmos support plus with a maximum screen size of 150 in you won't just be watching your
