the holidays are coming in hot which means it's exactly the right time to get the gamer in your life their dream gift especially if that gamer is you but Gamers they're a fussy bunch and with infinite combinations that you could pick from for a gaming PC it is easy to get overwhelmed well good news everyone by clicking this video you've already gotten the hardest part out of the way so sit back as we unleash this blizzard of tech tips upon you we are building three PCS at three different price
points point and when we're done you're going to be equipped to make an informed decision and to save some serious money along the way just like this serious segue to our sponsor Jawa Jawa is the marketplace for buying and selling PC components and fully built rigs from now until the end of the year they'll have special limited time deals so check them  first stop on today's Holiday Express is $500 station now one option is to turn to the secondhand market like our PS5
Killers Craigslist and Marketplace are a great way to maximize your dollar but they also come with risks no  appealing price but believe it or not this isn't our recommendation either at this price we like the long-term value of our game tomorrow machine you may already know that an APU or accelerated Processing Unit combines a CPU and a GPU onto one chip generally keeping both power consumption and costs down but what you might not know is that over the last couple of generations their gaming
prowess has gotten very impressive and the 58600 G is capable of playing even modern titles in HD while leaving us with enough budget to build an upgrade friendly platform that we can take with us for years to come amd's current am5 socket has some really solid options for entry-level motherboards these days a series chipsets used to be a for avoid but now they come with support for memory overclocking and PCI Express Gen 4 the latter of which is particularly important because our Apu limits any
future GPU upgrades to just eight Lanes Ram is going to cost us around $60 if we're targeting the ddr5 price to Performance Sweet Spot 40 bucks for an entry-level case around $40 for a 500 gig Gen 4 SSD and then one area where we're going to need to overspend a little is our power supply we like these two units from Corsair and EVGA for around $65 either one will give us the headro we need to add a performance tier GPU later on down the line but they both come with some compromises while every
Power Supply we're recommending today was able to go from Zer to 110% load multiple times without issue these particular units performed poorly for output Ripple it's not likely to kill anything and it probably won't cause problems for a system at this price point but if you want a little bit of extra peace of mind you can spend an extra $20 or so on one of these units that tested better while still fitting in our budget and here's the parts list upscaled gaming today upscale gaming
tomorrow once you slot in a GPU maybe we should have called this the Merry Christmas now wait for your birthday machine oh you guys it's not even my birthday which wait means there must be a secret bonus machine that's right my friends we've got an all new price point for our holiday guide this year we've got the game hard machine an $800 rig that will run modern games at 1440p right now as long as you don't mind being locked out of some future upgrades for our CPU then we've gone with the
5700 x3d on amd's older am4 platform that means no future CPU upgrades but being honest I think it's going to be a few years before that really starts to sting anyway and it frees us a lot of budget for our GPU rounding out the system we settled on a bios compatible b450 motherboard 16 gigs of reputable 3600 megat transfer per second ram and a decent pcie nvme SSD ideally here you want to find one with a dam cache but failing that look for hmb support to ensure stutter-free operation we settled
on this case but it's worth noting that deals in this price bracket can tend to be pretty volatile often changing on Tuesdays for some reason so be ready to be a little flexible on that now for this build and all the ones that are still coming you're going to need to budget for a CPU Cooler and we feel that the thermal right Phantom spirit is worth the $10 to $15 premium over popular choices like The Cooler Master 212 what isn't worth it at this budget is water cooling because you want every
possible dollar going into the right GPU this Asus dual OC 7700 XT was the right GPU for us cuz we got a great deal for it at $350 but that might not always be around so we'd recommend taking a look at Tom's Hardware's super handy GPU hierarchy chart to help you understand how any prospective deals that you find might match up at a glance we'd also recommend you check out LTT store.com for some great gift ideas at much lower prices than any of the PCS featured today we've
got stocking stuffers like these stick locks or the tech sack for your favorite tech bro on the go now it's time for our next stop on the deal train the game harder "$11,000 balanced PC here you can expect" Superior 1440p performance in new games and even 4K gaming for older titles that you'd love to see look their best perhaps most importantly though it does all of that while also providing a well-rounded foundation for future upgrades we'll kick off our parts list with a deal we found on an AMD ryzen 5
7600 X CPU that comes with a free 1 TB Kingston mv2 SSD now by the time you're watching this video that deal might have expired but the mentality behind our pick won't you got to be flexible educate yourself on what you need and then dig for the deals that are sometimes buried in bundles and most importantly ask yourself what games am I actually playing for example if you're a competitive gamer and you use low Graphics settings to get high frame rates you might want to look at an x3d
chip at least once the scalpers get bored with their latest play thing however if you're building a machine for AAA 1440p gaming you should stick with our recommendation which brings us to one of the hardest choices our motherboard let me break this down the ryzen 7600 X is am5 again but we're no longer budget limited to just entry-level boards that means we need to choose between the nine available motherboard chipsets at least the naming scheme is somewhat useful even if the
first letter is redundant so for now let's ignore the letter and jump to the first digit which tells us the generation either 6 or 8 is going to work for our CPU so then and let's look at the next two digits these tell us the tier of the chipset higher number means more tiers and an e indicates better connectivity with more PCI E Lanes but none of those things necessarily mean better board the chipset informs the feature set not the build quality so bottom line then unless you know you
need something else a good b650 board like this one is a great choice for about $100 it has good enough power delivery for a light CPU overclock and support for a pcie Gen 5 SSD even if it lacks a Gen 5 GPU slot the good news is that likely won't impact real world GPU performance for quite a few years looking at how long it took for Gen 4 to matter now we could go for a Gen 5 board but it would cost us twice as much which at this price point we don't think is worth it our RAM and our cooler get
carried forward we've already got our SSD and that leaves us to sort out case and power I like the fantex X T Pro and we can comfortably afford one of the good 750 W power supplies from last time that leaves us $450 for a GPU so let's have a look at our options on the team green side we can get a RTX 460 TI or on the team red side this excellent XFX Speedster 7800 XT now to be clear neither of these is a wrong choice but it is worth noting that while the GeForce card includes nvidia's
excellent Suite of features it's a less performant card to begin with and it's going to rely on AI upscaling in order to deliver comparable in-game performance so I leave that up to you now it's time to open the throttle a little if you're after a superior PC gaming experience the kind of 4K horsepower your console locked friends can only dream of we have finally arrived at the best without "wasting money station this $22,000 PC is" stacked and without throwing away some
serious extra money I don't think you can get a much better experience to kick things off then this Behemoth starts with the absolute best gaming CPU the world has ever seen the AMD ryzen 7 9800 x3d does it oh that's right those are out of stock everywhere what I meant to say was the second best the 7800 x3d nope all the deals are bad all right we went with the 9700x now I get it those first two would outperform our practical pick here but at the cost of how you say more money
and as we discussed in our recent 9800 x3d review Once you go above 1080p low settings you're better off spending that extra money on a better GPU besides we've still got eight fast Zen 5 course and amd's mismanaged launch of this thing has resulted in some aggressive deals to help clear inventory which is good because motherboards have gotten pretty expensive these days we've got yet another am5 chip so let's buy the most expensive thing not I know we could afford it but guys if you look closely
the main difference for the eboards is more PCI E Lanes which unless we know we need them we don't need them and there's no performance difference between 600 series or 800 series at least not on the chips that are available today so we'd recommend going for whatever you can find at a good price we ended up with this one but after procuring it we found this great deal that includes a 32 gig kit of g-skill flare X5 which is a good reminder that we should always be flexible if we want to get the best
value it's too late for us but hey our loss is your gain by the way it's worth noting that during the holiday season a lot of retailers will extend their return window on select items so that you can shop with a little bit of extra confidence when you see a good deal that's something that might be especially important this year with the looming threat of new tariffs on overseas manufactured Electronics we're not going to say that things are definitely going to be more expensive
next year but we also can't say for sure that they won't be and this will especially impact you if you're splurging on some style points with an AO cooler and a very glass forward case we've doubled the capacity of our RAM "and SSD and we've jumped up to a 1,000 W" Platinum efficient power supply to keep our power hungry GPU fed really real istically we probably could still get "away with a quality 750 W unit but 1,000" is such a nice round number and at this budget we can afford to spend extra on
something that we can hopefully bring forward to our next upgrade we can also "afford to spend ,000 on our GPU which" gives us a choice between amd's 7900 XTX and nvidia's RTX 480 super now on the one hand we've got better rasterized performance and more than $100 in s savings but on the other hand we've got better Ray tracing and upscaling Hardware not to mention nvidia's long history of solid software support I don't think either of them is a bad choice so I'm going to leave this one up
to you but we ended up going Team Green for this one we also ended up leaving all the links to everything that we've talked about down below just remember that because of the nature and timing of sales the prices will be different every week but if you were to start with any of these builds as a springboard we're confident that you should end up with an amazing PC and I'm also confident you'll end up with an amazing segue to an amazing sponsor Paul sway if you're a business owner or it manager and you're
