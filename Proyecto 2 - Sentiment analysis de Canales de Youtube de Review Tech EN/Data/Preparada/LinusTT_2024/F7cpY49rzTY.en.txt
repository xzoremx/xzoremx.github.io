welcome to the W show sorry one sec oh no not this time  dang we have got a great show lined up for you guys today we are finally going to be doing the segment where I find out if uh I was right or Reddit was right about the difficulties that I had unsubscribing from Apple arcade on my Apple TV actually even if it does work properly that might mean something changed but we'll get into that a little bit later uh we're also going to be addressing the community response to our
Nvidia Super Series review and hey maybe I left something for Luke to talk about he's got to pick topics now so he can't be distracted by his phone yeah that's what I thought Luke uh did you talk about the EVS nope oh nice okay so GM is to bring back uh plug-in hybrid EVS which is awesome actually yeah hilarious something that we've been asking for for a while now and ever since they stopped making the Vault I was like Wow an amazing car what a terrible decision how could they make this oh okay yeah they
unmade the decision which is great good job um did you talk about the neuralink nope and neuralink was put in a person someone someone agreed to do that Luke could you pay less attention yes not much  though  no the show is brought to you today by odd pieces manscaped and squar space uh why don't we jump into the uh Community response to the Invidia Super Series review so uh we decided rather than to spread our coverage of nvidia's super lineup the 4070 super super 470 TI super
and 480 super over I think it was a grand total of I want to say I think it was n it was like it was it was somewhere between seven and nine total embargo dates uh between the no I think it was seven I think it was seven because they had the announcement then they had unboxing embargos for each card then they had review embargos for each card no then they also had a separate they had a separate review embargo for partner cards rather than Founders edition cards for at least some of it
was it was some ludicrous number of embargo dates and I was kind of sitting here going okay so basically what you want is you want video after video after video after video that is just dedicated to talking about a midcycle refresh sorry no so what we're going to do is we're just going to consolidate it into one video however there is one super thing that people are pretty upset about in this particular video and that was the nonin inclusion of amd's RX 7900 XTX seeing as it's widely viewed as an
important competitor to the 480 super uh not least of which because it is at the sameish MSRP it's actually a little bit lower from the listings that I've seen somewhere in the kind of 93040 to $950 range um USD yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah not not in Rubles Canadian Canadian our price it's like that's really far off yeah no no no no no so basically I was in the room when it happened when we made the decision to not include the 7900 XTX um I have some of my own thoughts
about why we ultimately made the call that we did to include the suite of cards that we did but I'm going to start with the news team summary from Adam who was the writer on that project and who worked with the labs on it uh basically point a uh the decision to incl to exclude the 7900 XTX was based on a combo combination of relevance and testing capacity uh we saw this as a review of the new Super Series as a whole it was not a review of the 480 super even though we did Target close to
the 480 super embargo since that was the last one from the lineup uh the 4080 super is anywhere from 2 to 3% faster than a base 4080 U making it more of a a refresh with a price cut essentially is how we kind of laid it out in the video we refer to it as 4080 refresh 4080 um internally we were calling it 4080 refried 4080 Redux um retesting cards for up-to-date results takes time we tested a total of 11 cards for this video we haven't fully rolled out our our new standardized test
benches that allow us to test in parallel yet so there was a limited number of cards that we were able to if you are interested in that there's a video on that that's awesome yeah where they test all the CPUs go back can check that out um we actually ended up adding a couple of cards that weren't in the original meeting and there was one more spot where we kind of went okay can we test one more card if so what will it be and the debate was between the 7700 XT and the 7900 XTX and the decision was
okay let's go with the 7700 XT we don't want to cut the older cards we've gotten really good feedback from people that it's really nice to have popular older cards so we we chose our previous generation cards based on um what is still holding really strong in the steam Hardware survey we didn't want to cut those cuz we've gotten really good feedback on them and we figured that the 7700 XT would give additional context for the lower priced cards that would be relevant to the greater number of
viewers obviously not everyone agrees um number two is being selective about how many cards we retest test in every video is an important consideration to avoid unnecessary stress and overtime uh this is one of those funny things where it's always um it's always kind of damned if you do damned if you don't catch 22 if we test 35 cards um I'm going to be questioned on why we have so much crunch here if we test three cards I'm going to be questioned on why we're so lazy here uh at the end of the day you know
there's always trade-offs and we ultimately made the trade-off to go with the 7700 XT rather than the 7900 XTX uh there's a lot of stuff going on in  and I got to be honest with you guys this wasn't the most exciting one yeah and you know coming back to sort of my thoughts on it first of all we are going to uh we're going to address it um I think someone is is doing some OT this weekend to test 7900 XTX we're going to get those numbers added um but you know the the reality of it is looking at the
percentage of people that are are very upset about this versus the percentage of people who are actually buying a 7900 XTX um they're very very different and what it seems like to me is that this is one of those things where Maybe video is just like not the right format like one of the one of the challenges too is you can only include so many cards if you want to have averages which do matter chart and 1% lows that which in my mind are actually more important if you want
to have all of that in a in a 16x9 you graph it starts to get kind of illegible past a certain point and I'm kind of looking at it going man you know maybe the solution is why why why why exactly are we doing a review for a GPU anymore I mean we killed power supplies 10 years ago we killed motherboards like 9 years ago as sort of here's a product that merits a full l video it didn't particularly perform better than no no it didn't particularly perform well at all in spite of the fact that it was a
ton of work like man let me tell you the cards that we did test guys it was meticulous we put so much flipping work into this stuff and I'm sitting here going if it's not about what you're actually going to buy which is the feedback that I'm kind of hearing right now and it's more about what you just you want it you want to see it compared right like you want to see you know the green horse versus the red horse which one ran the fastest and that's fair enough that's totally valid but that
doesn't need to be a video and maybe the long-term solution is the lab's website and we just basically go okay yeah the card comes in we test the stuffing out of it and if it's actually interesting then we make an LT video and we put all the all the effort into all the different ways that we present the graphs and so they're paced with the script and all the things that go into making an entertaining uh dense video I mean I'm actually other than that one miss which I acknowledge 100% yeah
looking back at it I flagged it um I was like hey we should probably have the 7900 XTX and the argument that was made to me as I recall was well here's the thing the 7900 XT has dropped in price so much and that it actually makes a ton of sense now and so by taking this end of things and just having the 480 super be there as a th000 card I mean to be clear we never recommended spending "$1,000 on a GPU at all so just yeah" having that thing sit there and be its thing and then looking at anything that
we actually think might be worth buying in more detail is the right approach and I kind of went okay I mean I the Enthusiast I'm curious I'd want to know okay how does the 7900 XTX stack up against the 480 super it really is a a fairly Apples to Apples comparison but I accepted that I accepted that reasoning and I accepted the rest of the reasoning that's in uh that's in our notes here today and we ultimately didn't include it um other than that honestly I'm I think it's a great video it's really
short um one of our goals going into it was to spend absolutely zero zero time wasting the viewers time so from the moment this video  oh viewer time wasted there we go yeah exactly from the moment this video starts to the first performance graph is sorry sorry it happened really fast is uh 5 Seconds we wanted to get to the point right away and then our next graph where we basically start laying things out here we go we compare it to an older card comes at about a minute and then we get
into actual results within about 80 seconds so that was our goal we spent a total of 13 minutes to go through this whole kind of sort of interesting launch we talked about the changes in pricing we talked about the changes in performance and yeah there's a card missing from the graphs but I found it  card so card located yeah I can actually tell you about that so noticing that hey maybe we should acknowledge this card um I think actually ran some testing over the weekend and then we added that table
um but we didn't remake all of the graphs because we were like okay it's "$1,000 GPU how many people are actually" buying this versus versus for most people actually shopping um how much of the information have we presented in this video um yeah swinging a Miss but overall I'm still I still think this is a good direction reducing the amount of time that it takes to process these sort of uninteresting refreshes and the main takeaway for me from this whole experience of that man do you remember
when one Nvidia GPU was like millions of views and people were excited and now three Nvidia gpus I saw one comment that really stood out to me um and it was minus nothing personal this isn't your fault but I'm out this is boring uh these gpus are boring I don't care and I think I think Nvidia feels the same way yeah what's their stock up like six points today or something like that I don't even know I can yeah it has nothing to do with the RTX 40 series super launch um Five Points I don't know it's it's
funny reading comments like this I usually agree with lonus but uh you know hard pass on this reasoning what reasoning I said it was a Miss what do you what do you I'm explaining why it wasn't in there cuz that's what people want to know and then I'm saying it was a Miss I don't really know what there is to disagree with at that point here was our reasoning no we were wrong that person thinks it shouldn't have been in the video I'm joking I'm joking I'm joking well that makes more sense
know he's agreeing with the original decision um yeah I I just I just I just think video just might not be the right format for this anymore though and I think it might depend on the card right but what cards "yeah name okay I bet you have 5,000" series launch even if the difference is "this small I bet you a 5,000 series" launch would kill here's the problem the "problem is that 5,000 series is going to" be flipping fast because Nvidia has to do all of the development anyway in
order to make better AI accelerators so it's going to be flipping fast but I wouldn't be surprised at all to see a 5090 or you know whatever they end up calling it TI super RTI who who knows anymore what their naming scheme so whatever the 5090 whatever that equivalent Halo TI your card is I wouldn't be surprised to see it at "$2,000 and what Gamers have shown Nvidia" time and time again is that they'll pay yeah because some something to consider something that I think the the
components buyers don't necessarily think about that much because it's a really different perspective is that for most people a $400 difference in the GPU is actually only about an 8% difference in the total cost cost of the system they were planning to buy if you're buying a system that would have a 4090 or 90 or whatever else like some kind of Halo speec card in it you are spending probably somewhere between $3 "to $5,000 on that computer and so when" you play around with the sliders you're
not looking at oh I just spent twice as much on my GPU you're looking at oh I just spent 25% more on the total system for you know so let's say call it a 50% increase in performance or you know whatever that increase is generationally um so the calculus is really different and most people don't build their own computers so the market reality that someone like an Nvidia is setting their price according to is not aligned with the reality that we see when we put together like a a price to Performance
like a like an FPS per dollar chart or something like that because the FPS per dollar that we calculate is based on only the card pricing whereas someone who's buying a computer someone who's buying a fully completed system is not  way yeah anyway yeah we got a million views and so I'm sitting here going do you think that was imp like do you think it would have gotten more views if the uh if the sentiment around it was better because the 7900 XTX was included no I don't think so I think it's a it's it's
it's sep it's a small number of people who are upset about it in the grand scheme of things the like dislike ratio on this video I can bring this up for you guys is actually not abnormal in any  up here we go analytics so it's net positive for subscribers engagement is about a percent below Channel average but it started out for the first probably 8 hours or so a perent above Channel average uh it started out being received extremely well and then over time as people have
piled into the comments um it's been received much more poorly sentiment shifting yep sentiment shifted and seen that before and so uh oh yeah view duration is oh view duration is extremely low what wow you gave them the whole story at 5 Seconds right oh this is amazing so yeah this is this is what happens when you're basically like okay yeah here's the deal here's what's up with this thing in the first two minutes so we get to 1080p results and everyone's like see you later so this
gray band right here is your typical duration for a video of this length your or your typical retention on this channel so this is specifically relevant to our Channel um all anyone wants to see is a graph and then the rest of it is just kind of like noise apparently um so this is one of those things where I think people think they want to see a lot of graphs and a lot of visualizations and a lot of analysis they want it to be interesting but what they actually want is to watch an
interesting video and what really stands out to me about this particular one is and to be clear I'm not saying we're not going to cover gpus I'm just saying it's probably going to end up being on short circuit or not be like a default you're not going to cover it by default anymore or we'll do it but not bother doing it at embargo why are we bothering Let's test it sure we'll test it before embargo we'll make sure that thing's actually interesting and then let's put together a cool project with
it or something rather than just saying here's a GPU because or or maybe we consolidate it you know we do a quarterly GPU update that's kind of cool I would I would click on that personally because the problem with the problem with at launch videos and and this is an inherent problem this is not something that I think anyone can solve is that you're taking the manufacturer's word for what the street pricing is going to be and that ended up causing a lot of backlash toward the reviewer Community
back when Nvidia and their Partners were increasing pricing on the 3D series because we would review a card with the best information we have at the time and then it would turn out that it would have a street price that's 20 30 50 100% higher and all of a sudden it's our fault and we're sitting here going for crying out loud guys I yeah in the past they've been off by a little bit but my goodness this has never happened like this before MH and so if we do something like a quarterly
update then we can basically just go okay yeah here's the actual Street pricing here's the testing for this particular card the one that anyone is actually buying because we can look at okay what's getting the most reviews what is actually ranking high on you know best sellers at sites like Newegg or Amazon or Best Buy or whatever the case may be and we can give you guys a a snapshot of what the market looks like without any constraints like being limited to pricing information that is
provided to us in a very optimistic form  yeah right so the reason I had uh the reason I had brought this up was because here hold on I'm just going to uh filter by and to be clear guys views is not the be all and end all it's not the only reason we make videos we make videos because we think something's really cool or we make it because um we some we think this is something that's never been done before or because we think it's something people really need to know um occasionally it's just because
I'm really passionate about something I want to talk about it uh we have a video coming up soon that is not going to get a lot of views uh it's going to be called stop calling them Chromebooks oh and it's basically um I I don't know video essay or kind of a a chat about how I believe that Chromebooks are going to become laptops we're not going to call them Chromebooks anymore we're going to call them laptops because did you know that it is one checkbox now to just turn Chrome OS into I can install 
want well I know I had no idea yeah so chrom OS is Linux CH might be the team foress hat so that that's my thesis how many people I just speedran how many people I can piss off I know I know sorry that's not going to get a ton of views um so my point is that it's not the only calculus but it is something that we have to at least consider uh we have people who I actually it turns out cannot pay in graphics cards and water bottles uh they do need to be paid with money and if we
aren't making content that people and and and the other thing is that if it's not getting use well that's an indication that it's something people don't want to watch and so we should definitely be making videos people want to watch and I mean have a look at have a look at the other stuff we uploaded in the last little while so for this graphics card um we get you know this will end up probably in the 1.3 1.4 range uh it has a below average so our average is around 97.5% for like dislike ratio Okay so
so I did a tour of a building we bought talking about how we're going to run lands there people flipping love it way more viewership uh we collab with someone cool like medy electroboom that video is fun people flip in love it and watch the crap out of it we just we come in on the weekend and just upgrade the network infrastructure above average even even even this even this dry as post uh hey here's 12 CPUs and we tested them yeah it didn't get views which we knew it wasn't going to but we
just thought it was really important this a sick video though so let's see how far back we have to go to find something that people are just as apathetic about as nvidia's super launch let's keep going let's keep going let's keep going I mean even okay here we go here we go here we go no even this sponsored video on asus's zephrus laptop  going and guys no I I don't think that all this negativity just comes down to that people are actually that upset about one GPU that wasn't
included here we go here it is fr airjet where we like mangled that MacBook um where we mangled that MacBook uh and I think that really a big part of that was probably the title uh We've updated the title now to include for systems whatever that usually happens anywhere from a week to 3 weeks after we upload we'll add a more a better descriptor at the end um but I think some people thought it was going to be more something Apple can do immediately or something and so there was there was
a little bit of bounce off of that video but overall it was one that the comments are overwhelmingly positive on so I think it was just um I mean everything is just kind of like crystal ball um at a certain point you know why why did people like this or not like it and you can you can read a lot of comments you can look at a lot of analytics but it's there's always going to be a little bit of guesswork involved uh but at the end of the day yeah this um it's a high-risk low reward
video I I like the idea of we'll still produce that type of content yeah it'll just be an article on the lab's website it'll be a craft and if it's in the creation of that we're like whoo there's a cool story here now there's a video now there's a video cuz that's that's something we've discussed about how the lab site could work for a really long time so you can still come to lineus techtips lus Media Group to get this type of information just clearly you're sniping the video for graphs anyways so
just go to the site and get the graphs yeah yeah like that that way there's just there's zero wasting of anyone's time this is all you want to know anyway yeah and then we need to test the stuff anyhow because I want to do I want to do more build videos and stuff like that I want I want to do cool builds I want to do more uh I want to do more roundups I want to do more um just kind of updates keeping people up to dat so we have to do the testing anyway but we don't have
to do it on embargo day we don't have to do it under constraints like not having proper access to what the exact pricing is going to be prior to pull like crazy fever dream all nighters and so weekends and stuff like that yep I think you know at the end of the day this is not entirely my decision this is something that we're going to talk to the team about but it's also not something that I think is that outlandish anymore and we've seen this decline over time this is not the first time we've asked the
question should we do GPU reviews anymore I think the first I'm trying to think I'm trying to think of a GPU that launched um looking at all the negativity around 40 series that was that was certainly a time when we wondered I would say probably around the time of 4060 series and the  going if AMD and Nvidia can't even care  category how can they possibly expect their customers to care and if their customers don't care why are we why are we covering it  yeah man uh I'm trying to think probably
the peak would have been the  3080 when was that exactly um I think you'll be surprised how long ago it was I'm trying to so that was also at a very particular time which makes sense why it would have peaked September 17th 2020 when everyone was like it I'm going to stay indoors for a super long time this was the peak and you can play video games on computers 5.1 million views and yeah it's been three years or whatever but don't kid yourself nobody's watching that today yeah uh that was that would that took
off like a rocket ship and then the  review yeah that was the last time people cared about a GPU launch yeah what was the 4 80 launch brutal uh yeah we can have a look 4080 right 1.1 million no way no one cared no "way dude pricing it's a $1,200 graphics" card who gives a sh yeah fair enough "$1,200 I could buy I could buy a" PlayStation 5 I could buy an Xbox series X I could buy an extra controller for each of my Bros for each sorry for each of those consoles so you know you know me and my
little brother or my little sister can play together and some games no cuz it's 500 bucks each for those consoles is it yeah well okay not if I get the not if I get the digital Edition but if I'm buying first-party controllers you're also probably getting bundles if I don't buy first party controllers though yeah I might even be able to squeeze in a TV maybe May it'd be that I was I was I was assuming once you had of the second console and stuff I was assuming you weren't going the TV route oh okay okay
okay no but or I could or to your point I could buy a console a full complement of first-party controllers and a decent TV and your console is very likely coming with a bundle at Le ridiculous like it just doesn't it doesn't make any sense anymore yeah so I don't know I just and I'm tired of being mad isn't anyone else just tired of being mad I don't know if they are but I am it's exhausting yeah yeah yeah it is I don't know and like to be completely honest um a lot of the old cards are
fine I don't know uh like 1440p monitors uh 90 to 144 frames per second decently old cards are running a lot of new games no problem yep I mean at very respectable settings we did this video a little while back only you can this is a this is probably a bad title I I don't know how to fix it though because it's sort of um yeah I don't know how to fix it but basically I I scrapyard scrapyard wared a single GPU the only solution to GPU pricing yeah um what a great intro that was beg to GPU anyway the point is
um instead of being mad just don't give them your money yeah buy a secondhand GPU there's a lot of them out there and they're generally in a really good condition I don't think I've or not personally ever bought one that ended up being a problem or with a little bit of mcgyver noow I mean the one that I bought in this video had a fan that was a little bit squeaky yeah um okay but that's fixable with like a $4 fan off of AliExpress like the I uh I'm I'm I it would be very offbrand for me to say well then H I
don't know the fan could uh the fan could make a little bit of extra noise so you should probably buy a brand new card yeah that's not that's not that's not me that's never going to be me guys yeah like someone in chat I think I lost the message but uh let's see red pigeon in chat said my 3080 it's a pretty highend card U but my 3080 still runs everything I play perfectly the only game it struggles in at high settings is cyber Punk which is like an extremely insanely hard game to run
especially high setting it's also one game yeah so play it and then just run it at like medium it medium yes it actually still looks really good at medium yeah um I feel like we do end up I feel like we do end up getting kind of taunted into spending more on a GPU sometimes by just the existence of higher detail sliders uh I do I do Wonder as much as a as a geek I love that CD project red just keeps adding new technology to cyberpunk you don't have to turn it on though it's the
coolest thing ever I mean it's the new it's the new crisis they they literally add settings that they know that no Modern Hardware can possibly push at a at a reasonable frame rate but I I do I do wonder if that ends up almost having like a negative effect on people like the existence of that slider makes them feel bad about their GPU and if they just set it to a lower setting and then just never looked at it at you know Ray Trace Ultra Overkill you know preset or whatever they would just enjoy the game
and and and be happy with it yeah I mean some of the biggest games this year po world you don't need a freaking powerful GPU to play P world no not at all B Gate 3 is going to run fine oh yeah uh I I for a period of time ran Ballers Gate 3 on a uh uh Titan RTX which is 2080 equivalent I think roughly no problem whatsoever 280 TI 280 TI okay yeah 2080 was a lot lower than 2080 TI because nvidia's naming scheme means nothing it's ridiculous yeah um but but still that's that's multiple Generations back
and I I don't think I noticed a huge difference when I put in one of the newer more powerful cards it's just like whatever so that's two of the biggest games in the last quite a while neither of which would have an issue with with a 2000 series card let alone a three or four you can run a lethal company on potato that's another game that blew up recently yep speaking of running games on a potato we finally did it a potato powered computer no okay good run for like a second if you got it to turn on at all
you probably could I have no idea the potato computer what it's water cooled  is you're not going to explain are you it's a potato computer there's nothing to explain we built a computer in a potato in a potato is this like a a special variety of potato that's extremely large no oh it's a russet [Laughter] potato see that's probably going to get more views than the 480 super refr fresh oh it'll get way more yeah and it's also way cooler because it's interesting honestly it's it's technology that's
actually moving really fast right now like we cuz what we're highlighting is amd's apus and how okay and so there's this really cool minis Forum system that we use to that we dismantle in order to to make our potato PC that is shockingly small cuz I haven't seen anyone integrate these processors these these really powerful apus that amd's been coming out with over the last year or so in anything other than a handheld gaming PC or a laptop where you can only make them so small because they have to
have screens and batteries and and and things that you don't need in a standalone PC so things like this big it's it's freaking tiny and we were like can we finally do it anyway a lot of shenanigans ensues because it's me and David who we seem to have developed a bit of a Vibe uh for the projects that we work on together but uh you guys aren't going to want to miss that one it's a lot of fun I just want to jump to this to to talk about your previous point oh sure um so there's an Xbox
series X oh that's Canadian pricing though yeah yeah oh I see my point though yes is that it comes with 24 months of Game Pass ultimate oh wow so for um half the price of a 480 super yeah you can have this and I think this is actually slightly less than half the price and two years of playing does it come with EA play too  hilarious so and like this is Canadian dollars so when you when you look at 480 super in Canadian dollars there is easily enough money to get a very solid
TV on top of this I talked to in video about this at CES I was basically like look guys um I get it you know silicon's expensive it's not like it's not like you set tsmc's pricing I understand that um and I also understand you guys are a public company you have to maintain you know your margins in order to make sure that stock price go up and all those things that you have to do I guess in order to in order to maintain your health and and keep investing in the future of technology and all that stuff
and and they do that stuff they they build really cool technology I'll never hate on Nvidia for their Tech it's amazing um but guys you have to kind of understand what's going on here right now you are alienating your your Evangelical users you are yeah even worse than alienating you are you are creating a culture of apathy in the gaming Enthusiast Community they're just bored and that is a huge problem not today not tomorrow but it will be that's going to be an enormous problem unless
you just don't care and if you just don't care then fine um but you know if there's anything that you can do to convey this to the higher ups that it would be maybe prudent at some point to do something exciting um I think you should consider it and it's not like I'm sure that went nowhere unfortunately oh yeah I know yeah but I mean I had to say it sure what am I going to do not say it yeah get mad and Nvidia Nvidia knows how to do exciting 8800 GT when Nvidia decides to be exciting they can do
it 30 series launch that was exciting and when they decide not to be exciting well they know how to do that too no no when I say exciting guys I don't just mean worthy of purchase at all I mean exciting 8800 GT was a moment of gaming excitement all of a sudden for literally half the price with some compromises it had less vram uh but you could get performance that was close to what the the day prior would have cost you $500 uh I have to make some clarifications sure apparently the Xbox
all Game Pass ultimate all access something or other whatever I called it is some form of financing option thing oh is that why so you pay for it over 24 months and then it comes with Game Pass ultimate so you you pay for like the console and Game Pass ultimate as a subscription for 24 months oh okay but then I think you own the console at the end or something I don't know okay well however it works you were so far below the cost of the GPU anyway that I still think we're in the clear yeah cuz I
found this anyways that's US Dollars yeah so there you go oh they're oh wow they're under 500 now wow Microsoft must really need to move some units I don't think Sony's discounted PS5 if anything they've increased the price it's freaking February yeah what apparently it's 0% interest that 24-month payment thing okay I I don't know I don't know anything about it I'm not suggesting Finance models I just found the one that isn't financing is US dollars because that's the main thing
we're having the conversation in and it's less than 500 bucks so the point still completely stands here's our discussion topic you are now um let's say 15-year-old Luke sick yeah I know you know you're stronger I'm happy smarter faster things are improving in general yeah I'm not as broken do you need to talk are you okay things are great okay so you're 15-year-old Luke yeah um the one the one thing going well the one thing that's worse is that you don't have any money mhm mhm okay I was very
broke everything else was better but you don't have any money yeah do you take up PC gaming right now uh probably not or do you just CU back then I W I didn't really care I cared I mean this is still honestly kind of true just PCS can play so much more now um true but back then I I was in it for the games for the most part and I got interested in computers mostly because I needed to learn how to work with them and fix them and and keep them going to be able to play games and like I needed
to learn basic networking because my friend and I wanted to play Diablo On Lan and then I needed to learn still basic but slightly less basic networking because we wanted to have lands of like a bunch of computers and multiple Xboxes all at the same time and I wanted to be able to host servers for things and all this kind of stuff that was all largely because of games and that's what drove my passion for technology um but we pretty much always had consoles at the same time and I would always pretty much
play both um because like I talk about how Morin was my favorite game of all time all the time I didn't play it on PC I had it on Xbox I played the crap out of the Halo games not on PC y I played them on Xbox we had a some of my favorite memories of playing games with my dad were on Super Nintendo and N64 like and he played Warcraft 2 on Playstation 1 not on PC no I'm just kidding please don't do that no U and we we had PCS as well but it was it was about like what game I felt like playing at the time and
if PCS were this hard to get into um yeah I mean we didn't have a ton of money it would have come down to a costing issue and would have stuck with consoles like just is what it is and I probably still would have gotten interested in technology because I still would have been having Lands still would have had to network these consoles together and stuff but like yeah yeah yeah I mean looking back when I got into computer games I got into games that could run on a computer I wasn't we didn't have a fancy
computer I don't think we had a dedicated graphics card until I needed to play Civilization 2 test of time and in order for the full motion video um diplomats and stuff or emissaries to show up you had to have um just you had to support a some level of direct 3D I I forget what it was but I I basically went to bargain bites you know some hole in the wall computer shop in mission of all places and I was like okay uh this is the minimum requirement on the box I'm pretty sure I physically brought the
box I need something I need something that this and until then we didn't even have a dedicated graphics card so everything was like CPU accelerated my point isn't um isn't that you know we couldn't have bought a GPU instead of a console or something like that my point is that it was just there I fell into it we are asking for people to make an enormous commitment to PC gaming before they ever actually fire up a game yeah the fact that the 40 super refresh didn't do anything for the sub $500
range is what people should be talking about right now yeah the fact that 4060 series Nvidia kind of looked at at this  is ridiculous to me I'm trying to see on New Egg right now what I can get for less than $449 USD like if I'm an American Shopper yeah and so I set my filter down here to 449 cap um so I can I can get an entire Xbox series X yeah um with the controller and stuff or I can get there isn't really like uh what's this are hold on hold on have you filtered for things that are in stock and shipped
by New Egg um sold by New Egg yeah okay there we go in stock a lot of pop-ups new new egg has turned into a gigantic piece of lately it's very annoying it's it it used to be an oasis of easy filtering and and somewhat intuitive shopping and now it's just awful though it's not nearly as bad as Amazon uh did you see I added a I added a segment uh just called like Amazon sucks or something like that I want to do I want to do a fun little demo for you as soon as you're done with this
y yeah I'm I'm trying in different filter options and stuff I just did best rating um sure okay so what do we got 4060 TI awesome I think is probably our best one so for $400 is that the 8 gig version  $400 do you know how much eight gigs of  costs I'll give you a hint not a lot like nothing yeah oh man yeah 460 TI I'm not really seeing above that I think um there's 7600 XTS and stuff but those are those are lower at that point you're saving like almost 100 bucks um I'm not saying it's a bad deal I'm just
trying to look for ones that are closely priced to that Xbox here we go here's 425 what do I get for 425 3070 okay so I get how when did the 37 Prett monster deal on this so basically I can buy some ancient card from October of 2020 that's right friends I I can buy a three and a 3 and A4 year old GPU that launched for hold on hold on 3070 launch price that launched at $4.99 sorry what was it priced at today uh [Laughter] 4425 oh man and who do we blame Biden this sucks
because yeah uh this sucks because we we were telling people to go buy used but oh these are Canadian prices that's why yeah never mind so so it is a lot cheaper to buy used actually and there was some cheaper ones down here so like in this if you're going on New Egg to buy a 3070 like you're also probably doing it yeah that's not bad like that's $230 or so US dollars that that that Fe for 300 bucks oh no that's that's bids that's bids though sorry that's not a Buy It Now um by now
454 yeah so it's around around 350 no not that you should do the Buy It Now necessarily no and honestly I've had a lot of luck with Facebook Marketplace recently just because there's no seller fees MH so on eBay it used to be that you could get really good deals but eBay seller fees are quite high now and I understand why because they offer buyer protection which basically as far as I can tell is just a nightmare to administer um so there are services that they offer that do add to the cost of
running the platform I get it but the seller fees are quite high so if you can meet up with someone in person and if you can verify that the thing actually works then more times than not it's uh it's it's a way to go it's a way to go people are like 8 gigs for 370 is awful right but you weren't getting anything with more than eight gigs at that price anyway yeah so yeah it's awful no one's our whole yeah yeah whole point is that it's rough yeah 13% is the seller fees on gpus at
the moment apparently yeah that's that's freaking a lot oh here can I uh can I can I play this game with you let's play the game called I'm going to go to amazon.com and try to actually buy something uh okay so I don't know see here's the thing I don't know if this is going to happen the same way that it did when I was sitting in script review with someone earlier this week right cuz I don't know it seems to be just like G let's see what's going to come up when you click on something on Amazon these days
but I was trying to figure out what was kind of the going rate for a 55 in TV because we've got a really cool video coming on this um Flander scientific heard of them no okay they do instruments they also do mastering monitors I was going to say wait maybe I have yeah yes I have all right so uh what is it Flander scientific instruments FSI I think uh Flanders scientific Inc sorry FSI whatever Flanders came in and was like hi didly ho guys I hope they actually said that they
didn't um they brought a 55 in mastering monitor that's based on Samsung's latest QD OLED panel okay and we were writing an intro for this video and I was like okay you know what would be kind of fun is to do a bit of a like well you know Switcheroo where we start the video in kind of like a ranty form like who would buy this thing for "$20,000 it's got bezels that looks like" it I dragged it out of my grandma's basement it doesn't even come with a remote control and it doesn't have an
HDMI port for crying out loud right so we kind of just roast them yeah we kind of we kind of roast it which is was even more fun because the uh Flander scientific guys were in the room while we're filming this um the the unit they they basically hand carried the unit cuz they were on their way to do a demo somewhere or something and allowed us to make a video and test it because normally we would not have access to this kind of stuff and then when we were done they had to take it
away with them um anyway so we so we do this bit um and as part of that I wanted to have a comparison point for okay well what's a what's kind of your going rate for a 55in monitor because sure you "could spend $1,200 on a 55 in" did I say monitor sorry the Flander scientific is a monitor but I I was talking TV so you could you could spend "like $1,200 on a 55 in TV but you can" also spend X I wanted to know like how how low how low have they gotten these days and so the exercise was
Electronics television and video and trying to find a television there's one here's a 40in Vio what even are some of these things an antenna okay here's a magic stick I think there's a song about that yeah yeah yeah it's the the the penis of  mhm a man of culture i here's a USBC cable here's some sponsored results for   did I do something wrong TV amazon.com maybe um nen hanser says I've never had the issues you've had with Amazon but I never search by category I just search
what I want to find wonder if fit a category so I just search what's going on with me right now laptop yeah I just searched the word television sure but like I want to browse Luke is this not browsing see look they figured it out the filters on the side are all TV filters oh my God but why why is why did what I why is it that what I did didn't work I searched TV and that worked too I'm not saying you're wrong I'm just saying that I you're just saying to get good I'm right I mean okay maybe try and find it
then maybe I missed it I legitimately don't use Amazon so where where is it where's TV isn't it in here you could try movies and television that's not the one I clicked on okay or what did I what did I what did I click on exactly I S I looked at televisions and video products where's okay no that was that was that was content I don't think I have that seriously hold on I don't know I no you don't I am not kidding it's under electronics under electronics it's nested yeah there we go there we go okay
so fine where are the where are the bloody TVs then television video this is what even is that I don't know it's cool though it's a replacement lamp for a projector I guess it looks  projector for the restoration of color  immersed people are telling me hold on hold on people are telling me I need to go hold on we're going back to my screen people are telling me I need to go one level deeper oh no I don't there is no level deeper model year what's that movie I mean at least model year brings
up some TVs exception yeah we we got to go deeper I don't think there's a deeper layer what is this theal big button TV remote yeah wow "they sold six 6,000 reviews of this" thing what what is this this is a sabrent thunderbolt ethernet adapter what is this doing here this is an absolute Quagmire get that bread saent and I don't see I'm sorry guys I I don't see 3D really what year is it smart TV you mean every TV okay this might help this might help okay so if I click Smart TV then that's actually I
think a lot of the same results I got when I just searched TV that's the magic hack so that's the deeper level and I understand why you would just search TV but let me explain why I don't want to do that sure because if I search then I am at the mercy of whatever you're being paid the most to promote 100% I am just in my in my logic if you go to the department it's the same thing you don't think they're going to advertise on the department level well no because on the department level I want filters that's
or or I expect to find filters but I got filters when I I know but that's ridiculous a little bit why don't I get filters yeah like if if I just go to your category view the the all all the first results are sponsored 100% like that lamp replacement thing thing is a sponsored post says right there you're seeing this ad based on the product's  not sort of no I'm not this two star lamp replacement is very relevant dude this is a dumpster fire yeah I can't even believe this you it's the it's the
where even is the mute button it's the ification of uh I don't think I did that properly yeah well fine good job of of Amazon and other various websites right like it's just getting worse but this isn't sustainable go to try Amazon so here hold on what's really what's really wild to me is if look okay you know the the category that I drilled down into just doesn't have the TVs in it or whatever I could see that but no it does because when I click on smart TV they're all here they just didn't think that that
was relevant to my interests I mean what even is this stuff okay an HDMI splitter sure but a Sega Genesis HDMI adapter what are the odds Amazon what are the odds hey hey amazon.ca is actually better people recommended that and they're not wrong um oh wow so I I went I went to all and then I had to scroll down further I think uh shopy Department Electronics computer and office is this what I did yeah and then TV and home theater so there was two more layers here so that's probably what
that person was talking about and then I clicked on TV and home theater and it brought me here and then there was another layer where you just have to click on televisions which is fine cuz all these other things are related to what I've done so far so televisions and then boom I got a bunch of TVs let's see uh some people are saying that oh hold on hold on uh sh some people are saying that it might matter that it says shipped to Canada in the top so I'm changing it to why is it not going to go back to oh
my God why is it not in the drop down United States minor outlying Islands no why where is that what Canada is to you now a minor outlying Island no I'm just I'm trying to find I'm trying to find ship to us in the America it's not here and it's not here is there another have they changed the name to American or something like what where where the heck is America whatever I just I put in I put in the only zip code I know so 90210 uh here we go let's refresh the page nope sorry folks Electronics you
got to put in uh 2500 televisions and video products here we go 20500 yeah all right  America's attic we are not no we're the Hat come on now yeah figure it out really nice hat warm yeah a a beaver hat you might say beaver hat sold out of what are we supposed to be doing right now what even is the show hson Bay who knows you know it's amazing how much of Canada the Hudson's Bay Company owned oh yeah like a couple hundred years ago like actually owned the country now they're like almost gone yeah kind of
what a what a way to fall yeah what  arc amazing Canada actually has some genuinely very interesting history oh yeah yeah for sure like like actually yep and I'm not even just saying that cuz I'm also Canadian but like it actually does yeah anyway it like literally was the fur trade for a while that was its only point in existing and that's why Hudson's Bay like owned it all it was it was super weird I don't know oh hey Luke check this out what's up TV and video up here oh hey now you got that Canadian page
now you click on televisions yeah no no no yeah no no hold on hold on okay so what happened so from the homepage if I go here and I go to shop by Department SE all   happened all right at least I can find televisions now so that's good so I want to know how much a 55 in t great 50 to 59 in then fine I'll settle anyway we found the answer before it's about 250 bucks is what the kind of going rate for a basic 55 in TV is in fact I think this might be the one that we settled
on it is amazing oh no that's not it that's 50 in it is amazing pretty wild that you can get a nice 50-in TV for 26 here it is this one TV prices are something that have not gone the road of graphics cards it seems no no they somehow managed to keep getting cheaper wild they have man I've talked about this before but I actually got to experience it firsthand for a while firsthand um for the first time because For the first time in my life I went to a store and bought a TV not to make a video you know I've
only ever done that once too just to have a TV so that I would have it yeah me too I've only ever done that once my grandparents um have a had a pretty small TV it was like 38 in or 40 in or something like that and their vision is not what it was and uh they do not have at their age they don't have the capability to go to a store and and buy a TV at this point anymore so um I was over there and they were talking about you know some of the some of the hassle with it and I was
like tell you what uh Merry Christmas new TV sure um so we went down we went down to visit them uh last weekend and I was like oh I still owe you your Christmas present it's late January uh peace I'll be back and so I went to London Drugs of all places because it was that is a thing they actually have a surprisingly solid electronics department it's always surprised me they they carry Samsung LG high sense oh wow sure um and Sony yeah and so I was like okay well let's have a look um I
don't I totally understand or actually no I don't understand how Mo how enough people are buying makes no sense especially with shipping cost like LG and Samsung TVs uh given how much more they C like I understand why I understand why TCL and high sense are gaining so much ground in North America right now because it was literally half the price and even to my eye I was like yeah it looks good enough for Mima and paaw uh so so I ended up with a high sense I know right like got rid of my TV buying virginity
with high sense of all people um right I'll remember it forever though Unforgettable moment so so anyway uh  at just hear Dan's sigh from behind the camera no I I always think about things that I want to say and then they're just absolutely absolutely not appropriate again looking at the pricing the difference between 55 in and 65 Ines is basically negligible so I was like okay yeah let's well let's get them a 65 in TV let's get something nice and big so they can you know see National
Geographic or whatever it is that they watch figure skating I don't know cool yeah my grandma likes figure skating all right so so 65 in TV very impressive so I took my I took my son with me on this errand because he doesn't do enough errands and I was like you're going to do an errand um let's go get a console we needed to get a new console table because we discovered you know we found the TV we wanted and realized it had the new style stand cuz it's cheaper for them to make uh with the two feet on the
edges instead of the single thing that kind of supports it at the back so we had to go to IKEA we had to get a little a new little console table so we got that threw it in the trunk uh we went back to lar drugs picked up the TV that we'd gotten the quote for they they had put it aside for us dragged it out to the parking lot and went oh sh doesn't  it's a good lesson on running errands why would I drive the tyan you were just trying to be uh a dad who teaches his son things why did I take the tyan
though that's that was it you were trying to teach him a Lon yeah but why did I take the tyan I don't know it's cuz I didn't think about it I didn't think we were going to go out and buy a TV no cuz you were trying to teach him a lesson get you out here man come on would have taken the minivan um so the real reason I drove the Titan is cuz I like driving it and because it's electric yeah I hate going to the gas station yeah like hate it yeah so for those wondering for those tyan drivers
out there who have a tyan um you cannot fit a 65 in TV in the trunk unless in the rain you unbox the TV in the parking lot  God put it in with about this much clearance to either side take all the accessories out put them under it drag the box back inside say hey can you throw this in the compactor for me and then hope to whatever day you believe in that that thing is not [Laughter] DOA you could have um I've done stuff like this before you could have plugged it in and turned it on while you were
there yeah I I didn't think of that it's fine that's amazing any who this actually that is a different lesson maybe not the best one but get her done no matter what yeah yeah I mean that that's definitely the lesson yeah and uh mimo and peaw now have and it works a new TV it does work mission accomplished thank thank the maker high sense in this case yeah yeah good job I've actually had to do that before the last time was buying sorry soone in float plane chat Tai can't got him but it could in this
case so is still a Tian so a 65 in TV does fit in a Tian no that's not the lesson I actually takeway I actually have had to do this before and it was way worse uh when we moved wait so this is the second time you've moved a TV with the ti no no it wasn't a TV oh okay yeah no the first time I've had to do no I mean I mean unpack something in a parking lot ah the first time was way worse it was at Costco which should give you some idea where I'm going with this  frame for some reason because I don't
believe in planning I already had a bunch of stuff in the back of the van ah nice good so I had to completely dismantle and at Costco I was I don't know I was afraid to even ask them to take the packaging for me so I basically Tetris the crap out of this thing putting in the pieces every way that I could trying to use use the packaging to keep it from like keep the pieces from destroying and scratching each other and at the end of it I was able to shove the trunk latched completely full completely solid
um yeah so um plan ahead you won't well it's like what I'm  on oh man and like that that bed frame it was wrapped in that you know that really really thin foam wrap so it was wrapped in that it was a windy day and it was like blowing all over the place and stuff I was in the loading zone in front of the store so people were like watching me do this I'm pretty sure at least one person walked by was like Hey lonus cuz like  Anonymous oh my goodness that's fantastic won't pay $10
for delivery so I'll spend 2 hours bagging it but yeah that's two hours that he wasn't working though yeah delivery for $10 I can't get Uber Eats delivered for $10 never mind a TV what are you talking about yeah $10 yeah what's that line that Bill Gates do a back flip Bill Gate the Bill Gates character on The Simpsons says you don't get rich by writing a lot of checks or something like that yeah oh man that's such a great scene when his goons come in and just start like trashing Homer's living
room I don't know if I've seen he created like a website right or something like homer.com with all with like all the junk on it and the ads yeah and he was just he was just bandwagoning on the dot them boys yeah and so Bill Gates rolls up and is like we'd like to acquire your company and it turns out acquire just means like Wreck The Joint cuz it was like a Home Server that was basically just his computer and they just destroy it with baseball bats and I wish the internet worked more like
that your website is cancer going to destroy it we're supposed to explain merch messages so the way to interact with the show is to leave a merch message don't do Super Chat don't do a twitch bit it's not like twitch needs more money actually they probably kind of do we'll talk about that later actually why don't we yeah why don't we expand that thing we were doing before the show into a bit of a more of a topic twitch and the no good very bad week um pain left yeah yeah so that's
that's interesting any who um merch messages all you got to do is head to LTT store.com and put something in your cart and you will see a box for Merch messages once you complete your order it'll go to our producer Dan there he is who will either forward it to the appropriate party reapply to it himself or curate it for me and Luke to respond to we've got a couple of merch announcements before we do a couple of merch messages to show you guys kind of how it works first up we have a new
newsletter this this week going through the minor backpack oh here it is so make sure you are signed up for the newsletter because we are trying to provide some really cool behind the-scenes content um Tatiana actually hosted a video over on float plane where she went through that backpack that had been used in a coal mine and contrasted it with a brand new one this was in the leadup to the discovery that the bottom panel was not actually doubled so there's some really cool learnables from
all of this from our materials expert uh what else do we have as an update for the merch team um okay I am a little confused by this one oh okay we have a 3D down jacket promo right now I'm just going to have to go to the store to make sure that this is working but as winter reaches sort of the end of winter this my favorite jacket ever uh blah BL jackets here we we go if you order the 3D down jacket which is a relatively light jacket but very warm for how thin it is good reviews there you go you get free
shipping for your entire order oh so if you live somewhere where shipping is expensive and there was some stuff that you were planning to pick up anyway then maybe pick up a 3D down jacket at what will amount to a pretty sizable discount so there you go you just got to click that box and you fill out this thing and it's pretty cool and then you go ahead and check out your order the last thing we have going on on the store this week is precision screwdriver notification
signups there's going to be a couple of reasons that you're going to want to sign up for the Precision screwdriver notification so that's right here on the homepage where work meets play cuz it's oh that's that's cute with a Twist cuz it's got a really nice uh hybrid ceramic bearing in the top so it'll spin for like a minute if you just kind of lightly give it a little spin uh anyway there's two reasons you're going to want to sign up first is you'll be the first to know when you can buy it and second
is you will be in the pool to potentially get a chance to be one of the first 100 for that first batch of top of production samples um and then after that everyone else is going to have to wait for mass production so you could end up with it much much earlier than anyone else all right Dan do you want to hit us with a couple merch messages yeah I've got some here for you hi lldd what do you think about pal world lukee how do you feel about regionals in Pokémon go you even do Pokémon go looke I'm
going to let you yeah he's a Pokemon go I didn't know that awesome um I disagree with pretty much all of the things that the Pokémon go Community seems to care about CU I play it for wildly different reasons that I think most people do um so I don't care at all about reg regionals in Pokemon go I don't even care slightly for you it's just more of a like touch grass thing right yeah yeah so like whenever there's some features the point of Pokémon am I missing something oh oh oh okay I would can I
just say that I would like if I'm going  cancelled I would like for it to be for something other than Pokemon go this is the only time I've actually feared for my job I thought it was you're poking The Hornet's Nest here that reaction when he's like oh we're here now let me let me address the community really quick before we go further not that I'm not going to go further but just contr z contr z you're going to use those mute buttons and now would be the time Loop oh man that was really funny um I'd like
if I'm going to get canceled can it at least be for something cool you know like yeah I don't know and like graffiti I don't know people will would absolutely yeah hate like all my takes on Pokémon go and that's fine and they can just be mad about things and that's okay but yeah I don't really care about regionals if a regional happens can you explain what a regional is for those of us who don't Pokémon go got it certain Pokémon are only available to be caught in certain areas of the world right I
don't need them right I don't care right and now if I happen to be there and I get one right neat and then for anyone in that region I guess it's like if you want it that bad then you  come rather than go yeah come get it yeah totally totally probably a different game it also incentivizes like I wouldn't be surprised if it exists though probably exists what does it rule rule something something yeah um oh there's so many jokes there but I'm just going to leave it where it is
um but like when I was in Japan uh there's a APAC Regional which is farfetched so I caught a bunch of them when I came back I've just been giving them to people when I'm back so you don't even have to go get it yourself right if someone you know or someone in the Pokémon Community around you which it's very likely one of them will travel at some point happens to go somewhere and gets a bunch of them you can just trade them something when they come back and then you get it like it just I I
don't know who cares why do you care I I've been think I mean it's literally the tagline of the entire franchise got to catch them all okay okay no but this is a very good point I'm just saying I know I've been mulling on this thing that I make very good points once we both know I'm never going to make this and that's fine but I've been enjoying the mental idea I've been mulling on this video idea of uh we all suck at playing video games H and my whole my whole point is that we're doing it
wrong yeah we're never making that video just cuz the tag no I'm not saying blame the community video rarely goes over well yeah yeah yeah but just cuz the tagline is got to catch them all does not mean that you've got to catch them all like you should find a way that you have fun in a game and then do that right but I mean let's look at the Pokemon company's entire raand Detra like why do they create new Pokemon so that you won't have them all like they know that this is a compulsive behavior
for people that they need to have them all and they and they feed that they do it on purpose for sure they not only do you have to have them all you have to have them all in this game then you have to have them all in cards oh by the way did I mention there are shiny cards you need to have them all in that form don't foret you need digital you need digital cards for the digital game so you can play it online don't forget about all the Collectibles well you're going to
have to have all of those too I mean the whole thing is just designed to exploit people who just compulsively need to collect things right to a certain re to a certain degree you should want that because that means there's more content but you just got to not be obsessive about the content oh my god listen to this guy you just got to not be obsessive do you have any idea who you're talking to I don't know these are people who are so into computers that they are now hold
on one second there's this thing called Shadow they are an hour and 23 minutes into this podcast about nothing what have we even talked about yeah but we're second monitor they're not obsessed we're second monitor let's find out what monitor we're on I'm putting up a poll you got to include third as well you're on my fourth fourth yeah yeah but we we got a stop it somewhere I do need I do need more we still have to talk about that oh my goodness we'll get you one of those 55
in TVs and just divide it up no that doesn't work I did that at home and it's terrible for productivity I miss multiple monitors yeah multiple monitors are great okay I'm doing a two-minute PLL here we go all right Luke carry on okay so this is going to be nothing to you but there's a there's a thing in the game called Shadow raids and in just leaves well it's nothing to me I was going to get a snack that works I no no I'm I'm actually kidding um so over the pandemic I I quit playing over the
pandemic cu the reason I would play it was to go outside but um over the pandemic they added something called a remote raid pass you wanted to do a raid you could buy because I don't think there was any opportunity to get them for free maybe there was at some point there isn't now you could buy a remote raid pass sure but can sorry can I interrupt for a second what if I wanted  type well raid wouldn't be very effective against a bear my I actually I have to applaud you for
that it's very good I wasn't sure where you're going that was pretty good that was pretty good raid is a brand of insecticide here in North America if it doesn't Exist Elsewhere yeah yeah um raid is usually for more rare uh types of Pokemon I think the most commonly done one by at least groups of people would be legendary raids which are the harder ones um they introduced these remote raid passes so you wouldn't have to go outside in order to raid a cool idea we are actually primarily on
primary monitors just just saying wow 45% that's the float plane people though  Firefox why don't you make this why don't you make this point that you are apparently going to make it okay okay um um oh I just poked that Hive um can you not antagonize our most loyal Die Hard community members please so there's there's these things called remote raid passes really cool idea during the pandemic they still exist whatever sounds good people are really pissed that you can't do more of them per day
right raids remote raids remote raids you can do as many local raids as you want per day oh okay but you have to actually get off your chair and go there um I heard a lot of them are like churches and stuff now or something like a lot of locations or gyms gyms yeah like churches have embraced like the whole Pokémon gym thing so that people will go to them sure anyway that's a whole probably separate conversation yeah any um I doubt it works to be honest cuz people show up for like a few
minutes and leave they don't really anyways whatever um but Shadow raids you which have a certain type of Pokemon don't worry about it doesn't matter you can't remote raid into them and Shadow raids Shadow legendaries so like a shadow Zapdos is only going to show up on the weekend uh that they can't see it they have to move you and I Luke created a poll called I did not Dan did this Dan why they've kept it perfectly neutral I respect that a lot good job guys that's actually amazing it's
5050 his poll here is is everyone on float plane a liar yes yes luk had a luk had the polls closed that was for him  that that's I find that amazingly entertaining that it's 50/50 good job Flo plane that's that's impressive I'm genuinely impressed you guys are you guys are great these shadow these shadow legendary rides they only happen on weekends you can't remote rate you can't remote raid pass into them got it that has created this emergent Behavior where I will try to organize
with people to meet up on the weekend yeah and go walk around and do these raids right so you're so you imagine that that's really cool so you're the true Scotsman that's fantastic but no one else is a true exactly what I want and people are mad because they want to be able to remote raid pass into shadow and I'm like actually I would rather if we couldn't because now if people want this thing if people are going to I go catch them all then they're going to have to come out for a walk right okay so like I
have differing opinions to the majority of the community which is fine they can want to play the game however they want to play the game that's no problem but I play Pokémon go for a reason that I don't think most people do right I I I play it because like this weekend there's a thing going on and I'm probably going to walk like 15 plus kilom in a day and that's great because getting myself to do that without a gamified motivation is harder but now I'm like excited to go
walk a crazy amount of kilometers some people are just going to put a bunch of lures down and sit on their butt for the entire event and that will be very effective but I don't care I'm they can just be kind of like the NPCs and in that region yeah like the yeah the trainers that are just like walking back and forth they're like I like bug do you want to battle that would be fantastic um if you don't move enough you should turn into an NPC and when people encounter you you
should have to battle or something is that a is that a thing is that a mechanic they have cuz if not they totally should pretty sweet though like if you don't move you're just like you're one of the people on like route like a vision cone in front of you like anyone that walks in front it challenges them to battle um someone said I I agree but as a wheelchair user there needs to be a wheelchair mode is wouldn't you just wheelchair around would you just roll depends not everywhere is wheelchair
accessible like man it's it is that's fair where I go to every time I do one of these is very wheelchair accessible I had a um I had a pretty bad knee injury a number of years ago but I understand not everywhere such that like walking was actually really hard and came for a bit shocking like how hard it is to get around anywhere and I was still on my feet it's crazy easy um and the thing is that like as someone who's working on a building right now if you guys missed it we uploaded a video earlier this week
outlining the plans for the badminton centerland gaming center as someone who's working on a building right now um I I recognize a lot of the really good things that are being done in the building code to make things more accessible you have to have handy accessible spots you have to have X percentage of Handy accessible washroom stalls and sinks and all of that kind of kind of stuff um so your like your counters have to be such that you can you can roll up to them and use them all
that's really good but what's interesting is that building code just straight up doesn't apply to anything that was already built and 98% of everything actually no 100% of everything is already built like today you know there will be things that exist that will become that they have been built but my point is just that the overwhelming majority of things were built before that and the planning was terrible um so yeah yeah that's a that's totally a fair that's totally a fair
point and that's something that you know Niantic should address but I also don't think that that invalidates Luke's point that a lot of people are able-bodied and just don't want to go out I would love if there was solutions for that type of stuff I'm not against solutions for that type of stuff I think there's ways to accomplish that uh like maybe make it that you can invite a maximum amount of people to remote rates per day and you have to be a certain level of friends
with them because like there's a there's a if you hadn't stolen my phone I forgot about that until now I knew you would there's a there's a there's multiple apps there's a ton of different apps that you can use uh to host uh which I'll do sometimes or or to to remote raid in to other people's things so the community element is just fully digital now um I know I I I I understand the countering argument because you can play the game more and honestly probably enjoy it more and play it at a more
competitive level and all these other types of things and be much more immersed and in the Pokemon go experience if uh you're able to remote raid more and you're able to catch more things from your house like if your catch radius is bigger so you can get more things in your house all this type of stuff I get that but the reason why I want to play the game personally on a personal level is because it gets me outside and moving and more active and and in the Sun and all that type of
stuff um my motivation is less about Pokemon it's more about personal health and and fitness and well-being and stuff like that so I like the idea that I don't have to do those things alone and I have genuinely received the response I've been like oh I want to go do this thing like let's go to whatever Park and walk around and try as much as we can I have genuinely received the response of like I'm probably just going to hang out at home I I'll remote rate it and it's like
ah that sucks I don't know but to each their own right did we just spend half an hour on the first of the two merch messages we're supposed to do right now you didn't even answer the full question what was the question what was the question and also what do you think of pal world oh I haven't played I've played it um I hope it's a major wake up call the Pokémon and that's honestly pretty much my only only feeling about it yeah it's the best Pokémon game that has released in many years it makes uh
what what was it called Legend of archus or something what was that game I don't even know whatever it was even called cuz it didn't matter at all um it makes that game look like a joke yeah um and hopefully game freak wakes up and does something with that IP because it's incredibly frustrating as like a person who does like Pokemon that the Pokemon game's like I don't know yeah and it's not like Nintendo nintend is I mean Nintendo Nintendo can be really stuffy and really kind of set in their ways but
they can also be kind of edgy and unique and fun and so yeah I don't see why they couldn't do something a little more creative with the Pokemon IP I mean you look at like Super Mario RPG or Zelda yeah sure yeah Zelda has been changing evolving improving yeah how ironic that Pokemon wouldn't evolve yeah for real though uh we should do a a a Super Chat really quick here someone didn't get the memo and sent a $200 Super Chat that is a perfect way for me to highlight why we don't do
super chats and why we moved away from using this dashboard entirely check this out uh hey love the channel um Columbus was getting new Intel chip factory yeah it's super cool it's uh kind of crazy that semiconductor manufacturing is like coming back to the States who to thk it anyo look at this I've had people call me out on this and say no line of Slide the dashboard is perfect no Linus didn't lie the dashboard is not perfect that message okay a I can't apparently unselect it um anywh who uh is not
here it's not in what happens if you refresh the viewer activity no it's it's   out not there and eventually things do fall off here yeah that will go away that's only still there because it's such a big donation that's the bug that made us develop merch messages in the first place how many years ago was that two three somewhere around there it's been a while it's still not fixed how is that even possible like tell me something how complicated is the database that needs to store these text
inputs these text entries like is this is this more complicated than an Excel sheet help me out here well yeah no but on YouTube scale y y y y but it shouldn't be a big deal it has to store a username and amount a timestamp and a flipping it should not be a big deal for YouTube to do it it doesn't even have to store image anything like it's are you kidding me so anyway that's why and as for why I don't turn them off if people want badly enough to do things wrong then I say power to them yeah
all right Dan hit us with another merch message sure hi Dan Luke and lonus 2 I guess what industry have you been most surprised by the amount or kinds of  use man just about just about I think I'm more surprised by the opposite oh ones that don't use technology or or that like oh they're still running the same computer with serial cables from the like early '90s I remember finding out in like 2010 or something like that that that one of our competitors at NC still used fax to
place POS I'm like what Japan just emailed them like obviously I don't know if this is in the dock right now but Japan is dealing with like the fact that a bunch of businesses are still sending the government like floppy discs yeah apparently they just changed the legislation that forced that so maybe they can finally move past the floppy discat after all these years all these decades um I will say being in Japan a lot of the more tactile things still being around is kind of nice more things tend
to have physical buttons um more things tend to have moving moving physical components involved that don't seem like they're going to break of in did I ever tell the story actually like pretty cool about getting the insurance and registration taken care of from my car oh yeah and how like not only did they require facts like like uh like like signed facts uh like assigned facts but they actually required the original form for like the business registration for the dealer to be mailed to the
insurance broker in order to register the car because some some ICBC is our insurance provider and BC they have a monopoly because that's legal for some reason uh if anyone was looking for a platform to get elected on in BC it would be to abolish icbc's Monopoly and then instant you're elected just in case anyone's wondering anyway the point is um yeah the fact that even a fax wasn't considered good enough how is it how is how is anything more than an email required I just am sort of baffled by
that um and then yeah the fact that things have to be physically present for signatures always blows me away uh Hey the the the superb owl is coming up really soon uh Sports Tech is is really cool sports Tech is really cool especially in the NFL actually yeah I mean have you seen how have you watched an NHL game recently game no I heard we're doing well but no remember how bad those digitally superimposed uh board they're really good now I have seen that I have seen that they like move and stuff
and looks really good yeah yeah um but but genuinely uh if you're if you're into Tech at all even if you hate Sports if you look into the tech that the NFL uses um for for NFL games it's it's really pretty wild that is actually an extremely Tech forward uh organization yep yeah you wouldn't know it from all the NFL uh co-branded merchandise we did that video where we bought Sports Tech just the cheapest cheapest of AliExpress garbage with a silk screen logo on it it was amazing yeah but when it comes to
their games and like how they do reing and all this other kind of stuff really impressive yeah Hawkeye is super cool I I might have some news about Hawkeye for you oh okay well here why don't I first explain what Hawkeye is it's what they use for tennis badminton oh yeah yeah um to to track the projectile and I didn't realize this but it's not actually that the camera array is seeing where the ball landed or where the shuttle landed it's that it is calculating based on the
initial trajectory where it will go so Hawkeye might not actually always be right because this is less true of a tennis ball probably where you could do a like a NASA style two compute thing where you have Hawkeye try to figure it out and you have something that watches it and tries to figure it out I think they do have that okay but it has to make a decision and it is the final call Hawkeye is yeah if cuz Hawkeye only comes out at least in badminton I don't know Works in tennis uh in badminton
Hawkeye only comes out in the event of a challenge so they have um e EOB 18 full play chat I don't necess know how true this is but I've worked with Hawkeye at a Grand Slam Tennis tournament it's not 100% yeah they use a lot of cameras I I know they use a lot of cameras uh it's like in the dozens if I recall correctly like it's a flipping ton of them uh but aside from the cameras my understanding and hey feel free to correct me my understanding is that the cameras are more about feeding
data into the computational engine that decides where it landed because the the point of contact is so much smaller than the actual projectile think about it for a tennis ball absolutely yeah only the part that mushes touched the court and if the edge of the ball that doesn't mush onto the ground is over the line well that doesn't count so no camera unless it was positioned at ground level is going to actually see how much that ball compressed or in the case of a shuttle how much the uh the
how much the cork compressed as it hit the ground so they cannot see where it landed they just have to have a pretty good idea of where it landed and in tennis I could see this being less of a problem but in badminton the shuttle is fragile so if you knock a feather off of it with a with a really powerful smash or something like that it's traj eory may not be as anticipated um man sports projectiles are a fun Rabbit Hole oh yeah have you ever watched a baseball get made yeah
they apparently like tried to cost them down and make it make it like machine sewn or something and they were like no this doesn't work so they're hand sewn like every single baseball that the players are just casual just like Huck it to the fans which they should that's part of the experience of the ball game was like handcrafted what what's that thing about like badminton shuttles 2o man badminton shuttle manufacturing is wild the fact that they only cost like uh about a150 wholesale us is mindblowing to
me yeah baseball rubbing mud anyway uh Dan tell us about Hawkeye yeah so we had some really good feedback after uh the Badminton Center video came out and some people have been recommending a bunch of equipment especially for the audio like something like qis came up a lot um and so I did some digging with Matt and apparently qis has a lot of Partnerships with Intel and Dell and then also with Sony and so apparently Sony also works intensely with Hawkeye MH and we may
sounding really expensive we may be able to get a Hawkeye system what maybe we'll see there might be there might be some major partnership stuff but we'll we'll have to see how much Dan I don't know but like full Sony  um but if you could have if you could  uh okay like just it would be installed and it would be permanent it would be yours cuz generally you rent them just for just for people the audience that's my understanding anyway just for people in the audience we do a Hawkeye video and
then I mean I'm we do a Hawkeye video we explain the system we do a full build FAS not only that would be a sick video it would be an incredible video you know we put that in with the qis system because they've got some really amazing they're all based on like Dell servers qis is sort of like the same audio management system that we're planning to put in okay like Dante yeah but it works with Dante like there's a controller box um and all of them are kind of in the same kind of integration
thing they've got some uh and then they're also partnered with Sony so you know how we're going to have our TVs all over the lobby yeah yeah so CYS actually has a partners ship with Sony because the Sony like professional display TVs have ausus integration so all of the media and everything can be controlled under the same banner and the same system okay so we'd really need to change like a lot of stuff well we'll see but it it might be worth it I was just planning to buy cheap tcls and then
replace them when they burn out yeah like that was my and put USB sticks in them with a looping video like that was actually the plan it was minimum viable product well I mean all of it all of it was designed under minimum viable well except the facility could easily accom accommodate what Dan's talking about so we yeah sorry so so basically what we did just to give you guys a bit more context here is we built amazing bones yeah and then we planned to put the cheapest possible Flesh on them yeah
with the idea being that in the future we would you could upgrade or you could replace we are decked the out when it comes to networking and power because that's how we roll those things are annoying to run once you hopefully don't think about it again but knowing that technology only gets cheaper unless it's a GPU um we had planned to just go Min bare minimum for the initial implementation and then to kind of see how it goes but if we I mean look I'm I'm like I need to take my sweater
off excited if we could have a Hawkeye I mean yeah this is kind of what we're working on cuz after that video came out just everybody started jumping on me for for that audio set up but like it would just hurt but of course right minimal viable product alone that's what we need to have could you come can you come and pick up can you pick up our car please Dan's plan made complete sense given the bounds that we gave him to be very clear we could have told him you can spend as
much money as you want he could have come up with a different system my client gave me exacting specifications for that right so leave Dan alone but but looking into cuses like some stuff some good stuff did come out of this and like cuz we have people with Intel and I think Matt's already reached out to a couple of them because all of them like CIS has a heart and the head is Intel and there's Dell as well and all of them know what we're doing and they know CIS and then this is hilarious and then Sony
and then also Hawkeye we need to release preemptive vide for every future project this is why we never build anything reasonable because the second we say that's our plan either the community or our industry Partners jumps on us they're like what what are you doing that could be 8% better so for for for for me right so the system I designed for your for your minimal VI product cheapest is that we can get going it can do like I don't know you know maybe maybe 16 16 channels or
something like that seems the problem probably problem is that the the qys things that have the Dell logo on the front of them that run on the Intel  airports so they have 256 independent "channels of Dante and like a, different" individual paging zones um and so uh some people were asking they're like so how many paging Stones do you need I'm like well the spec got change so it's one cuz we didn't we didn't want to buy a second microphone so we're just going to do one like okay well I need I need an
airport okay you're did I know but you're making me sound like such a cheap head that was reasonable all of it is extremely reasonable Reon was Dan should we tell them what my plan was sure sure okay so I'm known as the cheap guy so I threw my plan into the ring and it got upgraded cuz my plan was rough if you want to know what my not a 610 a 5300 it was like I I don't remember fully but it was like raspberry pies connected to speakers and they're all logged into Discord oh I've done a full house
install I've done house install like that you would just move your your talking thing around in Discord and then speak it to a mic it was really cheap to  channel it was very cheap and then so we went from my garbage solution that would cost practically nothing yeah and we looked at cuz there was convers ear we looked at traditional paging systems as well there was was months of discussion right oh yeah so we we went we went way above we went way below and then we found the pretty reasonable spot in the
middle and now we have offers that might result in it being way above again in a facility that we plan to have a grand total of about two people on staff at any given time we're going to have to have a Sixers it team so this is this is the problem I mean that's why I went with that system initially cuz that was one of your requirements it just has to work with no training and be really simple right I love that look at him he's freaking out what if you could keep it what if you could keep it lus what if
you had system at all times I mean you have you might have to put a Sony sticker on something binton Center in Canada they also do like florid best binton center in can Nano LED walls that are all also controlled like it's digital signage right we're doing that why not no those are like millions of dollars for an install that we're not you could put a Sony Banner on the outside I don't even I don't even want to the Sony lius badminton smash Sony Champs I don't even want to owe them for
bers my soul who can't read good and want to play badminton entitled to at that price no no that would not be reasonable but no full Hawkeye video would be actually incredible cuz I don't think there's been any media on it like really at all there's a little bit but there's it's kind of um it's pretty dry like kind of expl and I don't think that I've seen anyone who's like an independent media who has gotten a chance to Benchmark it like I would be really interested to put
Hawkeye up against yeah real eye and like an array of like you know 25 cameras around a spot how good is how good is Hawkeye I mean this is the kind of thing that they're probably looking at going we're not going to we're not going to do that are we sick though that's that would be really interesting to me and then of course that also means that you know the the cameras that are going to be recording the uh the courts they would probably also be Sony oh well that's good we have found that Sony one
we really liked the only reason I was going to go Panasonic was because it was cheaper well they're also doing like uh some PTZ cameras PTZ cameras yeah uh P tilt Zoom for those not familiar so they they are remotely controlled yeah uh and a lot of it is in in like the maybe tracking and stuff as well but I don't think those are going to be super necessary but you know huge buildout very exciting yeah one bit of a downer I saw one comment where someone was like Hey I work with
bwf which is badminton World Federation or whatever um one of the one of the big mistakes we see a lot of centers making is is not investing properly in the lighting and the uh and certain other elements to make it uh bwf standard so we'd love to work with you guys to make it so you could like host International tournaments and stuff um I don't think that's feasible as much as I appreciate the Outreach um because a we don't have any kind of um we we don't have any kind of
spectator capabilities really like you could be up in the in the lounge but we don't have parking to accommodate if you know hundreds or thousands of people wanted to watch or whatever we could handle video but you know part of a sporting event is is the crowd right at least to to a degree yeah we do have a crowd section though they can all be on treadmills yeah exactly and then number two is that we don't actually have the um we don't actually have a high enough ceiling oh really
yeah so I'm trying I'm trying to find it right now but yeah here it is um according to the uh the minimum ceiling height for a badminton court at Olympic Games Youth Olympic Games grade 1 grade 2 and badminton bwf level is 39 ft ours are I want to say 32 okay yeah I think they're 32 or 34 I can't remember exactly which is for uh even a highlevel recreational player more than fine but those professional players man do they ever hit hard and there are certain instances I actually
saw I saw so many people in the comments on that video who just they don't know anything about badmon and I get it in North America we most people know absolutely nothing about the sport I didn't and one of the one of the big comments that I saw from people was what do you need all that vertical height for for badminton well let me tell you uh highle players if their opponent plays a really tight shot over the net where they're basically just coming in like this and just kind of popping it up so
the shuttle tumbles and it just barely like kind of rolls over the net what they're going to do to to counter that is they're going to come up and they're going to hit it as high as humanly possible way way up and toward the back of the court and the more ceiling height you have the more travel they can get toward the back of the court and that's really important because the closer it is to the front the more likely it is that they are going to be eating that shuttle when their opponent smashes it down at
them um so having it really really having the ceilings really high is actually incredibly important so we're not going to be able to host like a bwf sanction tournament or anything like that that's not in our future there's that's how high the ceiling is there's absolutely nothing we can do to change that it'll be a quality facility it'll have some of the highest ceilings in the Lower Mainland but no bwf tournaments for us Hawkeye be cool though Hawkeye would be sick hawkey so bad just for any
tournament even if it was just a video yeah yeah even if we had to tear it out that's that's fine I'd be down y yep uh you got one more no I'm just it's sponsors we have to do sponsors now oh yeah we better do sponsors uh right the show is brought to you  pieces don't get stuck using the Apple Vision Pro all by yourself share the fun times with your friends and family with odd pieces our sponsor their puzzles are more than just pictures you put together you are also getting to experience their

something right eventually you know broken broken clock is right at least twice a day it's like it's like they got 10% on a Scantron but they figured it out at the end General Motors has announced that they will be bringing back their line of plug-in hybrid EVS which they retired back in 2019 at the worst possible time with the end of the Chevy Vault the company has been under significant pressure from dealership who have been struggling both to meet consumer demand for hybrids and to sell battery only EVS
in the quantity that's required by their carbon reduction quotas how many times have I said the volt was an amazing car it was just ahead of its time and if if they their problem was the lack of demand so their dealers have apparently figured it out they could have sold man they could have sold this it's such a cool car yeah you only have to burn gas if you're going F plug-in hybrid just makes so much sense for most people and they just couldn't figure out how to sell it like man I'd
read man anytime I want to just be angry I'll go and read like Chevy Chevy Volt Message Board messages and stuff and people be like yeah I worked at a dealership this guy brings this car in and uh he brings it in for a trade in and I'm like oh yeah the the like lifetime fuel economy is really high he's like yeah I never plugged it in like not once like what the are you doing you could you could do your daily commute on battery and then anytime you need to go far you just put gas in it
it's the best of both worlds you don't have to strip M entire country to get all the lithium because they just have small batteries and you don't have to just like put gas in every week because you just really like consuming gas cu the vast majority of most people's driving is a extremely predictable and be not super long range but you want your car to be able to do that sometimes solution is enormous batteries yeah and they're not so heavy because they don't have gigantic batteries in so
they actually end up being crazy fuel efficient and I get it they were pretty expensive to produce but they managed to discontinue it right before car prices went like this in general any who other manufacturers also seem to be jumping on the plug-in hybrid electric vehicle bandwagon as of now there are 33 different phv models available in the US six different automakers have three or more pH models available and even Lamborghini launched a plugin hybrid in 2023 though they
don't plan to introduce an EV until 2028 our discussion question here is was EV adoption pushed too hard and did Elon Musk bamboozle all of us when really we should have switched to hydrogen and called it a century I mean I'm not going to try to speak to the whole hydrogen fuel cell thing I got to be honest with you guys it's not a technology that I understand well enough to comment on all the infrastructure challenges that would have been involved in that but what I will say is that for most people at the
time of the introduction of the model S when the Chevy Volt was still in its early days like the first gen Chevy Volt kind of sucked um and that's the reason that I didn't buy a Prius Prime back when I bought my secondhand Chevy Volt was cuz the range wasn't good enough it was like 30 mil or something like like that it's not enough the second gen volt though could do I think something like 55 I only know it in kilometers it'll go anywhere from 60 70 to 100 kilm depending on the weather
um and once that thing launched for most people I think it made more sense than a full electric vehicle yeah it was pretty expensive up front and I could see a lot of people looking at it going oh I might as well just go full EV but that's the thing depending on your usage you could basically Go full EV I did well over 80%  battery and then anytime I needed to go really far I could yeah I know the sex appeal not much I get it but you can make plug-in hybrid cars that have a lot
you could you they just didn't yeah actually I I think the volt was an okay looking car I think it was fine I think it could have been I think there could have been things about it it had notable family car energy oh yeah um but I I I I don't think it was bad at all definite dad energy yeah the 2024 Prius um people have been like drooling over this thing and it finally has decent range um and it's just Chevy is not there to participate in a market that they practically invented yeah it's just
sorry GM so Chevy the sub brand of GM Chevy Volt G General Motors it's just mindblowing to me how at every possible turn GM can get  correct yeah it's kind of frustrating yeah cough ev1 says uh culus in float plane chat 100% yeah new priest Prime looks pretty nice actually um what's the what's the range on this thing though blah blah blah blah blah blah and that's oh man see this is the other thing that people don't realize about these plug-in hybrids is that not only do you drive on pure
electric a lot of the time but when you are burning gas they are just wildly efficient yeah 4.4 4.6 City Highway like what yeah that's wild that's awesome uh specifications here we go okay show me my show me my All Battery range though though where where are we at here horsepower kilowatts okay what is this measure is horsepower a metric uh sorry anyway hold on one sec like what what what are you even talking about any okay hold on di wa why is this Dimensions why  dimension that's actually really weird
um I don't know man I just wow that's odd stuff happens you know I just I've decided to be less  knows uh that 4.4 is liters per 100 kmers just want to clarify that I'm on the Canadian site kilowatts are metrics and engine power no I know but how are horsepower and kilowatts the same are  though kilowatts versus horsepower there's no way that a horsepower is exactly a th000 Watts I don't believe that a power level of one horsepower is approximately equivalent to 746 Watts or 0.746 Kow
okay and there's the mechanical and hydraulic horsepower I don't even care anymore to convert from horsepower to Watts simply multiply by 746 no I'm over it to convert from watt to horsepower they modify by uh multiply Sorry by 0. 1 3 4 yeah so anyway um good job Toyota yeah missing an absolutely critical spec from the page altogether how far it can go on battery and then also um horsepower is a dimension yeah sure yeah uh what else are what else are  today oh is it time yeah let's do it all right
um I I'm it's I've just been hearing you talk about this forever so oh apparently turned off well Dan's supposed to do it right no no I no no I got this I just I think I just need probably went to sleep it's a sleeping it bitty Apple okay so one thing I'm not going to be able to show you guys or rather I could but I don't feel like going through the entire initialization process for this thing but it is shockingly difficult to sign up for Apple arcade without an iPhone make sure you don't blast your credit
card by the way uh yeah yeah that should be fine okay what just happened okay sure that makes sense um so I have already the the issue is that getting your Apple ID signed in on this thing pretty much requires an iPhone uh it was it was it was a real pain in the butt oh I hate this touch sensitive remote I always accidentally click it I feel like watching my grandparents operate anything technological okay so oh oh oh oh handyman's bringing you a good point make sure it's
updated are there any updates that this device needs I don't know but it looks like it's says I can cancel anytime so it looks like they've either changed it um so it should be under subscriptions I guess um no I I forget I forget where it's supposed to be you leaked your name yeah it's  blah uh apps maybe can't remember there's definitely there's definitely somewhere it's supposed to be uh yeah that's a game that I've played uh system okay well it was not easy to find no seriously though where is it
supposed to be no may maybe maybe it is still hiding uh okay well going into the Apple arcade app is not the solution there's no you just you just scroll um there's no unsubscribe in here uh Dan do you mind moving the uh topics piece piece of paper oh yeah let's go to account let's go to account yeah general account I think or you're supposed to click your new usernames and people in fli ch are saying yeah yeah y y I know I know it's it's supposed to be in here somewhere
because I Googled it and I did manage to find it at some point um like find where it was supposed to be here we go here we go subscriptions yeah that's what I would do okay what the actual can you just sign in manually I have already signed in on this device to change the settings sign in yeah that sounds like a very normal Apple thing though um because they always make you resign in or repin into like everything when you have an iPhone unsubscribing from something when I am
signed in should be one click exactly one click now hold on I don't think that's true for like anywhere cuz they ask you to confirm okay oh my God uh let me see if I can find this I don't I actually don't know my iTunes password right now and I think the only way for me to see the screen is for me to share it with you so it's possible that this has been fixed now but I can I can actually do a thing I found no no it's fine I found this before the show so back when I tried to do it I came
across this discussion thread on apple.com which showed that someone else ran into the issue where there was no cancellation button for Apple arcade the button to cancel was physically not there this is from February 2022 and I came across this post of someone that had the same issue because for me it wasn't there I clicked on this and this still has no reference whatsoever for how to cancel a subscription from the Apple TV so this is how I ended up being forced to install I uh to install iTunes
in in order to get rid of the subscription there is absolutely no way from within a browser to cancel a subscription which is absolutely wild to me within a browser I couldn't believe it here I'll uh let me sign in let me oh man oh this is not going to be this is not going to be easy I'm going to need a new okay maybe I'm not as prepped for this as I uh as I should be should should I do another topic yeah sure why don't you do a topic while I while I get this going sure I'll do the one that we
kind of leaked earlier uh Japanese government finally weans itself off of floppy discs since 2022 Japan's Ministry of economy trade and industry has been pushing for the modernization of over "1,900 submission protocols throughout" the Japanese government which still required companies to oh whoa so it wasn't that companies were necessarily just happen to be submitting this way it required companies to submit official documents in outdated and defunct media formats like many discs floppy discs and CD
ROMs this year many but not all of those requirements will be sunset finally allowing companies to move Beyond 1.4 megabyte floppy discs which stopped being sold by their last major manufacturer Sony in 2011 globally many Industries still use floppy discs for legacy Hardware like uh medical equipment and older planes notably the US government only modernized its nuclear launch coordination system to stop using floppy discs in 2019 um discussion question is why do institutions hold on to Legacy Media why
is it so hard to modernize I think a lot of it is if it works don't fix it kind of mentality which is honestly often not the wrong kind of mentality um especially for things that were fine um I don't know yeah like if all you need to submit is a document um and their system works that way it's probably okay I know there's like there's issues at scale at like government scale as well and you only have a certain amount of budget like if your it team only has a certain amount of budget uh they're going to
have to cut things um to be able to do other things right um and if I'm if I'm assuming that they're not misusing this budget which is Highly Questionable but if I am assuming that they're not misusing this budget they're going to put it towards other things that might need it more um than something like that I don't know also there's there's someone who brought up isn't it really hard to hack into really old Tech it's not necessarily true uh but it might not be as much of a Target um or or people
might not know um how to do it but I wouldn't say it's necessarily harder okay I've got one little update for you guys so if you go to the Apple support site which is where I ended up and I clicked on TV and I clicked on billing in subscriptions this all seems pretty yeah good right start your  you what is the fine text there if you don't have iTunes download it for free why the do I need itunes to cancel a subscription that is a little weird so download it why why no really though I would actually like
to know what the justification is for that I don't know I can't tell you I can't think of any reason why I should have to do that isn't iTunes dead well clearly not okay so people want me to go to my iCloud account okay so hold on iCloud let's let's sign into iCloud okay here we go let's do it let's let's let's  experience it is a entirely possible that at some point I missed something oh my God people are also pointing out a bunch of different things yeah purchasing things as a government entity is often
very interesting uh because you can't just like go out and buy the cheapest one you have to go through like all these processes and y y it can end up costing a lot more than you would expect um oh my God I don't have my iPhone on me so I guess I need to get a   fantastic why does it have a British accent at that scale wouldn't times saved outweigh the it works mentality clearly it just did or more probably in my opinion it was enough companies complaining about  go what's new on iCloud don't care
okay I did not think to sign into iCloud I somehow got signed into um like the Apple support site before I couldn't even find a sign in today but I I did manage to find it at some point you should continue to be careful as document names and things are being shown reminders this is all complete garbage look at this this is from 2020 or something yeah don't worry about it uh okay your iCloud plan we're getting into Danger settings sir I think you should off I'll be fine there's nothing on here Luke I promise
you settings I no Apple ID settings sure let's try Apple ID  saying uh okay yeah say Family Sharing uh yeah the really bizarre one was that it wouldn't let me remove the credit card so I eventually did install iTunes and it wouldn't let let me remove my credit card because I was the uh the family owner um it looks like I can change that in iCloud it didn't tell me where to change that it  that uh rooll organizer how to change your family settings this is freaking hilarious
check this out okay so I clicked on my roll organizer you have access to these subscriptions shared features how to change it on an iPhone iPad or iPod Touch go here on a Mac go here don't  yourself seriously where is my where is my unsubscribe button here and look guys my point was n necessarily that exactly the exact steps that I went through or didn't go through my point was this is a prime example of some of the most ludicrous dark patterns that I have personally encountered it was far 
be okay so hold on a second Let's uh is can anyone else I'm I'm open to suggestions here can anyone else figure out where in my iCloud account I should go to remove there's some people that are really mad I'm trying to get the steps that they want you to do from them sure no no I I know how to do it I did cancel my subscription guys I did figure it  easy oh but they but but it's right there on the Apple TV yes yes yes okay we'll go back to the Apple TV now oh Lordy okay here we go what's going on
with that okay uh oh hold on I have to do this Dan am I able to see it but not them yeah give me one I love the I love  message and just need you to tell me when I can see it Luke's going to do another quick topic right sure yeah apple launches The Vision Pro The Vision Pro released today after reportedly "taking just over 200,000 pre-orders" First Impressions from customers have been broadly positive some of the ones that I've talked to personally this is not in the notes have been very positive
uh though the handful of reviews that went up on Wednesday were a bit more mixed that is very true The Vision Pro was praised for its crisp displays minimal latency pass through mode very impressive um and hand eye control interface we already knew that the Vision Pro was going to be on the heavier end of headsets although I'm going to add a note here uh still lighter than a number of other ones um but most reviewers noted that they really uh that they really noticed the
weight especially after a few hours um due to how front heavy it is yeah the back is just the strap um a lot of other ones have either a more substantial strap or something weighing off the back so it helps counterbalance this one's weight is basically all off the front of your face uh impressions of the floating and tangable keyboard range from clunky to usable eyesight the vision uh Pros digital representation of the user's eyes on the external display is also apparently very uncanny looking in real
life yeah it looks very different I think Marquez made a big note of this it looks very very different than um the the examples in the like the I don't know what you call it product announcement trailer videos whatever uh meta likewise announced today a new update adding playback support for Apple's stereoscopic spatial video which can be recorded on iPhone 15 pro and pro Max to their own Quest headsets as well as support for using gam pads with the quest browser um I don't know who wrote
this but it says I Googled and while Vision Pro supports game pads it doesn't look like it supports the browser thing but anyway okay cool um discussion question is this the most out there Apple product launch you can remember man you sure picked a meaty topic hold on let's finish this off all right there  go oh my God I have new terms and conditions to accept okay are you ready yep I'm good oh where'd it  okay require password okay subscriptions seriously I just I just signed in uh round two oh
boy okay okay you know what it doesn't matter the point is it was there it was  good tell me something Luke In fairness to me would you have found that what would you have would you have found where to manage your subscriptions where was it it's under users and accounts and then you click on your  subscriptions where would you have looked to unsubscribe from Apple arcade I would have gone into settings would you have or would you have gone to Apple arcade uh that's a good point I would
have done settings probably I immediately went to settings when I turned it on cuz that would be where I would manage my account sure where did you subscribe to it did you subscribe to it in the Apple arcade app no I subscribed to it on my phone okay then go to setting getting subscribed to it was a pain in the butt for some reason I forget why because I didn't have an iPhone on me yeah I might go to settings then I would scroll down from here I wouldn't immediately go to users and
accounts I would scroll down and I look look look okay then I would probably go to users and accounts yeah I would want a subscriptions in that menu immediately I don't know that I would click on my user now absolutely not hon no I would I would get here and then I'd probably go and then go I must have missed something and I think that's exactly what I did too uh this doesn't look right yeah and then leave and then what you want to go into game center now now that you figured out that you need to click on
your name you go down to subscriptions okay is Game Center the thing that you were subcribe to no oh okay I don't remember what game center is it's something else entirely okay sure yeah it's like uh you can friend people and you can play mobile games together or something like that I I can't remember exactly what it does or ever or did so  conclusion I didn't find it it either moved or it was always there or it was a regional difference or it wasn't and outside of that the resources that I could find from
Apple's own website did not direct me to a meaningful way to get it cancelled so here was another person who was trying to do the same thing that I was and who was directed to this help article which included no information about how to do it on an Apple TV in order to do it on a Windows computer I needed to use iTunes and in order to access and in order to remove my credit card I needed to change my my family sharing which it didn't direct me how to do and then now I know how to do I
actually had no idea that you have to do that by signing into iCloud which is great never have done that now I know that um so I retract what I said about it not being there I maintain what I said about it not not immersed in the Apple ecosystem just to balance the tables out should you show your windows search thing no it doesn't matter okay that was I was just meing with you guys it pretty fun I searched for uh I searched for sleep because uh I just reformatted my desktop um just to just to to make it
clear that I hate Windows just as much as I hate anything that Apple does I I searched for sleep in the start menu because I wanted to tell my computer not to go to sleep cuz sometimes I need to remote into my workstation I just reformatted and the result was I can I can show on my oh if if you have it up then by all means go ahead and share it no so this isn't the exact same so if I search it on my laptop it shows view recent sleep time and then Sleep Country Canada in his example view
recent sleep time was not there uh it was it was just Sleep Country Canada so if he typed sleep and then quickly pressed enter it would have just it would have just like Googled Sleep Country Canada if I is hilarious if I send this to you Dan can you put it on screen uh yes I should be able to okay uh how do I send it to you in a convenient way teams oh okay then you already have it cuz it's in the topic approval chat Oh no you're not in the topic approval chat okay all right I
will I will send this to you this is wo crew yeah I don't know I I'll send it to wo crew Sleep Country Canada yeah you should probably buy a mattress somewhere else I did nice if you live up here that's a jingle you know just how it works well I think they have the same jingle in the US oh but it was like Sleep Country USA and I I heard it once when I was like South of the Border that seems not fair I was like what yeah yeah one County Valley yeah it feels gross I don't like that yeah it's R
jingle image button file not found I know I didn't attach a file I know what I'm doing I don't know In fairness to Apple it was like the middle of the night when I was trying to do this too and I think that a lot of my frustration was already teed up from trying to get signed into that bloody thing without an iPhone um which was a really frustrating experience as well in iTunes there's no way to manage your family group by the way so that was really annoying I I just it
was a more frustrating experience than in my opinion it should be I don't think subscriptions should be buried anywhere I think they should be super super easy to find speaking of which I need to cancel my subscription um because you just started one yeah cuz I just started it again I've got the uh the picture ready I played fantasian exactly the number of times I need to play it which is 9099 times I only haven't finished the second the the third phase of the final boss I got through you played it 0 N9
times yeah oh like played it through yeah oh I'm just going to fade it in there you go there you go that is the result for sleep on my brand new windows install it tries to auto correct it to Sleep Country Canada and it best matches  absurd I hate current year that's absurd settings NightLight really that's the setting they got rid of this computer so you can't search this computer why is it nested why is that nested Dan I don't know I hate it how is this this bad I wish I could pay
more for no ads there should be no ads in Windows I mean especially because we do pay for it yeah this is unbelievable the fact that everyone knows what a complete useless meme Windows searches and the fact that it doesn't improve indicates that this is Microsoft's desired behavior for it yeah to me and there's a whole there's so many settings in Windows dedicated to sleep yeah like so many like how about sleep yeah yeah yeah now I'm angry that's a bug check windows admin I don't believe you I've
seen it on basically every Windows machine I've touched in the last few years I it's if it's a bug it's one that exists on purpose at this point I'm sorry not even shopping for a mattress  Intel uh all right yeah advertise better nerds all right app uh Apple Vision Pro I did the intro I want to try it I haven't I haven't gotten a chance to yet the thing is Apple only seeds to media that they get along with which I you know is a thing um and being in Canada and not being one of the first
people to click the button um our unit isn't arriving until I think Monday so I haven't tried it yet I the way that the way that it looks to me from the outside I've actually tried not to find out too much like I just sometimes I can't help it and I'll click an article and I'll read some of it or I just yeah mostly that um or I did I did watch the one apple uh promotional video where she's like packing for a trip or something like that and she's wearing a Vision Pro headset for some reason
uh so I have been exposed to some stuff but I've been trying to keep my reactions as raw as possible because we're going to shoot a short circuit on Monday when it comes in and then after that my main mission I think is going to be to figure out how to use it as a non-apple user I've certainly had my frustrations using the Apple products that I do daily Drive I mean I've talked about this one before but you know there's absolutely no way to update the firmware on airpods without 
cannot that's sick not through iTunes not through iCloud this one I'm sure about you simply can't um and and there's also features that are extremely inconvenient or impossible to change depending on how uh like I think there's third party apps that have managed to uh you know change what the press does and stuff like that oh except if you have an iPad oh I'm sorry a big iPhone will also  um apparently you better have an iPhone or you won't be able to use the Vision Pro properly I think I have a 13 pro at
home somewhere I will have to check  um no I don't have it I used to be a big like always two phones guy like I'd have one in my side pocket one in my back pocket and over the years I found that whether I'm on an iPhone or whether I'm on an Android phone I just don't really need it anymore either of them can kind of do everything and people who have this kind of super intense brand loyalty one way or the other I think they just haven't I think they just haven't tried the other in a while so the one way or
the other is an important point because run Jun just said in phpl chat I can't update my Samsung earbuds on my iPhone either really what about on a computer I don't know you can only do it on an Android device that's they they didn't say that they didn't say that don't don't hamburger this hot dog okay they they can't on an iPhone  iPhone sheesh can you can you do airpods on a PC or Android no no you can't um we'll see if they respond you can but you have to install Samsung's iTunes
okay no that's a joke very funny you guys yeah you have to use their wear app a handyman said well that is equally stupid and I hate it just as much yeah all right what else we got uh did we talk enough about Vision Pro oh right yeah so I'm trying to figure out what it's for it's obviously not for gaming I think it's monitor "replacement sure so it's a $3,500" "monitor it's a $3,500 monitor that you" could have in scenarios but you can't have a monitor yeah I think is is it I
mean one of the ideas I had for the video was just yeting the monitor off my desk at work and only using the Vision Pro as a monitor I think you should use it in more scenarios than that I think you should have uh like ifon drive the car M and you work work on your laptop I thought you were going to say and wear the Vision Pro no okay yeah I mean based on their low latency pass through it feels like that might be possible um but I'm not suggesting that you do it I think that might also be literally
illegal I would think so I would hope so to be honest um but uh yeah no uh if you're going on a trip sometime wear it on a plane and have set up a bunch of monitors instead of your laptop and see if it's interestingly productive um and I can only use it with a Macbook right is that true well I'm already I'm already preparing myself to go back to the MacBook Return of the Mac once again I mean MacBooks are kind of killing it right now oh I mean yeah no no question it's just yeah and you know what's
really really interesting I think if you were to plot the amount of time that it takes me to go from completely fresh install first time I've seen the desktop to my computer is fully set up and I can do everything I need on it it would look like this when I that fresh format I was ready to do basic things on it in about 4 minutes oh and I was and I'm and I'm ready to do pretty much any and I'm talking drivers are installed so so not that and then beyond that probably about
another 10 minutes and I can do 98% of what I need to do on it and there's there's things that I would set up on my personal machine uh or there's tinkery things that obviously I haven't bothered with like uh I okay I want to play around with nvidia's AI HDR conversion Tom Foolery and yeah sure that's the kind of thing that obviously takes a little bit longer to get everything dialed in exactly how you like it but that computer was completely usable for me to do my job in like 15 minutes yeah
and that's assuming that the writing team keeps using the office suite instead of switching over to Google Docs which is something that we may do in the near future so having just gone through  going okay uh what exactly would prevent me from using a Macbook then CU almost all of it is either cloud-based or something that I could easily install on a Mac it's not like teams doesn't exist for Mac yeah seems makes me want to throw it through a wall anyway so maybe I should do the
Apple challenge again maybe maybe I should just switch maybe why am I as much as I don't want to I know it would be fine for me I work almost exclusively in browsers why would it matter for me well you'd go to do a thing and you'd be like why can't I do this thing it'll happen I'm sure it'll happen yeah for work though honestly like one of the ones that drove me crazy last time was how poorly it handles ma network drives it was just a nightmare so stupid no why don't you get a thunderbolt why don't
you get Thunderbolt like no Thunderbolt is a stupid solution for uh for that like direct attached storage in general is just a stupid solution I'm sorry I'm completely over it um apparently by the way someone did drive with the Apple Vision Pro and did get pulled over and got arrested well pulled over at least why does that not surprise me that's fun um I'm being told that you can only do one monitor replacement with it um I know I saw people with more than that of screen so maybe you can do one monitor
replacement and then other apps around it um why on Earth would they care how many monitors you replace with it I guess it would have it would come down to how Mac OS handles maybe display management or something I have no clue which was awful last time I used it by the way was just like terrible like just clone window just clone Arrow snap I'm talking specifically for the laptop usage by the way yeah oh okay when I'm saying I I'm sure I'd be fine on a MacBook I'm saying just to replace the
laptop that I have oh I see I see I would still need the desktop 100% right okay okay okay I understand yeah I would be going just I use a Macbook now yeah see that's that's a little bit more drastic if I was just replacing my laptop genuinely I think it would be completely fine um yeah okay so apps can be the other ones you can only screen share one MacBook screen and uh that's at 1440p apparently that's that's what Chad's saying I mean that seems F which I believe yeah and Matt who was doing monitor
replacement uh Matt from the lab's web development team who was doing monitor replacement um sometime last week with a quest had three monitors on the quest so it is kind of a weird limitation and I wonder if you're right I wonder if it's something to do with Mac OS I don't know no idea I mean these are all things that I guess I'm going to get to discover because the the main question right because everyone and their dog who's oh it's based on the display yeah see I I don't know don't don't don't take the
things that I'm reading from chat is like 100% fact it's just interesting to discuss everyone on their dog who's Mac friendly has already looked at this thing so if we're going to make a video about it it has to be from the angle of okay but hold on a second what if you're more like me should this be interesting to you at all or should you be just be waiting for a second or third generation clone from a PC company that kind of works or something yeah and I think the answer is going to be you don't need to
care about this right now unless you're willing to switch into the ecosystem so then my question becomes is it worth it they're asking for a pretty big outlay yeah I mean it's that being said I think they're going to have a bunch of tech people that are going to be happy to jump into it wasn't Google last like "$1,000 something like that I forget what" Google Glass uh Google Glass announcement price I I find people have a very intriguing amount of money whenever there's
something interesting to buy yeah it was "$1,000 and do you remember how many" people were wearing Google Glass at CES that year everywhere they were freaking everywhere and I just I couldn't believe it I was like I bought one of these because it's my job I used it for a while and was like okay I have used it now it's pretty useless and now it goes in a pile and how are you people still wearing these I don't understand this and then by the following year all of the we're gone I don't' in chat is
"saying $1,000 is way different than" "$3,500 yeah yeah for sure sure it's" still point it's it's also I would say it's still in a Range that like to spend that much money on something very fresh experimental stuff like that is wild is wild it's asking a lot both of those amounts are in the that's wild category are they the same no not at all no but like man Google Glass was only only 5 "years ago you have over $1,000 of throw" it away this might be complete trash spending money not even it might be
complete trash I don't think it's going to be trash but it might be sits in the box and doesn't get used yeah the battery man the battery life is a big concern for me I no I get that I get that you plug the pack in non removable cable on the pack not not true no it's removable it it turns out it's like a jumbo lightning connector or something it's kind of like the non- removable cable on that iMac that we easier live on the as far as my understanding goes you just stick a thing in a hole and it pops out oh
that's awesome I'm actually really happy about that that makes me feel better about the world lightning I mean it also just didn't need to be lightning at all um but hey whatever it's lightning so that's something yeah 5 years ago was definitely not correct oh yeah no that wasn't 5 years ago hold on a second okay what is this why am I was it longer than that oh no no no no no no this is Enterprise sorry this is Enterprise Edition 2 announced for $9.99 in 2019 hold on hold on
Enterprise Edition Google Glass here we go it was "$1,500 in 2013 yeah it was 10 years ago"  guys I'm excited for the display supposed to be amazing out of everything I care about I think that's the one I care about most cuz that means for all the headsets and if I could just use my Windows computer with that display that would kind of be my ideal while I wait for and that would also be a way that I could kind of justify it as  because that oh no even then like that's  monitor I do think a lot of yeah
traveling tech people will find a legitimate way to justify it yeah it's going to be T man dude it's going to be tough at work too though CU even just for privacy reasons I work collaboratively with people a lot yeah you do what am I going to I know I know well yeah but I'm reviewing it so I'm trying to think like what the heck am I going to use this thing for I don't think it's for you to be completely honest I mean I want to like it actually I'm excited about it I think I think
this particular device is going to be great for you that being said I do think you'd be able to see if had value for other people I don't think you're like not an applicable person to review it to be clear I just don't think it's like okay here's one thing I'm not going to get any calls on FaceTime I don't know anybody with an iPhone yeah that's one of the reasons why it wouldn't be for you but well yeah but so I how am I even going to how am I even going to applicable anything like I just sit in a
chair and pretend you're on a plane yeah I mean yeah okay obviously but like you can do it I believe I I know I I know I can you do it I know I can sit in a  s Welches you you weles they got a great one all right no but like yeah I think I think it's the the the price tag is a big hold back for the vast majority of people right it's going to be a huge issue we were just talking about the price of gpus earlier "a VR headset for $3,500 I mean we were" we were boing at VR headsets that were
less than a thousand not that many years ago now it's 3500 bucks that's obviously crazy I think there's going to be a market of people that are interested in it literally no people that have already  it yeah oh no no not me I thought you were saying you do too and then I realized that you were saying I don't know anybody but I know other people as well um multiple actually um and pretty much all of them are unanimously saying monitor replacement not at my desk so they're not trying to replace their
currently existing multim monitor setup but they are trying to make it so that that's a really ex that's a really extravagant I'm writing my novel in the Starbucks and I want to do it like like nextg yep accessory absolutely it's going to have to get a lot more useful than that yeah for the vast majority of "people yes they they had 200,000" pre-orders and they're going to sell a bunch more I guarantee  honestly straight up if meta released the exact same headset at the exact same
quality people would tell them they were idiots yeah but then hey maybe their stock would go maybe boners like it did at today or yesterday or something like that it went developers yeah meta is going like wild like if it was Windows base I think developers would hop on that within an hour what happened I forget this is the 5 day this is the five day it's their it's their year efficiency or whatever I don't know who knows it's the stock  omx oh man okay cool earnings apparently
they declared a oh they declared a dividend on the stock so owning it means you like get money instead of just you only get money when you sell okay all right that makes sense okay  um what what else have we got here do you want to talk about the AI poisoning tool yeah I thought this was something different until I read it in the dock and now I'm like way more interested I didn't bother read into this I'm going to run to the washroom while you go through it I've already read it sure uh
I didn't bother read into this earlier in the week because I assumed it was like is it on that one yeah I assumed that it was um just like you know a way to jailbreak AI that we've had forever and people just bought it for whatever reason but that's not it that's not it at all it is way cooler than that a team at the University of Chicago released their new free AI poisoning tool called Nightshade it was downloaded at least "250,000 times in the first 5 days" Nightshade is intended to disrupt uh art
generation models that scrape art without permission by identifying the subject of the image then applying a tag EG that subtly Alters the image at the pixel level so other AI programs see something totally different than what's actually there interesting gradually this will poison the ai's training data by making it misclassify the original images and therefore generate confused muddled hallucinated images the changes Nightshade makes are reportedly more robust than watermarks as the effect
remains even when the image is screenshotted cropped uh compressed or even filtered the the same team has previously released a separate program called glaze intended to confuse AI training algorithms so they interpret the imagees having a completely different style than it actually does they recommend using both together for the best effect there's a discussion question which I guess is Dan and I now can we expect the notion of copyright to change in the AI era and how uh because
you know everything is eventually made using tools that involve some kind of AI trained on some other type of copyrighted material etc etc etc um yeah I don't know all I know is I  um I find the the tool war of AI to be an extremely interesting thing I wish I had read into this more so before the show because I think it's super interesting and I will do so I will I will dive further into it after the show there is a really cool um page just night shade. cs. chicago.edu what
is. HTML I might as well do the whole thing and they have a whole write up um talking about it you should check that out if you are interested super cool I love this kind of stuff fantastic I like that if you if you don't want your stuff shared you have some tools in order to uh you know make it worse which is great very good is that Miss vickies yeah we have Miss vickies now yeah I've had Miss vickies for ages I don't usually look at the snacks that's cool though Miss vickies are great chips yeah
a good chips this is not an ad for Miss vickies nope not even a little nope um they'll kill you yeah see if it was an ad they wouldn't let me say that yeah yeah it's amazing how many people think like we have secret sponsorships and stuff that are not disclosed when we will when we will say stuff that's just like clearly you don't know anything about working with sponsors there is there is absolutely no way any brand would have you say anything like that in a video that Mon oh boy
um some uh actually somewhat interesting AI news this week Google uh the B chatbot can now use Google's own image in two model to generate images congratulations you're slowly uh feature matching other things um generative AI chat is being added to Google Maps uh awesome that's great now it's probably going to direct me to the wrong place some percentage of the time because of hallucinations I don't want that at all uh Amazon announced Rufus a chatbot oh the rip rofus USB uh announced Rufus a
chatbot in beta that will help customers shop on the platform maybe you'll be able to find TVs more easily um and apple according to Tim Cook apple is putting a tremendous amount of time and effort into Ai and plans to share more details later this year that's a okay uh perhaps something related to their published paper about getting llms running locally on iPhones that would actually be cool that would actually be sweet that would make buying an iPhone significantly more intriguing in my
Apple's been putting neural processing into their into their apple system or do they call iPhone silicon Apple silicon I can't remember but anyway their a Ser chips for quite some time now so I see no reason why they couldn't do this having a local llm on there would be fantastic because loal Siri would be useful yeah maybe that's true that would be nice I mean they could have done that without it being local though and then it would be annoying and suck Universal Music Group pulls Tech pulls music off
of Tik Tok um and then spec Ops the Line was pulled off steam it's actually the second one that's a little more interesting to me but a bunch of Tik toks got muted because uh licensing negotiations broke down between umg and Tik Tok this week Imagine Tik Tok caring about that I I I I must have missed I blinked and Tik Tok went from just yeah we just use whatever music whatever we don't care we're from China and we don't care at all to now they mute licensed music um interesting anyway the critically
acclaimed 2012 game spec Ops the Line was suddenly Del listed from digital storefronts earlier this week in response to a question from The Verge 2K stated that the removal was due to the expiration of multiple partnership licenses which the ver Verge took as a reference to copyrighted music on the game's soundtrack so it's been 10 years uh 12 that's a weird expiry that is a weird one anyway the game's director Cory Davis called the removal devastating personally both for him and
the rest of the creative team and he likewise stated that this is not the end for spec Ops the Line but what future the game might have is currently unclear these kinds of Licensing issues have come up before wasn't there a GTA game that had a bunch of license music in it that had to be changed at some point not sure I'm not sure if I I'm not sure if I I'm going to be able to remember exactly what it was but I know we've definitely seen stuff like that before that's Cory
B uh GTA 4 apparently yeah Vice City oh okay apparently there is GTA 4 Vice City fun fact I haven't actually played  I played a bunch of one that came out for Android I forget which one it was it was three maybe uh on my Nvidia Shield but I didn't beat it I think I beat five cancel them boys yeah I know but that would have happened like almost 10 years ago so I don't know it's been too long to really remember I didn't beat anyone's other than five I don't think but I haven't played any GTA
game in a hot minute so I'm not sure Mafia I I actually liked the mafia games more yeah that's on my list of I need to get around to this at some point cuz Mafia 2 remastered came out a little while ago and apparently just flipping awesome so yeah I liked Mafia too um finally Edge got caught stealing Chrome tabs yeah what is this an edge feature that allows it to import data from other browsers has gotten more aggressive much to the surprise of several users including Tom Warren from
The Verge who found that after their most recent Windows update Edge opened automatically with all the tabs from their default browser Chrome one user had even uninstalled Edge and deleted all of its app data only to have it open with all his Chrome tabs imported after an update so that's bad uh time for Wow after dark yeah have you noticed teams is just like ignoring default browser stuff yes I have that's over the last couple weeks I guess right I think it I think it might have gained a setting
where you can now set teams' default browser to something that isn't Edge but when it first happened I don't think that that was possible which is awesome awesome and then people are having we're we're we're slowly there's going to be notes in the Monday morning meeting about this uh for people that work at the company but we're slowly working on a migration and it will be announced as a full migration on Monday to everyone in the company using teams for meetings instead of Google meet
through calendar and in doing that we've been finding a lot of problems with  meetings ah team has also been especially having trouble the last week or so I think it is so maybe that's it and maybe it'll get better let's hope I wouldn't count on that  yeah yeah anyways after dark sure let's see what we got hi lldd you've spoken of the difficulties running video hosting Services think there's a wisdom to be gleaned from the older sites for example new grounds on track to 30 years of Hosting user
content actually we were having a fun conversation right before the show started about uh twitch and the no good very bad week that they've had um pokem Mane announced that she's no longer exclusive she will stream wherever she pleases um and you know obviously Pokemon pokem Main's not the biggest Creator on the platform but she's certainly a prominent one and she's just one of many prominent creators who have left or uh or or multistream now to forms such as YouTube and kick and
um you know part of the conversation around you know oh how could they let pokem man go or whatever is probably going to end up coming around to money and uh Luke came across a calculator that I think you guys might find very interesting can I switch over to your screen yeah so the calculation that I have on screen is roughly for this show on public channels so I think there was like 2000 and something on Twitch there "was is like almost 13,000 or something" on YouTube and then I threw in 20 for
good measure cuz Facebook exists um and I did the standard plan cuz I don't know whatever there isn't a big difference between standard and Basics I did standard and then 1080p CU that's what we're streaming in I'm saying the W show is roughly 4 hours we have that many viewers uh and this is average viewers so I did 100% of the stream because I don't have the total amount of viewers in order to give a lower percentage so we did 100% of the stream and uh yeah "$8,000 now this isn't some number that"
Luke pulled out of his butt no this is from Amazon's actual cost estimator this is Amazon IVs cost estimator this is the thing that kick uses and and twitch yeah effectively yeah this is someone mentioned pirate software yeah i' had seen this before but I saw his thing on this uh and that reminded me of this site which is why I showed lus He's Pirate software is really cool but um yeah then I looked over here and was like how many people are alive right now on these different different websites so
let's go uh 3262 channels yeah let's let's play a game let's let's play a game 3262 channels oh that's a big number um and let's go viewers right now uh what's there like Aver let's kind of let's kind of we's kind of eyeball this let's eyeball this grab grab halfway up a slope they look like halfway up a slope is around here actually okay uh maybe even higher this is this is fairly low as far as I can for average let's say  then okay and then let's um that's all yeah that's all the time but that's not
4 hours that's all day ah yes now obviously they would have volume discounts probably very significant ones mhm obviously this is marked up this is not Amazon's raw cost to to run twitch oh and twitch is has I mean way higher numbers let's have a look at what twitch's numbers look like two 2.2 "million viewers and 140,000 channels do" we even want to input this this number obviously means nothing just to be very clear it's just fun uh don't take don't don't take this too seriously um but
it's it's entertaining to throw it in the calculator anyways um for a day um obviously this is not representative for like a billion different reasons so again don't run for 727 billion different reasons but obviously doesn't cost that much but the point is that it doesn't make sense to give gigantic payouts to streamers to stream on your platform when streaming is expensive when those are the only ones that you're making money on anyway um and you are you you basically been operating at a loss from
the moment you acquired this company until now with absolutely no end in sight for it operating at a loss uh the only reason kick exists at all is that it's just gambling money yeah so yeah then you throw like uh Amazon Prime free subscriptions into the pile as well like Dam so a lot of people have asked us hey float plane why are you guys like slacking why don't you like have a free tier and why don't you do more on streaming and do this and do that because because we don't cuz we
don't like putting money in a fire yeah streaming streaming we we offer streaming on Flow plane but it's like it's it's an Avenue that I honestly wish we never went down uh we can't take it back now but I wish I mean we can yeah but we shouldn't we shouldn't um and yeah it's it's rough what what I like in my head kind of wish we did was was just develop a live chat that detects if uh a twitch or YouTube or whatever else stream is live then generates a subscriber only live chat
for you or something like that I don't know um but I mean we did it it's here now so we te we we do the streamings um and it's just it's a fun it's a fun calculator to to to play with I guess yeah uh it's it's rough too because something that was actually very surprising to me using the steaming uh streams charts site I don't know how accurate it is I just found it uh today but stream charts Twitches was really "high right 140,000 channels 2.2 million" viewers this was surprising to
me yeah YouTube is lowkey kind of a big deal it turns out I didn't think for live streaming though dude I didn't think they'd have like twice the viewers dude it's YouTube wow everyone who's like yeah man like you know rumbles you know YouTube YouTube sucks it's we're going to YouTube is just unfathomably powerful they they peaked what is is this yesterday 7 days ago they peaked at 8 million viewers yeah they don't they don't they don't need to they don't need to offer giant
packages to prominent streamers they don't need to I mean they can if they feel like it but they also just don't need to yeah that's wild cuz like I was looking at our numbers and we had yeah "13,000 Live on YouTube and then 2900 on" on Twitch um I don't know why anyone's watching on Twitch uh Colton insisted on turning the ads back on so that's why they're back on nice so you should just good watch on float plane or watch on YouTube or watch on Facebook apparently cuz that's a thing
yeah yeah I don't know it's just it's an interesting it was a it was a fun dive uh because I yeah yeah it's just a fun dive seeing the numbers of these companies is interesting and you know you know there's going to be like insane volume discounts especially when you start getting to the numbers that we were talking about like it's going to be a totally different world um but it's still interesting to see it's a lot of money being pumped through IVs yeah this is uh this is from Arcane
canand on Twitch uh twitch no longer offers big streamer contracts because Dan Clancy said I can tell you the cost of retaining those streamers would have been far more than the revenue generated that is something we've been very clear about we don't want to do that because the only way to do that then is to have this imbalance where we make up for that on smaller streamers yeah makes a ton of sense yep yeah yeah it's pretty wild um and like it's it's an interesting the streaming
economy in general is really interesting because there's all these companies just losing money Handover Fist and then the viewers and a lot of the streamers uh are really mad because the viewers are angry because uh sites like twitch are inputting more ads or making different viewing experiences uh worse in certain ways or potentially pressing the creators that they like so they're mad for the creators to do like their own transcoding or whatever else we've seen um and a lot of the creators want to
make more money because obviously why not why would you want to make more money everyone wants to make more money um but all all the money is being burnt so I don't know it's interesting VC money is a hell of a  yeah more questions yeah during a CPU upgrade the IHS was melted into the copper plate on the cooler half the pins were bent when I removed it from the motherboard uh what is the worst thing that has happened to you during a CPU upgrade that shouldn't be possible that
thing yeah that doesn't make much sense I mean the worst it's happened to me is  it worst thing I happen had happen was I was handling a hard drive while doing uh some work on my mineral oil computer and my hand was oily and it went nice and there was nothing coming off that drive from there on was unfortunate just went to Facebook and it has 29 viewers so I underestimated I'm sorry I apologize sry I guessed 20 I didn't count nine of you y was your mom one of the ones you didn't
count she actually genuinely probably   suspect okay next up Hi l l Dean I work for a major general contracting firm and we are seeing some amazing technology come into construction do you think at a certain point technology usage will Plateau in skilled labor jobs no not personally it'll just get faster more efficient until we can like just there's a building there's going to be some amount of progress hey lldd I'm an ICU nurse and have long enjoyed watching your videos ever had a negative Tech related
Healthcare experience the amount of tech we use just to keep one person alive is wild I haven't had too many Healthcare experiences personally um so no I can't say I've had a negative Tech related experience uh my only negative one was uh the ultrasound machine uses Windows CE and it was hilarious watching it boot into Windows I had a a friend who is an MRI service technician um and passed away over the covid period um and was working like insane hours because of covid stuff and just talking to
him the fact that all that stuff works in the song and dance that it has to work in is is pretty impressive it people that work for hospitals good job I think they're um they're nearly classed as biomedical Engineers is that I don't I didn't ask them yeah yeah I mean it kind of depends I know that some of them are like if you want to think about it as it for hospitals but you need a special engineering degree just to just to serve as a cow or something it's kind of ridiculous a computer on Wheels
sorry okay sorry sorry it's like a computer on a cart they call it a cow not like veterinarian Tech was I need an engineering we're jumping to vets now no no sorry sorry yeah yeah sounds good hi dll do you figure wearing the Steve shirt dur during an apple interview for senior software engineering Position  negative that's interesting actually I think it's going to depend on your interviewer they a lot of it comes down to that yeah you don't have to tell them where it's from um but I think I
think if they don't recognize the stoil of it they uh probably aren't paying very close attention so then it would be neutral and if they do recognize it I would say most people would probably think it's kind of cool that you have you know a Steve style shirt just don't tell them you got it from LT store yeah probably yeah I just might not mention that yeah if they ask just say mac address yeah it does have macad dress branding on it all right let's see if I can get this one right hello DUS nuke and Lan Mr
lefar lraf when picking back up an old project that was untouched for months what do you do to regain interest in continuing and remembering what you have made that's that's all that's the story of my life oh God that's all IDE I'm glad it was just Luke preemptive work um right you got to try to leave good crumbs for yourself I have a piece of my uh I have a piece of my motorbike sitting in our sand blasting thing right now still uh yes still Yes wasn't that started years ago well no no no well h
no okay it was started a year ago Oh I thought it was way and I only put it in the sand blaster a week ago and then I had to have tinan help me because the bottom had to be taken out so that it could fit enough that I could actually get the gun and the hoses and everything to the right places on it any who uh the point is um I I I put things in organized piles I label and I make notes for myself this is why I said preemptive work like oh my God it took me 2 and a half hours
to change the windshield wipers on my tyan the other night why you're either going to love my reason or you're going to hate it okay so here's the thing if you buy the full assembly I think it costs somewhere in the neighborhood of like 20 to $50 depending on the car and the bottle year and whatever else okay so it comes with stop I just stop I love it though okay so it comes with the the like the plastic and metal thing and then there's like a clip and it goes into the thing you can get OEM ones from the
manufacturer or you can get third party ones as long as they have the right compatibility type or whatever else  um the more economical way and you can get these uh for as little as like a few dollars in some cases is to slide out the actual rubbers and buy new rubbers and put them in uh in my case I went with silicone blades um because they have good performance characteristics and they last a long time and I was having a heck of a time as it turns out there's not a lot of people who there's
not a lot of people who drive taans um so the resources for you know DIY um DIY projects on them are relatively limited and the resources around trying to save $13 on your tyan are especially limited so what I was searching for someone who makes just the rubber component just the rubber strips that can be can be installed on a tyan and then just swapped out just that part um anyway I ended up with this article that was like the top five windshield wipers for the tyen as it turns out they
hadn't tried installing any of these apparently because I ordered I ordered one of them where the pro one of the pros was that they sell just the replacement rubber strips I was like great so that's good I will put on aftermarket holders once and then every other time after that I won't have to throw away that whole assembly creating a bunch of unnecessary waste and I'll save a buck it'll be awesome so they clearly never tried it I ordered them they didn't fit at all like it was
immediately obvious that they wouldn't fit credit to the uh store I ordered from I wish I could shout them out they have a compatibility stage in their order fulfillment and they actually they ask you your car when you order windshield wipers and they messaged me they were like hey we noticed this isn't compatible like officially so if you know something we don't know then go ahead and click this button and then you can't return them I was like okay fair enough so they arrived they don't fit at
all and cool cool of them though yeah yeah that's very very cool of them and so I'm kind of sitting here going okay but I need new windshield wipers H what can I do get this the OEM Porche assembly other than having this weird little aerodynamic blade or something that comes out the other side so so it's got like it's a shape like this it's like this like this and then there's a third one and then it comes out like that it's like from profile profile view of the thing it has a fin that sticks
out the other side that doesn't go against the windshield and I don't know whatever who cares other than that thing the actual profile of the rubber identical sort of get to that um so that got me thinking huh maybe instead of putting on the third party assembly and then swapping the rubbers on that I could just take the rubbers out of my third party assembly and then I can just order more of them after if I can figure out how to get them into the OEM wiper blade assembly Well that took a while first I
had to figure out how to disassemble the Porsche wiper blade which it was very obvious to me it has this plastic end cap that had some wiggle in it so it clearly clicked on at some point as it turns out not designed to come off it's not designed to come off at all there's absolutely nothing you can do no amount of prying and I fixed anything under get it off the only way I could get it off was to just forcibly rip the old rubber blade out and then there are two metal strips that sandwich it and as
soon as you uh take the blade out you can move them together and you can pop the end off so so the way the assembly process works is they put it together and click on but there's there's no way to remove them these These are at both ends that was only part of the battle I had to figure out how to hold these two stupid strips together while I fed the other thing through it turns out that is not the way to do it the best way to do it is actually to put the rubber thing into one and then put the
other one on and then click the middle and then slide on these two little retaining clips and then pop the end caps on uh but this is all trial and error because I can't find any resources for how to rebuild no one's ever done this a por stupid OEM wiper blade thing so I don't know what my hourly rate is but whatever it is that was the world's most expensive windshield wiper change i' I've only changed I'm too cheap to generally do it so I've only ever changed windshield wipers once and
it was on my current car you live in Vancouver yeah it's fine oh my God no it isn't it's bad for your wind Shield it'll scratch it up windshield's fine so I've done it once uh I didn't know there was insert things but I assumed so I went to Canadian Tire and asked for them they said they don't exist they they didn't they didn't tell me that they don't have them they said they don't exist and then I said okay what one of these things do I need for my car and the guy handed me one I went
outside it was clearly incorrect I came directly back inside cuz my plan was just swap it in the parking lot like I don't care yeah um you were talking about opening the mattress and Stu the parking lot but absolutely I was doing maintenance on my car in the parking lot um I go back inside I'm like this is wrong and they're like you can't return it so I ended up spending if we're talking about hourly rate longer than it was worth convincing them to take it back and they did eventually take it
back and then I bought the right one which I just figured out by Googling um and then finally swapped it and that was actually I mean other than debating with them about how I should be able to return something if they were literally the ones that told me it would work whatever um it ended up being very easy yeah took me like 45 seconds oh yeah no I know how easy it's supposed to be um anyway I learned something and now all I have to do is order the replacement rubbers which required some modification
by the way because the way they click into the the the third party assembly uh there's a a little um indentation in the molding at the end where two little metal hooks kind of grab onto it that doesn't exist on the Porsche one cuz that has end caps so I have to cut that off but that's fine because they're actually about a half an inch too long anyway so I just cut that part off as long as yeah as long as I get a nice clean cut um they work great I rexed my windshield I put on my new windshield
wipers and it's like dead silent everything removed I'm very happy there's some kind of um there's something in either the rubbers or something that causes a metallic residue on your fingers never figured that out that formed that formed at some point most likely carbon or graphite uh lubricant why would that be on um why would that be on there to help you get it in yeah oh okay all right cool un ironically Luke yeah know I know I know stop that that cheesy little grin you put that
away that would be that would be my anyways someone asked if I made a a guide now that I have figured it out the answer is no I I didn't it was very late by the time I was done maybe next time you know I'll upload a YouTube short be fun yeah that would be a fun like Channel lonus tries to changes windshield wipers like saving saving $10 by spending hundreds of dollars worth of hours and that's the whole premise of the channel yeah that'd be sweet yeah I'd watch it you know what I'd watch it
too you'd have two viewers yeah I mean man it's like I I you know I've got a I've got a button fell off of this shirt and the only way to get a new button is to like travel to Pakistan to the factory where they made it see that would be awesome I would love that not even sort of worth it not only are you like spending more money to love this I would definitely watch this series that' be sweet that would be so sweet oh I I do probably have security footage of me doing this hold on a second oh
man that's how we resurrect Channel super fun fun that's channnel super frustrating yeah new but it's fun for the viewer "wasting $30,000 of my time to save" 65 I mean I've done that before on my car where the part that I'm trying to change is like $4 and then it takes me 15 hours to change the part but that's like doing maintenance and Mercedes would charge me I think the last one I did was like six grand cuz you have to take the dashboard out oh my God and but if you know how to do it you can do it
by crawling underneath with a pair of a couple pliers and and redo it uh so you don't have to take anything out but it does take ages so basically you're saying you want to be the host of this channel no no no I'm saying that's a reasonable way to save thousands of dollars what you're doing is not like replacing a button and you have to go to Pakistan or like you know but I I mean stuff like that is um the consumables can get really expensive and it's unnecessary as well what night did I do this was a while
back why is this why is this yeah see Coburn gets it it's not about the wipers it's about not letting them win yeah I am I am so for that mindset yeah that's one of the reasons I respect lonus so much is cuz he does like that it's awesome like yeah I don't care how much your car costs I'm not spending I already bought the car yeah yeah yeah that's exactly why I don't want to spend more there's already a perfectly fine wiper assembly and there's obviously like a consort uh it's
like light bulbs right they all got together and they're going to go okay well these these wiper blades are going to fail how much how much material science and experience have you uh had in the world with every single car ever having wiper blades and you can't make  months I have very strong feelings about a lot of things that lonus is describing that he did so I'm like  too oh you know what I can figure out when I effectively stalled for time yet no no I can I can figure out when I did
this because I created a dock for myself so okay so yeah we're coming all the way back to what actually got us here Autocare car documents and tips keywords tyan car windshield wipers rainex yeah cuz you have to help find things in Google Drive because it search is so bad yeah so details hold on I created this dock January 27th so okay that'll help me narrow down where exactly I need to go to to find my little project so yeah we were talking about how you pick up the the merch message from half an hour
ago was we were talking about how you repick up projects or tasks or whatever that you've put down for a significant period of time and the the core idea was that it's all in in the preemptive work it's all in the work that you do while you're already working on that project and that is generally uh note taking organization planning stuff like that I don't know what lonus is trying to do um and you can extrapolate this to things that aren't serious as well so you should do this for things that are
serious I think we want to switch to yeah go ahead oh no that's the wrong one uh that one so there it is that's how to do it yeah give yourself notes keywords are key uh here also uh here I  yeah this is such a low Tech  here reading researching inspecting so we're like nearly an hour   this is the most ADHD thing I think I've ever seen okay I think by this point I have switched to rainx so uh it's about an hour and a half yeah that's not too bad actually I was so frustrated because
like it shouldn't be that hard it's a little plastic clip it can't be that hard to but if I break it well I'm I I have to buy a whole new one and I'm not going to have new windshield wipers on my car tonight and I can't put my old ones back on because I ripped the rubbers off so unless I can get it apart I got no way to put it back together you know do you know uh darus yeah yeah yeah at the at the whale land that we had in the lab Warehouse uh that night was a very interesting night for a few people I
ended up I think staying there in gaming no I I think I went to go sleep for a I don't remember what happened to me um my dad stayed up all night and then went and uh taught a plumbing lecture and then came back and kept gaming so he didn't sleep at all and darus I thought he went home to go sleep he went home remembered that his truck was like partially taken apart and like I don't remember exactly what he did he like uh repl the fuel injectors or something I don't remember what it was but he did
this like whole maintenance project on his truck for the entire duration of the night didn't sleep at all and then came back um which was why when he was in the Left 4 Dead tournament before the finals game he he he jumped out of his chair and just did a bunch of push-ups cuz he was trying to like get his blood flowing so he could wake up so he could play better absolutely mad lad I very much enjoy surrounding myself with these types of people it's very interesting life gon ninja says Luke's dad is a
machine yeah we're we we're we're convinced too yeah yeah that was a that was a heck of  weekend all right Dan hit us sure thing hey Duke Lan and dusos what are some of your favorite 4K HDR movies to show off QD OLED TVs also I watched hackers and it was ridiculously cheesy and hilarious at the same time thanks for the tip no problem uh Encanto bad ending to that movie uh absolute visual Fiesta it's so beautiful uh that's that's definitely my favorite right now I apologize if this has already been
asked but what is Linus's opinion of the Mig switch that was announced at the end of last year and is set to release this month okay this is my first exposure to the Mig switch it appears to be a uh an R4 or whatever whatever that thing was called for the DS oh this yeah I didn't know it was called that and honestly based on the website it's kind of hard to tell but  sketch what am I even looking at here is that Rasputin I don't know who it is but uh oh it is yeah it totally is yeah uh
what man what was sense with the colors what was the one before the R4 r4ds or like what what what are what are these things called just like um I don't know I don't know just like PIR pirate cartridge it's a nonh hardware modification way to flash cards flash cards okay there you go flash cart um I don't know I would be I'd be interested in trying it m switch is the only backup and development device for all switch consoles regardless of version firmware and type that's wild and requires no
installation or modification of the console just plug and play I am I'm  broken right before the new one comes out or gets announced at least yeah kind of bad timing um you know it's like yeah you can pirate games on the switch you finally um I mean if you can if you can I mean it's still cool it's still very cool cuz you can get micro SD cards that are like a terabyte right uh yeah I yeah I think so so I apparently can't buy one I go to the website oh so they either got taken down or
they're not up yet or something like that yeah one terab micro SD card is 100 bucks you pair that with this thing you got a lot of games super easy to get in China uh France apparently pretty easy Italy no problem Mexico no problem uh watch out guys something to keep in mind is that uh these can be illegal depending where you're from even if you use them for their official purpose which is to back up your own cartridges uh so yeah thoughts are Yep this is a thing that apparently exists I am very
curious to try it but I also uh does anyone have one like are you guys uh so the Canadian store doesn't work but you can go to American stores that ship to Canada oh okay yeah I'm kind of curious think this is just Shopify yeah there's just Shopify stores that shipped account got  okay yeah interesting you can get switch banned with these um says mcbaine Nintendo can ban the game's unique serial number ah very interesting I don't know I just I just buy my games guys I um I am at that era as well
yeah like I I uh I don't subscribe to Services though yeah that's fair enough yeah if I was if I wanted to if I wanted to rip off Nintendo I think uh a steam deck and emulation is probably the route I would go or a um an ally and emulation if you need the extra performance yeah yeah all right okay what else we got oh uh let's see hey lldd my wife bailed on the Pokemon friend franchise when she lost the ability to have the entire pokedex in one game what franchise do you feel has
let you down the most that's an interesting take if your tagline is you got to catch them all and then you just like you can't yeah but I pretty interesting take eventually the sheer number of Pokemon cuz they're always releasing new ones so that you have new ones to collect would have just been it would have just gotten completely unmanageable like how many are there now there's like 150 in Pokemon blue and red if I recall correctly that's right first gen is it is it 15 151 oh sorry
god5 game so maybe you are correct but in that generation there's 151 not you said the games though um5 is that what you said 1025 apparently 125 over a thousand let's say that yeah like how could you possibly hope to balance a game that has a thousand yeah playable battable Pokemon in yeah and you can put all those Pokemon in some thing called Pokemon home that I don't know anything about but I know you can put Pokemon there from all the different games yeah like that's ridiculous no I
get it um what franchise has let you down the most though I mean it's got to be Final Fantasy for me um I I loved the games and then I just didn't can I just say a company blizzard Bethesda oh also blizzard games to start with b are you off the Starfield like bandwagon now yeah okay so you're just over it yeah tried really hard you really did it was sort of admirable gave it every effort I possibly could yeah you really did it was actually kind of sad yeah sad to watch yeah yeah the disillusionment
it only comes that much stronger it was replaced with rage when you try that hard yeah like is it less of a piece of now or is it just yeah okay no cool and I have no faith that it will get cyberpunked because the problem is just  that took me they on fire tonight that took me a second these have been very high quality that was a deep cut I am a I am appreciative wow he's not there to fix it in my opinion the the problem is the company yeah and that's why I said I I wanted to say a company not a not an
individual franchise uh I don't think they're capable anymore I actually don't because you look at that you look at the trajectory ever since Oblivion and actually in my opinion every game from every franchise from Bethesda ever since Oblivion has been some form of regression and people are going to be pissed off because everyone loved Skyrim but in my opinion Skyrim was kind of the beginning of the end mhm um in in like a huge amount of different ways okay but but maybe blizzard never let you down
because hold on first of all this is a different company and also I don't agree hold on because maybe blizzard just changed their name okay have you seen this no storm gameplay reveal is this like some of the original devs or something this is folks who worked on Starcraft and Warcraft 3 uh they just oh that looks so cool they just shattered their Kickstarter seven months ago how had I never heard about this I I'm not sure how you missed this look at that micro go I love the art style yeah it's
so defined and everything's really easy to read and we've been watching this for 40 seconds and understand whats games are inly difficult to follow so so good I've never even seen this game before and I can fully understand what's going on Great Character models yeah love the UI and even like the terrain as well like the trees and all of the terrain is Great's A Lot F in really well there's a lot of really cool ideas I am I floored that you haven't seen any of this yet stormgate it's called I've maybe heard
of it but I haven't seen that video Don't pre-order you know whatever but also it seems like what they're doing is really cool so if you want to support it then is there an estimated uh I I don't remember people are talking about modded versions of the Elder Scrolls yeah but that's not the game um there's I I Skyrim modding is fantastic uh Starfield modding is uh required to even have a potential of enjoying any percentage of the game but is nowhere near as good the person who made the multiplayer mod for
Skyrim was looking into playing making a multiplayer mod for Starfield it just didn't bother his quote on it I wish I could find it he just eviscerated them yeah it was brutal like back to something that maybe doesn't suck um stormgate yeah is this the future looking at all the layoffs in the games industry looking at all the challenges facing AAA gaming and the enormous budgets required to bring the next GTA or the next Call of Duty or whatever it is to Market don't people just want fun I
strongly believe so don't people just want battle bit I strongly believe so battle bit is I still enjoy battle bit I still play every once in a while and and um love it like I where what what the heck happened to RTS yeah what it's not as it's not as profitable as a gotcha game like how did we get I think RTS is harder to continually monetize through microtransactions because people don't care as much about the Skins Luke how did we get twoing Diablos since the last RTS from blizzard
yeah how does that make any sense yeah it might be smaller teams making more bespoke things um balers is not an to not somehow Force balter's gate into this conversation and yeah it's not an RTS come on wanted to to force myself into this conversation that's one of the things that amazed me about pal world when I tried it for the first time it was just a game it's just F you push go and then you're you're playing the video game there's no uh like stuff that wastes your time um one
thing that I figured that wasted my time with the most was death stranding that was a huge unresting game same with probably Starfield as well but power world Mario the first Mario party for switch whatever whatever the name of that one is just bral just let me play the video game let me have fun please and they could have patched it so easily all they had to do was make cut scene skippable and the game would have been way better MH even even I'm going to mention bg3 now even bg3 you just hit
the right Mouse button and then the the line is gone right going from that where I can skip through dialogue really quickly or listen to it and then going to Starfield terrible I don't know stormgate will be released on Early Access through steam in 2024 uh D martines says the game is boring Bland and the main draw of Bethesda games exploration in a lively and handcrafted world was completely gone the modder Road dude I'm not going to put my heart and soul into a mod for a game as mediocre as
this get him get him w Wait February 5th no way storm Gates coming out in two days no is it really did this sneak up on me like that wait it's the second you live somewhere that isn't here it might be early access or something no no exact release date's been confirmed yet yeah it's a complex game so it may take some time blah blah blah blah yeah no no no closed beta apparently okay okay well I'm not in that but I mean I you're influential enough that I bet you could be does anyone know anyone who works
give me in there Luke wants to play I realistically won't have time but I do and you have a new computer is it working now yeah yeah okay good so it works with the side panel off um all right we we'll all right we'll it we'll let the people watch the video I've put it through some stuff though and like when it when it um I haven't recreated this scenario but when it did overheat that one time I was pushing it very hard but can you play Final Fantasy 6 I haven't tried yet I am planning on
playing tonight SL tomorrow all right cool I I gave him my manual from when I was a kid it's actually super cool yeah have you looked through have you like thumb through and stuff yet I haven't I even before I was able to play I was like we're going to look through this well that's what it used to be like cuz your parents wouldn't let you play the game all the time I also enjoy so you had to just read the manual I I enjoy tactile stuff in general but like when we were playing ano which I would still
like to play again sometime yeah yeah we should go back to our world and like you know finish figure out what the heck we were doing but uh when we were playing ano I used to take written notes on a on a like notepad um so that we could figure out what the heck we were supposed to do do next time steam has since introduced a feature that I try to be uh you told it to me through a video actually so this I learned this from you um but it's like the coolest thing ever and no one seems to know about it but
steam has a feature where if you bring up the overlay you can have notes for a game that are Cloud saved and game specific which is like the coolest thing ever um so I would have just digitized them if that feature existed back then but oh it's also a up playay game you can probably Force steam overlay onto it but not sure yeah um anyways yeah stormgate that looks sick uh I I kind of hope that the future of games is actually aiming a little bit less high on the difficult expensive things now
tell me this and still aiming really high on the fun now tell me this what if that means these small teams have to use AI That's in order to achieve their goals think I I want to get into that conversation this is dangerous you're you're asking for there's knives to my throat right now man uh the usage of AI how much you should do how much you can do all that kind of stuff is very very intrigu I don't want either of you to touch that let's have another uh let's have another merch message Black
Smoke Rise says we are never going to bed LOL I have a sign I have a sign chat we have a sign for this it's fine uh hi I've worked for my high school's it department for 3 years but I'm going to study civil engineering in college what is a good way to Market Tech skills to non-te employers uh I mean I did this I'm assuming you probably did to a certain degree as well back in the day no so I used to walk into uh most I I would try to profile places that I thought would need it work
so I wouldn't necessarily walk into a grocery store I don't know that's just an example yeah sure no chain because it's yeah no especially no chain what I would try to look for was small mom and pop probably this is the only location that exists uh medical or legal practices because just off top of my head with both of those uh tons of regulations around dat regulations data retention security for different things that's when true Crypt was super sick back in the day and nobody knew what true Crypt was so I
could basically just like get them set up with true Crypt and show them how to use it and that would be like an automatic win and I could often do that part for free yep and then get my foot in the door and be like all right now that your data is encrypted so you're not breaking a bunch of laws CU you probably work CU most of them were by the way just so you know um uh I can do more things for you going to have to pay me now but I can set you up with you know like uh data redundancy so that
remote access remote access these different types of things make it so that if this one computer dies your entire company doesn't go up in flames and you can give some um some uh uh cases of like here's an example of a company where they had a fire uh they lost all their records and they just immediately went bankrupt because they're a legal or medical thing or whatever and that like can't really happen um huge risk in legal and medical field if you don't have good insurance
though yeah uh I didn't know that back then let's move forward uh but I think that is probably a thing um I think the insurance might be on the com I don't I don't know there's some stuff this is not legal advice this is yeah this is definitely not's saying right now is the opposite of legal advice not even sort  lice find a way to communicate how being more technologically advanced can financially benefit that business the one bit I'll pitch in with this don't jargon them show them what
they can do with it yeah for real show them the result cuz they probably is a lot of these companies like they just don't know what is possible technologically and they might be able to save a bunch of their own time maybe maybe they're making enough money this is the only uh storefront they want to have uh but there's some tedium involved and if you can help them skip that tedium you might just make their life a bunch better and if you can do that at a cost that is reasonable they might run
with it all right Dan hit us hi din Duke and Lan I work with super conducting magnets that will be used in the LHC at CERN what a Chad what international project are you excited to see the outcome of that one umer how about Garbage Patch cleanup I'm going to go with that yeah there's some actually really cool things there yeah there's another really cool one that we became aware of recently uh they're finding like old sunk uh like ships and they are mapping them and then going down and
trying to retrieve the fuel from them yeah no that's cool I've heard of that before yeah not because they like need fuel for ships but that way it won't leak out into the ocean bit of a time bomb yeah yeah yeah that's really cool I want to show this really quick before we keep going I don't know if we showed this earlier but apparently stormgate it's over 2 million was raised I know you said they beat their target but like 2 million versus 100 Grand is crazy yeah people are storming the
gates to get that game Co-op yo yeah I didn't know had Co-op make games that are games everybody copy this it's good do this make it nice that's so cool just do cool things just play it's a game just make it fun no games have co-op days and it's awesome and so does bg3 all these games that I love if you have co-op in your game and it's at least decently fun I'm pretty much going to get it Slap Shot rebound yeah you know what what fun playing games with your friends yes five
5v5 or 6v6 I think it supports Slap Shot rebound is eight oh yeah I think you have to go on the bigger Arena but I think you're right yeah is freaking nuts super fun the potential to find five more friends maybe don't care if it makes the game unbalanced it doesn't matter no one cares I've heard that example from a bunch of people oh we can't like balance the single player campaign around Co-op who cares no one cares you just you just team up and then you just Avengers stomp everything you
encounter and that's fun yeah just please it's fun games are fun games are supposed to be fun anyways just make them fun move on from stormgate I'm wildly more excited now that I know it offers Co-op that's really cool Hi D I know the lab and the lonton court projects are huge but what is the next tiep for lmg growth enhancements expansions love you guys I think the main focus for us is getting the lab uh improving the lab I mean it's it's obvious that we have things to work
on WE we've had things to work on we have things to work on with that I think that it's really clear where we want to get to and there's a lot of Investments and a lot of time um that it's going to take in order to get there but that's something that I think is probably the most important thing that we are doing right now is building that database that will exist to help just demystify things and make this information that you can pull up at a moment's notice rather than
something that you have to sit through a video that clearly none of you want to  get with City with cities in the UK now increasing parking charges for EVS with the reason giving that they have higher lifetime emissions than traditional cars are we starting to see the beginning of the end for EVS no what kind of question is that e are not going anywhere I mean I do hope the plug-in hybrid model sort of takes over um I think it is a better solution for the vast majority of people with
gasoline I don't know that I'm that convinced but I mean and I with with I mean hydrogen fuel cell if it works as well as it like pie in the sky should it kind of sounds amazing um I still feel like I don't know enough about hydrogen fuel cells to talk about this to be completely honest yeah I know I know enough to know that it's on paper just outstanding because the refueling times are more like gas and the emissions are more like nothing it's super cool it absurdly expensive though
yeah but it's it's a long way it's a long way away is the biggest issue yeah H hey double hey d double hockey sticks have you ever realized in the moment I don't know there're just they're going crazy with the names all of them all of them are like this every single message is like this hey d double hockey sticks have you ever realized in the moment that you're doing something you'd remember for the rest of your life what was it uh I'm not going to repeat most of them but I I think
it's we have a bleep button I think it's an important thing to do actually not not only in the moment thing you were doing that you can't say I mean sure how else do we make more people but it's truly a noble goal I was I was thinking more like bags and a large carpet and then like a ditch yeah yeah yeah if you're using a condom it's all for [Applause] nothing yeah lonus knows how to replace rubers there still a percentage chance that it's for something um he's not wrong um anyways I think it's actually
very important and valuable to you as a person to not not necessarily even when you're in the exact moment but when you're in a period of time when you're like recognizing I will at some point in time look back at this and think of this as good old days for whatever this activity type of thing is I think it's actually good to recognize that and like bask in the warmth of that to a certain degree um because if you don't I think it's easy to fall into negativity even though you are in a very
good time because you're only thinking about the the the bad things and allowing yourself to just like actually be like no you know what in a lot of ways this is really great um and I'm going to be very happy thinking about this in the future is a good thing there's too much negativity in the world I don't take enough candid pictures me neither like this moment why would I take a picture of this it's just it's just uh we're we're walking to or from school or something it's just Ivonne and our youngest
daughter she's she's carrying her for you know what might be the last time time yeah right like she's getting to the age where you don't know when the last time you carry them somewhere is going to be right um and so I'm I'm trying to think about that stuff more but honestly I'm I'm really bad about it I um we took some pictures when we were at the badmington center cuz like I realized that we took no pictures of our Renault when I was trying to pull a cable through conduit and I was like
yeah I have no in progress of any of this and the most pictures for me to look back at are always the candid ones just like oh yeah we had the furniture like that in that room that means more to me than I try to screenshot float plane every once in a while I I I tried to I have a bunch of historical screenshots of the Forum different things change more than we realized I think yes I sent the ones I took uh to Ivonne because yeah I took a bunch of reference pictures thank you you're
welcome yeah Dan just what I was laughing at by the way was Dan just just like slid out from behind and took a photo of us I thought that would be cute was funny Dan you're always cute feeling cute right now might delete later my screen protector goes over the front of it so it's blurry as hell but that'll be fun yeah um uh yeah I don't know I I actually genuinely think it's very important um I don't think I've done that enough in my life but it's something I've tried to make an effort
to do more so over the last I'd probably say like 3 or four years um and there's been a few times where I've even like said it out loud to other people and they're like what do you mean I'm like I don't know I feel like we're kind of at a peak with this thing not that that's a bad thing but I think we should like appreciate that and enjoy it while we have whatever this is and that might be a friend group that like if you have a friend group in high school even if you stay friends with them after high school
it's different it's different you're probably not going to see them very often someone might move away it's not going to be the same someone might be that low percentage even when they do use the thing that they have kids then yep y uh you you might have like a D and D group that you play with eventually that's probably going to end not guaranteed but probably and you should just recognize when you're in the Moment Like This is fun I like these people this is good this is a good thing that I
have I this is yeah I don't know I'm going to stop ranting about it uh speaking of things that um I'm making memories of remember last week I was trying to point out banable comments and realized I hadn't really screenshotted any of them well I screenshotted some for the show this week here's an example of a comment that will get you a shadow ban I wonder how mocking the blatantly failing commercial name strategy of ingredia every 30 seconds helps in any way the consumers understand what to
choose naming choices start sucking more than hell at 4000 series launch and unlaunch not grown better however lmg says we're pro consumers okay fine deliver info standup comedian should be for super fun channel is cadow what are you even talking about yeah I don't know like what actually what are you talking about no idea um yeah so this one's good this is from the land Center badminton video at 5:16 I make a comment about how the women's washroom has the natural light
because of course the women's washrooms are always nicer what a completely unnecessary comment like if you're so bothered by women having the changing room with nature lighting change it you own the company this is so toxic and not even true to be honest what shadow ban nice you're actually done you have nothing to contribute I've just I've seen some questions from people like okay is lonus just like silencing dissenting opinions no it's just like actual wastes of characters on YouTube servers like
that's what do it's a it's like a it's a thing you know the women's washroom is always nicer and cleaner and smells better because it just does because they just take care of things like it's just it's just a thing and the natural obviously I know I could change it the decision was made that the women's washroom should just be nicer because they're just always nicer I thought about Shadow bands for the people who talked about the Privacy issue of having a window there I considered it because obviously we're
not stupid we're going to put security film on it like what come on come on people but I decided to leave those ones I decided to leave those ones anyway bit by bit I'm cleaning up our comment section and I'm actually noticing a difference yeah good it is a shockingly small number of users contributing to the vast majority of the stupidity in the comment section like a decade ago or something I used to be against that type of stuff but I think in the modern web you just have
to yeah I I think it just is what it is and I think honestly an argument to the the other side is just an argument asking for a bad experience I yeah I don't know how do you know the women's watch is better H sus says AER 32 oh my God one of the most mortifying experiences of my adult life was in the library at UBC in University when I just went to the  came out to wash my hands and there was a woman washing her hands at the sink  me and I just left without washing my hands which probably didn't make it
better at that point I just hadn't paid attention I just to get out I just walked into the women's washroom um was pretty bad I've I've almost but never actually done it I've like gotten up to right in front of the door and then been like and then switched but I've never yeah yeah no I I like went in did my business it wasn't it wasn't a busy Library it was like the it was like the small one it was uh which one was it Ivonne and I used to go hang oh yeah and Ivonne was there
like I I I I left and came back and I was like completely red and so I told her immediately like uh okay don't take this the wrong way but I just checked  washroom you guys are doing great yeah uh it wasn't a labeling issue I just completely spaced 100% um I have to redeem myself at Super check so we do have to start getting through some of these merch messages at some point Luke beat me last week and I'm so upset got him overtime game five of our five game series they're really good games they
were really tight games hard fought games what I did I win the first two or was it one I know you won the first one I think it was I think you did win the first two and then I came back yeah and he came back and took three in a row yeah think so cuz the first game was like really close or something then the second game was I don't think it was then I came back I think I don't remember anyway yeah yeah I should have noticed there was no urinal though yeah people say that but I don't know if
you're if you're spaced enough if if your head's somewhere else thinking about somewhere else that you walked into there in the first place are you going to notice the Ural thing I don't know yeah all right let's see what else we got here hello D with a land Center coming soon will we be able to buy LT merch and other cool stuff from the Creator Warehouse there thanks for the Cool Tools uh there'll be some stuff there like I would imagine we'd have water bottles and stuff probably but
it's you might as well have at least like a couple screwdrivers and backpacks screwdrivers and I don't want it to seem weird like it's a badminton Pro Shop it's not a screwdriver store that makes sense we do want to do a physical location at some point but like I also don't want it to just look like a weird LT garage sale you know yeah makes sense um like I could see like LTT has uh like uh like athletic pants and St like we we would totally have those there but beyond that no I don't think
so hey lldd what are your thoughts on the Apple Air tags now that they notify a thief they're being tracked had my LTD backpack stolen last year with one in it and never got my stuff back so I only found out this week that as an Android User you can ping any air tag that has been like near your phone recently or something like that so Ivonne discovered this she was like yeah I had to used my cuz I I threw an air tag in her purse because she went through a period of a little while there where she was just
like leaving it everywhere and I was like okay well this is getting really inconvenient trying to track down where you put it on the security cameras and stuff um like she's usually really good about that stuff but we just she wasn't getting a lot of sleep and she just kind of like she left it somewhere like twice within a few weeks or something like that and I was like okay this needs to stop happening so I threw an air tag that I happened to have cuz debrand some went over for some sponsored something
it had a line of meme face on it checked it in her purse and I was like okay well just let me know if you need to find it and I'll have to grab the utility iPhone cuz neither of us daily drives an iPhone and then this was I don't know 6 months ago or something but earlier this week she goes oh yeah I had to use the air tag for the first time I'm like what do you mean use the air tag how'd you use it I don't even think you know where my iPhone is and she's like oh yeah no I
just go into this thing and you can see recently connected trackers and just beep them like you obviously can't use um UW whatever it is the like the super super D uwb I forget what it's called Uh but you can't you know just point it and you find it you know to within 30 cmet or whatever but you can you can ping it I was like oh okay interesting so it seems like over time Apple has gone from sending an occasional notification to you can actually like Ping the thing um what I will say is this is true to the
intended functionality of the device it was supposed to be for you to find your own thing that you misplaced it was really useful for anti- theft um I they don't want it to be used for stalking and stuff though but I understand why these changes problem have been made yeah um yeah man I I get it I understand why they had to change it but for the law-abiding citizens this is one of those things where the Nar do Wells wreck things for everyone if just if nobody used them for
stalking totally this wouldn't be a problem and you could just track your personal air tag anywhere you wanted anytime you wanted and it sucks that it has to be like this yeah this why we can't have nice things D Martin mhm on that same subject that's a great segue um I love this is a great take on um a comment I get a lot hey lonus I've been watching since elementary school when you didn't even have your own channel yet and was always wanting to ask you why you're built funny it's just a very
strange why I'm built funny like do you mean physically like my build you could be taking it so long so many  weird I I often make that joke when people walk up to me at a trade show or expore or whatever or they're like I've been watching you for 10 years and I'm like really I didn't see you it's great that's horrible have fun with it I know I love it it's it's yeah this is great uh built funny um I have kind of wide hips for a for a male for my for my body type the fashion team tells me that
um robust child birthing hips it's good other than that U you know I'm kind of short but it's all in my legs my torso is normal so if I wanted to get that like height enhancing uh surgery I would actually look quite proportionally sound you can't play sports anymore at all well like I'm sure you at all could do something but they definitely say like is it because the bone structure is not as strong or like what's the reason I would assume that it is not as strong as it used to be and probably it messes up
your muscles a little bit but yeah I don't know if you guys know I thought you could recover from both of those things if you're short you can like have your legs broken and then they like pull your bones apart and they brace them and they like grow back together or something it's it's it's wild surgery NS you uh you won't be able to play sports because you would be too powerful here's one for Luke while you go through some of the potentials uh what is your favorite have to throw  
goodness Luke what is your favorite build and slay the Spire I always love when a shiv deck can come together with the silent h that's kind of funny that's one of my favorite builds in slay fire uh all my favorite builds are going to be not all the majority of my favorite builds are around the silent the silent is my favorite one by far um I would probably say that honest ly I prefer poison over shiv but shiv is fantastic um they're both very very good um I find both of those very fun another one that
I like is just raging super hard on Ironclad and going full strength and just trying to like one to two turn every single combat and if you fail you die that's very entertaining uh so those are my three favorite glass Cannon I think that type of thing is called yeah yeah cuz he's often built as like a a a block machine so he just like defends like crazy so you just build him in completely other way which he is also built for but a lot of new players won't go for he just go strength super hard um
yeah hey dll I remember an old LTT video about haunted Hardware which had fraps working on Vulcan when it shouldn't have been aside from that what's the weirdest Hardware thing you've seen uh recently I wasn't able to play back video on my machine at home it turned out to be uh I needed to reinstall my AMD drivers but even with Hardware acceleration disabled that would barely play anything it was it super weird I wish I I wish I'd recorded it cuz it's the kind of thing where you tell people they're like oh
yeah but I'm sure it was easily solv no it was not easily solvable Everything YouTube twitch uh local media players I justd I couldn't play media um I man I don't know I've seen some weird oh oh my uh my old boot drive for my system one of the reasons that I was like okay just it let's reformat this thing was that um Windows hello will not work I cannot change my password it's it's it's just like it's just it's just broken I I have a I have a webcam that supports it and on the fresh install it just
immediately worked the way it's supposed to but there was some weird authentication thing where I was using a local account then I was using like a work account and then I was using my Hotmail and then I something something it's just it has no idea what's going on  broken um I I think my most modern example at the very least is when we used to do remote calls for the W show um um we used to I'm talking like within the last the most recent one that isn't the current one we're using uh we used a
system called ping. G from from Theo which was great um he said I think afterwards I don't remember I I know he said it afterwards I think he might have said it beforehand as well that it doesn't work on mobile um but when I was in that airport in Serbia and I had to call in for the W show I did it entirely through my phone on mobile and it worked flawlessly the whole time and I remember I told him afterwards and he was like that shouldn't have worked but yeah it was it was Flawless
so that was kind of fun it was also really important that it worked at that  did oh no uh oh yeah what's your favorite janky cooling video on the  series favorite janky cool this one holds a very special place in my heart I don't know why actually because there are other ones that were more fun there were other ones that were more visually interesting like when we used water to cool a heat sink uh like we we used put an air cooler and we just poured water through it or like the fire
cooling that hacksmith came out like we've done so many janky cooling things we put the computer in the fridge which obviously didn't work because obviously that won't work um but I don't know why but this when you ask that question this is the one that stuck out in my mind baby Alex building the world's shest mold oh my hold on hold on those are the  second oh my God I have not seen this video holy crap I remember this but it's so old so this is it in order to get it mounted to anything uh we basically had
one I love this this is it Mount cool the CPU with a this channel seems cool I should subscribe um yeah it didn't work at all pretty much it's a complete piece of sh I think Alex still has this next to his desk I would keep that forever keep that forever that's beautiful  Memories uh I run into a lot of issues at my company around poor communication as someone who is Le here do you work anywhere yeah as someone who is leading a team are there any ways you have found to combat this the roles here are all
work from home as well oh God please please email us if you know if you find out save us please if I do the answer I'd be writing a book and I wouldn't have to work here anymore yeah if you find out sell it to the world and become a trillionaire so I think the answer is no communicating with a large group of very different people is extremely hard how people take a certain message is going to be very different depending on who the person is when they receive it all that type of stuff also
some people will just uh not be very interested in reading messages from certain uh messaging apps so there might be people that prefer to read messages from something or another thing or someone who ignores one type of routine email maybe that you put information in but they just don't think it's normally very important to them so they don't read it moving moving forward etc etc etc fun fact on our Monday morning meeting notes the first line is actually Monday morning meeting is
important you need to read it or something like that and I'm sure I don't remember the wording cuz uh he doesn't read it cuz I can't see it anymore because it's always there there's no there's no work around for that yeah so like I don't know man it's uh it's a big problem and I I think being too angry at your own company about it is not going to get you anywhere because if you leave that company and go somewhere else you're going to run into the same problem so have fun is it good
to uh yell constantly at your direct manager who sits across the room from you yeah yeah does that help it's a good Strat does it make him less stressed I say go for it yeah Do It um and that he is powerless to make any changes no I make some he has power yeah don't kid yourself he has power if he's not changing something it's cuz he doesn't want too I will continue to yell then no I'm just somewhat fair enough I can make changes um it's just you can't fix communication completely you can
make efforts you can try to improve things when someone that helps a lot if both sides are making an effort you can get a lot done yeah and like part of that is going to be like if if you notice a problem with with some form of communication that's happening voice it make sure that you are also not a communication problem or as much as you can um and just try to understand that it's going to be an issue do what you can to mitigate it uh do what you can to improve things if someone comes to you I
think you mentioned help leading a remote team if someone comes to you and mentions the communication issue uh try to act on it best you can um I I find layering is helpful so um and I I don't always do this perfectly I also have my own communication issues don't get me wrong um stop it but try to do it multiple times so like if you say something vocally in a meeting try to have it in text as well um if someone received something through an email uh that that is important yeah
they received it but they might just not read that email or something um copy it out put it in another chat uh tag people directly require reactions this is something that uh oh I love that I have adopted that in my entire life and all my Dev circles it's brilliant uh Dan from the labs web team started doing this with his team and then I copied it in every scenario I possibly could um which is like when there's a PR um if you see it you have to react with the like eyeballs reaction um and if it's
good to go you have to react with the check mark reaction and it just means that you have actual good receipts because red doesn't mean anything because notifications are totally broken things get marked as red all the time maybe you open your computer and it's on that message but you're looking for something really quickly so you just immediately click off of it well it just got marked as red you're not going to see it again but if someone goes through the effort to do that reaction you know
that they actually saw it so if it's important enough you can require reactions and then you can check the reactions to see who didn't do it and you can go after them directly to make them read the thing that was a lot nice yeah I love that system actually uh what else how is the struggle dealing with doing things you love but also doing it for a living and the livelihood of others is it a is the burden ever too much it can be exhausting um like I I still haven't tried the wireless Vive Vive U index
adapter I got it plugged in it's it's charged it's ready and I just have been I've needed some decompression time when I've been at home lately instead of tinkering with tech sometimes it's all I want to do sometimes it's it's it's nice to have a break and uh even though it's I'm really interested in it and I I want to know how it works I just look at and I go right but before I can do that I'm going to have to spend an hour just like fighting with it I'm going to have to
take notes while I do it which saps a lot of the joy of the discovery yeah it makes it feel a lot more like work it's tough it's tough I don't I don't have a perfect answer highin us in team you always say not to pre-order things but what would you say about pre-ordering a framework laptop I actually did and can't wait wait receiving it I would tell you the same thing I always say I would say don't pre-order things if I if I were to give you a different answer just because I was an investor in the
company then you should never trust anything I say ever again hey lldd has anyone tried to use the s24 AI image search on faces for example lonus would it find the LTT store mouse pad memes LinkedIn what about other people with love the guy that Luke signed his word 1997 I have not tried it but that actually sounds kind of awesome hello W.D first M matches hold on I'm actually thinking of getting one I really like it I did an unboxing for short circuit that went up today um s24
it looks kind of sick I still hate whole punch cameras but obviously I'm not getting away from that anytime soon um you can with this phone the screen's incredible what phone is that the anti- glare coating on it it's unbelievable what phone do you have Den I have the Sony uh One X yeah Sony I can't figure out how to move the stupid back button to the right though what oh it's just like a toggle it is not toggle it prove them wrong uhoh fight time it's going to be my second Apple arcade moment of the day
it'll be great either that or it'll be Dan's  day oh my God he's right yeah ridiculous right why wouldn't they it's it's it's part part of like AOSP or whatever oh no I can no longer recommend this phone how do they how do they like what the heck and I get it some people like the back button on the left that's nice I I love that you like the back button on the left but it is it is as far as I can tell just like a toggle the developer of the Android skin can just enable it's uh
absolutely part of um the top level I use it I think I swipe from the side all the time yeah fine I don't like gesture like three button and I like the back button on the left and I'm not going to tell you guys not to like your ways just like I will not allow a phone manufacturer to tell me that I'm not allowed to like my way if I want the back button on the right then I want the back button on the right wow okay no I'm never recommending this phone to anyone again well that is no Luke you don't
understand that's actually enough for me no I believe you I I am insane at this point I've worked with him for a while I fully believe that yeah I have no questions there don't buy a Sony ever again the back buttons Dan would you recommend that people work at lenus Media Group oh uh do are you the kind of person anybody out there are you the kind of person that would own a Porsche like lonus and change the blades of your wiper blades just for the principle of doing it if
you are then I think you're you're going to fit into the team here uh okay so a conditional yes a conditional yes if if that honestly makes sense Che if not giving the user the right for a like it's part of Android the basic thing to be able to switch the buttons if that was something that somebody had to develop for or like you know Touch wiz doesn't support it so you do your own launcher then all right fine you know uh but for to just not turn on a knob like it took efforts to probably disable that
yeah in my opinion bothers me so much man and if it's not in the debug or anything like that like God damn I mean I actually hate for for me like I like when Android 11 now you got me now got me ranting I'm I'm angry man oh God I almost said it twice um everything on Android is Giant now all of the buttons are huge all like the clock this is this is this screen has the highest pix per inch of any phone on the market and how's that information density D 660 pixels per inch you making
use of that density I can't because Android is garbage I hate it oh man Abacus give me an abacus I'm going to the forest I'm going to live with the forest  bye what the is this show I still don't know my uh my meds are off now I've been I've been hosting it for over a decade Luke and I still don't know what it is there is no more faux Quest I'm going to go I'm going to go write an app to switch those switch those buttons it like intercepts your input moves yeah oh jeez
gez hello when D First Merch first time merch message I'm so sorry man what are some of the most cool or unusual pieces of tech you've seen put into a PC case for example I saw someone put a discret car stereo into one ages ago back in the old days people used to put all kinds of wild things in the front of the 5 and a qu inch Bay like oh yeah the cigarette lighter was one just that's wow that really shouldn't be there yeah you shouldn't smoke around your computer the the amount of like cigarette smoke tar
that I've had to try to remove from computers over the years like just stop go smoke out goes right into the intake fan cuz that's how fans work yeah um that's a good answer last one am I curated we basically use an Apple TV as a coaster with all the smart TVs so I'm curious what is the most expensive piece of tech the company or employees have that does not get used as intended at all I mean I did my thing on that super expensive circulation fan last week so I won't talk about that I could
talk about our 3D printers man the kinds of things that I've seen people using 3D printers for internally we do a lot of really good things with them prototyping products and uh you know creating holders for our slates and pens for the sets and all kinds of very useful things but one stood out to me and this was for a lan event of some sort we apparently 3D printed a gigantic batch of trophies  going these are the most generic trophies that could ever have existed could we have bought these for like a
dollar could we have bought these at the dollar store and the answer is often yes and it happens all the time we will Design something that is actually available at Dollarama well we'll put the insert wiper we didn't design the trophies oh they just downloaded file we did not design the trophies I've seen things get designed unfortunately we did not need to design yeah that's what I thought we we designed I think more than once a like holder for a computer for our Barcode Scanner station he's talking
about me right now when I was like guys you know the Microsoft Surface exists you know there's one in inventory right now it has a kickstand built into  that and that's the stuff he complain about actually very reasonable but also not um okay yeah that's it I'm done I hope that Rhino isn't 3D printed the Rhino no that is uh that is ceramic yeah I hope we didn't pay for that ceramic Rhino I'm sure we did I'm sure we did I hate man I hate how much just like knickknacks cost drives me crazy it that
thing does nothing table ball if it cost more than $2 I it was a waste of money where do you think it was from if you had to guess I hope it's from Value Village and I hope some other idiot paid $200 for it and I paid $2 for it ceramic Rhino what what were we saying ages ago with the super expensive table balls uh what about them I was just saying I hate that there was a whole rant months ago about yeah just I think it was just basically this like like knickknacks it drives me crazy how much they cost oh
was it the bit about how uh I think the whole thing is just a conspiracy where designers um buy this stuff because they get a commission ba for for the Project based on how much they spend total so they'll just pad it with like stupid line item things that are like just an overpriced glass ball that they spend $400 on so they make 40 bucks I'm not sure because we used to know like one of those interior designers oh and some of this stuff just is like expensive I mean the thing is you go to
like home cents or something like that and it's an $80 table B but like this interior designer was like well we went to an artisan who would craft a table ball and it' be like 300 bucks sure I mean it's not like I don't understand that things are expensive I mean you're talking to the person who made a solid gold Xbox controller I get it yeah but that's a little bit different than like a knickknack that's an art piece if you want to think about it that way I think of it as more of an
investment I don't think of it as I made a solid gold Xbox controller I think of it as I bought some gold so that's my justification for that as for like the  of I couldn't find this rhino but I did "find a $6,000 Rhino oh my God how tall" does that it's 24 in tall it's it's like what is that 4 feet long it's by France by France good job country what yeah what the heck go up Cur cursor up here right up left oh wow by France yeah France France made it good job France look at the other made
"what is this oh it's $8,000 what is that" I had a wow all right so this is the type of stuff that they would put in your house I had a blast um there is a there's a secondhand shop okay someone at a partner sent me this couch brand that they were like man it'll change your life you sit on this couch you're never going to want to sit on any other couch and I'm like knowing you um this couch is stupid 10 grand or like you're not even close dude 40 Grand probably closer to that range anyway um this
couch company is so far up their own they already look like it the store in Vancouver the store in Vancouver Luke does not have a sign on it ah yep it if you don't know where it is and who they are I've been to this store you don't deserve to be there anyway so that looks very com they had "like they had like a $112,000 bean bag" yeah I think it was hand knit or something yeah that doesn't surprise me anyway the point is not this the point is that I went there for fun because
there's no way that I would spend that kind of money on any couch it could give you an orgasm every time you sit on it and I wouldn't buy it there's other ways  um but I went there just to check it out to humor to humor my RE reusability Factor to humor my contact the danger of the cheaper ones yeah the number of people that say laundering when they see stuff like this it's like no no that is actually just their business it's not not everything is money laundering like how people will just cry
like tax right off no it's not how that works anyway um so I went just to just to just to know what a couch that costs as much as a whole ass vehicle a new yeah um would be like really nice couch great couch comy but what I had the most fun with was actually the secondhand store a few doors down okay if you're telling me I can get that comfy of a couch there for cheap I'd be happy while I was there uh hold on or is this one of those like crazy expensive secondhand stores it was a
secondhand store for things like those couches okay yeah while I was there I   excited it's a lamp Okay in the shape of a horse all right it costs I can't see the bre "6,500" Euros oh and it is oh my God how are their pictures so bad hold on 95 how how are these their only pictures you don't need to see it you do need to see it it's the size of a horse oh wow it is a it is a horse sized so you also where the would you put this well you also have an enormous mansion that you need to fill with
things I guess so I would I would if I owned this I would put it at the bottom of my pool just because you can yeah I mean that that would be reasonable you can scuba dive inspect "your $99,000 horse lamp 5year warranty" though nice oh man sweet yeah so it weighs 120 kg so that's about 250 lb whoa it is 2.25 M high so that's about 7 ft it's enorm man this place just for a trip go on a date go down to Chinatown okay get some food go with the misses just go hang out in this store for a bit hey do you want
to see how people live just play the how much do you think this cost game and you just like keep score bring a little notepad and then play Price's right rules and see if you guys can just just have some fun it's actually fun it's a blast so the I think the 100 gcks song  lamp so uh to give you some idea of where it is um yeah it's it's definitely it's definitely it's kind of east of Chinatown southeast of Gast town uh and it's called oh man no that's not it might be I think it's this one um
oh no this might not be it this what's in the heart of an up yes yes yes yes here it is here it is okay I've got it it's called Carriage House affordable luxury yeah that horse was like half price uh if I was if I was more of an idiot I'd be like wow what a deal and I would buy it um so they are Vancouver's Premier Luxury furniture store which is not actually quite right because they're actually this an Upscale Consignment Boutique so if you're not familiar with Consignment basically you drop off your
thing and then the price goes down down down down down down down down down the store handles this for you until it sells and then they keep some percentage and they give you some percentage so obviously uh it's in their interest to curate the items in the store to make sure they're offering a variety and it's in your interest to have it sell presumably at the highest price possible so it's almost like a reverse auction it starts high and then goes low low low low low until it sells or until I think
you like come back and get it so it's kind of like a classy pwn shop um man it's just that horse would be a great way to get people in the door freaking wild though dude like I don't know we should we should get that horse and put it in the lobby these lamps aren't that bad I mean it's more than I would spend on a lamp Ralph Lauren lamp why is there a Ralph Lauren lamp I don't know because it doesn't look good dude I don't know it looks like someone put a lamp head on like a tripod like it it
looks like it has the three legs connecting $900 here you go the camera tripod that doesn't look good well you get two though they're half price yeah too but like I'm not even trying to like if that was $15 I like show me lamp looks good I don't know Google lamp and you'll probably find better looking lamps than these let me let me Google lamp what a hater hey I immediately found multiple better looking lamps and I haven't even like clicked in on it like what do you mean yeah there's a
Christy projector lamp who doesn't like that a bunch of these look super cool they're also really expensive these are very expensive lighting is flipping lighting is really expensive they know where you've been shopping for the last 5 minutes also probably that that's probably a thing but here we go look  doesn't have enough animals in it it's not a horse needs more tessalation only like things that are tesselated like it's 2009 so you'll know that I've completely gone off the rails
when I own that horse lamp if you buy that horse that's your that's your uh Canary in the coal mine yeah is you buying that horse lamp yeah what if we 3D printed you it I'm looking at some very large format 3D printers why uh obviously for Content four feet tall yeah I'm into it yeah we could do we could do a mini we could do a Shetland [Laughter] lamp oh my goodness um I'm 3D bring a horse land okay the last merge message is uh W what was the hardest decision to make in 2023 that in hindsight should
have been simple um let letting the W show go for 4 hours at a time it's just so obvious now how long has the show gone on today 4 and a half hours all right how was it get the out how was it so short before I don't know what did we even do differently I don't know you spent an hour and a half on the first topic well way to go Dan yeah it's Dan's fault yeah technically look what you've done yeah I regret nothing we'll see you again next week nothing same bad time same bad Channel bye nothing [Laughter]
D okay the is this show I don't all right
