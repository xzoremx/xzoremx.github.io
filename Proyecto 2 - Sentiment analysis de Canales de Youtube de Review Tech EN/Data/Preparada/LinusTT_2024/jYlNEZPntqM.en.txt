Apple's latest Mac Pro is an embarrassment it doesn't even have their latest gen M3 silicon it costs 3400 more than a Mac Studio that has the exact same specs and their prices on storage and RAM upgrades would seem to suggest that they're made out of gold rather than silicon the worst part though it's not even that good yeah here "we go final scores 3,000 and change 1,00" and change wow wow 50% faster on CP you but showing you all the results right away is no fun and not very helpful so
let's talk about our choices while we work together to build the PC Pro to yeah if you remember this isn't the first time we've done this and last time the PC wasn't a clear winner unlike our sponsor MSI if you don't have time to go through the process of picking out parts and building your own PC msi's AIS RS gaming desktop comes pre-built with powerful components on like a Wi-Fi 7 enabled motherboard and it has the benefit of being easily upgradeable check it out at the link down below
right out of the gate this PC Pro build is going to be a bit more of a challenge while our Mac Pro comes in at a whopping "$1,800 the old one was like $330,000 so" bargain well it all depends on what you're getting right there are two different M2 Ultras one with 60 GPU cores and the other with 76 we've gone with the ladder meaning that that machine is as fast as it can be meanwhile the PC Pro is getting something a little I don't know newer faster wider how about all of the above
the AMD thread for 79 70x features amd's latest zen4 architecture with a monstrous 32 cores and a boost clock of 5.3 GHz all while drawing 350 watts and that's before you turn on PBO or Precision boost over overdrive more on that later but um is a potential drawback of our machine uh compared to that one this isn't a top-of-the line thread r or anything that would have cost us more than half of our budget by itself but I'm still confident that this CPU is going to have no issue I'm still
confident that this bad boy is going to run circles around that thing now unlike the Mac Pro with its soldered CPU our chip needs a motherboard with a socket to go in specifically the gigaby tx50 aod there's only a handful of tx50 motherboards out there right now and we settled on this one primarily due to the spacing of its PCI Express slots which is going to make a bit more sense later it also conveniently is the least expensive TRX 50 board while still including great
features like dual high-speed land ports Wi-Fi 7 and a whopping four quad Lane m.2 slots three of which are PCI Gen 5 now hold on a minute lonus this is regular thread Ripper how is this machine machine pro that is a fair point compared to thread Ripper Pro we've got fewer pcie Lanes so you can't connect as much stuff to it and limited Ram capacity across half as many memory channels but then I ask you this how do we stack up to the competition compared even to this nonpr system the Mac Pro
has fewer pcie Lane still supports less Ram has limited support for professional application outside of video and photo and doesn't support ECC memory at all it does have faster memory but we'll have to see how much of an advantage that's going to give it let's talk about memory the base model Mac Pro comes with 64 gbes of unified memory and unified memory is legitimately super cool Apple Ram is directly on the S so package which increases bandwidth to both the CPU and the onboard GPU not only is it fast
but if the CPU completes a task and needs to hand it off to the GPU that GPU has immediate access to it rather than having to wait for it to be transferred between system memory and traditional GPU memory Apple's Ram also supports Dynamic caching meaning that the CPU and GPU can partition the system memory dynamically to best complete their respective work or at least the M3 can it sucks that this Mac Pro is still stuck with the M2 and what also sucks even more is the price we added another
128 gigs to our config which cost us "$1,600 on the PC side okay sure it's not" unified but boy do we ever get a whole lot more for our money I am talking double the capacity at 384 GB these are micron's 96 gig 56 600 megat transfer per second dims they're registered ECC meaning they should be beautifully stable and we're going to fill all four slots here maxing out our motherboard it's kind of funny we ended up with exactly double the ram because there was that clip that circulated of
an Apple employee erroneously stating during an interview that 8 GB on an M3 uh MacBook Pro is probably analogous to 16 gab on other systems I guess that's why it costs twice as much another sore spot that Apple users have been complaining about more and more lately is storage pricing to go from the stock one terabyte in that machine to 8  $2200 for that price you could buy a whole other computer you could buy one of every screwdriver on LTD store.com twice or you could do what we did and
pick up two of these the Cy rocket 4 plus 80 terabyte yeah yeah that's right twice as much storage hey Apple uh is your 8 terabytes equivalent to our 16 terabytes is that is that a thing we're going to find out yeah we sure will but what we can do is just have double the capacity whether it's for projects videos games or whatever we want one advantage for Apple though has been and maybe always will be sex appeal I mean look at this fine ass cheese crater that's why people keep buying this thing
for us we've gone with well it's fine this is the Define 7 XL it's not a new case by any means but it's compatible with high-end Hardware fits lots of storage drives and uh hopefully won't be too constricted when it comes to airflow worst case scenario will'll drill some holes in the front  aesthetic for cooling we've got on with an NZXT Kraken 360 because well we had mounting hardware and with this triple radiator it was able to handle our 32 CPU cores Under full load at least at
their default speeds uh the system does support overclocking but it's really not something that we would recommend for a pro machine in a production environment anyway now while you watch this delightful little Montage of our cooler being installed I'd like you to think back to when I said this motherboard had the pcie slot spacing we needed that is because for our build we are using not one but two of msi's RTX 490 Supreme cards yes my friends apple is what it took for nvidia's pricing to finally
seem so reasonable that you can just put in two however there's a Twist the keite among you might have noticed that one of my cards is aircooled and one of them has water cooling that my friends is because we couldn't find any combination of motherboard and case that could fit two air cooled 490s and then well when we wanted two of the liquid cool ones we found out gosh darn it AI rush and China there's now a 4090 shortage so we asked our trustworthy bro Ryan from the LTT store
support team if we could borrow his air cool variant and we used our one remaining liquid cooled variant that way we've got two of the same cards but with slightly different hats now since the shortage prices for these have gone up a fair bit but still think we're going to end up looking pretty good by  that anywh who to power this mess we went with the Silverstone Hela 2050 R platinum or SST ha250 r- PM for short it costs a whopping 6 $170 which only sounds like a bad deal
until you compare it to the Mac Pro ah reasonable now that the build's done all we got to do is fire it up and run some benchmarks now our final price not that far off but for fun we're going to include results with both gpus as well as with only one GPU because a little bird told me bird named Elijah H that it'll still win even with just one GPU yes good job bird spoiler berer I stuttered I'm sorry IED up the shot no I loved it it was great Ed her to flee cut around and make me look good
can you please freeze frame cut around him put me on a beach you make me look good give him like a Tom celic mustache and like you don't know who Tom celic is he's the selian one what does that mean couldn't help noticing Elijah we're off to a pretty bad start here our system didn't even boot up error code Zer D you think you've seen little PP energy that's zero PP energy and they're booted finally PCS y but which one's faster classroom and go wait that's what is it F12 I don't know I don't is there a
hotkey to render yeah oh I didn't know that it is F12 there you go go I got to12 on a MAG what is this command option F12 oh I don't know I was just guessing I give that if anyone should have had the Head Start it should have been you spoiler are you done uh no I oh no it's still going yes I am going much faster than you though oh wow yes you are all right I finished I'm not even halfway you started late you started late let's give it the benefit of doubt we'll let it heat up catch up you know I
started like 5 seconds after so quiet though it sounds like it's barely doing anything wait since we're still waiting for the Mac anyway why don't you run a GPU intensive test and see if they spin up yeah sure we'll run c a bench we'll see what it can what results it can give us you oh you finished did I finish yeah total time oh 246 was the end result Leon's so proud  me here we go boom it's starting oh hey you've got to run on Theo sorry sorry sorry sorry GPU start hey my fans are
spinning definitely louder is it yeah no I mean louder than the Mac like this thing is silent yeah I mean that's what happens when you hook a raspberry piie up to a heat SN this big it's not a raspberry piie it's a powerful computer it's an apple pie yeah don't feel bad your computer's really powerful good boy okay this is this has rendered this multiple times we're getting about "65,000 points give or take it's doing it" over and over and over preparing it hasn't even started just
read it like four times remember the first gen when Apple was all rgpu was like yeah and NV video's like what are you even talking about okay that was the 390 if I recall correctly not the 490 but still it has done this multiple times while it's trying to finish this one it's kind of insane how it's just crushing it there it finally finished one 9500 points we are over six times that what was our difference in price give or take like a couple hundred bucks depending on sales of Parts but Final Cut the
ecosystem I get my Windows phone back please bring it back dozens of people are so upset right now is the noise difference enough that you would prefer to buy the Mac over this no this is still a really quiet machine we should put the side panel on In fairness though oh yeah Apple's side panel game on fleek kids don't say that anymore how would you know you're old now let's do the CPU version of cine bench first before we completely write this thing off though and they're off
coming out of the gate strong we've got nobody nobody is coming out of the gate strong wa hold on a sec this actually closer yeah this may be a competition oh okay oh PC Pro two is picking up speed is coming out ahead around the first turn I'm going to stop that now yeah please do yeah this one had like a moment where I thought hey yeah hey yeah no hey yeah what cuz you said hey yeah it's a song Oh I don't get "it do we have scores yet yes 3,000" "2,000 oh this one's not even done still"
though oh does it give preliminary scores yeah I think oh that's interesting estimating what it's going to be and then okay well it's almost done it or it's like halfway done its second one though and this one's not done its first it took a bit to spool up "yeah here we go final scores 3,000 and" "change 1,900 in change wow wow 50%" faster on CPU Apple silicon has been a huge win for them in Mobile Mac Mini super cool machine the studio as well cuz we're not we're just dissing this
one because it's the same spec but it's "like what $3,400 we said more expensive" B you're paying 35 00 for a fancy case and some PCI slots you don't even have expandable Ram in it anymore like you used to and that's the problem we like Silicon because of its efficiency and you know we love silicon okay can't say that Apple silicon oh we love silicone what nobody is talking about that they're different what silicon yeah is an element okay silicone is a compound compound that contains silicon so
they're the same no that's like saying that water is the same as oxygen because  it I understand now we got there ladies and gentlemen for LS gaming sure let's play game so CS2 Counter Strike 2 it is that's going really fast yeah that's pretty fast how fast could you download the game delete it and reinstall it all right manage uninstall here we go 1.5 1.6 is the Mac going to win the game download Benchmark oh no oh did we beat it three yes we pass okay we beat it for 3.1 one thing I will say that is a w
though that boots way faster yeah that was a problem we had with the last Mac Pro killer as well was that one took a while to boot workstation platforms on PC tend to be poorly optimized but hey you can download games at 3.4 GB per second compared to 2.8 wait is Counterstrike 2 not available for Mac did you check it's not available for Mac so it's trying to get you to launch it oh for I didn't even realize that okay rocket League rocket League's not launching either is
are you sure this is it doesn't work on the M silicon okay are were you just trying to make a point that nothing works or were we supposed to compare I was trying to make a point that it's very difficult there's very select games that you know you may or may not get to play the ones you want were you or did you think they worked I totally was doing it on purpose it is one of my f whoa sound Boomer enabled okay very cute sound Boomer is not a real thing what speaker is that is it just
playing off the boom speaker that sounds like it eh is that a thing I didn't know that was a thing it could do well where's your PC Pro built-in speaker at okay fine I guess you got me on that one all right I don't have a speaker embedded in my computer to be clear Linux is a piece of Windows is a piece of so when I say Mac OS is also sometimes problematic don't get upset you know why can't I type right now you know I'm clicking this box I'm highlighting this text it's not that my keyboard's not
working oh look Spotlight oh good wait I think I figured it out keystroke receiving dusk would like to receive keystrokes from any application so like clicking I don't is that what it's asking so it wants access to the keyboard to play I'm exhausted just trying to open one stupid game oh wow this mouse is really laggy imagine the bottom charging port not being the worst thing about it hey wave two shotgun let's go I mean it looks kind of smooth I can't tell what you're feeling with the mouse
though does it feel rubbery oh no it's well the mouse is terrible but the actual game is fine okay yeah it's running super smooth yeah so why don't I have an FPS counter dumb question did it actually enable I don't know okay I'll tell you what Elijah's going to find at least one game that runs on both of them we're going to have a little graph right here but spoiler alert it's not going to be pretty because the raw horsepower of the gpus in the PC Pro 2 is vastly greater and remember that in games we
aren't even able to make use of both of them because Invidia no longer supports Envy link or SLI at all for that matter on consumer cards jerk so okay lonus we hear you apple is expensive and none of their products are good but that's not what I'm saying there are some arguments strong Arguments for many of Apple's products there's the power and portability of the MacBook the efficiency of the Mac Studio or my personal favorite the Mac Mini that thing is a Powerhouse or the convenience
of airpods which I happen to daily drive it's just that the Mac Pro is so bad that Apple will almost certainly can it by which I don't mean turn it into a can again I remember that I mean discontinue it I mean even Apple's most ENT Defenders are starting to realize that Apple's pricing especially with Halo products like this just doesn't make any sense anymore if you search for the M2 Ultra Mac Pro almost every article or video reaches the same conclusion it's dumb there are some things that it does
do well I mean like the Mac Studio because it's the exact same machine the single Cor performance was actually on par or even better than our PC Pro 2 sometimes and its efficiency is outstanding I think its overall power consumption is closer to one of these gpus than it is to this entire system but for the price of this thing you can get a fully kitted out Max studio for your home office and still have enough money to buy a refurbished M2 Max MacBook Pro from Apple's certified
refurbished store or if all that seems like a bad idea you could buy this fancy segue now with $700 Wheels to our sponsor ground news they want to change how we engage with news by helping us better understand media bias and break free from it because while the internet has connected us more than ever it's particularly good at connecting us to people and news stories that we happen to already agree with ground news solves this by analyzing thousands of Articles and news sources each day merging the
