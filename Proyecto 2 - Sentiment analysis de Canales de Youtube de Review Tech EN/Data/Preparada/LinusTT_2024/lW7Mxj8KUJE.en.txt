man Google Chrome kind of sucks now right I remember when everyone was screaming stop using Internet Explorer Chrome is so much faster was that all a lie no actually Chrome was a revolution it was lightweight fast as I'll get out and it brought great features like tab sandboxing so that if one of your tabs froze your entire browser didn't have to crash like the old days so what changed then to turn Chrome into this bloated Ram devouring Behemoth maybe it was you me I mean I don't have the best
browsing habits I leave way too many tabs open but Chrome has a way of dealing with that using Dynamic caching for the tabs I'm not using sure but is Google the one who installed all those extensions I mean I don't have that many I just have zoto for tracking my research language tool tele party and an ad locker could it be that his insatable thirst for extra functionality is bogging down his browser as it turns out yes I need to make some Chang but not every extension is made equal
while some had no effect on browser performance others like last pass reduced performance by as much as 12% an effect that Stacks across your library of resource sucking add-ons with 2third of people using Chrome as a default browser it's clear that we need to see just how bad this situation is explore what can be done to fix it and talk about Google's solution including why it  lab wait this isn't the lab this is the segue to our sponsor ODU if you own a business you'll know what I mean when I
say you probably have too many apps running at the same time with odu's all-in-one business software you can combine all of those into a single unified platform so click the link in the description to learn more our Labs team has a fair bit of experience under their belt testing video games and productivity apps but this is one of our first for into browser performance and how exactly you measure browser performance is a big question primarily because browsers are big programs
chromium the open source framework that Chrome is based on is 31 million lines of code that is almost as much as the Linux kernel the core of Linux based operating systems and it's close to the estimated count for older complete operating systems like Windows XP which Probably sounds ludicrous right until you consider that I mean outside of games how many programs do you run that aren't in your browser and of those ones how many of them are just web apps that could run in your browser so the thing
is modern browsers need to be able to support pretty much everything from 28-year-old geoc cities pages to full-blown Photoshop clones so coming back to the question of how to measure their performance it's challenging because browsers do a lot of different things but we're going to do our best starting with a machine that is based on the most common specifications in a recent steam Hardware survey to look at memory use we opened up Chrome to a set of common web pages and on a clean system measured our
idle RAM usage at around 1.1 GB which increased to 1.25 when we were streaming 4K video even on a system with just 8 gigs of RAM that's not a problematic amount of usage and it's important to note that even if it was higher that isn't necessarily A Bad Thing programs that need to access information quickly will benefit from using up more R and as long as they give it up in the event that your Os or another program needs it it's not really a problem but what happens when we add extensions well as
it turns out it depends on the type our password manager last pass and our thirdparty spell checker grammarly both used considerably more RAM than say coupon code collector honey one extension insert usual disclaimer about the impact on creators actually reduced our overall RAM usage and that was ublock origin which is clearly effectively blocking ads and trackers from sapping our system resources though funnily enough the more popular ad block extension didn't have the same effect
which kind of makes us question its Effectiveness especially when they advertise that their extension saves memory overall with 10 of the most popular extensions we observed a nearly 50% increase in RAM usage with half a dozen tabs open that's not that big of a deal but as your tab addiction grows so unfortunately does your Problem by the time we reached 48 tabs we were looking at a whole 2 GB of extra RAM usage for what is functionally the same user experience I mean you're not looking at
all those windows at once are you I mean of course if you have ample system memory you're probably not going to notice the difference anyway will you actually you might to gauge performance of our browsers we ran several benchmarks that aim to test the many features of the web in motion Mark which measures Graphics per performance in our browser most of our extensions caused virtually no change in performance except this is kind of a funny one our ad blockers you see ad blockers need to
interact with the rendering pipeline in order to hide ads without turning your web pages into a completely fragmented mess and that appears to have resulted in a reduction in in browser rendering performance now in the real world this slowdown is going to be masked by other speed benefits but we thought it was an interesting observation nonetheless moving on to speedometer a benchmark that's f focused on simulating user experiences like working with a to-do list editing Rich Text rendering charts
and reading news sites we found a totally different story here it's last pass causing a big slowdown and our best guess is that this is due to last pass trying to scan every text field for potential autofill opportunities in jet stream 2 a benchmark that's focused on smooth operation we found that ad block and grammarly did a lot of damage but then last pass was relatively benign and then in web expert 4.0 we measured just 3% reduced performance with all of our extensions enabled at once so sometimes
your extensions matter sometimes they don't and sometimes different ones will or won't the results just don't really seem to add up to a clear picture but hey maybe the problem is we're looking too closely if we zoom out and look at the overall a clear Trend develops especially when we configure our browser like a regular person would and we have multiple extensions running concurrently with everything enabled we lose something like a quarter of our performance in the Chrome web browser if
you're a major Surfer 25% that's the kind of difference that you could really notice in day-to-day use I mean think of all the extra LTT behind the scenes that you could watch on lm. g/ flat plane with all that extra time so what do we do about this well some extensions are always consuming some level of system resources and you can track this Yourself by pressing shift escape to open the Chrome tab task manager at the bottom of your list will be your extensions and writing this right now
I'm noticing some of my extensions being needlessly active page downloader single file why is that open I'm not downloading anything but then the PDF editing extension that I'm using seems to respect the fact that I don't always need it running and it's not consuming anything now's a perfect time then to go through and call some of your more inconsiderate extensions especially if you aren't using them that much anymore all it'll cost you is a few seconds to click that little puzzle block and
here's a good rule of thumb if you don't remember the last time you used it or what it's for just get rid of it you can always reinstall it later if you have lots of RAM and good tab management turning off the memory saving feature in Chrome will speed things up as well as Chrome will spend less time reloading Pages preloading Pages can also speed things up but if you're someone who uses an ad blocker or a privacy extension pre-loading isn't really an option speaking of privacy this is unrelated to
your extensions but what you're in the menu why not stop by the add privacy section and turn all of that tracking off we can't really give you an after result for the impact of all the changes you just made I mean your mileage may vary depending on what you removed or didn't and your overall web browsing habits but from what we've seen anecdotally it is very possible that you'll notice a difference just not in startup times this was a really interesting part of our test that we're tacking on the end
here we found that with a reasonable extension load out the application takes about the same amount of time to Launch regardless of what you do or don't have active then again I guess who cares anyway because when's the last time you closed Chrome I see that update button the last thing that you can do is to uninstall chrome and I'm only kind of joking right now the roll out of Google's manifest V3 is set to dramatically change the capabilities of chromium extensions which by the way
also affect Microsoft Edge now especially hindering the effectiveness of ad blockers and privacy enhancing extensions we have haven't tested firefox's performance with you know extensions or without cuz realistically most of you aren't using it but hey maybe next time we do an update on this the situation will have changed because you'll have listened to Our advice why not give it a try and while you're at it why not try out our sponsor Odo if you're running a business keeping track
of a hundred different apps all running at once can be a pain I mean just imagine all those Chrome tabs with odu's all-in-one business management software you can combine them into a single Unified operating system check out their CRM and sales apps which make lead generation and closing deals easier than ever their time sheets app helps you keep close track of your employee schedules and their accounting app lets you autocreate and send invoices and it "integrates with 28,000 Banks from all"
around the world and if you only need one single app to shore up some holes hey you can get access to that for free so start saving time and resources by unifying your processes with ODU you can check them out in the description for a free 14-day trial or to set up a demo with their expert team thanks for watching if you guys liked this video maybe you'll enjoy another Deep dive into minor differences in computer performance check out our video where we tested 12 of the same CPU so that we
could find a set of them that were nearly identical in performance why did we need those we'll never tell well we will in that video but not here
