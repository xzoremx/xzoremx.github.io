I may be married to Ivonne but it's Christine who's been on my mind for the last 10 years a project Christine that is at CES 2014 Razer unveiled an idea that would completely change how we build computers and I was amazed who wouldn't be a modular high- performance mineral oil cooled chassis Hardware upgrades as easy as plugging in a USB device maybe even easier but Christine's promises were as empty as they were enticing and every subsequent attempt we've seen at this kind of modularity
has ultimately failed even from some very big names which makes it all the more surprising that a smaller manufacturer kadz who sponsored today's video is making a big move into the space with an absolutely tiny modular computer called The kadas Mind workstation their approach is both similar but also different from what we've seen before remember Google's Project Ara the philm that could be assembled from building blocks to help you get the perfect device for your needs or how about Moto mods those ones
actually made it to Market in the form of upgrade modules for your phone like speakers battery packs and gam pads and they probably bear the most resemblance to what kadas is doing here you start with a solid core Computing device and then create an ecosystem of enhancements for those who need it let's take a closer look then at the Mind we've seen small computers in the past but I don't think we've ever SE seen something quite so selt this thing is small like about three times the volume of my phone small
but they still manage to cram a 12 core Intel processor in here it Peaks at up to 55 watts and is paired with 32 gigs of 5200 megga transfer per second lpddr5 a 1 TB WD SN 740 MBM SSD and believe it or not a battery it's only 5.55 wat hours which if you're familiar with laptops you'll know isn't very big but the idea isn't that you're going to run this thing away from the wall for an extended period of time rather it's so you can pop it into sleep mode take it with you wherever you need to go and
then pick up right where you left off up to 25 hours later it also doubles as a handy battery backup should you ever experience a power outage giving you time to save your work and shut down safely along the rear of the device we've got our IO which some might find a little disappointing both USBC ports support 65 WTS of power delivery in but only one of them runs at 10 GB per second with the other stuck at USB 2.0 speeds for displays both the USBC ports support DP alt mode and there's an HDMI
2.0 Port as well then there's two usba 10 gig ports all of which is pretty good actually for a miniature PC so why the sad face no ethernet which is kind of a bummer on a workstation however speaking of bums the real party is on the bottom watch this you can pop this little tab off down here just like that for one of the easiest m.2 storage upgrade processes that I have ever seen and right next to it is the Mind link high-speed connector and the first mind it linked must have
been mine because the mind dock that plugs into it solves pretty much all of my complaints adding 2 and 1/2 gig networking a metric whack of HDMI and USB ports 3 and 12 mm combo Jack and an SD card reader the dock also has a fingerprint reader for Windows hello and a volume knob that kind of reminds me the ones on Logitech keyboards oh and they threw in speakers for good measure too bad the whole thing is let down by a proprietary interface what I would normally say except it's a little less proprietary
than you might think the Mind link connector is basically just a Juiced up pcie by8 gen five connector with some thoughtful additions first up it's much more compact than a standard PCI slot and for another it's much more robust the slots that you see in a desktop PC are going to be rated for dozens or at most hundreds of Cycles but kadas expects people to use this interface potentially multiple times per day for years at a time so their target was "10,000 Cycles so then I can do this"
right wow the magnets really help make it easy to abuse also their connector allows future products to suck more juice or even blow it I'm talking up to 200 watts in either direction much more than the 75 Watts that you'll get over a typical PD connector oh and did we mention that it's hot pluggable yeah I mean it is a bit of a downer that this thing has no Thunderbolt 4 when the chip does support it but if I was going to plug a GPU into this thing I would rather have the extra bandwidth not to
mention the lower latency of the Mind link anyway of course they Envision an ecosystem with more than just GPU enclosures they are working on that in addition to their dock but also a studio style display and this twoin one tablet thing I'm not sure about that last one but the Mind Graphics is kind of a no-brainer and we've asked them to publish their pinout which could make this interface a significant upgrade over oculink where eight lanee is possible but four is the norm not to
mention easier for the community to embrace than XG mobile which is also by 8 pcie and hot pluggable but completely closed and very expensive speaking of I did a video about hot plug pcie some years ago and it turns out that despite having been part of the standards making a hot swap PCI Express device is pretty difficult and ripping a cart out of a running system can cause anything from weird Behavior to a full-on crash or even Hardware damage so how is kadz doing it the answer unfortunately is
substantially more complex than we can get into but here's at least a rough rundown when your PC boots up the system takes note of all the components installed and allocates memory to properly serve all of those devices no device no memory allocated since this is all done by the UEFI bios before booting into Windows a board or operating system that is not prepared to dynamically allocate new memory regions two new devices is well it's not going to be pretty there's also the hardware side of
things while your GPU might have all the pins to fit in a 16x slot not all of those pins may be used and if the pins don't connect correctly or in the right order it can cause a short or an initialization error that can damage the hardware or data so clearly this requires many precautions so for this reason even if kadas did publish their pin out hot swapability of Homebrew accessories would be very difficult but with their own gear kadas managed to nail it let's see it in action let's start
with the mind with two displays connected to it there those two perfect oh crap the peripherals are connected to the dock well you know what fine you guys saw the two displays light up let's go ahead and connect the other  takes come on hot plug PCI you can do it I saw a flicker I saw action hey there  bad why don't you put on crab RVE cuz it's got speakers in it and stuff that's the max volume which honestly isn't very loud but to their credit they don't distort at that level
so you'll have devices that'll go way louder than that but they sound like garbage past 60 70 80% whereas these sound good all the way up to 100 considering how little it's doing right now C PE temperatures are a little on the high side at 56Â° on the package but to its credit it's also quite quiet so it seems like they haven't really ramped up the cooling system now let's see how it Gaines unfortunately kad's egpu dock is not out yet but some enterprising individuals are using that
super easy storage upgrade slot to put an m.2 to oculink adapter in it then running an oculink egpu like this one from GPD which I mean should work but we don't have one of those you know what that is a surprisingly wide Sound Stage seriously though the graphics performance is terrible yeah we're getting 60 FPS but oh my God look at it we're at minimum boys oh okay medium is not happen and maybe we'll fa better  realistic yeah okay it works of course this is not the point of
a device like this the point of a device like this is the cool interface which by the way contains more than pcie also display port and USB and let's check just how hot pluggable is it oh right I don't have a keyboard and mouse one second one second no no I got this i got this oh wait for it that is very hot pluggable I'm actually amazed check this out boom we're on the dock I think Windows is give it a sec give it a sec I believe whoa look at that undeniably very cool sponsorship aside then this is Far and
Away the most refined attempt at a modular ecosystem that I have ever seen But it comes at a price I understand that quality engineering costs money but the kadas mind isn't cheap so All That Remains is to see how the market will respond if this looks like a solution for you check out the link in the video description to get a kadz mind of your own and using the links in the description below put in coupon code LTT mind to get a $100 off a kadas mind if you guys enjoyed this video why
