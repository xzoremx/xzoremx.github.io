what is up everyone happy Friday and welcome to the W show it's going to be a very exciting show for you guys today we've got of course the big controversy this week why is it that YouTubers keep killing perfectly innocent companies how could they what did those companies ever do to these YouTubers they're so cruel and awful we've also got an extremely special guest this week the one and only Jim Keller I'll give you guys a bit of a longer introduction right after the intro now Luke gets I mean I'm sure
there's something else that's going to excite the people uh uh he's trying I don't know man the spiffing britz PC needed repairs oh you went right what did you do what did what did my heart do to you why did you feel the need to jab something into it and twist build a build a question did I destroy your [Laughter] company I don't know about that uh and Bost Dynamics has a crazy new robot and of course of course in Boston Dynamics style they had to an absolutely psychotic video about it you're were
going to say of course of course and it's not going to be a horse I I missed the video so I didn't know what it was I assume I mean they have a dog uh it's not a horse I just assumed it's more like humanoid I'm I'm I'm messing with you I know what I know I'm clarifying for the audience they need to know things I already wed they can still hear us I know but barely it's there's music  the show is brought to you today by MSI Squarespace and vessie I'm going to spare him having to turn red while we
talk about his illustrious career but of course our guest this week is the one and only Jim Keller current CEO of tens torrent co-founder of atomic semi who notable work includes and Brace yourselves because this is a bit of a list he was the lead architect of the AMD K8 micro architecture and co-designed the x86 64 instruction set he was later the lead designer on the Zen architecture that catapulted AMD back to relevance and now more than he helped design the Apple A4 and A5 the
company's first in-house s so he's the former VP of autopilot Hardware engineering at Tesla more recently he left Intel in 201 20 uh following a dispute we don't need to get into the exact details of that but joined tens torrent as CTO the same year and became CEO in January of 2023 in 2023 he also co-founded Atomic semi a Foundry that's focused on designing and Manufacturing lowcost fabrication equipment which is something I have to admit had flown under my radar and I'm definitely going to want to ask
a little bit more about and without  show there he is hey thank you so much and welcome I'm I'm struggling to imped imped and match your Your Enthusiasm pretty good I think we all do it's okay realistically look I usually have to sell it a little but I am genuinely extremely excited to have you on the show uh they asked me when I got on the phone with your team because we reached out when we saw the the dev kit that you guys have right now so this is on the T torrent side um and I was like okay
obviously whatever Jim's working on is probably cool as so maybe there's something here and so I scheduled a call to it's just exploratory call and they go oh well you know do you want to talk to Jim and I'm like well we don't really take guests on our show anymore but um yes we'll make an exception that would be great w I don't want to waste anyone's time which is a big part of the reason we don't take guests we are notorious for starting our show anywhere from 1 to 3 hours late
and we hate doing that to important people so without further Ado I want to get into some of the community submitted questions we announced that you were going to be joining us and it would have been a huge disappointment if you weren't here but you are so Dylan asks hey Jim I'm a junior Computer Engineering student about to start my first internship doing verification engineering at a big chimp company first of all did I just say chimp company any who doesn't matter the point is
congratulations Dylan he says it's great to see how far open source has gone uh we even learn risk five in our introductory Hardware course oh cool so first of all I want to I want to start with letting you talk about risk five a little bit because that's obviously a hugely important part of what tens torrent is doing right now and I guess I realized I didn't really talk about T torent at all so do you want to give us a short introduction to what exactly Drew you to this company and to their 
wow okay so Tor is a AI computer design company we're designing a high-end AI engine and also a high-end risk fire processor and I think yeah a AI has gone through a lot of evolution and you know it started running on CPUs and then gpus and then I think Google went has the tensor processor and 2015 and we're building essentially array of tensor processors that's programmable with open source uh software stock that we released in January and then there's going to be a combination of AI Computing and and
general purpose Computing tied together and we decided to make a high-end risk 5 processor our AI processor also uses little RIS 5 cores you know to drive the execution of the big tensor processor so and yeah so the and the r five thing is really interesting because you know at some level computer architectures are generic it doesn't really matter very much if it's x86 power PC myips Alpha arm or rist 5 but only rist 5 is open and the Berkeley guys that started it were pretty good
and the cool thing about open source you know we saw with Linux is when it's open source a whole bunch of people can work on it it's a it's a much better Innovation platform and and there's a it's a one-way door when people go from you know proprietary technology to open source they literally never go back Linux killed literally all the proprietary Unix operating systems and I think Solly RIS 5 is going to take over the Computing World which is pretty fun just want to say your student
friends go go ahead I was just going to say if I'm one of those Berkeley guys I'm putting uh Jim Keller said I'm pretty good on my LinkedIn like immediately that's awesome they're pretty good well yeah I could tell funny stories about like you know computer science in universities and computer science and high-end computer design companies they they kind of work together and it's really interesting because a team of a hundred people work together for five years can refine that crap out of
somebody something whereas students you know they get a project and sometimes without that much support and some of those projects are pretty good and and some of them it's hard for it to add up to a lot let's say so you but like like the branch predictors everybody uses came out of universities and the RIS five architecture which is going to let's say dominate Computing in 10 years years is came out of universities and now there's 20 odd companies building r five computers and way more using it so
whether you did it on purpose uh or whether you did it by accident you actually transitioned me perfectly into the second half of Dylan's question and this is he asked forting into a higher level architectes position if you want to work on one of those teams are you going to recommend stay in school go for the PHD or do you want years in Industry what are you looking for I well so phds are really good for some people if you really have a research topic and you really want to go
think really hard but if you want like I didn't study computer design in college I'm an electrical engineer you know my my major is first electromagnetic fields and then when I my my advisor ran the the semiconductor physics lab so I learned about a lot about that and then I took one logic design course and then got a job doing that and then I got a job at digital where I work for a great architect Bob Stewart and then computer Architects good ones know about a lot of different
things so I learned how to program you know do lot to design I know about semiconductor physics I I know a weird amount about packaging and you know signal integrity and all kind of stuff and so if you want to be a computer architect you should probably work on a lot of different things and most computer Architects that are really good at it didn't do it in college you know as a PhD interestingly enough I it's it's almost like a two Arrow of a way to go about it PhD guys tend to be experts in
something ARS tend to be tend to be generalists I'd say yeah so you already kind of alluded to this one as well but William asks I mean you've obviously got experience on the arm side you've got experience on the x86 side you've got experience on the risk 5 side um William asks how far do you think x86 64 can go I mean you're telling me now you're saying look risk 5 is going to be the future you gave that number 10 years I'm not going to hold you to it I mean I can't promise nobody else will but I'm
not going to hold you to it um is that because x86 is out of gas or is it because risk 5 has just got some kind of fuel that we're only just discovering the potential for in the engine which which one is it neither so computers generically you know they fetch instructions decode them and issue them right and the thing that makes the front end of a computer fast is how many instructions can you decode and how well can you predict the instruction stream right so x86 has a deficit in this sense
that you know random lengths instructions are harder to predict but we sort of figured that out it's just harder to do but it's not like a big limitation and then the execution engine goes fast because you have lots of execution units and out ofo issue which is generic to computers and then you have a good memory system with a really good predictor for where the data is coming from which has nothing to do with the architecture so I'd say x86 has a limitation so it's 16 registers variable
length instruction set and it sort of has a pile of old crud that nobody actually needs but you have to build so so it has a tax right but comp Compu performance is mostly today based on prediction and the number of predictors in a modern computer is crazy we predict obvious like where the instruction streams coming from where the next branch is the direction of the branch call return stack we predict the width and grouping of instructions we sometimes predict the results of
instructions so tell me this where the data is coming from so it's all a prediction uh one of the uh a follow-up question from William is you know know could we see cores using multiple architectures could you see someone like an Intel or an AMD an x86 license holder taking uh uh some kind of risk 5 architecture AI processor co-processor and using that for prediction like an AI accelerant on a traditional does it just not make any sense I mean tell me if it's a dumb question I'd love to
know yeah probably doesn't make very much sense so computers are very optimized around you know a particular instruction set today there's pretty good binary translators and they keep getting better and binary translation from like an arm instruction set the r five is relatively easy and back and forth so you'll probably pick your general purpose Computing architecture and then either recompile all the code or translate the code you need like apple switched from x86 architecture to
arm architecture they hardly missed the beat nobody even noticed or cared that's ecosystem andof build but they could switch to r five and nobody would notice her care either this is hilarious uh he keeps beating me to what my next thing is going to be it's all prediction right so I just don't even why do I even why do I bother talking we live in a simulation and a good simulator predicts everything and so so the next thing I was going to this the next thing from Williams question
that I was going to focus on so so he asked okay how far will x86 go do you think armor risk 5 will replace it in the future maybe we'll see using multiple architectures so that's all William's question so far I'm not taking any credit for that or blame but what I will take credit or blame for as this next one I was really focused on the word replace in his question and you brought up needing to recompile code and software is something that I feel like is a a bit of an elephant in the room
you know when you talk about how well you know fundamentally all processors are the same essentially it's like how many instructions can you process but while Rosetta 2 was an absolute Marvel um to the point where just a few years ago I wouldn't have even shortlisted Williams question let alone asked it to you uh but now that I've seen what Apple was able to do with that x86 to arm transition um and what Qualcomm is claiming that they're doing on their upcoming Snapdragon chips with Windows
on arm um I feel like anything's possible and that word that replace word can I expect to go back with with to Legacy programs right um to to stuff that that is that that tax on x86 that tax on Windows and whether it's through uh whether it's through AI or whether it's through on the-fly recompiling can I expect to replace the gaming PC that I have today with something risk 5 that will run and I'm not going to ask for 100% but if I ask for 90% of the software I used to run do you foresee that yeah of course
of course more and more more and more software is written in more and higher level languages like recompiling C programs in Java and py pyth Python and you name it it's getting easier and easier like the architecture mostly doesn't matter now what matters is on a given architecture like we found this we started building like a server stack for RIS 5 and when they went from Intel to AMD to arm to risk five each time you port software it gets easier to do and the hardest Port by the way was Intel to
AMD even though they're both x86 right really and that's because there's a whole bunch of proprietary software in the server stack that was actually Intel proprietary so you weren't which by the way they weren't giving out the port so they had to rewrite a bunch of stuff but all the new software is C C++ it's clean so porting the arm was easier right porting the 5 is pretty easy um the thing you find is like the tool chain maturity like somebody built a binary with some set of switches and
then you link that and somebody mislabeled one of the header files and then you have to be an expert to figure out why this thing didn't work but the actual porting of the software is not not the hard part 5 ecosystem uses GCC and lovm and they're really mature compilers like they literally use the same compilers on the back end for all the architectures you mentioned there the server stack for risk 5 um that's a huge deal and I know there was there was the struggles with
the Intel the AMD transition and that hampered AMD a bunch of stuff it it's going to be a big problem solving the the server stack thing how's that going I know you guys are working on I know some other companies are working on it yeah it's going pretty good so and again this is one of those so so Amazon did a really fun thing so in AWS they put graviton in there yeah and first they they ported some of their own applications so and Amazon's pretty good at putting a gun into somebody's head
and say you will go you know Port the software and get it running and then they said yes sir and they did you know and but then they put it up on the web and said hey if you want to you know Port your stuff to arm it's 30% cheaper whatever the number was and a lot of people said sure that's easy it's JavaScript anyway who cares right and so people started porting it and the more people ported the better it got and it's easy to tell if the application and they made it pretty generic so I think what
you'll see is like heterogeneous data system so you'll so you have a cloud and there'll be some Intel servers for the dinosaur code and then there'll be arm and wrist five or stuff that's already been ported and there'll be a price difference and then people will go you know where they need to keep converting like nobody cares about IBM 360 code or vax code or sun code or you know hpu code like it's it's all gone and and and you won't care about the the games he you ran 10 years
ago because there'll be better games they'll just emulate them or they'll AI emulate them like that'll be the really funny thing you'll say hey I want to go play Super Mario Brothers and you'll talk to a computer and and describe Super Mario Brothers and and play a little video of of of you know YouTube video from the 80s you know that played Super Mario Brothers and it'll emulate the whole thing and and you'll think it's fine that's kind of terrifying uh I can tell you there's a there's a lot of
Gamers watching this right now that are going to be really unhappy about that but we're going to move on we're going to move on guys some of them could be really happy cuz now they have these games that going to get pong from this you know the 80s and and they'll be able to like train an AI engine to play perfectly Nintendo's litigating already Space Invaders all the stuff that we used to play at bars I I can hear Nintendo's lawyers from here yeah um Carol asks as a junior IC design
engineer I often wonder how to stay on the bleeding edge in the semiconductor industry recently I discovered Intel power via entirely accidentally through a YouTube video and blamed myself for missing it for almost a year what is your advice for keeping up with the industry besides just I don't know creating new technology yourself make sure you work someplace where they're doing new stuff oh okay so so what happens this is a recruitment inter lot of places yeah sure we are hard no so you build a
technology like a CPU and you know at first it's new and you know it's got a lot of problems and then you start refining they get pretty good at it and then the the management teams typically go well it's really risky and expensive to do a new one what if it's worse right and you start refining what happens is people get in smaller and smaller boxes whereas when you do new new new projects with like a new team everybody does a little bit of everything and you have to go solve new challenges and when you do
a new project you never use an old CAD tool or you know you you sort of aim forward whereas you know I was at Tesla and we talked to vendors of a bunch of our chips and half of them couldn't do a small tweak to the chips I had in production they've been shipping them for a couple years was it the knowledge that was Miss they didn't have the cat tools no they had the database to run it on the Fab but but they couldn't update it right and it was so so if you're a young engineer make sure you're working
some place where they're doing new stuff and there lots of new stuff going on you did it again um you led me right into my next question uh this one's for me so again I get full credit or blame if it's a stupid question um I've always wondered this uh my lay person brain you know looks at a new innovation uh you know a new a new generation of of Chip whether it's from an Intel an Nvidia um a tense torrent whoever right and I look at it and I go okay but really tell me this this this idea you guys
implemented where did it come from you know how much of that generational Improvement is a we didn't think of it before versus B we needed to try it first but we went small before committing Big versus we totally thought of it uh we totally knew it was a good idea but the process node technology for example didn't allow it we had other priorities like how much of it is a b or c I want I want to know right like 3D vcash I think it's all of them yeah it's it's really weird so I mean in the
platonic reality everything already exists right so we we don't actually live in that world there's literally an infinite number of possibilities most of of them are bad right and so thanks doctor strange it's true like so so that's a problem um so there's one thing which is you work out a bunch of you know architect you're making a new CPU you have a bunch of ideas you say these are really solid but I want to make it a wider issue but that causes you to have to go rebuild the entire cach and fetch
system and then the the more instructions you fetch the better your predictors have to be and some predictors scale just by making them bigger but sometimes you need a better algorithm like the simple Branch predictors we started with were fine for years but if you're trying to keep 500 instructions in a reorder buffer and never flush the pipe it has to be so accurate it's unbelievable now some of those things were invented now here's a funny story which is Intel ran a competition for the best
branch predictor they published the results and the one of them was in Wikipedia and when we first started doing Zen we needed a really good Branch predictor so I looked it up in Wikipedia IA flew over to beat the guy and paid him for a patent you can't make the up now the mathematical so it turns out there's math under these kinds of predictors which is a little related to how neural networks in AI worked right and so the initial predictors was sort of do what you did last time and then the the
better version was keep more track of the history of what you did before and use that but at some point point it started to look more like a computation of you know there's this space of path in the program and can you map compress that space of paths to something useful and then predict which path you should follow on which is related to a field of mathematics and and then it was it really possible to you had enough transistors so more slog gives you more transistors every
couple years and so there's this little and then there's a tradeoff like in the short run maybe I'll make this bigger because it's easy but I can't just make keep making it bigger so I need to find a better idea or do something sophisticated and then take advantage of all the transistors like it's it's a combination of things and then every time you build a computer you learn a lot about doing it you continue to Performance model software continues to evolve and there's some things that used
to be a bad idea that are not a good idea and vice versa so it's you know it's it's complicated let's shift our Focus lot of publish stuff you know like like people don't realize how much information's out there "there's 100,000 people building faster" computers let's shift our Focus people know a lot about what's going on yeah go to AI um because obviously that's that's your next big challenge that you're you're taking on right now um and it's I've got actually a number of different
you know what I'll go with I'll go with one of the ones from our audience um I've gotten kind of an Adder to this one Charles asks AI is set to disrupt the global economy in ways that we've never experienced before not in our lifetimes maybe never ever as a species uh what do you see as your role in guiding an economic future that includes Ai and then my follow on here is as a key contributor potentially to this upcoming change do you feel a personal responsibility for shepherding AI in a
responsible direction or do you kind of go well look that's the software guy's problem I just build I just build the the platform that it rides on like what what's going on here in your mind well if you heard a story and you know the human race has been radically disrupted you know a dozen times in the last couple hundred years you know automation is kind of wild uh my father used to tell me it was the fractional horsepower motor that automated all the fact factories you know electricity
generation was huge obvious you know everybody talks about the printing press books being able to read college educations highway system it's it's it's a lot right and then curtz says AC you know progress accelerates and so it's one thing for something to happen like once a generation but we've gone through Mainframe any computer workstation PC Mobile internet internet yeah you know cloud computing you know always on always connected and now a lot of that's in my lifetime man like what is going so this
is this is a lot of accelerations in one place right now I'm a technologist I know how to build  and we like my part of it is I I really don't think the world be a good place if only the the super rich corporations had big computers right I think AI technology should be available to as many people as possible that the software should be as open as possible I really I really like the fact that some people are publishing really good AI models we decided to publish our compiler stack as you know like the core
of the TPU compiler and video stuff is proprietary and not accessible to to everybody um in terms of managing Society I I don't believe individuals are the right answer to that I think this is a collective effort which needs a lot of people to think about it also but on the flip side in most of the transitions we've ever had the Doom sers have been wrong right we keep solving the you know how does society and people and individuals work together to solve our technology problems and the
balance of power between all the factions you know so I you know I have some concern about it I have a belief in human progress I think I I I like the open source world I like open technology I like products that people can build and afford I'm not really into the one trillion doll computers that only two people can afford you know so my T T's mission is partly like how do we make computers cheaper and how do we make them more open and when we're licens our technology to a bunch of
people to build their own products and you know I think that's that's part of the democratization I'd say of of AI and software in general which which I'm a fan of so so tell me this I mean AI is clearly it's in that it's in that stage right now it's like it's like it's a toddler right like it'll do something one day that impresses the hell out of you and then it'll be you know running to greet you when you come home and it'll trip and nail its face on the floor and it's got a big nose bleed you
know the the 5 minutes later right like it's it it's clearly stumbling around looking for its footing but you see the potential right you see what this thing's going to grow up into how harmful do you feel like high visibility AI fails are um The Humane pin for example is something that we're going to be talking about later on in the show as generated a ton of mainstream buzz and I mean that's that's obviously there's some recency bias there that makes me bring up that versus uh you know talking
about some of the um okay like the $30 million Heist that was facilitated by uh machine learning powered uh deep fakes um there's clearly a lot of a lot of fud around Ai and do you think that sort of Damages our progress in the the long term or is it all just a blip yeah it's all a blip like AI has already been through several hype Cycles it's going to go through more hype Cycles you know the the history is usually the big first movers don't become incumbit like nobody heard of Google and Facebook and
Amazon before they became big you know it was IBM digital equipment Sun Microsystems they're all gone so like there's going to be multiple blips there's going to be you know both funny and you know somewhat scary you know issues but it's you know the human race is pretty big and resilient and there's lots and lots of smart people and um yeah well it's going to elaborate out all over the place you know it's happening as we speak you know am I worried about it I am definitely curious it's going to be a
it's going to be a wild ride okay you you did it again the last 25 years have been wild you actually did it again are you sure we're not in a simulation because the next thing I was going to ask is no no here's here's the really funny part okay here we go like it if you were going to build a simulation you would build in a bunch of things to like let's say limit the computation you need like the speed of light's cool because you can't really see what's going on over there cuz
there's a limit that like things don't interact all at once and the uncertainty principle is really cool because when you look at something really closely it gets a little bit undefined we live in a here's my favorite part of the universe we live in a universe that's governed by three principles the uncertainty principle the incompleteness theory and the UN unprovability problem so it's uncertain incomplete and unprovable if you were building a simulation those would be some pretty
good rules to put into it because that would massively limit the amount of computation you have to do um okay so what I was going to bug you with then is I mean Nvidia very publicly uh very loudly dropped 10% of their valuation today and every time right every time something like this happens um you get people on both sides going no no it's real it's real to the Moon you get people on the other side going it was a bubble they're talking whether it's uh bubble or whether it's
web 3.0 or they're pointing at some other hype bubble um what is companies are bubbles yeah can can can both of those things be true was my question yeah yeah yeah that's like that's capitalism somebody said oh that company's just kicking the can down the road and somebody else said duh that's how companies work right get invest dollars there's no stability okay there's no stability okay then well there's a dynamic stability in the sense that there will be always be 100 top companies but those
companies change continuously like the the myth is oh the you know the super rich will always be rich that's mostly not true the super big companies will always be big that's not true like there's virtually no companies that are 100 years old that are so viable uh speak everybody's got their day in the Sun so okay speaking of which you're at the helm of a company now my understanding is this is your first time in the CEO position is that correct it is okay so I was going to ask
you with that knowledge right like uh one of one of the really famous quotes from someone I can't remember who because I'm terrible at names but um a really famous quote that I that I read at one point was that good leaders lead a company great leaders put the company on a path such that when they leave it becomes better than it was with their leadership um and you know you just said it right like there's very few companies that areful thinking yeah sure I Okay but well hold on hold on let
me let me finish the question before you predict my whole thing and answer it so knowing that a 100 years is an awful long time for a single company to stay viable you know what does your leadership look like is it an in the trenches leadership is it a set the vision and let people do it leadership  it well yeah I I'd say I like to do both I I like Visionary leaders um I worked in you know Steve Jobs Apple and I worked for Elon and I learned a lot from those guys they they both they are both
Visionary leaders but they're also really Hands-On people like Steve Jobs worked on products every day now I did he didn't work directly without many people but I work for a guy talked to him literally a couple times today like hbert who was a brilliant guy and it was very Hands-On and very knowledgeable about everything we were doing and you know and elon's the same way he's like he's a he's a Wonder in terms of how many different Technologies and stuff he can say useful things and have insights
about and he likes everybody to be handson so yeah I'm I'm into the hands on things so now I I'm a Believer what called cre Collective creativity and I like people to own stuff and feel empowered to go do it I played the around the find out video for my whole  maybe fun and that's you know so I like people to get stuff done and you know but also to own it and it's okay to screw it up and fail and as long as you learn something and try it so it's complicated to be a leader if you just
tell people what to do they don't do a very good job if you just pay attention to Vision that's not enough um you have to be ready to willing to work with people and find people like like good people that work for me I have some really good uh Technical and organizational managers and they're pretty hands on people they know what they're doing but they also know how to give people space to go do something useful and it's com It's a combination of things you got to do both okay well
tell me what success looks like pretend for yeah every year we get to build better computers and we we build products our customers like and uh we keep going but here's the funny one so when I was a digital we used to joke that would build computers till the money ran out and then the money ran out and we went bankrupt so I went to am and I told somebody that joke and they said Jesus the money runs out here all the time we've been bankrupt like three times Jerry Sanders just you know he
goes borrow some money or cuts a big deal so like like run running out of money was not an AMD problem and when I went back to AMD we were like months from bankruptcy and uh Jensen's famous for telling everybody they'll be bankrupt in a month you know for most of the company's life and so no like you you build stuff Steve Jobs said you're only as good as your next product right I believe that like people build a great product and you think now we made it not technology no you go make a better
product or the the market changes or the customers want something different or or you learn something new or somebody else learned something new that you didn't know about so yeah success for me is I want a team that's you know engaged and interesting and we're building useful stuff and we build stuff that somebody wants and then my expectation is we'll have to go build something else like keep going of course we were going to have some questions about your time at AMD uh Hector asks uh you
returned during a challenging time which you've alluded to just now um what was the morale like were was it was it fight was it flight uh resignation oo apathy yeah so when I joined there so so so so I worked at AMD I I liked the like when I was in AMD in 98 99 something like that um I like the culture of it's a teamwork culture um Apple was much more of a hard Edge do the best Excellence you know reward the top kind of culture um so I was I was intrigued I knew I thought they were going bankrupt when I
joined um it was closer than I thought they had fired a third of the people I think we ultimately laid off over half the company um but the people that were there liked each other um you know the expression the rats leave the sinking ship there weren't many rats at AMD when I got there they had all left and the people that were there were off of and technically very good and they were good to work with so and I thought it would be fun to figure out how to turn the company around yeah it didn't work you
know like I just get another job it's like like I wasn't really worried about job so so I went in there sort of knowing you know what's going on there were some things that to be honest were worse than I thought yeah nobody talks about the rat that um voluntarily swims back to the sinking ship so I put us you're try to say that well I call SP of Spain well I was friends with Mark paper master and I said I wanted to lead the CPU team and they wanted me to be the architect and I thought I could ever
pull this off if I'm the architect and somebody else manages us to people because building a great product takes a combination of architecture teamwork organization all kinds of stuff and uh I hadn't managed like 500 people before but I read a book about it it's not that hard to be H I read 10 books about it and I hired a consultant who was excellent about this kind of stuff okay so it's a little bit hard then yeah 10 books took a couple of weeks but uh it was really fun and then well uh Rory Reed was CEO
at the time and I told him I had to cancel all the projects and start over and he's like yeah nobody cares if you know if we have like a 50% of the competition or 53 and uh you know go ahead and do it so I had a lot of freedom and then a lot of people had a lot of good ideas you it wasn't just me like so we kind of unlocked it you know and I'd say a lot of people didn't believe in the product some of them didn't believe it right till it was finished really because they were so used to AMD losing yeah well
hold on a second how does that happen Okay this is something that maybe is does not Engineers are very determined people they can work on something they know is never going work but they're having fun doing their part and they just Soldier on like it's it's okay but hold on a second and maybe this isn't your problem because you know you can tell just from the blunt honesty that you you haven't spent a day in marketing in your life um but oh I'm great at marketing I could I can sell you your own
shirt that's a book about it it's not that hard okay but help me out here because this is something that blows my mind is a product will arrive and US monkeys who basically are just like I don't know oo o ooh o Run game you know measure frames per second are sitting here going hey guys you got the pricing way wrong you're at you're at you're at 80% of the competition and you're priced 20% higher and you get people who presumably talk to people who worked on the bloody thing
and they're like oh really and you just kind of go where does this disconnect come from how could you possibly be help me with this how could you possibly be an architect or or someone working on Zen you got your nose right up against this thing and you go I don't know maybe this thing I have no idea how does it happen how can we tell and they can't I'm sorry what question did you asking okay the question you're were saying some of the people working on Zen up until the very end you go yeah they
didn't they didn't believe in it how's that even possible because they're seeing they well they they'd worked on the previous product that was any good and you know they just assumed this wouldn't be I don't know but they got I would tell people what we're doing and they would look at me like Jim we could never do that we're not that good or so I don't know so here's a funny thing so a friend of mine told me this years ago so every company will tell you we only hire the best we're the smartest people
in the world and what he said is at a 100 people you can have a really like excellent group and at a thousand people "you can be above average and at 10,000" all companies are average like it's true just by statistics now there's a question about whether you lead from the top or the middle like there's a bunch of management theories about this and then there's there's a lot of problems with how you do things and then there's this uh risk reward if you have an okay design and you want to
make it 10% better it might be really hard but if you do a new design you aim 30% better you can do it but the risk of that's way higher and so people make bad risk reward track trade-offs like the existential risk could being 50% the performance your competition was 100% and yet they were doing lowrisk 5% moves right so we said hey let's build Zend to be just as fast as I think it's we started out I said we'll beat Haswell which was the processor competition at the time and which by the way was
shooting behind the duck a little bit because we assumed Intel would keep moving but that was my next question was how much how much did in handy save AMD by just stagnating like that I mean 50% okay that's a lot now you need a good design hey and and somebody said uh he always told me I was I I did not bet on luck enough cuz you know I I do what I can and I assume everybody else is doing what they can but I I didn't see that coming so I think that was pretty handy for
them yeah a little bit so tell me right now but it was good design and it was clean so one of the things people don't realize is when we built in you know we had a pretty clean architecture and redid the Catal and methodologies the flows and stuff and then you know zen1 2 3 4 they were able to makes pretty good progress then what happens is at some point progress starts to slow down because you really need to do a big either a from scratch or a big rewrite and then you know to get on the next
curve and that's that's that's one of those complicated things now tell me this um right now realistically the 800 lb gorilla in the space is is not Intel it's it's Nvidia um or unless you disagree in which case I would love to I'd love to hear about it okay good so we're on the same page there and still founder L and Jensen is a really smart guy so it's not only a are you shooting behind the duck are you shooting ahead of the duck where what what are you guys targeting cuz you're trying to disrupt
Nvidia essentially if I if I'm not mistaken I don't care about Nvidia okay then tell me tell me what duck you're aiming at there's so many it's a huge AI is a huge Market Nvidia builds very expensive very high performance very high power products that people like right with very high growth margins turns out there's a big market for smaller AI engines open- Source software licensable IP chips they can buy and put in their own products like that's not a hundred billion Doll Market
I don't need that I'd die and go to heaven at 500 million in Revenue so so I'm building products for other people now some of our products I think are really effective and you know we'll see but it's going to take a while to you know to do that and I have literally more business right now than I can deal with and you know we're working on you know delivering hardware and software and you know we'll see what happens now um and and then the other piece is I think the AI revolutions just started from a
computer architecture point of view and also there's going to be a interesting revolution in how we build general purpose Computing so one thing I want to do this is J personally is I want a really good Ai and CPU design that I can then iterate on as software and models and a whole bunch of things change and so we designed with conscious intent like our AI engine is clean and simple right our software stock you can go read it read it yourself right it's pretty straightforward we're getting really
good performance on it and we have a whole bunch of stuff coming in the next six months that rais us to borrow on it but if we had to say hey there's this new model go rewrite the software I "don't have 2,000 people with 20 years of" technical debt of software I have a 100 great people writing software and the software Stacks clean and say with a CPU RS 5 CPU is it's going to be super fast but it's a brand new design with brand new architecture and it's really clean and if we want to you know radically
change it I can do it I'm not stuck because you know somebody's CPU that's been iterated on for 10 years where three qus of the code was written by people who don't even work there anymore like like we have we own our own stuff which is pretty fun so I'll give you a funny example everybody told me you know there was a big debate about autonomous driving should it be driven by a c program that makes the decisions or an AI model and the Assumption was the AI model is this murky you know
thing that inputs go in and outputs come out and you don't know what the AI codee's doing they had it exactly wrong the C program was 5 billion lines of code written by 100 people over five years they had no idea how that worked but the weird part is it doesn't have a proper loss function whereas the AI model you trained it with a known data set and when you train it you know exactly what its error properties are so which one's better the AI model you built yesterday from scratch with a
known data set with a known error function or the C program written by a whole bunch of people over time that nobody knows how it works I don't know so one of the things I want to do is you know build the next generation of computing in a world that's changing fast so I'm not worried about 800lb gorillas because they don't they don't move as fast speaking of that um yeah sorry go for it it's a fun thing uh do you see other competitors in the risk 5 space as almost like teammates helping legitimize
risk 5 or do you see yeah yeah oh yeah definitely yeah so so like like yeah re just got Ras just got funding the it's company's run by a friend of mine they got some really good designers I wish them the best scii is the good company Chris was one of the original pretty good Berkeley guys as you pointed out that helped build the RIS live architecture uh Andy is a really great company they're CEOs he's a character I really like of a lot they're driving they're driving real stuff I know the
Anana guys yeah like the CPU Market's huge yeah right and to be honest you know having five so x86 was the original open source architecture right they licensed it like six seven companies and the reason it built d80 6800 652 um was because those were single Source proprietary architectures and x86 the original 886 was open now it's it's become proprietary with two you know duopoly you know controlling it but it was the open architecture that's why it won it didn't win cuz it was better all those CPUs
were were crap um and small and arbitrary speaking of there being only oh okay um speaking of there being only two uh we got our hands very recently I'm about to tease an upcoming video here on a centaur processor that uh well it's obviously it never actually made its way to um to the market but Centaur Halls uh it's an 8 core it's clocked at 2.5 GHz and it seems to have risen out of the ashes of uh via um yeah I haven't followed that for a while well no one's followed it for a
while it's been dead for a while but their concept was on CPU AI kind of like what you just alluded to that was very affordable uh they were targeting 500 bucks for this chip uh with on chip AI uh with with on onai um and it just couldn't get over the line was the problem x86 was the problem just they didn't have a good enough team if you don't know much about it that's totally fine it just was it was a funny coincidence that we made a video about it this week and then you brought up that that kind of that
concept um okay so if you're not I don't know it turns out you know building AI hardware and software that works is is harder than it looks let's say like uh my friend Roger kadori said every AI company in the middle of it there's a mole ad unit like and everybody can build one but building like AI is complicated because it's a general purpose computer that runs AI programs so you need all the layers you can't just build a uh an AI engine with a compiler that runs a couple benchmarks
you know there's firmware there's drivers there's security there's interrupts there's every single piece of it and the thing we've been working on is elaborating out that full stack on that subject from top to bottom and and then the other is a lot of people tried to make a a dent in the market with one chip and it's relatively small you know so to drive a car it's going to be couple pedal flops to to run like real time video um we're building the computer which we think will run realtime video
in a single box at a reasonable price but but it's expensive it's a it's a big AI engine it's not a $500 you know 200 Tera flop chip it's it's it's it's pretty serious okay so let me jump in with what was going to be my next question from Ricky um like you said hey it turns out AI pretty hard driving a car pretty hard I mean uh Mr musk has famously promised us that full autonomous driving is x amount of away um I I I kind of am wondering if he had an early point in his career where he
worked at valve at this point when it comes to giving etas for things um and I and Ricky wanted me to ask you okay how far are we really away from Full self-driving because I got to tell you I am relatively speaking an idiot but when we got the promise that you know full self-driving was going to can you drive a car I can well okay oh so you you could at least I'm smarter than your computer so it doesn't seem like like we don't really need AGI to drive cars it turns out cuz Okay pretty funny what I
was trying to say is relatively speaking I'm an idiot but I looked at the claim that you know every current every current Tesla was going to be capable of full autonomous driving and I went there's no way there's no way even knowing what I know it's just there's absolutely no way that they have the kind of capabilities even if I extrapolate even if Tesla is is 10x what everyone else is doing on the market right now I just I'm sorry I don't buy it um so how so so Ricky asks me to ask
how far are we away from True like level four level five True full self-driving give me give me a spitball so well my favorite my favorite crack about Elon is he turns the impossible in the late and then people complain about  and I always thought that that's pretty good um got to raise money somehow it yeah well sure you know Kick the Can down the road buil some products like their cars are great I I have two of them so and I like full self-driving I use it every day and uh it's a little
quirky um but it's getting better no so there's building a big enough enough AI engine so so humans drive cars really well I taught both of my daughters in you know a couple hours to drive a car and it turns out they both have a general intelligence right and so for them conations the subset of that yeah yeah it's pretty good and I I was thinking of AB testing them like like I was going to have one of them like read the rules and then you know go for a drive and then I was going to have the
other one watch like a hundred million hours of video and then see which one could drive faster but my daughter Cather she told me to bug off she's like no way I'm watching like 100 million hours of video to learn to drive a car Dad she learned it like 8 minutes flat like so the the general intelligence seems to be a really good thing now the problem in the cars today is we're trying to put a small AI engine there and get the maximum performance out of it yeah so weo I'm in San
Francisco right now they drive around with no drivers in the car it's pretty spooky and you know that's a fairly heavy-handed solution cuz it's got a shitload of sens sensors everywhere yeah mosquitoes and all that stuff whereas Elon would say like a oneeyed guy with 2200 Vision could drive a car and you know you don't have to be that smart now that that causes the tradeoff cuz the smaller the computer the better the software has to be so I think if you put I don't know five pedop flops in a
car with some of the new good Transformer models you could drive a car pretty fast but there's another weird thing which is humans aren't data intelligence we're computationally intelligent like you didn't get smart by watching hundreds of you know millions of hours of anything don't don't tell my audience yeah well maybe you watch hundreds of hours in the last week but it's only you know tens of thousands of hours it's not not that much information like we get some information we
essentially learn to simulate the world so you you know I don't know if we live in a simulation but our brain chair is a simulation and we haven't we haven't really cracked the AI problem of building really smart systems that like simulate themselves and essentially create intelligence with simulation they they're creating intelligence with data prediction uh which seems pretty smart but it doesn't seem like it's not close to what we actually do I want to arguments like yeah that well people get
a lot of data from from Vision but blind people are smart too like you don't you don't need to see anything to be smart and that's State at all I want to loop back around to one of my earlier questions and this is obviously going to be a little bit of uh crystal ball gazing and I don't expect you to have a good answer for it but I you know I asked okay how much of a generational Improvement is we just didn't think of that versus we just didn't have the capability right now you're really
focused on AI you're focused on risk 5 that's that much is very obvious um but I have to imagine for someone like you talking to the people you do talk to you got to have some idea of what the next thing is I mean obviously um you know Jensen had some idea where he was going with Cuda while everyone else was sitting there going why don't I just have more FPS on my stupid gaming thing right right you know what is there a risk five replacement that is that is you know two two cells dividing right
now um where are we going well let's say it different way so so your brain you know there's there's this theory about you had a primitive brain then a mortar cortex and then an emotional brain and then you know cerebral cortex so our brain evolved to add layers like our cerebral cortex is essentially a high-end planning machine and so obviously animals survive just fine without one and then when it started to grow you have to ask like what was it for and it could be it
helped model the world better and create better planning with better outcomes and at some point the uh cerebral cortex took over most people think they live there in their head so you can do things really fast with direct connections through your motor cortex but most of the you that you believe is you if you believe in that kind of thing seems to be your thought press so in your higher level thinking so today AI computers are treated as accelerators to general purpose computation that's going to flip
pretty soon AI computers are are going to treat general purpose computers like a motor cortex so there'll be AI things running to do stuff and occasionally they'll say generate a deterministic program to do something right as opposed to deterministic programs calling up AI module so that flip is coming pretty fast and interesting the way we think about programming like you were talking about well how are we going to run the old games none of that going exist like and even stuff as simple as video is
going to be all generated like nobody's 10 years going to watch a movie like you're going to live in a movie right it's going to be all real time generated and you're going to interact with it and you're going to ask your favorite character what else going on they go shut up I'm shooting somebody like like this is going to happen faster than you think and like so all the mediums we think about are toast and all the software that's ever been written is going to be gone like
100% I mean obviously there's going to be a ton of resistance to this I mean there'll be a corner there be a guy with a rotary phone and a and an iPhone and a a Java program or something but it it won't be material to your everyday life so okay I guess I'm about to ask you to and feel free to ignore this question if you're just like look I don't need the uh one more you want it so yeah I'm I'm a Believer in um we're going to like like we're going to use AI to rethink a lot of
Science and right so human beings like we have this idea of you get data you have a theory you have a prediction the problem is you get trapped in your theories and so then new data comes along and you can't really interpret it into your theories so all our science is is you know it's elaborated from a bunch of ideas but they're all human ideas and they can't incompass comp Encompass all the data and and I think science is going to go through a fairly big revolution I'm still going to see if I
can get a hot take out of you um when you see for example you see the uh I think you brought up entertainment a couple times you brought up gaming you brought up film uh when you see for example the actor Union uh negotiating to keep generative AI out of film and music out of art um you know what's your what's your take on that this just happened a lot you know there was a big split you know supposedly in Europe I read it in the history books that you know Austria band like knitting Ma you know weaving
machines and and clothing bills and all that stuff cuz they didn't want the people to lose all their jobs and England embraced it and you know one W and one lost so yeah so the writers unions will say you can't use this for this movie it'll create a whole new area where they don't exist and people generate all kinds of stuff and and so technology change usually means you you get on you get on board you get left behind you know now I think there'll still be writers there'll still be books
there'll still be movies made by people for people there's all kinds of stuff like that like you you can buy machine-made clothing but people buy knitted clothing people people like what people do and you know that's a really great thing you know we we like artists like you can get a perfect painting by somebody printed but you still buy the painting from the artist that you talk to because it's some level more interesting but yeah keeping AI out this and that you other thing is going to be a hard
fail I want uh the last sort of big one I know you should probably I think we've kept you longer than we said we would I'm very sorry for that but I promise we're getting we're getting close to the end um we haven't talked about Atomic semi at all and this time I'm coming in without having done any pre-briefing because I like I said it kind of slipped under my radar um you say you're focused that's I'm I'm at the office that's that's an adom okay I did know it was an adom but is that the logo is that the
logo for the company or Okay cool so all I know is you guys are working on lowcost fabrication equipment like when you say fabrication equipment you mean like like asml fabrication equipment what what are we talking exctly but smaller yeah like a little little tiny one like that so you want to what what your wafer is is is like five cm or why tell tell me about okay even smaller  so so the semiconductor technology is great today and all the equipment is great yeah and it got optimized to make
very large Wafers that move very fast yes right you know they're 12 in around like the thing that holds it weighs 50 kog and it moves so you look at all the machines it's it's really hard to build and heavy and all kinds of stuff yeah you got to account for seismic stability of the land make sure there's no ancient burial grounds under it that sort of thing yeah like yeah it's it's amazing right so so I met this kid Sam Zulu like he made made a Fab in his garage in high school he YouTube videos about it and
then I met him when he was in college and we started talking about what it would mean to go build a set of equipment where you could make a fairly high-tech chip really fast but just make one chip at a time and and then optimize the crap out of it because you're not solving the problem of moving 50 kg at you know 100 miles an hour you're not trying to keep something perfectly flat over a huge surface like basically change the game and make something way way simpler and then take advantage of
like there's hundreds of billions of dollars of material research being done you can Atomic you can deposit Atomic layers of almost any material single atom at a time it's beautiful so is the goal to be like deed to go sorry go for it well my personal goal is to go make a a really interesting chip really fast and uh it it it feels like the 3D pror said it's yeah it's yeah yeah it's basically 3D printing you know compared to injection molding right where you you don't have to deal with the enormous
scale huh yeah now the weird thing is if you make them fast enough it could be for more than prototyping right which also happened with this is uh yeah well 3D printing is amazing and it just keeps getting better and better and goes into more stuff and then there's really fun stuff like you 3D print molds and then injection mold that like what you can do today with the combination of the modern cat tools 3D printing injection molding and then CNC and all kinds of stuff it's it's
fantastic and yeah so we're we're into building our own machines that make chips and you know using an unbelievable amount of Material Science research they publish everything you can buy any any any Atomic layer deposition material you want for almost nothing it's crazy yeah super fun okay which um I I mean this is It's almost like a chicken egg uh question right like which uh which comes first for you in terms of of taking tense torrent to the next level in terms of um
of taking Atomic semi to the next level do they drive each other like is this an attempt to to yeah maybe someday real men own Fabs you know as the the famous quote right like I have a Fab computered sign company I have ai software sure why not right yes why not what are you doing this I mean what are you up to like damn boom roasted I make know it's like people hey this planet might get hit by an asteroid or blown up by a volcano man I want to make sure that gets stopped I'm
hustling like they a backup Planet but you know we got we got big problems right here so yeah we got to get moving all right well on that note I think this is a perfect time for us to say thank you so much for coming on the show um preemptively you know I'd like to get out there and uh make it so that you can't say know because it's in front of "10,000 people and say we'd love to have" you on again sometime I know that tense torr has some really cool stuff coming and we'd love to take a look at it once
that's a little more baked and once you guys are ready to kind of engage with us do some videos together uh we'd love to maybe have you come on for a you know a deeper look at you know the the Normie version that we publish on the main Channel maybe we can have a chat about it after um oh thought this was the Normie version this this has been no this is the really dialed in audience yeah this is yeah this is the guys that'll sit and listen to us for 4 hours a week uh this is the WAN show so um
guys if you could just give us uh give us some Applause in the chat for Mr Jim Keller um really appreciate you taking this time on a Friday night uh get to your family please sir and uh hope to talk again soon okay great hey great talking with you guys all right thank you thank you very much that was great all right oh maybe we should do interviews more man that was a lot of fun dude and like I knew from watching some of his other interviews that his answers to things were going to be extensive but I was
like I want to make sure I'm prepared so I had all these questions we got through I don't know a 20th of what I wanted to talk about and we didn't get through like almost any of those and then you had your own it's like that's why I preempted that's why I got out ahead of it cuz I knew you had stuff um and his his staff told me cuz I was like look realistically you know we don't want to take up a ton of his time we don't want the w we don't want the W show to be 9 hours long um I do know could we could
we maybe schedule could we maybe ask him for 20 minutes cuz I wanted to be super reasonable and they were like I'll tell you what you don't want that we'll put we'll put 20 minutes on the thing but we're going to tell Jim some other amount of time that's longer because people get talking to Jim and then I mean is time even real anyway that was so much fun uh obviously we do have to move on into our next topic um yeah I'm yeah that was that was a blast um that could have gone on forever I think
let's talk about Marquez brownley destroys the economy what a pivot is AI going to destroy the economy no it it will be a YouTuber so this is obviously our headline topic for the video today uh a review of Humane ai ai pin by MKBHD has received a surprising amount of backlash with at least one detractor calling it and this is a quote almost unethical irresponsible and careless this particular critic even made an implicit reference to a doctor's hypocritic oath first Do no harm several business influencers
followed his lead framing mark as being some kind of powerful reviewer heartlessly killing other people's nent projects um this is despite some of these business influencers claiming that he bankrupted a company in 41 seconds sorry what um okay so there's there's lots of problems here so number one Humane AI is not currently bankrupt um number two they received a lot of equally negative coverage from people other Marquez he just happens to be a particularly high-profile person and
number three Humane AI staff seem to be largely unperturbed by his review and their social media head Sam Sheffer called it an honest solid review with fair and valid critiques this is another quote I think it helps that Sam is a very experienced person who came from the media side actually so like he's he's been on the other side of this he understands it it it makes sense that he would have a well reasoned appropriate response um Marquez himself has commented on the controversy saying that
a negative review is very unlikely in and of itself to kill a product or a company without there being other factors involved he also stated that his reviews are not to inform or um entertain businesses they are to inform and entertain consumers um and that you shouldn't really get that all confused so I would just like to say heartily that I agree uh as a reviewer you don't owe a brand that sends you a product for review anything the deal is and I laid this out I laid this out back when Hardware
unboxed was Under Fire from Nvidia uh or rather not Nvidia was Under Fire for their treatment of Hardware unboxed and you had these people coming out and  know you know what I'm not going to name any names but there were people both on the company side some companies let's not name any names and on the audience side that had this understanding of a reviewer's role like the second you're reviewing something you are part of the marketing strategy for this product or that you um or that you owe somebody
anything that is not how this works you get the product you evaluate it with the knowledge and with the tools that you have at your disposal and if you like it there is a huge benefit there's an enormous benefit because an unbiased video or article about a product is going to have a much larger impact than paid advertising if that weren't the case and I promise you this I cross my heart and I give you my personal Linus Tech tips trust me bro guarantee if that were not the case
companies would only advertise they wouldn't engage with Independent Media at all why take the risk because the other side of that coin right the other side of that coin you get this huge boost if an independent media says your product is great and recommends to buy it but if they don't like it it stings you don't run that risk with paid media we went through a similar thing we sent our screwdriver out well we've G through things on all sides of all kinds of things when it comes to saying
whether a product is good or not and having people be into it or not I just mean on the product side we have been on the product let's talk about it from the manufacturer side yeah yeah do you want to R going we sent it to I had the Luke experience for an hour that was genuinely hilarious I was trying not to laugh every time I could see you physically reacting and I'm like yeah welcome to welcome to the world um that was epic uh I I'd like you to go ahead and tell your story now no I'm doing it
on purpose right now um no yeah we we sent it to a bunch of different reviewers um and every time that we knew a review cuz we would often like there'd be some form of communication of like when the video would come out but they often wouldn't tell us what like the results were cuz that makes sense um so like we we would know a video was coming out on a certain day and there was so so much anxiety because we have a lot of belief in the product but you don't know like they might test it in some weird
way that we we didn't think of or whatever like you don't necessarily know what's going to happen they might not like the feel for whatever reason yeah they might just plain not like it maybe they just think it's ugly like who who knows right and then the videos would come out and then oh great everybody seems to love it but like it's it's it's a tense moment and there's a degree of kind of knowing who you're sending something to like if I had a product that was functional but not
particularly aesthetically pleasing um you know what I you might send it to someone who's more into function over form yeah I I might you know I'm not I I've decided not to name names um but but I would I might pick and choose my reviewers a little bit if I had something that I thought was um very very very beautiful and and and crafted um you know I might send it to a completely different set and don't imagine for a second that companies aren't playing this game and that they
don't have a certain set of expectations um again a name I'm not going to name but a very large technology channel that is not Marquez but really really big told me that before engaging with them one time there's a brand that had someone on their team go back and watch every single video they'd ever published a to make sure they were brand safe and B to get some idea of where their heads space was at and what they felt was important like I'll tell you this much  that tells you everything you need to
know about their confidence in the product from a out from a nuts and bolts prati oh do you think they don't know who we are yeah but did we reach out we I think we did at some point I'm not sure it would have been procurement team okay but there is absolutely no way that if they if it had there's no way that there was a conversation at Humane AI that did not include what about LT and there is absolutely no way that if I was on that team I would have green lit sending us one come
on what was I going to say about it was I going to talk about the design I'd have been like wow how many I'm sorry how many pixels are in this display I was I'm not going to lie when when some of the videos started coming out on it I I I was often refreshing the LT page looking for uh the the resurrection of kickfarted but unfortunately it never happened no I mean I I'd be down to cover it I think we I thought we ordered one or something this point it might be a little late I
haven't followed it up well I don't know I came up with a good title today it doesn't matter how early or late your video is if you've got a good you got that Banger title that's true yeah so I came up with a good title it was it was like Marquez killed this product or something like that or like I I forget why did Marquez murder this yeah exactly look how they massacred my boy um as long as you've got the title it just really doesn't matter so I'm I'm definitely down to review it I am
intentionally not watching any coverage of it like I did with the Vision Pro so Apple's a company that explicitly excludes us from any kind of early access or Insider information on their products um because they don't like the way we do things that's fine that's fair  um yeah the the cold hard truth the basic truth is that that's how Independent Media Works everyone has their own methods everyone has their own processes everyone has their own biases and the way that you engage is up to you you're
not obligated to send a product to anyone uh the only reason that that whole thing with Nvidia and unbox therapy blew up was because Nvidia said the quiet part out loud apple is so careful Nvidia yeah Hardware unbox did what did I say unbox therapy oh I'm sorry Hardware unbox I'm just yeah yeah thank you the the whole the only reason that whole thing went down with Hardware unbox in Nvidia was because Nvidia said the quiet part out loud they said look if you don't get on board with Ray
tracing and and beat this drum we're not going to be able to seed you products anymore well okay Apple's too smart for that I just want sorry I just want to interject for something slightly off topic for a second just before I forget because I was supposed to do it at the beginning of the show but then obviously uh important things happened um if you're watching on floatplane check out the beta. flow plane.com site we just pushed a a massive update which you're going to notice probably nothing but
it's really big for us and we need bug reports so if you use it run into any problems there's a form in the bottom left hand corner click that let us know what's going on don't tell me in the flow plane chat cuz I can't do anything about it right now but use that form and let us know it's uh we complete removal of the angular wrapper it's all in react it's a big deal anyways sorry back on the topic Avery Studios says MKBHD saved us from a junk product at the end they can go cry on their pile of wanted
inventory and that's that's 100% true I mean I I made a comment a little while ago that I think got taken well okay basically what I said was look um I don't want anyone to buy this about a product um and that was taken as like that I had some kind of bias or something but no and while I do come with my own set of experiences obviously in my own priorities it was it was not a bias it was based on my direct experience with the product and when I said I don't want anyone to buy it it
was that I don't want anyone to waste their money that's my fing job is that you don't waste your money and the reason that we've got you know as many subscribers as we do the reason we have so many people watching right now is because a lot of you seem to have very similar priorities to me and so what I tend to do is with my experience and with my priorities I tend to lay out what the case is for you know you guys as best I can or in some cases like with something like the PS portal lay out
okay hold on a second let's go outside of your bubble for a second and talk about the use cases for people who are maybe not you that's that's what I'm doing when I'm doing my best and we have a responsibility to at least try to be consistent when it comes to the application of our of our rules so if on the one hand we say hey this thing ain't baked it's the worst thing I've ever seen forget about it and then on the other hand we have a product and we say this thing ain't baked but I you know uh
I I I love it and I'm excited for the future anyway then we better have a damn good justification for why we're applying these different standards and we better explain it um I think you probably saw something like that with our coverage of Intel Arc where we basically said okay look we're rooting for this thing darn it we're rooting for this thing it is very good today but here's why it's important I I'm going to do my gosh darnest best to you know try to see if this thing is usable at all um
but no you know I can't give it a I can't give it a straight based recommendation but you've just you've got to explain that and what's frustrating I think sometimes is that you can't count on people to get the whole story I think a lot of people saw marquez's title which was initially the worst product I've ever reviewed or something like that and they just look at that and they go okay well that was all he had to say about it guys I think his worst his worst crime was engagement bait right which
everybody has to do which realis ically we don't make the rules about yeah I yeah um and you kind of owe it to yourself if this is something you're curious about to hear everything he has to say um and you know what yeah am I guilty of it sometimes reading just the headline sure we all are but we can't be mad solely at a Marquez or an us or U whoever you know whoever in the media we also have to be a little mad at ourselves for not getting more than one perspective a finish getting that
perspective and B get a second perspective I have always always advocated for multiple perspectives I have always advocated for a strong diverse Independent Media because the reality of it is you know you are not going to get the same perspective on even something that we we all use in fundamentally the same way right let's say an iPhone what is it well hold on a second it's a computer in our pocket yeah we all use it as that but you might game on it I might use it solely for
telecommunications someone else might use it only once a month when they're not using their daily driver phone because they need to do a 3D scan of an environment I don't know that's why we need these multiple perspectives and I think that for anyone whether you're on the consumer side or the media side to say you know no this is this is the one source of Truth and that truth wasn't right how dare they it's losing the entire plot that's my Spiel yeah and it it  furthermore he's got to get back that's
fine um it was still so fun to watch um also I I'm going to tangent again really quickly I'm stoked that he was very receptive coming back on again cuz that was a fantastic conversation oh Jim yeah yeah that was sick anyways jumping back to this it sucks because like you we I think we all want to live in a space where companies are a little bit more Brazen about the products that they make and and are willing to take risks and and make weird things and push limits and do stuff like that and when you're
in that environment things will fail um there's there's I I don't know if he said it here or it's in a interview that I watched with him in it recently because I think those things are going to blend in my head for a little while now but um he had a conversation where he was talking about how when yeah you can aim for like 30% ahead and you could do that every time if you wanted but you're going to it's a big risk or you can just aim for 10 10% ahead every single time and you'll
probably hit more often um and you it's fun it's fun when the companies aim for 30% ahead y but they're going to miss and it's not our job to say great job product amazing when they do miss yeah yeah thanks for participating everyone go buy it so that they can make a better one for the people who didn't waste their money on this one as much as we want companies to take those chances it's a big risk on the company and it's our job to inform consumers so if the thing sucks you got to say it Y and you need
to you need to boil down why because it's very possible like your analogy with the iPhone that someone won't care about all the reasons why you think it sucks and they might see some of the reasons why it is good as enough justification for them to buy it so it might be a product for them and that's great it doesn't necessarily mean anything but like yeah I don't know it's unfortunate but it is what it is and we're going to keep doing what we do and so will everybody else we sure are I mean

streamers and through your I get it that's super cool you know super chats and twitch bits and all that kind of stuff but the way that I see it you should get something in return for that money they should throw something right back at you and that's what merch messages is all you got to do if you want to interact with the shows head over to LTD store.com check out our actually shockingly wide array of products I forgot to offer Jim some merch okay doesn't matter the point is
we we'll we'll get something over to him I can approxim his size based on anyway uh the point is head over to LTT store.com and in the cart you will see a little box whenever we're live that gives you the opportunity to send a merch message it will go to producer Dan who will what are you wearing is that just the moare from your C oh I see I don't know it always does this cool okay well it'll go to producer Dan who will either reply to it directly forward it to someone who can answer your question
or throw it down here or finally curate it for me and Luke to read on the show uh we've got a few to go through right now just to show you guys kind how it works so why don't we go ahead and get that started sure do you have an ETA on the mouse portion of labs there's an explosion of mice on the market and would love to get some info on them I'll never cash this gift card if it's sometime this year um let me find out in the meantime do you want to read another one sure uh let's see speaking of Burkley I'm
curious if you have thoughts on the recent research paper showing that "55,000 Plus VR users can be uniquely" identified based on head and hand motion  saer I didn't hear about that uh you ever heard of gate analysis as well just by how you walk I know gate analysis I know that because my vision is bad but I can identify who people are by you've mentioned that to me a couple times yeah so um who owns beat games again Facebook cool oh the saber bar it's it's Facebook meta excuse me uh oh yeah I
know Facebook uh oh oh man okay well let me find out about the mouse thing anyway um uh oh hi Gary you're live on the wano give me one sec um the audience noted the absolute explosion in the gaming mouse Market lately and they were all hey when are you guys going to have your mouse  out uh Mouse testing a lab should be figured out within the next 30 days um we have all the equipment in uh it's being set up right now by Antoine and Sharon um and probably in about a week
week or so uh we'll start early testing on it but within about three three to four weeks uh yeah we we should have results and we'll get them up uh for people to look at okay and we'll have uh what are the main things we're focusing on we're obviously going to have like click consistency or or like click uh characterization graphs right we're going to be able to do acceleration we're going to be able to do uh tracking accuracy and precision any other major stuff that we're looking at latency
okay yeah no I that that covers most of it so okay oh man you know it' be really cool Gary that I just thought of and I'm sorry I'm springing this to you live in "front of 10,000 people but um are we are" planning to implement or integrate 3D scanning into part of our product ingest uh process right yes are we planning to are we planning to like publish an STL file on the lab's page so people could evaluate the ergonomics for themselves that would be sick we will eventually get there
yes Luke's cringing he's so unhappy right now anything well it's just a download it's just a file download luk things I'm sure your team can figure it out that's not lusl development let's go L development is a terrible idea all right thanks Gary yeah ju just ask Luke about embedded video also so you know sick all right talk to you later okay take care all right cool so that's Gary had a Labs so you heard it here first um 30 days so soon is what that's the that's the the filtered by management version
of that yeah very very excited for that um I don't even know what what would we even use for the scans cuz I think we've got that like handheld scanner coming but if it's something as small as a mouse I see no reason why we couldn't  um oh bloody hell I forgot the name of the I forgot the name of the company I'm sure someone internally will tell yeah CT scanner um L Luma field I se a reason why we couldn't use the Luma field for something like that oh man that would be that would be sick Elijah says I'll
model it in blender by hand every time no scanner needed yeah you're going to dude I thought anyway Dan uh want to hit me with one more merch message uh yeah sure did you have any more follow-up nightmares about the beat saber identification I just I hate it okay Co thanks I hate it I actually would have been happier not knowing that it makes perfect sense obviously the way that we I had to read it I mean I could tell what member of my family was walking up the stairs you know just by listening to
them and I'm I'm just a monkey brain right like I can usually tell who's walking up to the wet just by hearing how they walk yeah so none it was a matter of time none of this should be that surprising but damn technology you're cool but like also buzz off sometimes you know yeah all right cool what's next I had a bad day as an IT Tech security it told me to connect an infected PC to the hospital workland and log in with ad credentials to investigate felt sick the whole time how
would you handle such a ludicrous ask say no um hm um bring them substantial information on why this is a bad idea and propose an alternative solution that you have also laid out thoroughly of how you can get the results that they want in an easier and safer way yeah that's such a that's such a novice error that I I think it was a James Bond film it was some it was some kind of like spy Spy flick of some sort and the way that the bad guy compromises like the the the lab or whatever is by getting an infected
laptop in and like their like head of it basically just plugs it into the network and it takes over all the screens and everything and I'm just like uh that was actually the inspiration for a video we still haven't made all these years later but I wanted to do it experts react to Tech in movies uh kind of like Corridor crew um now that I've said that out loud I'm putting pressure on the team get that going if you guys have any clever ideas by the way uh where could they post them uh ideas like of movies to
watch of of particular scenes oh yeah one of the opening scenes to the new Tron uh okay hold on hold on hold on though okay we need a place for people to put things where can where can we do that what swordfish just the movie I could come up with an entire script Dan's gonna Dan's going to get a link for you guys to what was it Skyfall was that the one um okay people are saying Skyfall for the one that I was talking about uh anyway yeah so we need we need to get we need to get some scenes together I'd
love to have like Wendell come on and be a guest host for something like that awesome um maybe oh man if we could get it together in time maybe we could shoot it at computex and we could get some some fun of course we can get it together get some fun guests well I don't know I mean I had came up with the idea when Skyfall was in theaters so that should give you some idea I can easily get a list of scenes for you by like the end of the weekend uh release that was in Skyfall came out in 2012
okay it wasn't when it was in theaters then it was at some point if if it was Skyfall I actually don't remember exactly which movie it was I was just going based on when your Linux ISO collector got it people talking about that oh now he knows what movie it was from no I I don't know I'm taking float plane chat's word for it you guys this is this is all I have to go on it's it's you guys who are telling me what movie it's from all right yeah we'll we'll get this going so Dan Dan you're on that right
all uh sure he's going to post a link in chat of some sort about Forum LTT forum is that doable uh I guess so yeah yeah Dan cool he's a cool guy look at him go look at his fingers typ uh all right you know I don't listen to you when you're talking why do we jump right into our next topic uh Luke have you seen this Kickstarter huh have you seen this Kickstarter probably not oh no from okay we're going to watch it together awesome okay this is the paint cam Eve it is a face recognition and paintball
firing security system supposedly uh where's the dang it where's the where's the video oh upcoming project bloody heck no no no there's no there's a video there's a video okay hold on is the video on  engineering here it is uh what what am I even looking at here what is this junk I saw a video I think I got it you got it okay no I don't no I don't okay gosh darn it oh wait hold on hold on well I do I I have videos from other  oh I got it okay you got it okay we're going to Luke's laptop here it is we've
got audio do we care about the audio no it doesn't matter okay cool yeah introducing paint cam Eve an AI powered robotic security system I would like I would like to know um I mean I'd like to know so many things uh face recognition animal recognition where where where is the hopper for those paintballs that came out of there can't be very many that came out of the oh okay it didn't quite come out of the cameras um that's it I got yeah that was it I saw I saw another video a little while
back um can I just say for a no I'm going to get through the thing first Slovenian startup Oz it is seeking funding for a home surveillance system called Paint cam Eve that uses facial recognition and motion detection to detect and assess potential threats it can also shoot these threats with UV paint paintballs or get this tear gas rounds according to Oz it same class the system allows for remote monitoring it's it's nonlethal but can also operate fully autonomously without internet
after identifying an intruder in a forbidden area the device will issue a verbal warning followed by a 5-second countdown if the Intruder fails to retreat the device will aim for their chest and start firing Oz it claims the eve system will be able to recognize specific people as well as animals and specific objects if an unknown person approaches alongside a familiar guest the system will notify the user seeking further instructions so I saw a demo somewhere where they had a known person
standing in front of the unknown person and it like it didn't fire not that that could be faked or doctored at all so I would like to I would like to ask and I guess I'm addressing Oz it directly here I would like to ask your engineer leadership sure have you ever fired a paintball gun do you have any idea why we don't  anymore have you seen how inaccurate they are if you fire at someone's chest with a paintball round do you have any idea what your liability is going to look like when
somebody loses a eye I mean even if this thing worked as well as you think it did even if you with your however many hundreds of you're going to raise on Kickstarter managed to create an automated turret the likes of which many much larger teams have tried to create with sometimes catastrophic results even if you did that the round your firing is so spectacularly stupidly inaccurate that this is a disaster before you even wake up from the weird fever dream that you had and
thought Oh that seems like a good idea I mean people have already made these like of course they have yeah wait didn't uh didn't hasn't a YouTuber made this um I'm I'm only remembering this now what's his I know the channel boy boy I don't remember what the channel where they make the things on is called um maybe I can find it by just looking at boy boy Michael Reeves I mean yeah he's probably done something like that I did a thing that's it yeah didn't he make one I mean we're working on a water
one from my cats to keep them from scratching up my carpets but that's a whole separate conversation the point is hey thanks for coming out uh this is a really really bad idea yeah so it's it's a bad idea uh because most like this is a this is a Creator from Slovenia so we don't know what the laws are there I see a large amount of Americans in the chat talking about how this is definitely illegal and is a federal offense which is why I'm assuming they're American um but like this is this is a company in
Slovenia but uh people have done this I'm going to show off oh yeah it's on my screen now I did a thing as a video I made an illegal home security system where he just straps a paintball gun to a camera on a tripod that like can do things and it uh it I think that yeah they wore t-shirts with someone's face on it and then had it shoot them for a while this is not this is not advanced  it's very doable um and you'll get in insane amounts of trouble because most countries that I know of have some form
of legal system around based around like automated home defense and the way that that's usually set up is because of traps booby traps and stuff and there's been cases where people will like rig a shotgun so that if like a barn door is opened the shotgun will shoot out and yeah that's not okay it's actually super dumb and super bad the damage that is inflicted the the person who ends up being responsible for that is is not the the thing that ends up being responsible for that is not this automated turret
it's you yep and like uh yeah the second this paintball hurts someone or doesn't and then that person just claims that it hurt them yeah you're screwed that's a big one you're screwed immed like people claiming stuff and then I'm traumatized now all of a sudden it's on you to prove that I I can't open doors without fear anymore I need therapy for the rest of my life yeah you're going to pay for it now you're Millions Bob IUS says paintballs can be fairly accurate but you need a pretty long barrel to
actually get the round of spiral that little camera was like yeah Bob yeah Bob brought that up it had a maximum like 2in Barrel there is Absolut and Bob Chris is right at a range of but that's the thing right like out a range of let's say 10 m 30 ft I could probably hit an aluminum can pretty consistently like I'll miss but I'll miss by a little bit like I could hit a torso no problem from that distance every time however the problem is that uh a 30 ft that's nothing presumably this
thing is not mounted like at the perimeter of wherever you're trying to protect like it's it's like a home security thing by the time someone is within 30 ft of this thing if you have it mounted in a traditional security camera location I think it's supposed to be indoors indoors oh well that's but this this security camera thing is indoors Outdoors how long would its range be well that's my point that's even more insane is is you're going to you're going to have you're like facial
recognition someone just walking down the street you're going to have 20 of you're going to have 20 of those feet just in the distance to the ground yeah not not to mention you're going to have to compensate for drop offs somehow okay hold on a second this is getting even more complicated tear gas in your house yeah okay fair enough and then that and then that Barrel that Barrel further complicates it this thing is not going to be accurate it has absolutely no hope whatsoever of being accurate at all I
assumed this was just indoors it being outdoors makes it significantly more hilarious it it I mean there's there's some amount of like you know accuracy in volume where if it's able to shoot just like a huge amount of how the hopper on that thing see one at all so yeah I don't know um if they have like maybe maybe it gets fed through something that's like on the other side of the wall oretty Wrangler says porch Pirates maybe but yeah but if it gives them a 5-second warning I could be off and on your porch
in 5 seconds and the first porch pirate that gets shot by that is just going to tell everyone else they know and everyone else is going to go get shot and then they're going to sue the heck out of you like that'll be the new scam yeah getting shot by these things so you can sue the owners um in probably I'm assuming most countries we don't know about all of them maybe in Slovenia having automated defenses for your home is totally fine say idea um actually I have a 98 Custom where the barrel curves
up it's pretty accurate at long range does not have to be a long barrel yeah but your 98 Custom Barrel is like four to five times the length of this Barrel that's this little tiny security camera Barrel is very small yeah that's that's part part of the problem so many problems uh why don't we jump into our next topic which is sad and happy remember the spiffing Brit te PC that had that teapot pouring as part of the water loop well um we have an update on it unfortunately as we feared it did
indeed break in transit and as we feared the tea in the loop did indeed start supporting life okay so here's a question right off the Hop it broken Transit when did we send this I don't know a thousand years ago yeah what well he hasn't been using it but hold on the story the story continues so this is this is the spiffing Brit PC what was up with my hair that day I you were on a I have no idea what this was only a year ago is this that YouTube thing where it was like essentially two years ago this
was a year and a half ago yeah man look at this is awful anyway the point is here's the finished PC did we ever actually yeah there we go we did an actual Montage so you could check the system absolutely incredible Alex outdid himself uh got that got that teapot got that teapot action unfortunately the system has not been in action uh finding loopholes and exploits on the perfectly balanced YouTube platform according to overclockers UK who repaired the PC the GPU moved laterally in transit causing
the Riser cable to essentially split in half uh I'm only going to check out this closeup here because you guys should definitely go check out overclockers UK's video they did a whole video on this I've seen this before uh I wish it surprised me but Yep this is the thing that happens you can see it it broke so that would explain why it wasn't working normally you want to ship those separately but water cooled in yeah gets a little harder not always an option um the repair team didn't have an identical
replacement so they used a Gen 4 fantex Riser cable with an adapter bracket the water block radiator and despite being gross were successfully cleaned though the pipe through the teapot was apparently too disgusting and had to be replaced yeah I mean that makes sense oh I think they're saying the GPU block was successfully cleaned the CPU block apparently turned out to be restricting the flow rate and had to be replaced as well as the D5 pump interesting are they saying that it was because of the growth
or because uh must be it d5s are it was just very restrictive uh no the block um any I'm surprised they weren't able to clean the D5 as well anyway but well they said as well as the D5 pump right interesting meaning that had the same problem anyway the T has apparently been replaced with a combination of EK cryofuel that is then died to resemble tea and everything else seems to have arrived in working order uh they apparently added their own branded mug to the build okay that's the last thing
that I am going to check out I want to see I want to see how they integrated their stuff into into our original build here here here it is uh so here's their footage so they've added a barrow CPU you block and where's their where's their mug where's your mug at boys I honestly I looked for it I could show me your mug I found no not that mug get it face the Yorkshire Tea box I don't think was originally there I believe it was actually oh that would have been an Alex Innovation I don't see the mug yeah I I
couldn't see it well anyway great job thanks for getting that fixed up why do we ever build computers for creators they always get broken in transit H and the funny thing is like we even we man we went out of our was there okay we we we create things we like couriers are just determined to destroy you know what it I think people don't appreciate what Transit does to things there's a reason that PC companies are like yeah you know what we only build computers in America for Americans because the longer
something goes the greater the chance that it will essentially vibrate itself into pieces um check this out um here hold on I'm just trying to find this thing here we go uh the no where is it dang it there's this new it's either new or it's uh it was recently in the new cycle um ah it's it's a hard drive Destroyer data sanitizer thing inama jig that works solely on vibration what's the company called no no that's not it I I bloody well hate it when here we go Garner there we go here it is okay this
is a promotional product so I have no problem showing this video in its entire or it's a promotional video for a product realistically they're not going to get mad at us it's called the dismantler patent pending from Garner you put the hard drive in check this out  it that's right friends see you later that's some vigorous shaking everything is disassembled it apparently does it in just a couple of minutes or something like that and I think people underestimate what sitting on a truck or
in the cargo hold of an airplane or being anywhere being on a being on a ship with those with those diesel engines going under it I think they underestimate what these conditions do to a product heat cycling increasing decreasing shaking and vibrating um I think I've told this story before but I used to have a very reliable client when I used to do like it stuff on the side um who was a trucker who was actually on like some Trucking TV show at some point or whatever but he would often have his
laptop running on his passenger seat and it would just shake itself to death because they were all hard drives back then and he would come back back to me you know every however long and another hard drive's dead he doesn't need a better laptop he uses it for like almost nothing but he just needed a new drive and I would have I had like his favorite desktop background which was like him standing next to his motorbike or whatever so I would like set it back up exactly how he liked it with the
programs that he liked I didn't have an exact ISO cuz like obviously some things would change whatever um and and I just rebuild it for him every time and then ssds became like a thing and I was like well man I like hate to say it but this is the last time I'm going to do this for you and he's like why I was like I got you a new thing I'm not going to bother explain it but it's not going to die anymore and he was like oh okay cool and then yeah never heard from him again it is what it is um apparently uh
yeah it's apparently doc I was sorry this is totally unrelated apparently doc Martin's you know like the shoes is really struggling right now and uh a big part of the problem might be that they have kind of qualed themselves into uh financial trouble because their stuff just like lasts for a really long time yeah um ssds because of the growth in capacity in performance initially and then especially capacity now I think have kind of Saved themselves from that but I hate to I hate to be this guy oh this is
a really scary thing to say but I feel like we've reached the point now where people aren't going to need to upgrade their ssds that much anymore like one terabyte has been kind of the magic sweet spot for what is definitely good enough for a boot drive for a long time and I might buy some more storage but that was not the way it worked before I was essentially replacing my drive for a long time as we made our way through 60 gigs 120 gigs 256 um and yeah you sure you could run
your OS on it but for convenience people were getting a new system they were just getting a new SSD that was a much greater capacity I feel like we've reached the point now where it's just not really necessary anymore and unless you are you know pulling apple and lock the SSD to the system you're going to be stuck with people just wanting to carry their drives forward yeah uh speaking of upgrading and building quality products that don't need to be replaced very often LTD
store.com we've actually got a couple new products if you guys uh were looking for an excuse to send a merch message we've got our phase these look sick pullover hoodie and uh zipup hoodie and t-shirt these are genuinely super cool so this design started off inspired by um shoot it was something oh yeah it started off inspired by like a VHS low Fidelity kind of thing that Lloyd pitched me and I was like M yeah I see where you're going but M yeah no but you know what take this part that really
reminds me of these um like those image tests and let's just lean into that and he came up with this design that I think is so flipping awesome so these are these are kind of like um res like inspired by resolution test patterns we've got like a little you know color block there just to add a nice little splash of color to the design um I don't know what the 23 is anymore it doesn't matter the point is we've got a few different colorways you guys can check that out we've also got a pullover
hoodie and a zip up Hoodie in the design so there you go I think it looks great and of course it's your typical LTT quality oh look at that we've got Navy  noise test shirt please ignore that's a that's a that's a pretty funny name for it sorry what what's that Luke test shirt please ignore where uh Corey is the name in in chat said you should call it test shirt please ignore yes um you're 23 yeah but that doesn't mean anything Dan why does your thing say when after dark are are are we
out of topic time already no no basically you can just go whenever now uh I know that uh Luke May wanted to step out I'm still good as long as I'm home by like 9: I think oh okay cool uh Watcher leaves YouTube I have to confess as someone who doesn't watch that much YouTube I hadn't watched them before but it's a really interesting business move and something that I thought you know Luke might have some thoughts to share uh Watcher entertainment a media company founded four years ago by three former
BuzzFeed creators has officially announced they are leaving YouTube and beginning their own AdFree subscription streaming service Watcher tv.com according to the founders they have found themselves increasing split between creating the content that their fans want and creating the content that appeals to advertisers and to YouTube's algorithm further they've been dealing with a tension between the costs necessary to maintain television-like artistic standards and the financial
model that is required to thrive on YouTube their hope is that switching to their own streaming service will allow them to build a more sustainable business and rely Less on advertisers the site went live today it's currently priced at a month or $60 a year and they're offering 30% off the first year I assume that that might be a typo here for anyone who subscribes before May 31st as well as the opportunity to vote on which previously cancelled Watcher series should be revived this is an interesting move
mhm I think they're doomed yeah me too I think I said I think it was literally last wow where I gave my like five websites statement uh which is i i i my theory on this I'll try to keep it short is that roughly everyone has roughly five websites each that they go to it's not the same five websites for everybody but most people have like a few websites that they go to and pretty much nothing else and if you leave that Sphere for people you're gone and you can you can sort of exist
in both like you can have a foot outside like I suspect you know the vast majority of the line secp's audience doesn't go to float plane all the time the float plane subscribers do sure but we're on YouTube so our visibility doesn't go away people still know that we exist but by completely leaving the the YouTubes the reddits the whatever things like that Facebooks of the World by leaving those entirely your discoverability goes away now they are planning to upload I think
they were saying like the first few videos of a given series on YouTube but then the idea I guess is they're pay Walling the rest of it so kind of like if uh if Netflix just uploaded the first episode of every series to YouTube that's a better that's a better idea than I I thought it was but I still think that this is going to be an incredible challenge I mean we've um we struggle with all the same things you know how do we balance increasing production values how do we balance and
I do think that it's a little bit um misleading to whether it's our notes or their feelings or whatever I do feel that it's not it's not quite right to say that you have to fight between or or you're torn between what the algorithm wants and what the audience wants because the algorithm and the audience  sameish because the algorithmic audience is the the broader audience whereas I think that if you were to say if I were to say my audience right who would I be thinking of would I
be thinking of a random fby who happens to come across one of our videos one time gets engaged with it watches that video and then never watches Another LTT video no I would I wouldn't think of that person as my audience I would think of that person as my algorithmic I don't know person that YouTube managed to serve this thing to right like they're not my audience when I think of my audience I think of the W show viewers I think of the people who are actually enabling notifications on their phone
and and clicking on them when they come up which by the very small in case you guys were curious I wanted to make a video about that for a while I even came up with the title you won't click this notification um because they won't it's it's like a fraction of a percent or something like that it's like absolutely minuscule um anyway like so there's different ways to Define my audience and so in that sense if I were to talk about the differences between what the algorithm wants and what my audience
wants it makes sense and I think that's what they're talking about but the danger of catering to this one catering to my audience catering to you guys with the mainline content versus catering to you guys with the w show on a weekly basis where we really get to sit down and hang out uh catering to you guys with behind the scenes on float plane where we we'll pull silly pranks on each other and you can kind of see the real personalities come out we'll get we'll get deeper into uh Tanner did a really
cool video doing a deeper dive on that North Korean Wii U clone thing um that's the kind of stuff that we want to make and and we understand that you guys want to see but we can't infect the mainline content with that because that's our Discovery funnel right we need that algorithmic audience and if you're putting out if you're if you're casting fewer Nets out into that sea of potential audience members that audience that core audience is going to Decay and you know I've seen every
reason under the sun for someone to site that they're not going to watch anymore um I had I had someone uh tell me how disappointed they were that um we built such a cheap skate computer for that person who begged for one and um and that it it really showed how not generous we were it was hilarious because it came literally the day after "we raised $100,000 for sick kids right a" video they clearly didn't watch imagine imagine for a second if it had absolutely nothing to do with that and
had everything to do with what I said which is that we wanted it to be something good enough to like really be a gaming PC worth going and getting but not so good that they were going to get like murdered on the way home that was it that that was the re imagine whole skit gets stabbed in the back I think imagine for a second if the reason was just what stab that's not the great part sorry the skit was great yeah um sorry where was I where was I going with this right I I've been given every
reason Under the Sun for someone to stop watching anymore but the reality of it is most of the time it's that you've changed you've moved on I've probably changed too but I suspect I haven't changed as much as you have in terms of the product that we're trying to upload we're we're always trying to do things a little bit differently we're trying to do them a little bit better but the cold hard truth is what's probably happened and this is particularly understandable lately with tech at least in the you
know on the gaming PC gaming side um the traditional PC gaming side getting you know kind of stagnant compared to what we're used to kind of kind of boring compared to what we're used to right um that's probably the the most honest reason that people have given me for for for not watching anymore now if I had a dollar for every time someone said they're not watching anymore because we're constantly making jokes and the juvenile humor you're going like we never did that in 2012
okay buddy yeah that's that's a new thing that's a new thing if anything it's probably gotten less to to be completely honest yeah I don't know maybe that's it maybe it's more jarring now maybe I don't know there's still a fair bit of it I doubt it yeah there's still a fair bit of it so I've done some poking around while we've been sitting here um but anyway okay so hold on let me finish let me finish real quick I'm sorry um so by not by not casting out Nets to the algorithmic audience the
broader audience you aren't replenishing the core audience and that attrition is unavoidable you can't watch the same TV show forever yeah think about it you can't play the same video game forever one person of the audience is like I played Starcraft since I was born and game we're not mostly we're not mostly wired like that and so I I think that while this is something that could be very successful uh in the short term they could convert a significant amount of their current core audience over to this
paid platform uh I I worry I mean it's not like this isn't the kind of thing that we've dabbled in in the past we were one of the we were as far as I can tell the only relevant Creator on vessel.com we built float plane like sweat Blood and Tears built float plane in an effort to to create that sustainability most of the creators on vessel.com stopped kind of doing the Early Access thing all this kind of stuff we weren't the only relevant Creator on the platform we were the only
relevant Creator to vessel in terms of Revenue yeah sorry I should clarify um anyway so I I've done some looking around someone in the chat pointed out Dimension or sorry not Dimension well Dimension 20 is one of their products but um dropout.tv which I think was a really really good call out of a channel that has done something similar as far as my understanding goes actually I'm not even going to go there CU I don't even know but um they do really good job they still get into the brain space on
the main channels they do stuff with shorts um and I I think they might still release full videos here there um every now and again but it's a funnel into Dropout TV for the most part and as far as my understanding goes they're very successful with this they also have a very large amount of different shows and shows with like very di hard dedicated audiences which is exactly what you would need in order to uh do this uh mck says Dropout uses Vimeo as their their backbone provider yes um and I think
that's a good idea I think that's how they should do that if they wanted to do this approach where it's one Creator one website they want the thing they should just use another service like Vimeo Vimeo is a great solution there um and and run it that way um yeah Dropout has a ton of different series and they've been doing this for a long time they're very well set up now uh looking into it as well it's like okay what external monetization does Watcher have so first thing you look for
is there more links on their YouTube channel and you can see patreon so okay let's go to their patreon if I can click "things well they've converted 1,200" members which is very good conversion very respectable they're doing a great job they've got what looks like well fleshed out good teers we could maybe learn something from that um they do you know they've got a 7 this is all Canadian dollars so the 750 is probably five bucks looking at as some form of standardization it's probably 5 USD 10
USD maybe six something around that I don't know exactly um but they've they've got a good pricing range they even have the like wh big crazy one um and they seem to be posting actively so they they they can convert people to outside platforms they shown that they have a very strong outside platform presence um one thing that they might unfortunately find is that patreon is one of those websites that a lot of people go to it might be harder to convert to a external platform non patreon funding
website um I have looked into Watchers website as well watch.tv and this is also built with Vimeo um as the video playing backend someone pointed out that Dropout was done that way this one is also done that way I don't remember how I determined that I think it was this video uh you can pretty easily tell this is the Vimeo player but another fun uh thing to do is like let's just copy this URL um and go to BU built with.com and you just paste in the URL and you can see like all the things
that they're using and if you scroll down a little bit to audio and video media you can see Vimeo um so yeah they're using Vimeo which seems like probably a good idea for what they're doing so they're doing a lot of things well from my judgment I don't know what that matters but um I don't know I wish them the best I hope they do the thing that Dropout TV is doing where they still sprinkle out content quite healthily and really start trying to grasp onto things like shorts
where they can try to convert people look there's this really tasty little nibble from this video you need to go over to this other side to watch it um yeah someone in someone in chat said Rooster Teeth did it for a while but then it just slowly went Into Obscurity that's the risk that's why this is terrifying um Rooster Teeth is not the only example that that's happened to um it's just a really big name uh but yeah this is this is scary  well yeah I don't know man it's uh it's tough
and once you've um you know did I say "1,200 yeah I meant 12,000 sorry yeah" once you've once you've got an audience it's um you know it's something but it's it's small like we've we've got 35 th000 subscribers on float plane we are we are one of the top patreons except we're not on patreon yeah um we've been very very successful at it and still in the grand scheme of things guys the the revenue that we can generate on an audience that small even directly as paying customers it it pales
in comparison to the costs associated with hosting video hosting video through Vimeo is not cheap um and it in comparison to you know what you can generate more broadly through ads and sponsorships and and all those things on on a platform like YouTube I do yeah I do I I worry I worry about them that's all I mean these aren't people that I know personally or anything like that but I I generally think the Creator economy is pretty cool I think of other creators as my my fellow creators these
are people who have gone through a lot of the same struggles a lot of the same challenges that we have and I I want nothing but the best for them um but I I I'm I fear I fear for these kinds of moves they can be and and I'm sure I'm sure they feel it too right it can be scary because once you've once you've  back what else we got today spiffing Brit Keller we talked about the uh o I didn't mention during that merch up dat that all of those uh the lab's uh t-shirt pullover and zip up are print to
order so uh they the shipping will be delayed whoops uh okay this was actually from like last week or week before I don't remember when it was but HP has been sued for their alleged printer ink Monopoly again HP has used printer firmware updates to create a monopoly alleges the newest class action lawsuit brought against the company for their Dynamic security feature the lawsuit filed in Illinois alleges that firmware updates in late 2022 to early 2023 blocked HP printers from using non-hp
Inc cartridges forcing owners to buy first-party ink and lose the value of any non-hp branded cartridges that they already had this isn't the first time that HP has faced a lawsuit over this practice since Dynamic security was introduced in 2016 HP has settled a California class action for 1.5 million in 2019 admitting no wrongdoing but agreeing to prohibit use of the firmware they are facing a separate californ lawsuit seeking injunction against the practice they've agreed to pay about 50
Australian dollars to affected Australians in 2018 admitting the company likely breached consumer law and they were ordered to label printer packaging to reflect the first party initation they were fined €1 million EUR by the Italian government in 2020 in order to modify sales packages of printers and they agreed to settle a complaint pertaining to customers in Belgium Italy Spain and Portugal for $135 million admitting no wrongdoing and they settled a Canadian class action in
"2019 for a maximum of 700,000 CAD" denying they did anything wrong our discussion question is how many times do we have to prove that what HP is doing  stop I don't think there's a limit to be completely honest I think this is just how it goes I think they're they're they're kind of like uh limit testing to see what they will and won't get sued for and they can do it as many times as they want this is like we we've talked about this before about like there's so much money in maintaining your Monopoly
and builing customers that it's worth just getting sued over and over and over again because you're never going to get sued hard enough because everything's mostly just a slap on the wrist so who's going to be the one that finally goes after them I mean the US is kind of woken up recently but I feel like they've got their hands full with uh apple right now oh oh hey should we talk about Boston dynamics's new uh new robot one day one day after they announced that Atlas is no more
they announced a new all El electric humanoid robot also named Atlas um you want to watch the video yeah I mean I've watched it now obviously but it's worth watching again I love how they made it stand up  just dude seriously this legitimately reminds me of iroot like it it it looks more it looks more fake than it does real yeah it looks like it looks like a game it looks like a character out of a  it I've always had kind of a theory that like the the people in the contracts
that are that are working with Boston Dynamics they they kind of want their videos to appear sort of terrifying um I don't know they are Masters Masters at viral marketing I mean they've got four million views on this video yeah and the more terrifying they make it the more people are going to share go oh have you seen this it's crazy it's spooky man the robots are going to take over this looks super cool dude I mean yeah it makes sense right like why do your limbs have to only bend
the way that human limbs do they might as well just like Bend IN in any way that you want but like but still be human shaped so that you can take advantage of how the world is kind of made for humans what kind of jobs are these going to do I am amazed at how and obviously we can't we can't quite tell um but I am amazed at how apparently humanlike the form factor is I I I I I don't know I mean obviously I'm not I'm not uh an expert when it comes to um robotic design much more
humanlike than Atlas was Atlas was pretty bulky Atlas was like a human with a gigantic backpack you know some people are pretty bulky but this is atlas was very like Barrel chested I guess the the legs on Atlas were kind of like naturally curved out so that wasn't as Atlas was hydraulic right this is electric yeah yeah but that doesn't change appearance much it might be the extra overhead of all the cables and pumps and things maybe this is wild dude nuts I just keep looking at this going
like I I thought we were a like I'm I'm obviously not an expert when it comes to robotics right like it's not what I do but I thought we were a lot more years away from something that was this clean and this compact that's what's really blowing me away about this like how how does that have enough battery power to operate yeah on board it yeah like where even is it probably in the chest somewhere but still it's wild yeah right why why wouldn't you just put it everywhere yeah
I mean maybe yeah well more wiring is actually it it adds complication I mean it might help with weight distribution but no idea there's definitely going to be trade-offs there wireless charging in the feet yeah that that you might also not have one battery that powers the whole thing like those those like uh it's like quad where where you would normally have quad muscles are pretty bulky there might be batteries like for the legs in that area not sure or that's just all infrastructure for the knees that's
probably what it is man I have no idea I don't know yeah figure robots we I'm I'm pretty sure we've watched that figure AI video on on W didn't we where it like hands the person the apple and stuff we not watch that I can't remember yeah we did on W we did I don't remember sorry have you seen oh I literally closed it right as you nice while he looks that up Keanu Reeves is apparently going to be the voice of Shadow the Hedgehog in the upcoming Sonic 3 movie nice um the plot of the movie reportedly
involves Dr Robotnik getting his groove back after the events of Sonic 2 so yeah could be could be interesting um okay you ready um yes oh it's an ad nice cool a back pack it's not a back is this it yeah have you seen this do you recognize this no okay so maybe we haven't then maybe Dan and I were just talking about it sorry I thought this was the one that you watched on W you kind of need audio can we get that figured out uh yeah I'm sure I can live without it he's he's
telling it to do something it's going to do something that's I get it it's definitely better with audio because he does reasoning and stuff like through  so like he's asking him to tell him like why he's doing different things and in what order while he's doing a different thing actively with his hands that's pretty cool where should all the dishes go and stuff like that I think is while he's putting the garbage away so he's like doing a task while talking about a different
task all righty and the world's going to be wild and then he tells them like based on based on what you see in front of you where do you think the cup and the plate should go and then he says something along the lines of like I think they should go in the drying rack and then he tells them to actually like do it so he has it he has it reason it out first and then I don't think he says like put them in the drying rack I think he says like okay do that or whatever  yeah huh it looks a lot more useful than 
H all right well good luck humans um yeah YouTube is warning of another ad blocking Crackdown this week they published a memo warning that third-party apps that violate YouTube's terms of service specifically YouTube viewing clients that block ads um are going to be experiencing a Crackdown YouTube was vague about how exactly it would act against these apps Beyond saying that app users May encounter issues like buffering error messages and videos failing to load YouTube emphasized the importance of ads in
supporting creators in their content uh the Chrome Store meanwhile still offers several ad blocking thirdparty YouTube apps so I guess the question here is  exactly trying to get less people to use the platform without watching ads yeah but if you if you're not a premium subscriber if you're not a member of anyone's channel it's pretty brutal and you block ads Oh I thought you were going to say the amount of ads on YouTube is pretty brutal oh no I was going to agree with
that saying if if you don't watch the ads anyways y because you're blocking them and you're not doing any other method of giving them money for using the platform why would they care yeah I think it's it's pretty interesting uh seeing people who do block ads on the platform saying well I'm just going to boycott YouTube and um and I I think they don't really fully understand that they are um they are it's it's kind of like being vegan and saying you're going to boycott McDonald's it's like so I
think you already were yeah who cares their fries are cooked you're not you're not a customer um you are you are from a monetary standpoint to YouTube you are not just worthless you are actually some money vampiric you are a parasitic um they don't care at all yeah and so it's been it's been interesting to see some of the discourse around this on both sides right like I personally see this as a win but not for the reason you think because I mean as a tech Creator who's found ways to monetize our content in
spite of the fact that probably a disproportionate um percentage of our audience does engage in ad blocking realistically you know okay they they crack down on ad blocking they don't crack down on ad blocking it probably it's not an existential little Chang almost nothing to me um but the reason I see this as a win is because in the earlier days of third-party YouTube apps uh Google was very um very antagonistic like remember that Windows mobile didn't have a YouTube app
because Google wouldn't make one and the third-party ones were constantly being hampered uh there was one third party one in particular forget what it's called but basically um we weren't there there wasn't you had to use a browser on Windows on Windows Phone which kind of sucked and while YouTube is obviously taking a stance against thirdparty apps that engage in ad blocking here what they aren't doing and the win that I see here is they are backing down what they aren't doing is going after the third
party apps for existing they are backing down on the changes to the UI that people might be enjoying through these thirdparty apps and basically just going okay look truth but don't block the ads um and I think that's probably about the best offer we're going to get from them because the negotiating power of the users of these apps that block ads is zero it's it's it's less than zero and there's like there's there's some stuff you can argue about like if those users are sharing that content or
talking about the platform in general it becomes more in the like mind space of others and stuff but the value of that is like so incredibly low and YouTube already has oh I don't know roughly the entire planet as its user base so I don't think they care yeah so this is going to be uh I think this war is only going to escalate and I think think don't quote me on this but my understanding is that Google's tools for detecting ad blocking are much more sophisticated than what they have
necessarily deployed I think they are making a conscious decision about how aggressive or not aggressive to be towards ad blocking and yes ad blocking services are evolving but I suspect that they are evolving at a pace that they won't necessarily be able to or I suspect the pace at which they're evolving is reactionary and Google is capable of laying the hammer down in a much more significant way I think in a lot of these like cat and mous type of games you don't necessarily
put all your cards on the table right so like yeah I wouldn't be surprised if you're right yeah so uh Good Luck Good Luck everybody what I hope is that that's where we settle where we can have nice things we can have third party apps that don't shove shorts down your throat or that um or that you know don't fill your um don't fill your space with unnecessary promotion of other videos or that allow you to get straight to the comments or you know whatever the things are that bother you about the official
YouTube app I hope we can have nice things and I hope that the third party apps figure out this is the best deal you're going to get take it now or take it later I guess but you will ultimately probably end up taking it um stickboy over on float plane says if premium wasn't 14 something dollars maybe I would consider it I would never advocate for finding a group of friends and  plan of course not I would never advocate for that yeah I mean I can see why some people might do it right because it would
significantly lower the cost of the YouTube premium subscription for all the people while still contributing at least something to the cost of running the platform not to mention to the creators that you enjoy but I would never advocate for that and like it's not like it would be that hard either it's actually like the systems are just there right I think you just send email invites oh this is interesting Chom Machan says I got nabbed for that the I he checked me really cuz I'm pretty sure
no I have people on my in my f in my Google family that are not at the same address have they changed the to on that  interesting people are saying me too all right well um now shows Luke no I got bumped out I was in it for a while and then I got removed from the Sebastian YouTube family yeah sorry brother mhm hey technically I think steam is up to six so uh nice I'm back in we'll see I mean you can only uh you can only join and rejoin them by the way have we talked about the new steam
family Family Sharing thing or I forget what they're calling steam families I don't know if there's been an update but we did talk about it originally yeah oh we did okay well I've been using it and it's super cool that's all I have to say about that nice yeah I absolutely love it um there's like parental controls now the sharing works great uh something I wasn't sure about because it says that you can only while I can play a game while someone else plays a game a different game from my library and I
didn't I wasn't sure if it would be possible for it to pull licenses together and allow two people to play at once right okay so if any two people on your family Network have a game than any two people could play that game simultaneously yeah that's prettyy sick so you can that would work either that's really cool super cool that's very cool so as long as you know let's say Ivonne and I own a license of a game two of our kids could play it together as long as yvon and I are each playing completely
different games I yeah so cool you and Avon is like two separate entities in this case if you both owned a license to a game then two kids could also play it if you weren't playing it yeah so cool yeah that's cool love it that's really cool and that mimics how it would work anyways if you had two copies of a game at home and they were discs you could put both of those discs in other systems like yeah it would  next uh I don't know shot at piracy what is this Plex has requested that GitHub take
down the Plex reshare repository allegedly because it would contribute to plex's piracy problem despite the facts fact that Plex reshare doesn't host any IP infringing material GitHub has honored this request and replace the repository with a dmca takedown reference it's unclear why GitHub made this decision probably because I don't want to deal with it um though it it took around 3 weeks for GitHub to respond leading to speculation that they were discussing the matter with the Plex
reshare developer and allowing them to respond Plex reshare is primarily intended to allow Plex users to make shared directory browsable on the web which allows people to reshare them without being the original owner the project remains available on Via Docker Hub discussion question is this likely to reduce piracy should we be concerned about companies removing non-infringing tools just because they might enable piracy this is a super weird one the fact that this does not actually host or
even directly enable the sharing of any infringing material there there's there's multiple layers to the  um I'm  confused that a Plex requested this because as far as I can tell the only in the only pressure on them would be political and I am B EX extremely confused that GitHub which hosts all kinds of tools to enable all kinds of piracy yeah I'm extremely confused that  down yeah should we be concerned about companies removing non-infringing tools just because they might enable piracy I
think I think that's the like this developer it sounds like they were using dockerhub and GitHub and it I mean that's probably just going to be the route right if you're if you're pushing something up don't don't have it only in  spot that is frustrating though all right any any other topics we want to  um yeah let's do this one really quick UK criminalizes non-consensual deep fakes the United Kingdom has passed a new law criminalizing sexually explicit deep fakes without consent creating
these deep fakes carries a penalty of a criminal record and a fine distribution however could result in a prison sentence the US Senate is also apparently considering a bill that will allow victims of sexually explicit deep fakes made without their consent to sue the creators um discussion question is it better to deal with these matters using the criminal justice system why aren't lawsuits enough another discussion question is AI and the increased accessibility of Def fakes
forcing the legal system to catch up with this as a problem yes it definitely is um one thing I find interesting is that it's just sexually explicit ones I'm kind of surprised just all non-consensual deep fakes aren't a problem to be honest oh I mean uh it seems like it seems like it would almost be too broad so if I that person looks like me I'm going to sue this person for IT yeah I think it'd be really tough to enforce and it'd be tough to prove whereas I think it's harder to find a
motive for an explicit deep fake um whether that okay yeah I'm not going to get into the motiv there's a huge issue right now of people being very angry about um like I don't really care personally but some people care a lot of when whenever any deep fake is made of them especially people who um they're they're kind of job relies around it right so like we we we've seen voice actors like this recently um where even if you're not doing it for commercial means they don't want you
deep faking their voice ever for any reason yep um and I'm sure there's people that more on the visual side of things I'm just assuming I don't know models you might not be making sexually explicit images of them but if you deep fake them at all their their job is modeling right you're removing their job I don't know how okay with that they are when you're removing their job by recreating them specifically um it's weird it's a touchy point we're headed into such uncharted
waters all right do we want to head into  yeah sorry did you pick one no I had to push the button oh all right thanks Dan I love when show after dark it's  yeah I'll go through potentials we ready yeah I'm ready you guys ready hit me Dan sure hey guys thank you for all the work and thank you for making my Saturday morning educational but also entertaining heck yeah I was wondering what is beyond Labs you consider going into online education like what is after Labs oh um I feel
like right now it's lab yeah yeah let's get let's focus on that for a bit let's get to Labs I mean I think it's uh I think that the opportunities for product testing and better information about electronics are are many um but that's for sort of the business people to decide right now we're just figuring out how to get that data in a in a scalable manageable cost effective way and that's it's a tough problem it's something that very few organizations have solved and it's something that I
believe that we can solve but it's it's  time how is the smart home going light switches and heating do you recommend zigby or Wi-Fi I purchased Wi-Fi devices based on features but now I'm having network issues du the number of devices oh man I mean it's all uh okay so the switches I am hoping that in AI is going to have some of their uh their upcoming switches that use millimeter wave for presence detection I am hoping that I will have some of those in hand at some point so I
can test them and then if it goes well I would really like to use those because motion is just not good enough um I'm still having problems with my blinds um my HVAC has been a lot better ever since I figured out that I had too much Wi-Fi I turned off the antennas on some of my access points the 2.4 GHz antennas they're just they were too powerful they were too close together and even though I was parking my Ecco bees on particular access points um and it's partially my fault for having all
the antennas enabled but partially ubiquity fault for having them all on channel one I had them all on auto and they were all on channel one anyway the point is I'm no longer having connectivity issues with those and I'm pretty happy with the HVAC but there's still a lot to be done when it comes to lights and uh window coverings and honestly a lot of it just comes down to that I don't have the time or attention span to focus on that when I've got just a lot of other stuff going on
it's like okay it's the afternoon on one of the two days a week that I get to do anything other than go to work and eat and sleep um do I go to the swimming pool with my kids or do I play with my light switches I don't know it seems like a pretty obvious one most days of the week because I do have things that I legitimately enjoy like I'm finally working painting my bike did I show you my test pieces yes yeah so I've got a new color that um if I'm a bad boy I'll try tonight and if I'm a good boy I will
wait until tomorrow to try but it's a it's a candy it's a a candy paint's over under on that oh I mean it depends how late the show goes um 40 to 15 I don't know are we playing Super checks tonight probably not you don't have time tonight I don't think okay that's fine uh I I would be murdered I'll probably I'll probably prime it tonight I'll probably prime it tonight and that's a solid Middle Ground then I can sand in the morning and then I can apply paint right away instead of waiting around to sand
the the primer for it to get hard enough to sand yeah it's a candy though so what that means is that your primer coat has to be really even and your application of the color has to be super even as well because the paint is clear so if you have a buildup somewhere it not only is going to affect the surface finish it will affect the uh perception of the color but it's a super cool like kind of shimmery pink um that's what that's what I'm planning to do for my motorbike so
that's the reason um I I did shave the beard for the super shallow cheap butt reason of that I was getting that facial treatment that cost the same whether they did my whole face or whether they just did above the the lips uh but I'm keeping the face clean until I am finished with my painting project because let me tell you I uh painted for a lot of years I've inhaled a lot of paint you know you masks they're not perfect um and I was like okay I know this automotive paint is like way worse
um but all I'm doing is I have like this one thing and I'm just going to go like this and I'm right next to the exhaust fan so I'm just going to go like that one time and as soon as I did it and accidentally pulled in just the tiniest bit of air I was like hm poison so uh let me go there's a reason why none of the firefighters have beards yeah let me go get my let me go get my organic uh you know filtered nonsense and and everything and even if I'm doing one pass of the sprayer I will be
putting that on every time uh so that's that's good to know yeah um Jack says uh why am I on Twitch why am I looking at twitch chat well so it starts with automotive paint ends with super glue a paper bag and a back alley yeah um I believe you though that that's you know uncommon uncommon twitch W good take witness me paint this bicycle thank you Dan you're welcome don't forget eye protection or or uh tinan will get angry at you uh yes I don't have bespoke eye protection but
I'm wearing swim goggles that seal so that should probably be good enough perfect y okay let's see what's up next I've even got the full bunny suit actually but I don't put that on every time mhm which I think is why I have um these marks on these pants cuz I'm pretty sure these are new oh okay yeah that sucks cuz we I don't just have an unlimited supply of the LTT cargo pants all of mine are prototypes still we  yet howdy LDL pronounced latle Ladle ladle how do you Ladle lonus what's the
biggest compromise you or ion have had to make with each other when implementing new tech into your house I mean that's a better question for Yvonne than me uh she's had to make all kinds of compromises like her lights staying on and elus had to has to make few I don't know how she hasn't murdered you for that yeah it's kind of it's kind of a miracle um she's a very wonderful woman and and I will never get  voluntarily yep moving on hello W crew is the labs hoodie the same as the Dropout hoodie I recently
got the Dropout and Hoodie love it it is not I didn't think so but I didn't want to say for sure no it's our it's our standard hoodie the drop out hoodie is a sick upgraded hoodie and if you manage to get your hands on one of those uh while we had it on promo you are very smart and if you buy one now you're also very smart it's a really nice hoodie it's it's probably not fa H I don't know it's hard to pick favorites it's like kids right like I don't have a favorite but it's a
really great hoodie and I wear mine all the time you probably be upset a little  know you I more oh well okay and the point is yes um what's next hey lldd I love listening to you guys talk about product development what is something that is significantly more complicated than you thought prior to LTT store or  plane uh I was reading a different message what file downloads I did not realize how critical it is that video loads in chunks until we tried to overcome the it challenges
around just allowing people to download the file continuously um especially when a new video drops we would have this challenge where the more people are hitting it the more longer it takes for them to download that continuous file and the more detrimental it is to quality of service whereas when you can feed everyone in chunks you can balance all your different users and you can accommodate many more users much more easily obviously I I was aware of Chunk loading and I was aware that people
obviously do it for a reason but I had never really sat down and had a about it until we were up against the challenge and the reason we were was because we offered streaming yes but float someone thought it was a great idea okay to support downloads I thought it was a cool idea just like how someone thought it was a great idea to support live streams the idea was that people could whether it's you know for their own archive on Plex or whatever else keep a local copy of the content as
part of a park of having a float plan subscription DRM free blah blah etc etc the look the point is that yes it's much more challenging than I personally thought it would be it's not actually like hard to do it's just yeah cuz like if if first of all most people don't watch 100% of every single video they try to watch through like a a vaud streaming scenario but if they're downloading it now they're downloading the entire thing for sure every time right so okay so it's guaranteed to take
more bandwidth on average for the people downloading it than the people not downloading it for the people streaming it um and then you also have the issue that if a video say the W show say someone has a script that automatically someone has a script that automatically downloads every single VOD that shows up on float plane that's going to include vods of the WAN show so now they're downloading like 4our long videos but they don't want the download to take 4 hours if you're streaming it you can
deliver it to them over the course of the four hours which they probably won't watch the entire thing of so you're saving bandwidth anyways but no they want it fast so yeah downloads are I  whatever LT store whale here I own multiples of almost all your merch and love the quality the one thing the rest of my loves is the onesie when will we get a new design probably never it hasn't been a big mover for us and uh I don't think we can support the various sizes in a completely different
design adding skew our skew count has ballooned and we need to pair it down it's unfortunate because that's like I've I've heard this feedback before and it's like I don't know Emma wears the onesie like all the time yeah the the challenge for us is that a lot of the time um we still in spite of our incredible reach in the tech spere we still struggle with marketing yeah we have really good quality products and the feedback like go on the go on the bloody site and read reviews the
feedback on the products is great anytime I see someone talking about how overpriced our products are I'm like well you're a idiot because you clearly either don't understand or appreciate quality uh or you do and you've just decided to declare it a something and you've never even tried it they're good products and occasionally even a good product can have a lemon like well you know a seam will rip once in a while but that's what the trust me bro guarantee is for um so we've got a good product we
just I don't know man we uh we struggle to move volume of it I think part of it is just the focus of our product development there's been a lot of Linus Le development when it comes to the um the direction for our physical Goods it's just like you know stuff that I like stuff that I think is good I think is is comfortable um and we yeah I mean crystal says I got the logo notebook today it's so nice yeah it's great we sell like two a day or One A Day or something like it's not it's not it's not
meaningful um so something like that may very well get discontinued uh unless we can kind of figure out how to Market things better and until we figure out how to direct our product development a little bit better it's going to be hard for us to um craft messaging around it and so it's it's kind of a chicken and egg thing so we're going to have to have some stuff fail in order for us to succeed better at our core competencies yeah this is the onesie yeah 89% of the reviews are five stars there's no two
star no one star but there's only 38 reviews yeah dude we don't around but like guys we could use some Word of Mouth you know yeah like because it's it's great yeah I don't person I I don't personally like onesies but like I know a bunch of people that do Emma loves them wears it all the time it's like one of her favorite garments maybe if it wasn't called merch yeah I don't know I it could be yeah it could be a perception thing I think a lot of people assume that our merch is is is is merch it's just some
piece of crap with a logo silk screened on it or whatever but like even our printer you know for all the for I mean you guys have heard me talk about our printer and our fr with you know the scale that he operates at and and all that kind of stuff but are we using someone else yeah no why because he because he cares right like he he he cares about his craft he does a great job and that's something that we respect more than you know an additional printing capacity  so I don't know man we can't uh can't
win at everything there it is hey D have you had the chance to watch The Fallout show yet if so what do you think I was rather certain he hasn't I haven't I don't really watch shows I was wondering if you have no all I know that it's Canon the whole thing is Canon oh that's unfortunate but I hate that but it's a bit of a meme because Fallout New Vegas had three endings and Todd Howard said that they were all Canon did he okay I thought follow New Vegas specifically wasn't Canon it's it's
basically this thing I don't know I haven't seen it I'm not sure what the public perception is no Fallout New Vegas is not canon wait never mind I read this wrong no The Fallout show didn't make New Vegas non Canon and then when Todd Howard was asked my understanding is that he said yeah it's Cannon uh Howard told IGN there might be a little bit of confusion in some places but everything that happened in the previous games including New Vegas happened so which ending happened H all
of them huh all of them it's a Multiverse they're going Multiverse no no makes sense follow Multiverse yeah let's go when the atomic bomb blew up it created parallel realities wow people really want you to watch this show Luke it's also all simulation they want you to watch it good luck with that I don't really watch shows what is it even on I don't know no I don't have it  wink Luke your front end refactor to react is impressive what's the motivation and how long did it take guys
you're not going to convince him telling him it's on Prime that's going to make it worse that is actually the least convincing platform yep don't have it tell you that much um yeah he's not going to give Amazon a dollar nope um but I might check out someone's isos  uh the react conversion thing um use Linus's account do have one we we needed to do something um we needed to either majorly clean up what we had on angular uh or refactor to react it was honestly going to be probably a fairly similar amount
of work to do one or the other and at the point in time where we made the decision I think react made complete sense I think if we were making the decision now it might have been less painful to stick with angular angular had a massive update recently which looked really good um but we're very happy with react the team Jaden especially I think is like super super stoked about the migration that's happening or at least where it is now it was a little painful along the way but he's happy with where it is now
people are happy with the fact that we're going to be on react um react is is a heavy component of the lab's website as well so something that's all warm and fuzzy for me is that my teams are working on similar platforms which is which is very cool I like that a lot um so I think the end result is better than if we stayed on angular even knowing that angular did get the update um because I like the cohesion of of you know across the teams working on similar things um so yeah I'm I'm very happy
about the react refactor codebase is in a much better space now um a lot easier to work with uh yeah it's just just better overall Jam's done a great job um and I I also like the sidebar thing that were're the the platforms that we have flow plane um and the lab's website the like independent platforms that we have I can't can't really count the store because Shopify runs the vast majority of it um but the the independent platforms that we have are becoming more and more similar over time in regards to
how they're built how their bones are set up so that if you were a developer that worked here you could potentially swim between the teams and it would be less painful which is cool  yeah got another one for us Dan I do hi w. D I bought the Chevy Volt based on linus' review and it's the best car out there love it any major uh repairs or tweaks that you had to do for the car and what should I do to keep it in good shape nope uh some some jackass uh sideswiped me in the suicide Lane and knocked my mirror off
that's about the only issue I ever had with it volt oh yeah that was ages ago how you talking about your current car I was like how many billions of dollars is that going to be oh man I curbed it oh no yeah my winter Wheels it's not that bad but I'm really upset that's unfortunate it's always the first ones yeah well no Ivon curbed it once already on the Summers but uh that one was bad enough that I had it fixed uh Jake knows a guy Jake knows a guy for everything of course
Jake knows a guy my guy's now Jake yeah exactly um yeah so Jake Jake knows a guy uh so I had that one I had that one touched up U don't don't forget I I spilled muriatic acid in the back of it though so like that the first scratch was a was I forgot you did that doozy she was a doozy that is impressive fortunately the floor mat covers it like you actually cannot tell if the floor mat's in so whatever um yeah drifing on Sunday's uh battery acid all over the back yeah ex yeah Lonas I remember from a previous
W show you said you used to be an avid hockey fan ever ever considered AHL games my local team recently played Abbotsford and it was a great time I have heard it's a blast I have never gone I've also heard that um there used to be a roller hockey team in Vancouver I heard those games were a blast as well I bought into the hype of the roller hockey no of of NHL oh NHL yeah yeah like I just I was like I don't know NHL and the convenience it's on TV I very rarely would go to uh
to an to an imperson game but I I watched on TV I would just I'd put on team 1040 back in the day AM radio and listen to the to the talk show talk show hosts and stuff like I was I was into it but I didn't like physically attend anything it's the convenience of following professional sports right yeah I I went to a game with my dad at the Langley Event Center um and it was really fun to be honest it was it was interesting because like I was I was talking to my dad uh I think we saw who was
it I think it was I know we've gone to go see the bandits there which is the basketball team but we it was the Vancouver Giants versus someone I don't remember who um and it was really fun and you get that like i' I've watched some NHL games where you can tell they're like you know holding a lot in reserve this isn't the playoffs let's not get injured whatever these guys were going hard the whole time it wasn't a playoff game at all and they were just like every play they were just sending
it every play you are potentially getting scouted yeah so they it was it was very high energy the whole time regardless of what the score was it was very fun to watch um I had a good time I don't even remember who won it was just like entertaining the whole time through so yeah and the tickets were cheap closer it can be more interesting when um everyone's good but not so good that they don't make mistakes yeah like what's more exciting a a a clean tight defense or a big giveaway in at Center
ice and like it they're they're so much better than me that I would look like a clown so like which we know for sure because we've tried it yeah I can't skate um nerd Sports it's fun to watch um but so like the skill Gap is there that you're still watching people that are just like incredibly good at this thing so like that's that's established but then they're not necessarily quite NHL level maybe some of the players are and they'll get scouted up or whatever but it's it was uh it was very fun to
watch why still know atx2 vo I really want to see it take off and while the BTF format seemed like the perfect opportunity to do it they're all still using the Legacy specific intercompatibility man uh it's going to be it's going to it's going to take off in pre-builts and then and servers it's happening already there um in fact i' I'd be surprised if they don't go even higher than 12vt in servers uh they're going to want that efficiency and then over time eventually maybe we'll get it
on the desktop but it doesn't look like it has any momentum right now okay line luky and Dano what's your thoughts on automatically Chang changing twitter.com to x.com how did Shenanigans like netfit twitter.com get past quality assurance well I don't think they have much in the way of QA right now like it's pretty obvious that it's fire them all yeah yeah just it just seems to be a zoo over there right now um you know about this right no oh yeah so any reference to twitter.com in a tweet they
were just automatically changing to uh x.com so people could have S twii tt.com and it would go to that website but it would change the  sex.com so any URL that ended with an X so that's why they were saying netfli twitter.com that would show as netflix.com in the Tweet but if you click it it would go to netfl twitter.com so like fishing was a huge concern I think that mostly people who um were smart raised this as an issue and it mostly probably these domains didn't fall into the hands of too many
Fishers but probably some people some people got screwed over by it they just they just do stuff over there these days I act fast yeah Break Stuff and break a lot of stuff good job guys yeah what is the worst piece of tech that was adopted on mass early SmartWatches without even a day of battery life seemed like a terrible Mass landfill product I mean it's a pretty good example um adopted on math oh pdas I'd say PDA gained enough mainstream acceptance um and the man the
life cycles for those were so short like Palm pilots and stuff people used them for a couple couple years essentially threw them away because they were getting so much better so fast and the early ones were terrible a couple years is not bad for a tech device getting a couple years I guess but I mean it's a pretty substantial amount of E-Waste I mean yeah was was like everything that's fair Tech that's my answer it's all eventually eways uh just potentials left feel free
to curate or we can just go through them human are dust to dust e Wast is sand to garbage oh that just makes me sad humans return to the Earth and Tech just goes goes to the pile it's more more depressing yeah from Earth to pile Earth to pile sand to garbage We Gather here today to look at the Apple Leisa oh whatever poor Lisa TSA took my Black Shaft screwdriver so I guess I have to buy a stubby line as you mentioned not doing another onesie for another low volume products for other low volume
products would you consider doing similar to mass drop um I don't know we could but I I realistically don't think I think you guys would be surprised at how many onesies you have to order yeah in order to do a run of them it's like hundreds and hundreds like I just don't think we'd uh I don't think we'd see the demand I mean we do it with PR t-shirts but we also have to have reasonable turnaround times for these things like people get antsy when we say hey yeah this is a print to order and
it's not going to ship for a few weeks there's people messaging us after a week and a half going like where the my order right like uh it's exactly where we told you it was going to be it's U not created yet um and if and with the way that delays can occur with the way that quality issues can crop up at the last minute I just I don't need that headache in my life I don't need the money that badly I guess is what I'm trying to say is like yeah I could say okay yeah we'll do a
onesie in a new pattern and it'll be great but then if we get it in and the quality sucks like now what I I don't I don't feel like I I I don't want the headache is basically what it comes down to sup Duke D land and land Linus do you know uh do you ride your bike with your LTD backpack on if so how well does it do after a slide uh there's a couple people who have posted backpacks post accident on the subredit uh personally I haven't wiped out with it on uh I wouldn't say that it's a good idea it's
not Kevlar reinforced it's not armored or anything um so you should definitely have proper gear aside from your bag but um I do ride a motorcycle and I it you know it is something that I considered whether it would be comfortable with riding gear on and stuff and I like it some other people like it but it's not uh it's not a promoted use case for the  product hey LDL you can fight over who is the first L thanks for all the entertainment over the years what brand of optical DP cable are you running for
your racked PCS for the game room it's me infinite cables yeah shout out infinite cables uh hey Luke even registered that L uh no I'm reading stuff Luke is gone so I got dibs nice oh on the first l y whatever that's fine you already took the name of all the else I bought the company for a dollar that means my name's on it I'm the biggest l i I do I do I do often regret going with that we tried I know you and Ed really did try yeah Ivon tried to talk me out of it too ion Tech tips you know you know what the
example I cited was for why I just thought it didn't matter you could just call the company whatever it could just be my name it's who cares like people will just not think about it that way do you know what it was no Rogers sugar I was like nobody thinks about that probably someone named Roger or something Rogers invented the Sugar Company it's just Roger sugar who gives a and I was like just whatever Linus Media Group it's not even the public facing thing the Channel's already Linus
Tech tips anyway what difference does to make turns out a lot yeah anyway nice hey tall short and in between if you could collaborate with any Creator brand or celebrity on LTT store who would it be and what would you make um I mean I wouldn't presume to tell any Creator what they should or shouldn't make I I would want to know their ideas I mean who have thought lwig would be passionate enough to make a Beday I wouldn't have seen that one coming in a 100 years the reviews by the way on the
store are great he was really into Beday before he sold Beday uh I guess I guess we have these listed under other that makes sense but  stars it's white plus how about a casual 88% fstar reviews here let's go awesome yeah but these are cool or warm you scrub down your whole body with soap and water and all this other kind of stuff do not use a pet for that and then you then you have your then you have your poopy butthole and you're like nope paper's good enough I will put this I put this paper that is
designed to disintegrate yeah let's just go with that and then I'm just going to kind of run around then I'll walk around all day like that I don't know the days are good hi deline nuke what do you think about buying online movies you can't own and then pirating it or screen recording is it worth it to buy the mov movie sorry what's the question buying online movies you can't own and then pirating it or screen recording is oh so like buying buying the movie on like a like
um I don't know where can you even buy movies these days who cares yeah YouTube so buying the movie on YouTube and then just being like well it they got my money I don't care about any of this if my collection goes away I will now guilt-free pirate and ISO for this and put it on my Plex server I say that's up to you yeah personally that would be well within my bounds of what I would consider to be acceptable because at the end of the day it's not by that company to be clear I I believe that that still
makes it no less illegal but I don't care but I agree I the rights holder got their money yeah that's that's what matters what matters to me um and oh shoot oh man I was going somewhere with this um well doesn't matter the point is block thing yeah the point is I I would do that completely completely oh yeah I know where I was going with this in fact if anything I would say that if your goal is to ensure that the rights holder gets paid that's actually a lot better  Blu-ray because that Blu-ray was already
paid for and watched or whatever like for me I that's obviously well within my bounds as far as I'm concerned as long as I have bought a license of that movie at some point I'm like I'm good um but yeah if it's like a really great movie and you want to support it in some way but you're just like no man I'm not going to log into some stupid website or put the plastic disc what year is it right like yeah just buy it and then pirate it I don't care I'm not going to that's not that I am the judge of any of
this and I'm not I I'm not a legal this is not legal advice but for me personally I consider that to be okay for me personally and that's a personal decision everyone has to make for themselves personally uh geeky Vapor says so if I saw a movie at a theater it's okay well that's up to you that's my whole point it's all is it's always up to you you're acting outside of the law effectively yeah you need to draw your own moral lines that's all I've ever said guys all I ever
said whatever happened to upside down PC cases that opened on the right side panel with the motherboard upside down everyone needs their PC sitting on that side of the desk I don't know I personally run a reverse case there you go Dan has them all I I have the one that supports it now yeah what is your favorite part of product development I think I like brainstorming the most I've always been like a like an idea it's energetic yeah it's it's exciting uh before before you get into
the real World anything is possible you know like oh man we could what if we made a a laser pointer out of failed  shafts did you just do that again did you do that thing again I think we've talked about that before we're making a fail pointer yeah yeah it's it's going to be made out of failed screwdriver shafts um it's hilarious Thomas had some serious reservations about the ergonomics because the uh the the the cell that I wanted on the back and I wanted it to be user
replaceable and all this stuff he's like he's like dude this thing's going to look like a like like an ant Queen like it's got this giant ass on it um and I'm like no man you just kind of sits like right here in the hand and then the battery is going to last for like hours and hours and hours it's going to charge with USBC it's going to be like really good probably be fine it might look weird but once you grip it it'll be fine and no it's not going to be like a strong blinding laser it's just going to 
be never play with your pets with a laser it is dangerous for their eyes but if you were to do it this would be a reasonably low power laser pointer that would run for like hours and hours and hours yeah that's all I got that's it that's all I got too that's the end of the show hey guys thank you very much for tuning in we will see you again next week same bad Time same bad Channel bye
