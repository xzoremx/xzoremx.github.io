the networking in our studio is pretty epically fast I mean look at this that is 48 ports of 25 gig networking for our editors and our ingest stations not to mention these six 100 Gig uplinks to our servers but uh watch this why is my internet broken oh not again Jake why does this always happen if this one network switch ever dies or even has an issue our entire network goes down and not just here in the studio but also in the lab and here in Creator Warehouse which is where our merch team designs
our products and where I do the segue to our sponsor T get super affordable phone plans with awesome freebies and excellent customer service from T they "were rated excellent by over 9,000" unbiased customer reviews on trust pilot stay tuned to learn more about their custom plans now In fairness toell even though we bought this switch on eBay 3 years ago we've never had an outage that was caused by it or either of our other Dell switches but the fact that it hasn't happened yet what the holy
doesn't mean it couldn't happen someday in the future after all these switches are basically just really reliable fancy computers but one reliable point of failure that's not how we roll anymore mostly this my friends is how  done oh my God lonus it looks good right Hey Jake helped I just died inside you made me feel so bad of the one I did over there all it needs is some patch cables and it'll be good as new wait they made it even better uh-oh I already saw it before Jake I haven't seen it
like literally at all yeah it's um oh wow that's that's nice yeah I mean it's you know it's nothing you know like what we did oh which is good we made like lifechanging improvements this is really just aesthetic it's cosmetic yeah what is this this is a yeah they've got that one cable out of place you see them hiding back there Bo yeah boo what's this cable here it looks like it's a special cable the question now though is not how good does ours look how good does theirs look that's
not what anybody's interested in especially us right Jake ours is better the question is is it all configured correctly so that I can come in here rip the power out of this switch and the whole network stays online can I Stand On This Server that's fine right but I mean you're already doing it you guys ready hold on hold on hold on Jake you're not going to get more ready in the next 5 Seconds here we're ready oh my God okay let's go find out come on come on Andy don't cut the
camera hey how's your editing going good good see you later I honestly have no idea if you don't even work at that desk d what are you doing hi is your computer running it is running then you should go ahead and catch it Network working oh good everything was fine and nothing bad happens that's normal and that's what we expect is it actually working I mean it should work Jak what of course it's working yeah to be clear it's better to just have them both up what I'm just going to put this back
but that was pretty cool right that is where these come into play and I'm really excited to tell you about these new switches but before I can do that we're going to have to make some room in the server room oh I make some room in the other server room that one's going to be bad to be clear it's not like we couldn't put the switch is here it's just that when we specked out this room we didn't realize we were going to be putting such long servers into this rack and we ended up with some clearance
issues with our pdu see look I can't even use any of the plugs down here oops fortunately we have a solution this custom painted orange rack from Hammond Manufacturing is both wider and significantly taller than our existing one is this going to fit in the room oh boy at least it looks like we have a plan the rack goes on here and then we push W yeah those are mint this thing weighs 350 lb cool oh uh I think this is not going to work gentlemen new plan we're putting it on the pallet jack and
we're going outside what could go wrong I can't see a damn thing oh boy and then it goes downhill hold on well we may want to no go for it it's good we're good we're good okay we've done stupider things uh yeah we've done stupider things recently you weren't there for the 115in TV oh that was really stupid since we're walking I've got some speeds and feeds for this thing it's basically the canyonero of server racks 7 ft tall 30 in wide 48 rack units and it weighs in excess of 350 lb that's without any
hardware in it what well yes I I well that's what I asked you guys I didn't have any plan I planned to hire experts who would have good plans for how to do things oh my God are you sure about this oh yeah if I die make sure you catch it on camera oh yeah yeah it would clear just fine no it will clear okay all right not so bad okay stop stop stop stop oh okay Mr it won't move now says oh it's moving too fast okay fine go woo all right okay now hold on just a gosh darn second here holding how is
there going to be room to maneuver this thing in there is that is the other rat coming out we didn't think this through they're not bolted on not bolted no they feet so there it is right there defeat don't scratch hey nice wow these casters though this thing is built better than some houses it's oh and bigger too don't step on the door I'm not going to step on the door God he's literally stepping on the door I'm not stepping on the door I'm stepping on the cross braces that are by
the door part of the door well it's doorish I mean look look at this I got my full weight on it it's not even doing anything we can get rid of those cage nuts immediately we'll be using rack studs available now LTV store.com o what was that noise what was that noise it's a good noise and yep there we go this is probably enough space for the other one right yeah it should be all right whoa stopping there Cable Management who needs it see look how useful you are one two three one two three one two yeah now
you can go to the side just a bit slowly yeah yeah yeah no no they're good they're okay now what you guys it takes up the whole room this is your new bedroom We Ready boys barely boy hi there okay shove towards us moving okay that's definitely the paint I think we're going to have a bit of a Timber moment here I'm trying to get to Dan okay perfect okay yeah okay Holy balls this thing is huge yeah this is ridicul what were you guys thinking we could have just put two racks in here you need more rack units
oh we're doing that anyways oh you saw the other rack right what other racks there's another one are these yeah yeah for where here we're just we're  just look at the color on that wow it's got a combination lock on the back oh my God there's a den inside get get him out get him out it is really roomy wait this is the back then this front and back oh sort of of the back is for patch cables  cool Dan used nerd punch it's as effective as it ever is in all seriousness though what are we planning
to put in here are we transplanting everything y so an Dale goes at the bottom switches and everything goes at the top and then that one's leaving no that stays well what's going to go in it that's going to be the rider rack so that when Jake wants to mess with all of our networking gear he doesn't take down the entire lab and cost you tens of thousands of dollars a minute wa W wo woah wo I mean the cost's not that high okay it's a slight hyperb but you know and there it is the real reason we're
doing any of this because Jake wants a play toys rack cuz we could have made this work I don't know this is much better I said we could have made it work any Dale doesn't even fit in it it's in it right now barely not all of it we're going to leave my play things in there which is like half of it so my it's not actually that bad yeah but the networking is the worst part that's why you have Sean and I yeah I was kind of think can we go do more fun things than just leave them to
do the grunt work yeah and then it'll be done properly at least half of it'll be done properly you guys ready yeah look at that that's awesome oh so easy almost as awesome as this switch I'm ready to tell you guys a little bit about it this right here is the S 5232 f- n it's got 32 ports that run at 100 gbit Each of which can be split out into 425 G gbit ports it has a total switching capacity of 3.2 terabit per second half duplex so 6.4 then bidirectionally and these things are
massively configurable because when I say they're going to be the topof rack switches on both this side and over at the studio I mean they're going to be a pair of top oh God that's heavy top no no I got it I got it a pair of top of rack switches because the main point of what we're doing today is to add resiliency and redundancy to our Network by the time we're done I'm going to be able to take one of these rip the freaking power connector out of it and the whole Network's going to stay up
right yeah they each have redundant power supplies wow 750 watts that's not as much I guess it's just Optics there's no Poe right yeah that's a lot for not powering anything else and ooh easily serviceable fan modules of course it's a right management Adele Management Port and and I love the rails these things come with they're toolless and super easy to install these might be the easiest toolless rails I've ever used 46 and 44 all right Boop yeah this rack's too tall for me to work in
this is my maximum reach I have to Tippy Toe is this the work safe approved way to do this oh God oh God I can't reach oh God no I'm kidding I'm kidding I'm kidding I will I will note that he is standing on the bottom of the rack to give extra height I am stabilizing on the bottom of the rack look here's a banana for scale  baby oo this might actually be too nice for us that's why it's sha andiz and you get the other one got him infrastructure rack and the rider's rack I'm getting
very close to just requisitioning this rack as my own man this is a fine rack but it has super small PP energy next to this one this side is going to have its own challenges because as much as we tried to keep things organized we're looking at about 8 years of total Tech debt and Frankenstein Solutions yeah I'd like recable Managed IT like 3 years ago but I did it a couple times before that it always just kind of turns into spaghetti the good news is in the long term I think what we're going to do is
move everything around to the front of the rack and move the Vault and maybe some of the other servers over here to the labs side because we've got a nice fast link that we worked out with the city between the two buildings now is this the part where we just start ripping stuff out uh well Gary kind of wanted to keep internet but too bad I guess our transceivers don't come out Jake oh God yeah that switch got a little bonked a long time ago and well in in transit from eBay to us oh great
so now I get to do this to keep our fibers safe you could just send it and I'll just clean them after sorry Gary I unplugged the internet update for you guys we came up with a brilliant idea these switches don't have a ton of vlans conf figured on them but this one does cuz that runs a bunch of our security stuff so we figure okay if we just unplug everything then maybe we can move this down three notches where it needs to go according to the plan without actually unplugging anything yeah good
luck everybody okay you can pull it out now you ready no no no top one top one oh sure the top one doesn't have handles Jake got it yeah there we go we only need one of these 48 Port 10 gig switches now so we're going to keep the original one and then we're going to hold on to the one below it as kind of a cold spare pull it out that's fine okay we were a much smaller company when we configured all of this and you're quite sure you don't support the idea of just having the other room be the main server
room correct wait you're not just knocking cage nuts into the rack are you a little bit well Jake come that came out that's fine okay other side now tell everyone you're great idea he hates it when I'm right but he likes it when it saves him a bunch of work I'm sitting here going we only Built from both sides of this rack because we had no space yeah well now we have space you just watched us install it so why don't we just move everything around to the front and then this is hilarious remember that
switch that we were super concerned about moving because of all the vlans well guess what I just took every cable painstakingly and plugged it into a dummy switch for now and then I'm going to pass them around to the front of the rack and I'll just be like okay one two and we'll build it from the front if it's stupid and it works it's not stupid yeah I I like this because I've wanted to do this for in February it will have been eight years I never did this because I liked it or I thought it was a
great idea it was always janky we just didn't have anywhere else in the studio to put rack down equipment you know the the main reason I wanted to do the mother Vault aside from the old one being Jank was so we had more rack space so I could eventually do this nice it's been a long time coming so basically fiber patch router one router two we don't have both of them so it'll just be one of them for now Dell patch Dell patch Dell patch I think there will not be enough devices plugged into these two
that we will need two patch panels very likely only one way to find out do we just YOLO and hope that it goes well sure oh hold on there's locks on the strain reliefs on the power and everything okay all right jeez man okay you're good that's my baby yeah yeah yeah new new new oneic four the plan today was not to just Strip This rack but that's done now what time is it right now it is 2:00 we have an hour let's go fast oh my God we need to move all these patch panels now which is nice uh they're all labeled
which is great except a bunch of them are not it's all the ones lonus did that aren't labeled you got that last one yeah oh yeah that's it okay dummy switch comes out okay now we start going fast I love how the payoff for this video is going to be so much worse than what we started yeah like the server room is just like destroyed but one day when sea and Dan spend 3 days recable managing this it will be great we have two of our switches installed we got the Dells racked in here fiber patch panel we've
got the microti running temporarily to keep internet running for Gary while we switch everything over sorry Gary and uh yeah everything's racking well the lots of cable management is beautiful and everything's coming together right Dan yeah we got the pdus here too which is great come on oh god oh my god there are hard drives in that fine all right here we go that was not very good I don't even care that much when you kind of drop a hard drive now that I remember back to when
you actually yeed a hard drive totally lived this is such a relief I remember the conversations back when we decided to build from both sides of the rack and we were like well this is the only way we can fit all the stuff so I guess we're stuck with it but I hated it then I hate it now this is so much better it's almost like we have two server rooms or something now and the other one isn't a Harry Potter closet you know that these stairs are so wide because this room needed to be wider right M so
what you're saying is this is entirely your fault yes the issue is that we realistically couldn't afford more so I'm not going to apologize for it we cut all the cabling from the ceiling so now we have to fix all that cuz it wouldn't fit we've got all of our networking gear in here now and the back actually looks tidy now I'm trying to make up for the sin that I cost in the ceiling right now we have Al what used to be Alpha Del which is our 48 port s4048 in we're putting these ethernet
patch panels in a spot that is eventually going to become a like bber patch panel but we can just pop the keystones out at that point or rather Dan and Sean can and then I guess we're just moving more patch panel like it's awful I know but it's going to be great one day this is about to get interesting we have to put the two new Dell switches the 32 Port 100 Gig ones here and here which would be fine if the various contractors who had come in at various stages of in this building's history
hadn't made complete spaghetti out of all the cables going into the patch panels uh I don't know if they're going to fit in here I never know quite how this happens but every time you clean up a server closet or like a tech room you find all these things that are not plugged into anything man this is going to be awesome being able to like restart one of your core switches and the entire network not go down I like and all those years in the early days Jake using rails that were not tooless and whatever the
cheapest rack mount stuff that I could find was I did not know what I was missing oh well you actually got it in for once good job yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah these things are flipping crazy Overkill when Jake told me what we were getting I was like why we have no application that actually requires these but I think really it's less to do with the speed and more to do with getting the latest OS and all the latest features oh I haven't even told you the long-term plan is pretty cool it
involves having two routers here at the very least we want want them to be redundant if our open sense router poops the bed I have no idea what I just unplugged the other one takes over automatically sure the long-term plan is we have two routers at both buildings and an internet connection at both buildings hear me out what I don't want to pay for two internet connections oh yeah whatever we'll figure that part out and then we can use OPF or bgp to like route the two buildings and if one
internet connection were to go down for whatever reason we could assume the other buildings internet connection over here and vice versa so redundant internet connection redundant routers redundant core switches also these switches are probably going to be our routers at some point and then the open sense boxes will just be a firewall um so cool that second internet connection better be just like a basic residential thing yeah it can't really be I'm not paying for two internet connections it's not
happening I don't really care I'm good with my my want can you stop knocking cage nuts into the wack I mean it's not as bad as used to be when we had servers that had the backs of them open all the time I remember this one time one of the servers was open it was one of the 45 drives ones and I knocked something into it and it sparked God oh God and then I never told anybody and nothing ever happened but something was dead in it said the best part of this is that everything uses rack studs now I can ask
Luke to make it one of their quarterly goals to take all the old cage nuts out of here right I think if we had a networking Esports team like from our networking and infer department they should call themselves The Rack studs license the name it's a great team name yeah there's definitely an appropriate amount of patch panels per number of ports here definitely you mentioned earlier we're going to transition to using these new switches as our router but I think for most of the consumers
out there that doesn't make a lot of sense but yeah thanks Andy but Enterprise switches are very powerful they have very robust operating systems why would we not setup effort High reward pretty good but why do people care about those things for us it's mostly inter VLAN routing you can imagine a VLAN it's a virtual Network it's kind of like you had 20 virtual routers you could have 20 VLS and 20 networks it's all kind of in one the big thing is if you want to pass traffic
between networks which maybe that sounds why do you have them split well sometimes you want one device to talk to a device in a different network even though you don't want all of the devices to talk like a writer's workstation being separated from an editor's workstation well if they both want to access a server and they're separated it's got to Passover right now that would happen on our open sense machine which it's pretty fast so it's probably okay but imag you're doing 10 20 GB it's
going to start to become a bottle and this is just running commodity some kind of mainstream Zeon processor in it whereas these switches are running as6 that are flipping optimized for networking yeah you can imagine it would do that at line Speed without issue and the other thing is it will be local so if that's happening in the lab between two networks in the lab it doesn't have to come back to here in the studio it can happen there so you're it's just way more efficient also the the internet
connection sharing thing I talked about earlier but okay here we go sounds like maybe that's not going to happen yet oh hi Jak this is awesome so good it would have taken us so much longer to do this from the back we would have gotten to the point where it's time to plug everything back in and go oh crap I forgot how hard it is to reach in here and access the power outlets on everything just G speaking of accessing things let me access my Flex box oh this thing is so cool have showed
you this before yes I did at the land party yes you did uh Flex Optics aside from making Optics also makes direct attached cables we're going to be using these to interconnect our Dells uh taking it back to that redundancy thing for them to be redundant they need to be connected every device Downstream of these is now going to be connected to both so if one switch dies this magical cable will allow the connection to Traverse between them but in order to make sure that these cables
are going to operate with Peak Performance and reliability you're supposed to use Dell Optics except that sounds expensive well they actually sent us some and then they never arrived cool the cool thing about Flex Optics you plug them into here open an app on your phone and I can type you know Dell 100 Gig 1 M and this becomes Dell 100 Gig 1 meter and you plug it into the switch the Dell switch doesn't even know that it's not a Dell cable awesome as far as it's concerned it's D all right time to
put some servers back in the rack some crazy Overkill servers so you guys think it's me driving the completely Overkill infrastructure that we build around here but often it's in spite of me I'm at my if it works don't touch it stage of my life uh well we got the whole front patched in all the mvrs are in everything's patched up everything's good to go Dan is doing cabling in the back and all we have left to move over to the infrastructure rack is anell which does all of our off-site backups
from Studio so that's all that's left move that over finish up cleaning the cabling and then we're pretty much done here I'm waiting for Studio to come back up online yeah they took down the whole building yeah they took down the internet everything it's all I told I told Gary 20 minutes it's been two 2 hours or 4 whatever and then yeah anale and tidying and putting the shelving away and cleaning up out there I'm putting the sides back on oh Dam I'm putting the doors back on it doesn't
look like much right now but man is this ever easier to work on and we are really close to being ready to fire this up these are just all editing workstations right so I don't have to worry about any vand nonsense or anything uh yeah yeah I mean right now this switch is connected to the router and it's it's getting the vlans now I'm just about to connect our ubiquity 48 Port so we can have Wi-Fi cuz that will make my life supremely easier also you never plug the power into it which one
ubiquity you know I've been doing stuff here okay doesn't look like it I've been doing lots of stuff he go plug that in will you I'm working on it come on boy get it together hey I'm working here oh Jake went away he wanted to show you guys something he made a number two good job Jake good job Wi-Fi is up okay great all right that's good now where's the Goddamn Cloud key what was the problem did we ever figure that out the problem was they were switched not switched like Network switched
like hey there we go it adopted and like remembered it's config now okay great nice the Wi-Fi definitely works hey guys hi thought you guys were supposed to be the professionals our cable management on the other side looks so much better I tried really hard our side looks like actual pasta ah yeah I thought I'd uh try and absolve myself of this sin yeah uh no this looks great this is amazing you know what came in really handy is these guys here yeah yeah yeah LTT store.com soon TM Cable
Management boom it holds anything anywhere it's awesome absolutely phenomenal yeah especially the big one you can take like a big old freaking thing and like all of these are just one of those yeah exactly that's what I'm talking about in all seriousness how are you guys doing here it looks pretty close yeah we're nearing the end here we just got to deal with some of these power cables and then of course get these back up onto the ceiling sure um and then I think that's about it okay we gave up you gave
up I mean we told Gary 20 minutes to take lunch so that we would be back up and then we immediately moved the micro tick and got everything ready so that Gary could continue doing his job yeah so here's the thing we got about 30% of the way through and realized that moving everything at the back of the rack was going to take way longer than just pulling everything out and rebuilding it all from the front so that when it's time for you guys to UNS spaghet the thing at least you can see
what the heck you're doing so that's what we did yeah we are not going to get the full redundancy that thing up and running today oh why because it is time for Jake to go to the airport okay well we still got Sean and I it's also time for me to leave okay so we're staying here till 1: a.m. no oh as long as the network works we don't need the redundancy working okay I know I'm acting all surprised and stuff but it should work and it does work for a number of reasons I mean you can see in
the UniFi thing there's only one Upstream online on all of those switches right the second one hasn't rebooted yet every single switch Downstream of the Dells is connected to both both of them and then both of the Dells are connected to that link we have through the street to the other building yeah and they're also connected to each other with something called VT or virtual link trunking um traditionally you would have like an lacp or an aggregate link between two switches well the Dell takes
it up a notch and instead of just between two switches it's between one switch and two ones above it and if one of them goes down you still have the Redundant link and it just works what's even cooler is if you have a situ situation where it's not like the switch just died entirely it's more like the fiber got cut or the direct attached cable is screw and it needs to get something on a switch that it's not currently connected to it will like route over the connection between the
two Dells and back to that switch and what's even more cool is that it only took like 5 minutes to set that feature up you know what else took only 5 minutes brainstorming this segue to our sponsor T are you tired of feeling like you're stuck in a phone plan that doesn't meet your needs or is too expensive meet T Mobile's build your own plan with T's build your own plan you can create the perfect phone plan that suits your lifestyle and your budget with options like 2 gigs plus unlimited talk and text
