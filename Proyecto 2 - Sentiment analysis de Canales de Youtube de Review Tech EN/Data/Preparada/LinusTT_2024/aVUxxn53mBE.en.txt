dasung promised that their paper like you would be the world's first eink monitor that was actually usable we felt usable was a pretty strong word there's supposed to be text up here you're terrifying here but never mind that they said we have a new monitor that will be more powerful more sexy and more colorful than you could possibly imagine okay wait though colored eink now they've got my attention and apparently yours as well here it is okay that's pretty cool boasting 3K
resolution the 25.3 inch paperlike color boasts full color ultra speed refresh rate special xcolor filter technology a multicolored front light and even a stylish backl but is the grass really greener now that the grass is really green well you guys saw the title so you know it's going to be a little complicated so let's dive into the Tech that makes this thing tick and see how it handles everything from the use case that it was designed for to ones that are well o o o funnier like this funny
segue to our sponsor War Thunder you got to admit it would be pretty cool to fly a jet or drive a tank well War Thunder gameplay is about as close as you can get from the comfort of Home play for free at the link below E in the kleenex of electrooptic displays works by susp spending charged pigment particles in a capsule filled with viscous liquid the capsule gets placed between two transparent electrodes that can send a charge either attracting the particles to one side or attracting them to the
other side of the capsule if you zoom way in and you slow things down a bit you can actually see the individual particles floating to the surface of the capsule then you just take a bunch of those capsules put them in an array and you got an eink display but how dides color work well okay one thing you could do is you could add colored pigment to your capsules but now hold on a second if all we can have is a positive or A negative charge well how do we make sure that it's the colored particles that
rise to the surface of the capsule well we can change the size of the particle if we add slightly larger particles to the mix then we can take advantage of the momentum of larger particles so we can hold the positive charge just a bit longer and those larger particles will accelerate and smash their way to the top pushing the smaller particles out of the way but wait a second hold the charge longer you mean even longer than a black and white e in display yeah like two frames per minute
longer so clearly desung had to go a different route let's take a closer look using this handy dandy USB microscope we can zoom way in on this Monitor and see exactly what's going on here would you look look at that just like the monitor or TV that you're watching this on right now it uses a color filter on top of the E Ink layer but if we look closely things get pretty weird what is this sub pixel layout okay we need red green and blue in order to make white right so here's a triangular pixel with my red
green and my blue that I need to make white right and you know here's another one but the problem is that in order to make another pixel that's right in line with this one I've got to go way over here I'm missing an entire row oh wait okay no I see it we can have a triangle here and then we can have a triangle here and one here and one here and they're kind of offset and if we look closely at the surface of the display it's got almost like these denim lines running through it so that makes sense
our subpixel layout is these nested triangles is what I would tell myself good job lonus if it wasn't for the fact that these are not sub pixels every pixel on this 3200x 1800 display is either red green or blue to show you how this pans out in the real world we made this test image that is a 3200 by 18800 checkerboard pattern now every other pixel should be black and every other pixel should be a color I mean if you look at the display it's kind of gray so in a sense this red green and blue are making
whitish but how do they advertise this thing as 3200 by 1800 well my friends because even though not every one of our pixels can impact Hue every one of our pixels does impact the brightness and saturation of that square and the overall sharpness which is why we need to stop using the word resolution to describe pixel count but that's a lecture for another day let's play with this thing let's try zooming in to see how this thing is going to handle larger checkerboard oh that is cool you can
actually watch the transitions you can see the particles as they slowly darken or brighten let's see what happens when I move my cursor across it oh hey oh hey oh how you doing there buddy there's the little thingies on the hand icon as you can probably imagine though on a display that can only sort of produce white gray introduces some unique challenges let's go ahead and have a look at the no signal screen oh wow those are not supposed to look like that are they so it's trash then well
not quite so far everything we've done has been weird test patterns what about real world usage well the first thing I notice about it is that uh we still have the same issue as last time where you're going to see the ghost of whatever it is you were doing last on top of any new content unless you clear the display and do a slow refresh okay drawing in green it's like kind of greenish I can see every single Pixel with the naked eye that is not something I'm used to this
is an LGH HDR test video that you guys can go watch on your own if you want to have some idea of what it's supposed to look like to be fair this is like the worst case scenario for this monitor the ghosting on black is way worse than when it's ghosting on white it's not for watching video but how does it compare to the non-color one do we have the old oh we have the old one it's right here you know what I think the ghosting is better on the new one oh yeah I mean that's something at least let's see how
they hold up in video though so we'll do the classic clear and then I'm going to go ahead and start our giant movie CD laser disc before we do that we should make sure these are in the same mode these have five different speeds that they can refresh at we got uh fast mhm uh fast plus fast plus plus fast plus plus plus uh-huh and fast plus Plus+ plus right okay video mode with both of them fast plus plus plus plus I don't know how much I I need the color I was about to say I really
appreciate having theor color well I mean like look here like you just have these like weird specks of green like nothing's really filled in it's all sporadic and I feel like it looks a lot smoother with the gray yeah but that shot didn't have a lot of color in it so you weren't really getting that benefit at least this plant is green like look look here oh at least I can appreciate the you know the glinting light off of this laser disc what even is that but did you notice that the front light is on
no I mean does that matter wait this one doesn't have the light on at all okay compared to our black and white display the color filter ends up wasting a ton of Light which defeats the purpose kind of cuz the point of e in right is it's supposed to be more like the experience of reading off of a piece of paper with natural ambient light and on the original black and white one we can totally do that the brightness of this to my eye is actually comparable to this one with the front light activated and
we found that so much light was lost that we almost always preferred to have the front light on you guys can see just how dim it is with it powered off but maybe there's a use case where it's still worth the tradeoff let's take a look at word processing and document creation oh this is even great cuz we have highlights and stuff in here yeah like that's ooh really bad oh goodness it's really not sharp even with a clear that looks like ass what if we try changing the mode okay sure I mean I
should put this one in text mode too then text mode is very very very aggressive with oh you want it black like look at this it's blue let's go up one level oh no that's black now the sharpness is okay now but I would never edit text at this size no like I'd be working probably more like this I think I would rather have my gray lighting over here than this highlighting over here with this low resolution text let's say I was willing to accept those compromises though how usable is this
let's take this document from roasting SB and Creator gaming setups and try and make some edits to it I just hold on I'm just trying to fix the formatting here okay what is happening right now that's the page break there's a page break I can't even see it here you can totally see it on this one yeah but to be fair we are in text mode so text mode look no no no no if text mode is not what you need for editing a text document then they no there you go I just changed the contrast but okay the
rest of it you didn't finagle enough I can barely even read this now you should have finagled more well that's okay now you can press your page break and then you can go like this and change your mode so that's back to be better you know there also this is supposed to be yellow mhm you wanted me to try to game on this thing oh yeah we're going to game on this thing but let's you know what let's do what color e Inc does best let's look at some Comics yes I could see that being a legitimate use case for
this uh that's not that great lus what I tell you about finagling I'm working on the I'm working on it oh a graphic mode not bad we can get the other one this one's also messed up now so I'm going to come around and give this its best shot if I'm reading text sharpness is everything yep and that's way sharper way way sharper on the black and white maybe a newspaper comic strip isn't the best comparison cuz I was like what am I really losing in black and white here but that's cuz it was smartly designed
to not always be printed in color but that's most Comics here's where I think it actually is probably the best case scenario for it is this older Watchman comic and I think it does look really great it benefits from the incredible coloring of the Watchman series and it does get that dot printed cheap dot printed feeling really well it Nails this but when you're not looking at cheap dot printed stuff um falls apart pretty fast it's just disappointing especially compared to like I don't know
any other display in its price bracket but let's game in a minute first I want to talk about the folks who might be considering a display like this in spite of all the obvious downsides and those are people who are suffering from digital eye strain AKA computer vision syndrome now I won't dispute the perceived improved comfort of using an eink display but it should be noted that there is still a lack of scientific evidence to demonstrate that blue light or any light emitted from a display is
bad for your eyes and while some of it might be down to poor translation desung makes a lot of broad medical claims that they probably haven't tested so if you're someone who suffers from digital ey strain rather than just taking what they're saying at face value try following the 202020 rule and make a point of remembering to Blink if you have trouble with that keep some saline eye drops at your desk in order to improve your hydration of course don't take advice about your eyes from either
monitor manufacturers or YouTubers and if you have a persistent problem make sure you talk to a professional all right enough boring medical stuff let's game Super Meat Boy challenge dasung black and white versus dasung color versus Alienware 2 40 HZ OLED and you may be wondering hey what's up with that that seems unfair it's the same price well actually mine's $400 cheaper are those the speakers built into this monitor yeah they are not very good and this is Sammy if you guys lose this and you
blame your Hardware that's uh that's kind of embarrassing I've never played this one moment please I'd like to tweak my monitor a little bit yeah Sammy you can also change your settings if you'd like oh look at that got to get that fine tuning okay so we're just going to go we're going to go to the first level go so you have to get you have to save the lady okay done nice and then just Mash a to get the next level uh you can wall jump by like slamming against things oh I can't even see
myself there a wall here are you on the slow are you on the what is oh my God how far are we expected to go here I think someone set a timer for a minute wait wait wait oh well that wasn't very good I didn't I can't see anything it's all gray uh how do I change the refresh rate again M plus yeah I yeah I think so okay you want fast plus plus dude I can't I can't see for oh hold on okay I turn my contrast down this is definitely better where am I where are you L is don't worry about it okay I'm going this
is going way more better now that I can actually see any of what I'm doing I need beat lonus be embarrassing right no you're not dude you're not going to beat me no no no no No 3 2 1 all right I'm at 112 I'm at 1 N I don't know what I'm at uh you almost were there 111 111 so I was at 110 so clearly that's proof that color does improve your gaming performance yeah not just that but once I was able to tune it The Limited ghosting compared to the first gen one is definitely better like this is very
usable compared to what poor Sammy was dealing with over there with that said I'm not getting much of the benefit of the color of it at this point no wow now that I look at that it looks so much better of course no one is buying this thing for gaming and if you are the sort of person who has a use case that can benefit from it you know who you are say for example if what you do is review documentation all day for a living something like this could be worth the investment and investment it will be the
color paperlike is worth about $1650 which somehow is less than dung's equivalent non color Inc monitor but with the trade-offs that are inherent to the technology I can see how they would view these two displays as equal if not the same I guess the question now is you know color E Ink it's definitely a thing so why hasn't Amazon released a color e-reader yet with the Kindle brand recognition that they have they charge a fortune for a color version but if I had to guess I'd say it probably comes down
to the lack of brightness and the poor performance in both black and white and especially grayscale so for the time being you'll have to turn to competitors like Kobo who will have Linked In the video description along with dung if you're the sort of person to whom this is appealing and our sponsor War Thunder if you're going to watch explosions you may as well do it from the comfort of your couch War Thunder is a free-to-play PVP with a focus on realistic vehicles and immersive PVP combat every single
