what's up everybody and welcome to the W Show Hope yall had a wonderful week so far it's about to get even better that's right my friends we've got lots of good news this week Google is officially a monopoly wow really no way what oh this is amazing I can't believe this is happening uh YouTube is testing Twitter esque notes which will allow community members to uh issue Corrections on videos fascinating what else we got this week Mr luk La frer so much for our 60 milliseconds of
lat tell you if I actively had the dock open that's fantastic so it wasn't a connection latency issue it was a brain latency issue you still don't have the dock open do you wow wow I don't think we're actually at that right now but anyways uh what's in the dock what's interesting did you mention  all right Logan Paul sues coffeezilla for defamation that's totally going to work of course also rip Game Informer 33 years long they've been running and now   gone I'm lagging like crazy I'm going to 
it pop a caffeine pill oh there we go that helped nice the show is brought to you today by MSI Squarespace and back blaze of course alongside our chair partner secret lab let's jump right into our headline topic Google is a monopoly on Monday a judge ruled after having carefully considered and weighed the witness testimony and evidence the court reaches the following conclusion Google is a monopolist and it has acted as one to maintain its Monopoly it has violated section two of the Sherman Act the
277 page ruling details all the ways that Google has controlled and maintained their control of General search services and search text ads the court was convinced that Google's default distribution deals with browsers and platforms is its biggest advantage that prevents competitors from having a Fighting Chance at creating a alternative regarding Google's approximately $2 billion annual payments to Apple judge meta MAA well sorry if I pronounced your name wrong it's it's
wonderful and you're doing a great job uh determined the prospect of losing tens of billions in guaranteed revenue from Google which presently come at little to no cost to Apple disincentivizes Apple from launching its own search engine when it otherwise has built the capacity to do so in 2020 Google conducted a quality degradation study which showed that it would not lose search Revenue if they were significantly to reduce the quality of their search product imagine that I'm
sorry I'm sorry I'm taking I'm taking a break from the notes I'm taking a break from the notes Luke I know isn't that great imagine if you will conducting an internal study at float plane media okay where you guys kind of went hm if we were to make our product 10% or 20% or 50% crappier um would we lose any revenue and then reaching the end of that study and going oh well the rational conclusion is we should make the experience crappier because we're not going to lose any Revenue I know that the
whole motto don't be evil and it changing or you know whatever thing is not as black and white as their motto was don't be evil and then they changed it it's it's not that simple but maybe it should be maybe Google should go maybe Google should just you know humor the internet lists who believed that that was their original motto and they should bring back the motto and they should just have don't be evil as their guiding star because wait was there was that not their original
motto I think it was but then when they changed it it wasn't that they just like got rid of it it was like still part of it in a way or something it just isn't quite as black and white okay dude I have 100% noticed 100% noticed Google search getting actively worse oh yeah I pretty much everyone that I know has especially over the last few years so while it doesn't surprise me that the search product has been degraded over the last four years what does surprise me is they literally did a
study and we're like can we do this green light check mark rubber stamp it's totally going to be okay because it can't affect our Revenue what a what kind of shortsighted thinking is this I just can't Luke I can't yeah this it's it's it's difficult because like I don't think you can write regulation to like not allow that to happen but I wish we could but I I don't think it's like even possible because well they do it's called the Sherman Act okay what's the ACT well no that's
that's um that's basically like um it's it's IT addresses like monopolistic Behavior essentially okay but I don't even mean within a monopoly like compies do this at all that's why worked really well here yeah that's why it worked because they could just buy their way to their dominant position they don't actually have to make a better product because they can just make sure that absolutely nobody with any capacity to compete with them will ever exist yeah all right our notes go on
generative AI has not or at least not yet eliminated or materially materially reduced the need for user data to deliver quality search results so that's that was one of the other uh findings interestingly Google was not sanctioned for destroying internal communication but that was because the judge was already convinced by all the evidence that's hilarious imagine that imagine destroying evidence and getting away with it because you didn't destroy nearly enough I still think they should get in
trouble for that regardless um even if it didn't end up like if it didn't matter it's still a bad move and you should get in trouble for it but it's like yeah you should have you should have you know man H okay you know what no it was going to get Grizzly um the ruling is for the liability phase the next step is appeals for Google and the remedy phase where judge meta can possibly force a breakup of Google the closest parallel to this case is Microsoft's antitrust trial in
1999 they did successfully appeal but they reached a settlement preventing them from acting anti-competitive in the browser market now here's my question how about a settle M that prevents Google from acting anti-competitive in any Market they participate in what do you think and while we're at it why don't we why don't we open the books back up on Microsoft and their recent behavior in windows with AI stuff oh yeah with Windows yeah dude how many times how many times am I going to be
prompted about uh a Game Pass subscription by my stupid operating system why do I why do I have to deal with this you you know that that whole thing where it's like snooze for 3 Days remind me later and it makes you go through the setup wizard again and it prompts you to use Edge again have you gone through that no I've never had that happen have you seen how have you seen how teams will ignore your default browser setting on your computer dude that was recent that was recent Microsoft is 100% back
added like that one is so Brazen so obvious so clearcut they are using their position in the workplace Communications Market with teams which by the way they they bundle with office and a way that actually you could argue their behavior with teams is anti-competitive and monopolistic so they leverage their position in teams to effectively Force anyone who isn't going to dig around in the menus to use flipping Edge anytime they click a link in teams why would anybody want an application to ignore
their default browser and they clearly knew better because it used your default browser before this change happened what like 6 months ago or something like that I don't remember exactly when they changed it and you can fix it but most  how dude it was broken on mine for a bit I literally couldn't I I brought someone into my office I showed them they were like wow you literally don't have the button that I have it was it was unbelievable it could it could have just been a bug my computer was being kind of
funky at that time so you never know you can see weird stuff when a computer's unstable but like they also they're they're simultaneously running old teams and new teams right now so like it might have actually been a problem on like one of the versions of teams yep so I don't know yeah I think I was using new teams at that time but I'm yeah I'm not 100% sure oh dude the fact that the fact that this took so long the fact that so much of this goes just completely under the
radar the fact that we haven't seen a major antitrust case like this since 1999 I've got to say like I I don't I don't know everything about what the Biden Administration has done um I don't know exactly what their role was with making adjustments to the FTC but I am super liking what the FTC has been doing lately I am super liking what the US government in general has been doing to to address this kind of antitrust and monopolistic Behavior it's not nearly enough they could probably 10x their
funding for this and it still wouldn't be enough but man at least it's something like come on how about how about into it next let's go let's go oh man the tax companies yeah that needs to be crushed it's at like the North America is like a laughing stock in regards to how taxes work d just Americans Canada is not the same like American taxes are are worse as far as my understanding goes but we have a lot of the same problems where like the government knows exactly how much you owe them uh this
has been a solved issue for a really long time but the lobbies of the tax companies are just forcing them to make it so that you have to use these garbage tax companies in order to uh follow your taxes properly which is really frustrating uh yeah and how about how about how about the the Transunion and whatever the other one is duopoly how about we how about we get rid of that while we're at it like come on come on come on come on let's start let's start knocking down some monopolies cuz it is
it is tiresome it's tiresome and I I I like the whole idea of like you could be a monopoly and not get crushed by Monopoly law as long as you're not doing certain actions like if Google search was effectively a monopoly because it was just so much better than everything else that's one thing if Google search is effectively a monopoly because they spend billions and billions of dollars annually which no other company can do to make sure that they're buying their way into being the default search engine
on everything yeah that is that something should happen because that's bad practice Monopoly yeah yeah 100% And it's just it's one of those things where it's it's tough because philosophically right the idea of a of a free market is is appealing to me I mean I was born in a capitalist country I I I generally believe in uh things competing on their merits right but that's the whole thing this regulation compete on its Merit this regulation doesn't exist to destroy a free market economy it exists to
maintain the Integrity of a free market economy and I think that's what a lot of folks are missing sometimes when they see government regulation um come down on the behavior of companies like this is no they're not this this is not this isn't government overreach this is the government doing its job to give everybody a crack instead of just Google and their Executives and their  yeah someone's pointing out in chat like didn't Google pay for 81% of Milla Foundation to keep Google as the default
search I've heard an even higher percentage than that um and this this might actually end up hurting Firefox a lot um but I also think without certain monopolistic practices Firefox wouldn't be in the rough spot that it is right now um and so it's like Google like monopolistic practices are propping up Firefox who never would have needed to be propped up yeah if it wasn't for monopolistic practices like so we can look at it now we can go but look at the collateral damage there
will be if they don't do these deals anymore it's like yeah we you're right we never should have this shouldn't happen that sucks but we never should have gotten here yeah and we can't just we can't just allow it forever because we allowed it for a while and it's created problems I mean it's like the way that they've allowed the it's like the way they've allowed housing prices the the bubble to balloon the way that it has uh here in Canada particularly in markets like Vancouver and Toronto and
everyone's looking at it going well you can't let the market crash because think of all the people who are over leverag it's like oh my God at some point it's going to pop it can either be really really really painful or it can be even more painful those are the only options now yep yeah it's brutal um and I I'm to be very clear I'm very very worried about what's going to happen with Mozilla Foundation yeah me too I think this is going to be really rough I hope as much as I don't really like Bing that
much I kind of hope Microsoft swoops in and um puts some Bing contract in place and pays him a bunch of money to make Bing the default or or something I don't  that are they engaging in the same practice my well my biggest problem with like there some of search is going to have to be the default somewhere in my opinion I don't have a huge problem with that being a thing that happens my problem is that uh Google was all of them they were all of those contracts they had that contract with Apple
forever they had the contract with Firefox forever they had the contract with everyone forever it was across the board it wasn't like a few companies are fighting in different Arenas it was Google fights everywhere and that's it um I don't I don't I don't think these kinds of deals will be possible I mean there is no there is no way that you can make an argument that Microsoft other than Microsoft's extremely low market share so that's where they could make an anti-monopoly
argument is hey we're a we're a scrappy Underdog in this space genuinely though yeah but they're also you know literally one of the top valued companies on the face of the Earth and so but in that space they are they are a massive Underdog sure but imagine this right imagine if let's say um let's say uh LV LV MH or whatever the Lou Louis Vuitton uh heres what whatever that luxury brand Bernard Arno or whatever his name is okay I'm I'm trying to pick an extremely valuable company
that is not in Tech that's that's the point so these are this is an enormous company okay so if they were all of a sudden to go into a space that is much smaller than than they are um so let's say um a technology youtubing okay if their market share in views for that was effectively zero you know it was 1% they because they started a channel if they were to go around and pay Google a bunch of money to be the first result anytime anyone searches for any video around  absolutely uh an anti-competitive
Behavior even if they don't have a dominant position you can buy advertising but it has to be on a Level Playing Field and the fact that these are back room deals as opposed to like okay if Milla for example just had a completely open um affiliate program for example that everyone pays into equally and everyone has an equal shot at then I think that's a completely different story so if every time you installed Firefox and it asked you to select your browser and it was a
completely randomized order or not your browser sorry uh search your default search and all of the potential default searches would have a chance of showing up at random and then whoever people click random order not not shown up at random random order who whoever someone clicks um they in they have to sort of pay them a commission for being the default Brer on that install or something as long as everybody can participate equally then that's fine but if it's pure pay to win
and it's happening in a way that is not open and is not accessible and nobody else even gets a shot at it then no I don't think you can really get away with that what do you do about so I I don't hate the idea but what do you do about groups like um Duck Duck Go which aren't going to have any money um to pay into  I'm look I'm not saying it's a Sol include them anyways then no one's paying yeah and then if no one's paying then there's there's no like the the community funding for Milla is like
practically nothing people don't contribute to free software it's it's basically a joke um like it happens but it's enough to like buy developers coffee it's not it's not enough to actually properly support people um yeah I don't I don't know I don't I don't know the the answers to this I'm just saying that you know Microsoft buying Bing default is not the answer because the way that it is supposed to work is products are supposed to compete on their Merit and buying your position is not
competing on your Merit buying advertising space that is clearly delineated as such totally fair game but I get all that and I don't disagree I think what I keep getting stuck on is like how do we allow groups like Milla to monetize things um because if if it if it's if it's the setup you're saying yeah no one pays I know well no no I I'm not pitching that setup I want to make that very clear I was just trying to pitch something that could be more fair um and like look I I
don't I I I don't have good answers I have unpopular  Firefox and realistically if that were if that were the case we might be in a position where you know what um Microsoft might not be allowed to give edgeway for free Google might not be allowed to give edgeway for free I mean that is the point of breaking up companies if Google gets broken up and Google Chrome becomes a company the whole idea behind that is that Google Chrome Inc is going to have to compete against other browsers on its own Merit
it doesn't get to just have a special data sharing deal with big daddy alphabet and it doesn't get to receive but it would have to offer the same deal to everyone what is yeah that's the whole idea you don't have to offer equal deals to other companies as a company if they didn't though given the scrutiny that Google and alphabet are under here I think they would find themselves in court again immediately Ting like them basically claiming that they're acting as a uh as a combined group of companies
a combined group you have have no idea what the laws around that are but I'm sure that's a thing you would have to demonstrate that in good faith you attempted to negotiate with other parties right that's the whole idea of a breakup is that instead of Firefox going up against browsers that are funded by all of the data that they are stealing from their users and feeding back into their parent companies and that are then paying into them in order to continue to collect they would be going up against
browsers that well are still going to be stealing a bunch of data but are selling  everybody and that's the bottom line Firefox is that you probably just have to you you either you either buy the product or you are the product and so You' probably have to buy fir would buy Firefox because at the end of the day you know we look at something like Firefox as an alternative to being the product but we're not really it's all the same it's all the same groups it's just a different label on it it's the
same groups funding it right yeah um and so it's all it's all feeding into that it's all feeding into that machine until we break the cycle so I I don't know I'm looking at this as a win but I'm also looking at it as there's going to be pain but I think a tiny a tiny first step in what is going to be an extremely painful breakup because people think that they support you know the small uh you know independent the the the real uh free market um they they think that they
support um groups that are doing things the right way respecting their privacy and their data but when all of a sudden they are faced with the cost of buying what they were getting for just data I think they're G I think there's going to be sticker shock Luke yeah like people often talk about how expensive float plane is oh I don't want to pay $5 for one Creator guys the margins aren't that crazy for us on float plane and yeah we operate at a much smaller scale compared to someone
like a like a Google for example does and so our costs are higher get better as you scale yes a lot there are absolutely economies of scale but a platform like the one you're watching on right now whether you're on Twitch which is being just money furnac by Amazon or whether you're on YouTube which we think may be profitable by now but absolutely was money furnac by Google for many years they're so expensive to run video is shockingly expensive and I I think we're just I think we're just going to realize
collectively holy crap that that reality that dystopian reality where everything about us you know from the the food we eat to our our weird Kinks to uh the family members that we related to everything about us is collected used against us um I think there's going to be people that are going to look back at that and go yeah the grass was greener compared to pulling out my wallet and  browser oh yeah man you know it's going to be a subscription baby oh yeah it has to be when you said buy Firefox I was
like all right like lifetime that's not how it works y you have to the buy once model is dead Luke yeah because services that have to be maintained it it makes sense that it is dead but it's just and when and when the internet and when Computing was growing at an exponential rate you could sell it once and then when your user base is twice the size 18 months from now you could just you you could sell everything you'd ever sold you could sell it again in the next 18 months and
and it would keep growing and it was all going to rocket ship to the moon but it all busted it all has to bust eventually there's a finite number of people and a finite number of dollars a finite amount of value that you can extract and if the market size isn't growing well then you have to grow the amount of money that you're extracting from the market it's all going to be subscriptions everyone already has a phone you can't be a cool product from stripe there's not going to
be another India moment hold on that's the last point I want to make there's not going to be another India moment in the world ever India comes online when India went online my goodness did it happened practically overnight I forget what the carrier was but they basically a value carrier launched in India for the first time and it happened right at the at this intersection moment when smartphone prices reached attainable for the first time and and a country of over a billion people
just came onto the internet and there  where's the next Market that's going to do that birth rates are falling across the vast majority of the developed world uh pretty much every country is connected at least to a very significant degree I mean we're still we're still going to see growth in from Africa for example but it's not going to be like that sorry okay go ahead uh no I've been having a decent amount of conversations with people at at this event already um about payments
processing and and stripe and and PayPal um and a pretty interesting product that stripe could make I don't think they would actually want to because they'd lose out on one of their probably biggest revenue streams uh but it would be cool in my opinion as as we're getting to more and more subscriptions one of the most annoying things to me is not necessarily the cost per month but it's the just genuine volume of subscriptions and payments that are coming through um so one of the
conversations that we've had is the benefit of bundling payments so if if you have like if you have a certain platform that has multiple subscriptions on it um paying for all of those subscriptions on that one platform at the same time so if you're a patreon or a float plane or something like that if all the payments go through at once how these payment processors do their fees is it's generally a percentage plus a fixed cost for every transaction y so most like North American or most American really
transactions are .9% plus 30 cents um unless you have some negotiated rate but most people I've seen fixed rates as low as like 15 cents I think like it depend yeah there's like there's uh there's different models that you can use there's like particular microtransaction models that you can use through stripe where the got it um where the numbers a little bit different it shifts that a standard transaction is 2.9% plus 30 cents got it but there better than me so yeah go ahead um but if you so that 30
cents is where a lot of people can save a ton of money because I mean if you're doing 10 million transactions in a month 30 cents three million bucks let's go every month yeah yeah so you're looking at $36 million a year so if you can if you can bundle um like if one user has three subscriptions if you can bundle into that into one payment you're saving 60 60 cents a month on that user y so it' be kind of neat if stripe as a platform if if you instead of having like you would need accounts on both but
if you had like almost like payment by stripe in the way that you have uh like Apple pay and Google pay and then stripe bundled all your payments into one big payment dude they have zero interest in doing that they have no incentive in doing that but it would it would be so good for me like if I could just go to stripe and on stripe see all of my subscriptions yep so it's all nicely laid out in one spot I could cancel uh subscriptions right through there and then it just came out in one big payment
every month that would be sick that would be super cool I think the only entity that could probably do that would be like a major American Bank um because realistically part of that that the handling fee that the the the transaction fee that they're dealing with is not just collecting the money from you but also routing it to where it needs to go so by combining them yes they're only doing the one payment from you but they still need to split everything out to all of the different
end destinations so it would have to be a Cooperative effort between like like like the a group probably even of the big Banks where they all go okay we're not going to charge each other anything to to to do these uh interbank transfers uh and we're going to absorb the ones that go outside the network in order to do this like uh this sort of subscription bundling um and save oh shoot wait save uh we're the ones who collect this Revenue crap no we're just not going to do this like the only kind
of Market where I could see something like that happening because you're absolutely right that is how it should probably work the only Market where I could see something like that happening would be somewhere like China for example uh where it's it's dictated yeah by the central government and these these entities are only sort of B people on the head and be like hey stop wasting money yeah essentially yeah um yeah and some some people pointed out in chat that this is a thing I know this is a
thing on the platform level Flo plane does it what I'm saying is is I wish this was a thing uh on the on the payment processor level yeah so if you like followed uh let's say let's say you didn't know that dank pods was on float plane if you followed dank pods on patreon and you followed LTT on float plane and both patreon and float plane used stripe as a payment process then essentially uh we could we could say we could opt into this program and then stripe on the back end would take one
payment from you for that month and it would divy it out to the two different platforms for your two separate subscriptions that's what Luke is pitching yeah I think that would be really cool personally and like some people have asked how that would work because if people subscribe at different times there's this whole math you can do to figure out proa to adjust for that and y y y it's it's definitely possible um like I said we we do it already I would just like it to be done on the
payment processor end but uh I I think there definitely isn't a per transaction Financial incentive for stripe to do this but I do think it could be a good Market um like getting more customers thing because that would make me prefer to use whatever platform did this over anything else personally oh Wade actually I shut down his patreon like seven months ago so all right he's all float plane all the time heck yeah let's let's go Wade uh oh wait you didn't know that no no I totally didn't
know that I didn't know he shut it down I knew that he I knew he was going to um okay but I didn't know he pulled the trigger yep that makes sense what a Chad yep we were we were discussing creators who haven't had controversy um prior to the show on on the pre- uh as as far as I know I don't think Wade's ever had any controversy every time I've hung out with him he just seems like just seems like an upright dude he's super chill dude you know for someone who's upside down you know he
sure does manage to have his head screwed on straight wow wow Australian Australian he's not upside down just calm down all all right so anyway um one of the things I asked the uh the prep team to put together was some examples of other monopolies that have has gotten their comeuppance yet um and they put together uh Google themselves in September so this was uh over digital ads okay um meta oh0 wait they're getting sued by the FTC Amazon oh wait they're getting sued by the FTC Apple oh wait they're getting
sued by the doj um and Microsoft and Amazon backdooring AI startups there's a bunch of stuff actually Nvidia is getting investigated finally for some of the just like everyone has known forever that doing a deal with Nvidia is like dealing with a very difficult entity that understands fully the dominance they have have they ever crossed the line hey we're finally looking into that very interesting I am so happy to see it I want to see so much more whatever incoming Administration we in
the US come the November elections you personally I'm talking to our American viewers out there you personally need to be putting pressure on your representatives to keep this train going this matters a lot it is costing you money all the time both directly and through tax dollars this is costing you money and these investigations as long as they can get cash settlements should be a gravy train that will pay for itself for a very long time there's baby there's lots to investigate let's
go all right what else we got today Luke what do you want to talk about should just go right into the next one the the YouTube thing yeah all right let's do it YouTube is testing Twitter esque notes YouTube has announced that they're testing experimental feature that will allow users to add notes to videos akin to the community notes feature on Twitter the goal of the feature is to provide context and other relevant information that may not be included in the video in their example they've used
a video about extinct animals with a note that says that one of the species was recently discovered to still be alive the notes will appear under the video title where we can see other labels for helpful things like Co 199 information and will be rated by the community as helpful or somewhat helpful or unhelpful currently the ability to write notes is By Invitation Only and during the pilot notes will be reviewed by third-party evaluators rather than the note creators oh what just happened
rather than the note creators or the community at large there's a discussion question here that says how well do community notes work on Twitter do you find that they are accurate and unbiased uh I have not found that they are completely accurate and unbiased however they are lot better than not having them um I think overall they're helpful but they are they have problems one thing that I would like YouTube to consider in all of this and I haven't spoken with them directly so this will
be the first anyone from YouTube is hearing about it from me uh but one thing that I would like to see addressed is right now the Creator himself doesn't have a ton of ways to address anything about the video that they want to clarify after the fact we used to have the ability to put text annotations at a given timestamp in a given spot on the video so that we could issue a small correction uh say for a data point on a graph or uh say for something that changed after the fact like if we said
oh yeah the power consumption of this isn't very good but there's a bios update that went up 3 days after we published our video we could put an annotation in there and say hey this is something that they've addressed um it was a great way for us to deal with the constantly changing landscape that is the technology space that we cover um and at times it was even a great way to deal with sponsor for example because if there was a temporary deal we could have an annotation that said how much the
discount was and then that could go away when they didn't have it anymore and stuff like that it was a way to keep the content of the video up to date not well but it was some it was something um they took that away uh under the guise of um you know trying to make the mobile experience better and more streamlined or something like that like it it it was horse plop then it's horse plop now it was never anything to do with that and it was thing to do with that they didn't
want to do it anymore and they had good reasons for not wanting to do it some creators did abuse the feature um plain and simple whether it was through spam or trying to get people to accidentally that you could interact with them so trying to get people to accidentally touch them and Skip to certain parts of the video like there were there were it was definitely an abuse Vector but I do think they could have solved it and I think just getting rid of it outright was not the solution
right now we do have the ability to to pin a comment we do have the ability to Heart comments or heart our replies but hearts are super inconsistent like I'll see someone asking a question that like one in every three people in the video is is asking a question about that and what I would like to be able to do is heart that comment reply heart my own reply and have that be the first thing people see so they don't need to keep scrolling and ask the same bloody question but it absolutely doesn't work
that way not for me not for anyone as far as I can tell everyone's algorithm for what comments get served to them is a little bit different and you can have "a comment that has you know 6,000 up" votes or something like that and is harded by the Creator and has a reply from the Creator and it'll Decay which a Decay algorithm is perfectly reasonable but it'll Decay to the point where you can't even find it at all after a little while and you'll just you'll just be kind of perpetuating the same comments
over and over and over again because people can't see that this has already  addressed um so anyway where I was going with this is if we're going to have a community notes feature giving the Creator the ability to address the community note I feel is extremely important I don't see any obvious way to do that right now but um I I I would like there to I would like to have the possibility for there for it to be a conversation I I think it's important to for people to understand that community
notes are not uh the solution to misinformation and are a form of misinformation themselves but they can help reduce misinformation overall yeah I I know people that have put out tweets had a community note attempt to correct their tweet have the community notes stay for close to 24 hours and then the community note eventually is removed because the community note was wrong but in that 24-hour period the community note because some amount of people have grown to trust Community notes that
Community note was a fairly strong source of misinformation because people read it and then nobody's going to go back and look at it a couple days later and find out that they were that yeah so it's it's important to keep in mind that it doesn't automatically mean that the note is true and you have to you have to realistically question everything if you  um this cause the same problem the like the the dislike button supposedly did I think it'll create a way significantly
bigger problem than the dislike button did um but uh I don't really I'm I'm still not convinced that's the actual reason why YouTube Took the dislike button down so I doubt they actually care no the dislike button thing was as far as I can tell a purely ideological move it had nothing to do with an objective reason to remove the dislike button I have never never in my many conversations about it seen any real evidence I've seen I I or I've heard compelling arguments that removing the dislike
button didn't materially hurt watch time or it didn't do this or it didn't do that I have never seen evidence that it improved the experience of using the platform in any way there's like no way it  yeah all right well hey good luck um Community notes I I don't know man there was a time when I when YouTube kind of I would say had kind of earned my sort of mostly trust at least as far as I can trust a big Tech conglomerate to to do the right thing um I'd say they still I think they
still get it right more often than they get it wrong but they've really eroded a lot of that trust especially over the last few years yep I mean Google in general man Google's like Google's rough yeah if if you use something that's made by Google and you like it uh you like have to have a backup plan at this point because they might just remove it at any time for probably not a very good reason um a lot of their tools have not really been advancing very significantly um they they are retaining
their market share through spending dollars instead of making better   know yeah cool it's rough what are we supposed to be doing Dan meres oh merch messages hey if you're new to the show you may not be familiar with the concept of merch messages we don't do twitch bits we don't do super chats we do merch messages so that any contribution to The Show Goes To Us goes to our creator Warehouse team uh goes to our suppliers goes to our uh warehousing partner mibc um goes to goes to our team to build
great products like the LTT screwdriver The Scribe driver our water bottles all that good stuff that you guys know and love and the best part is that unlike just throwing money at the screen like some of those other methods you can throw money at your screen and also get great products in the mail um we're going to show you guys how it works in just a moment but I'm pretty sure there was something else I was going to say oh right how to send a merch message all you got to do is go to
LTT store.com add something to your cart and when we're live you're going to see a box to send a merch message and it'll go to producer Dan who will pop it up in the bottom of the screen who will reply to it himself who will forward it to someone who can answer your question or who will curate it for me and Luke to address all right Dan why don't you show us how merch messages work sure I've got a question here from Jason lonus why do you want AMD to create lower-end chips manufactured E-Waste instead of
promoting using older Hardware Ah that's a good question I do not want people to stop using older Hardware but what you've got to understand is that not everybody is comfortable buying a secondhand processor so while I have advocated many times like to the point where it's almost probably exhausting how many times I have advocated for buying used Hardware rather than brand new hardware especially if you're on a tight budget um I know and accept and fully understand that some people are just
never going to do that and so the reason that I'm going after AMD for the fact that they haven't launched a ryzen 3 processor in like three years four years years they haven't launched a a budget gaming processor in many years is that the way I feel like they have   leader and figured well if we can only produce so much silicon why do we have to give any of the most new fangled power efficient performance chips to the people who only have 120 bucks to spend when we can just
take all of that allocation and put it into epic and ryzen 9 and uh stricks Point laptops um and that wasn't amd's attitude before and I just I don't know I get frustrated when I see people treat AMD like they're some kind of Golden Child Scrappy Underdog who is you know Pro consumer or whatever because look at what AMD did with ryzen where you could buy a thread Ripper for uh Matt I forget what the starting price for the thread Ripper uh 1900x was thread Ripper here hold on I
want to I want to check this thread Ripper 1900x uh MSRP launch okay what was it $549 for $549 when AMD was actually Scrappy when they were coming from behind for less than the price of a current thread Ripper Pro motherboard okay seriously Flagship thread Ripper Pro motherboards are like a th000 plus dollars you could have gotten a thread Ripper chip and a board that wasn't that long ago that was in 2017 so what frustrates me is that AMD used to still they they used to give you
the option to buy a last Gen processor with probably more cores okay but you're also going to save some money on the platform or you could buy a current Gen processor at a lower price get more up to-date cores so you'd be getting the latest architecture you probably it probably wouldn't perform as well in it's in a bench or even real world applications that more people use like video editing or video encoding uh but it would have a greater upgrade path so AMD does do some things right fact that
they're continuing to provide processors for am4 is really good they just launched new Chips that's absolutely incredible how long they've supported that platform for but what isn't incredible is that they are effectively putting a a price barrier in the way of am5 which is the new am4 that's the one that people who might not have a ton of money today but might want to be able to upgrade down the line that's the one they should be buying so that they can be able to upgrade in the future right
to to take advantage of some of the very consumer first things that AMD does um so no I I am not I'm not going to stop calling out AMD for not introducing entrylevel processors am5 is not new like for crying out loud when did ryzen 7000 launch hold on let me check let me check this September 2022 am5 launched 2 years ago and you still can't buy a chip for it under about  okay let me check let me check what the 7600 is might be it might be under 200 hold on is your phone making noise no that is
not mine also uh calls to like if you're going to talk about this with AMD you should talk about Intel too I I think there's no illusion that Intel's in a extremely significant amount of hot water right now we're just trying to make it clear that that doesn't mean that the other side is uh and this specific thing no this specific thing Intel isn't doing Intel absolutely nerfed the crap out of their entry-level chips for many years but man you can pick up like a 14100 um let's see there actually there
there's some really good uh Intel 14 series chips that are like an outstanding value if you're a budget gamer now I would not necessarily recommend those I would actually rather that you go pick up like a used ryzen 3000 or something like that but if you must have something brand new with the warranty and all those things that you know kind kind of make you feel better or whatever else it's not my thing but if that's your thing then Intel absolutely has value options they do but
we've got to recognize that that's not because Intel is benevolent that is because Intel is in a position where they are looking for gaps in the market where they consell chips and AMD didn't create thread Ripper 1900x because they were benevolent they did it because Intel left the high-end desktop Market completely unaddressed they got complacent so what I'm advocating for is for everyone to address their customers needs proactively rather than wait around for us to go yo hey where the 
processor yeah what is going on here why is Zen 5 launching purely with highend and absolutely no indication no telegraphing whatsoever of when you're going to address the entry level when am I going to be able to buy one of these stupid efficient chips maybe I only need a couple cores maybe I'm building a NZ when am I going to be able to buy Zen 5 for  okay that's all I have to say about that I got another one for you here hey lonus you've been daily driving Qualcomm Snapdragon after getting your hands on
Zen 5 stricks are you eager to switch back to AMD anything you were expecting to see in Zen 5 five you hope to see in Zen 6 I am not eager to switch back oh what I have realized is basically everything I do on my laptop is in a browser except for the occasional thing and I haven't run into anything catastrophic yet um I am I am really enjoying that realization should you just be on a Mac I I thought you were GNA I thought you were GNA go Chromebook got him never mess with the producer blocked 
producer I didn't expect that you're going to make me support Mac we have a whole topic on why that's going to be hell later yeah um oh do we yeah I I I I okay my understanding is that Apple has addressed window Management in a big way um so that was one of my irritations with Mac is I I'm sorry I refused sear is way better I refuse to buy a window management application um but my understanding is it's way better now you're right search is way better but if there's one thing that would keep me off
of the Mac anyway it would be finder I do not like finder I do not find it to be intuitive to to navigate um folder structures I do not find it intuitive to access network shares um Apple went very Dazz heavy um and it's it was very clear from you know the Thunderbolt drive towers and just the the workflows that Apple would feature in their marketing collateral that they just didn't really get Nas um the funny thing is that Apple was I I would say one of the key players
in moving 10 gig to the mainstream like the fact that the Mac Mini launched with 10 gig as an option like the the new Mac Mini or the new new the less new whatever uh when when Apple made 10 gig networking an option on the Mac Mini and then dual 10 gig on the Mac Pro I was like thank you finally you someone's doing because Apple's the one that does it and then everyone else goes oh okay we're not going to be our spec page isn't going to be comparable to Apple if we don't have
this it's like okay yeah freaking a let's finally go 10 gig um do is in a browser and the search on the computer is pretty good does finder being an annoying piece of junk really matter yeah it does because I still will yeah I I Navigate the folder structure of my computer frequently enough that would be a problem for are you just old um I don't think so I think I just do a lot of work and um I think I just do a lot of work that requires me to be in my folder structure like I work at a
media company is you looking through the folder structure on the computer a symptom of Windows search being so bad no because would you do it so much if search would work yeah I I still would because I wouldn't remember exactly what something's called necessarily like many of the files that I'm accessing are mvi 0723 whatever like it like footage things like that right I no I need to be a I need to be able to quickly go to the folder see it and thumbnail view exactly um so with the amount of that that do I
just I just don't see it and a part of it for me I have to confess would be just being old and set in my ways I don't want to remember new shortcuts like keyboard shortcuts um yeah yeah me neither I I do not objectively I stand I I believe this is objective I Apple's um command key is really hard to reach compared to control for executing shortcuts I would that's not something something that I would ever think is better or the same bu that don't know I genuinely do not know
uh people are saying finder can show the folder path yeah my issues with finder run deeper than just seeing or not seeing the folder path I just do not like finder I'm sorry I yeah I'm sorry I just can't I can't um people are like every excuse not to try it out guys I switched to a Mac I switched to a Mac for over a I'm just trying to mess with lonus um find her freaking sucks and I would use it too Gomez says Linus sorry but you're objectively wrong there's so many media companies that use M compared to
Windows that is like Oh that's oh man that is that is so flawed for so many reasons nothing that I said was that media companies don't use Max and you got to understand that a lot of the reasons that media companies use max it's not cuz finder is good like I'm talking about the way that I need to access footage I'm I don't I'm not an editor I don't use Final Cut I'm going in and I'm I am I am like browsing media files like I'm uh like it'll be like hey lonus can you have a look at this
section of this clip is this something that needs a pickup for example I wouldn't open Final Cut or premiere for that I would just I would just go find the file so yeah I'm I'm telling you guys my workflow specifically um requires me to be com comtable navigating the file structure uh I'm not saying that I'm not even arguing that media companies don't use apple um and a lot of it does not come down to finder it comes down to software like logic it comes down to software like Final Cut
Pro right it's not we're not even we're not we're not even talking about the same thing there is no objectively wrong that I find finder to be unintuitive and difficult to use compared to Explorer Explorer is not perfect Explorer absolutely has its issues but uh yeah no basically explore is pretty good I I don't disagree that it has its issues and stuff but explore is pretty good I mean it has it it even suffers from some of the things that I find frustrating about Apple like for example
why is there a limit to how big I can have my thumbnails why can't I just have even bigger ones right like why and that's such an apple thing like I remember I think it was you Luke that I showed this too and you were like what uh when I showed you that there there's like an artificial limitation to how far you can zoom into a picture when you're when you're looking at it on an iPhone iPhone yeah so wacky and the fact that you like and you know because because you know apple right you understand the product
philosophy right the reason is that they don't want you zooming in too far because it'll look blurry it's like no I'm actually just trying to see that and and you can zoom in as far as you can like reach on the screen but when you let go it'll like wiing back no I actually just want to leave it there I don't want to keep my fingers on the screen to be able to see this and just like stupid things like that like not being able to lock an iPhone in landscape mode even though you can with
an iPad um and that was true even back when they were both using the same op same operating system they were both using iOS but it was just an arbitrary limitation um like it's it's just stuff like that but Microsoft absolutely does the same thing sometimes and I'm sure you know the thumbnail size thing is is again back to different company cultures different company philosophies with Microsoft it's probably more to do with the fact that no one felt like revising the code too much and it's been this way
since XP or whatever like it's it's for completely different reasons but I I do think there's absolutely ways that Explorer could be improved I just do  her okay should we do some more topics that was all a merch message wasn't it I don't even know who even knows anymore did we only do one merch message I think we're supposed to do another one all right hit us Dan oh that would be three merch messages okay oh are we mixing it up I screwed up okay fine Luke well hold on do that I'm sorry Dad I just I
thought we only did one that's my bad before we do that there are a few things for us to talk about real quick we have some cool stuff for you guys to check out on the store if you're looking for an excuse to send a Merc me Merc message a mercenary message um if you're looking to send a merch message we have a poster I don't think we've ever done a poster before but you can level up your space with the intergalactic GPU poster it's just a cute art print of a legally distinct GPU that is literally out of
this world look at that your space to could there we go your space to could look like that frame not included uh I actually have one with me isn't that classy love it oh where'd luk go oh there he is you where you growling at I have one with me uh Arthur asked me to specifically call out that the frame is not man I'm gonna dude I'm gonna get this wait how is that is is that camera not level I I swear this is level um okay this is painful okay there you go  like it comes in a tube and it's
available now so that's one of the anouncements for the store this week does it come with the frame uh no Dan I just wanted you to reiterate Shout Out Gary from our design team um and it's printed using pigment ink on luster photo paper which means it's got greater color and detail and it's more resistant to fading than your average poster oh okay thanks team uh it's available in super limited quantities with a limit of one per person oh okay apparently this is just like a like a a small thing uh oh also
oh where'd it go here it is our collaboration with Delta Hub is now live  LTT I'm sure one of these LT carpos today using the link in the description uh it's got Teflon feet so unlike a standard wrist rest it Glides along with your hand there we go while you're using it and basically supports your wrists "there's only 2,000 units available so" grab yours before they run out we're going to have it linked in the video description and I have one last store update for you guys scribe
drivers that's right the product that should have been called the write off scribe drivers are going to be in stock soon we've been getting a ton of comments and messages asking when we're going to be restocking The Scribe driver for those who don't know it's a stainless steel uh bolt action pen uh that is made out of repurposed LT original uh from the original supplier that disappeared and screwed us over and then made these uh subpar shafts that were not the right nerling type for a
screwdriver but it turns out great for a pen uh so it's made out of repurposed LTT screwdriver shafts uh when we initially launched the Scribe driver uh "we sold out of all 5,000 of them in I" believe it was 33 hours or something like that like it was it was about a day it was crazy I don't think oh I was going to say I don't think we've ever seen sales velocity like this but I think the original screwdriver may have been higher uh but either way this this was uh I I don't think we've ever been as surprised
by sales velocity with that certainly not yeah I think we had like 200 left near the end of Wan show right it was like yeah it was crazy crazy like that we've come a little more prepared this "time we're going to have 10,000" available next week but there's over "11,000 people already signed up for a" notification so if you want to secure your scribe driver before we run out again sign up to get notified at lmg gg/ pen and then you will know exactly when we restock I've seen so many people that
are like OMG I'm being so careful with mine right now because they don't have any more stock I'm going to buy another one like as soon as they restock so that I I like don't have to be stressed about losing it people are freaking loving this thing um all right that was it Dan where are pens is pens is pens under Tools yes the pen is under Tools which is fine it's a writing tool but seriously guys five stars let's go look at this oh the big one that I found is a bit disappointing
well look that's all the proof you need that we do not censor people from posting their real Impressions on our site all right there you go jeez awkward this is what happens when I'm browsing the site live you got to love it right that doesn't change the overall picture festar product yeah all right what are we supposed to be doing right now okay more topics let's go and I'm sorry Zeal from Acron us I'm sorry the seam between the two sections is noticeable yeah I know the seene
between the two sections is noticeable that's cuz they're made of different things this part is made of salvaged screwdriver shaft but the shaft is not the length of the whole pen we had to machine a separate thing that's why they're they are separate things okay well all right well anyway um cool yeah no we wanted to reuse as much of the original material as possible part of the the coolness of the product is it's recycled materials Alon says I wouldn't buy a festar product that didn't have some
critical reviews that's fair that's fair enough oh that's going to be a fun video Luke we finally did it we did the lowest rated PC we shot it this week so David oh scoured New Egg for the worst product the worst rated product in every category and we built a PC using  products it went about as badly as you'd expect now we we didn't take we didn't take products that were one star but just had one review and it was like defective so I think our threshold was it had to have at least five reviews but
we ended up with a lot of two and a half three star products and without spoiling too much David tested it to make sure everything worked and it didn't fully  shoot wow yeah it's yeah it's it's a fun video it's going to be a good one I'm pretty I'm pretty excited for you guys to see that okay next topic nope I have more Community announcement things oh uh there's an article on the lab that was basically just published which is a uh a deep dive into overclocking the new risen 7
9700x um this is a first of its kind of like article type on the lab uh and it's very cool you should check it out and it's there it's long there's a lot of information scroll through it go go faster speed I am  this is as fast as I can go no matter how many watts you give me I don't believe you what about 4500 amps so if you guys are uh I think that's what I think that's what the motherboards are giving this sorry uh I went somewhere else with that I thought it was going to be letters
that spelled something or something no no way down 808 amps or something like that you know can you can you turn off your phone notifications please me yeah oh oh is it his okay yeah I don't even know where my phone is oh there it is it's under my leg um fine oh hold on it's my wife though it might be important one sec uh okay I don't know what that means cool um oh wait no there oh there's more oh oh there's more uh there's a tech hoarders auction we made a video where I
went to David's house Luke do you know about this uh I know you did something with this David's moving he's getting into the housing market which means some of his retro collection which he has accumulated over many years and spent thousands and thousands of dollars on uh some of his retro collection has to go now he was thinking hey we did that Tech hoarders video at Brian the electrician's place and people were pretty interested in like seeing me effectively go in and kind of Shame
people for all of the stuff that they've accumulated you know um people really liked that format and he was like as much as this is you know me being the the zoo exhibit that we're all going to at you know I think there's a tech hoarders here so what he did was before I got there he separated he drew a line down the middle of the garage and he separated the stuff he was keeping from the stuff that he was going to auction in order to help pay for a gaming space in his new place um and help pay for
some of the uh the fixing up that they need to do and I was like oh that's super cool David but a big part of what you asked me here to do was to help you get rid of more of it so he had boxes and boxes of retro games and again without spoiling too much he got rid of a lot more than he had originally intended to and he he's going to uh he's actually got everything that we went through and I made him get rid of up for auction right now the original video or the video where we're
going to look at his horde is up on float plane right now so I think that actually went live oh shoot I just closed FL plane chat way to go L I think that went live yeah that went live while we were on Wan show today I'm auctioning his collection Tech hoarders 2 uh absolutely incredible collection guys you're going to see you're going to see some stuff okay like why does he own food fight for Atari why why does he own why does he own why does he own Pimp My Ride for the
PlayStation 2 classic okay yeah exactly um so the video is live on float plane right now where you guys can check out what he's going to have for sale I believe it's going up on YouTube tomorrow uh we wanted to make sure people had time to bid on stuff though so we're letting the W show know so they can go take a look right now it's at Urban auctions um and oh the listings are dispersed among non LTT listings so we asked them to add an LT keyword to the listings but haven't heard back so
look for the listings with this gray hardwood as the background oh good lord okay well at any rate if you go to Urban auctions and then refine search and then LTT uh basically anything here is a piece of David's collection and there is some very very interesting stuff in here guys like dude it's it's kind of wild analog consoles uh so many consoles a lot of modded consoles that he personally modded um there was a lot of stuff that I was going to kind of tempted to pick up I'm not seeing Ein Hunter he must
have uh he must be keeping it like a complete in box Final Fantasy 7 oh yeah  uh I don't want to go into it so much I have been trying to get them for a long time and talked to certain people and they said that I could get them and I have not found a route to getting them I really wish analog continued to make some of their older stuff okay hopefully they can figure that out eventually nope the listings should all have LCT in them now we have heard back so it's all good what auction 
auctions.con our list of announce oh yeah scrapyard Wars part three coming out soon on float plane keep your eyes ready for that notification also our episode 3 giveaway is live now ahead of us releasing episode 3 and the prizes include two Jawa editioned oh signed LTT screwdrivers which I will be signing right now apparently so basically did we love hug Urban auctions or is my internet just struggling uh oh it it has been hugged okay whoops well that's just typical oops sorry guys there oh no there we go
it's just long anyway we did a couple of screwdrivers in jaa's color scheme and I'm going to sign them right now and you can get a chance to win all you've got to do is check out the link in the video description which I assume is there but I haven't actually looked for it so uh good luck everybody okay hold on I'm back to my document now so I will know I will know uh yeah lmg Doggs YW giveaway 3 they'll have even more screwdrivers to give away along with a bunch of really cool and
exclusive prizes and we'll have everything Linked In the description okay okay okay I think we're good I think that's all the good Lord is that ever a lot of announcements this week  next uh Believe In You Luke you're going to pick a really good one what about those things you're supposed to be signing I just signed them okay good I wasn't paying attention goodbye he's a fast boy um Reddit CEO hints at payal subreddits and AI search an earnings call earlier this week we're never GNA
no no no no no we're never going to do the good news W show at this rate how dare you pick that topic I don't think I think we already haven't haven't we already covered negative things I know I just mean ah it's never going to happen no just fine fine just do it I'm over it uh ear in an earnings call earlier this week CEO Steve Hoffman suggested that users could start to see paywalled areas of Reddit that may include exclusive or private content Reddit will start testing oh wow that could actually
do really really well um Reddit will start testing AI assisted search later this year using a mix of first and thirdparty AI models to provide Search summary and Reddit went uh public in March of this year and has been aggressively pursuing new ways to monetize the site's content which has created and moderated uh by their users which is created sorry uh increas increased API fees which many thirdparty apps couldn't afford so essentially just had to shut down which I think was honestly if we're being if
we're being real the play and what they wanted um they signed a deal with Google while blocking other search engines from crawling uh maybe this is you know part of why Google got crushed as a monopoly um and signed a deal with open aai allowing posts and comments to be used to train chat GPT they also increase the number of ads shown to users they're currently testing ads within comments and they're planning to include ads in search results yoikes uh reddit's Q2 earnings reported a 54% increase in
sales from the previous year with losses shrinking to 10 million from $41 million wow discussion question why do we keep on putting up with Reddit uh well because they crushed all the other competition so they're really isn't much anymore yeah and we're at the point now where they've got that they've got that  you're you're just not going to find information on you know Playstation 3 modding on a new community that Springs up tomorrow you know not the same way that you will find this this wealth of
it that exists on Reddit from back when everyone was super into it you know um I just don't see I just don't see a path forward other than just take it um I don't know and and to be clear I'm not saying that I want to do that I'm just saying I don't see people standing up I mean Reddit already pulled moves that were deeply deeply unpopular with their user base and as far as I can tell everyone just came crawling right back back really even left I mean a couple of them you know that thing where
like the the Doom scrolling maneuver when you like close an app and then pause for three seconds and open it again or you like oh I'm done with Reddit on my phone I will now go on to Reddit on my computer I feel like that's what users did they're like a I'm annoyed with Reddit I'm going to close it and walk into another room and then open it again like  down oh well uh in other news still not good Google kills the chomecast introduces successor Google TV streamer they can't
just call it Google TV because they kill that in the past as well I actually wasn't done talking Reddit they're going to kill it with private subreddits um and with monetized subreddits because they're already very adult content friendly so like look out only fans I actually see them I thought you meant they were going to kill it as and they were going to kill Reddit make enormous amounts of money from this yeah yep yeah if I was only fans I would have my eye on this extremely
closely yeah probably only one eye knowing only fans um next  snake Google kills chomecast on Tuesday Google announced via their blog that Google TV streamer a set top box replacement for the chomecast a set top box replacement for the handy little dongle gross yeah I know right with added  what uh anyways the the best of Google TV for AI powered personalized entertainment uh Google into the announcement what changed it's $100 compared to a $50 chomecast 4K they added an ethernet port okay I'm actually
super into this the fact that we were all Wi-Fi all the time for video streaming was phenomenally stupid ethernet now yeah yeah I do like that there's ethernet now I'm into I don't know if paying double the amount for ethernet makes a ton sense but um there's a 22% Improvement in the so but it's also just like a new product so that's fine um they moved from am logic s so to the same mediate Tech lineup used in the Amazon Fire stick uh has an HDMI cable built in or any HDMI oh got to not move stuff during oh
sorry these are part of the same thing I'm so sorry sorry Luke where did it even go i i f it folded up with the Reddit CEO H Pay weld subreddits one um watch me mess with Luke and move it again sorry go ahead all right I mean you can read it if you want no no go ahead all right um well I have to find it again so this is a fantastic no longer has an HDMI cable built in or any HDMI cable at all just a port okay did you find it yeah just support is fine though um I wonder if one comes in the Box
no assume it would nope just a port but it says no cable built in or with it at all you sure yeah I know right okay uh seems weird I mean things don't come with chargers anymore Luke Luke things don't come with chargers this is uh oh well matters uh I like smart home thing and I forget what thread is okay um FCC filing done by Quant computers instead of directly from Google okay uh the remote has a speaker now so that you can chime in when it gets Lo chime it when it gets lost okay
that's actually neat yeah Co and volume buttons move to the front of the remote instead of a rocker on the side I don't love that it's a set top box I just hate that it's $100 um I don't really see I don't really see why this needed to be so much bigger and so much more expensive just to add an ethernet port because from my point of view that's all they've really done here um this is just this is just a this is a price hike um that's that's all it really is Google TV streamer uh also in
my opinion not a good name yeah like a bad name in the sense where companies make bad names that are like impossible to decipher it's just it's so generic that searching for anything to do with it is going to bring up a whole bunch of other garbage especially in Google's own search engine that sucks um yes it's just yeah chomecast is is like it's it's catchy everyone knows what it is I can see how it's kind of outdated these days because realistically most of what you're doing
with a chomecast is not casting from a chrome enabled device like it's kind of an outdated name but it had such uh it it was it's so well understood like it has so much momentum already I don't see why they wouldn't just call it chomecast 2024 like just call call it just call it chomecast even though yeah the CHR casting part is not really the most important part of it um I just I just don't see why this  here yeah somebody in FL plane chat said there's a lot more storage I'm not sure about
that why do you need a ton of storage on your chomecast though I didn't I didn't know chomecast had any storage do I never wanted any storage you can run emulated games on them and stuff I think chomecast I think so Android games yeah yep yeah it has 32 gigs of storage so that's something but like does 32 gigs of storage cost that's practically nothing in the modern day yeah I I don't know guys yeah the hardware specs suck it's  one Anie hikage says I just want a streaming box experience without any
attachment to Fang I mean what are you going to stream from that isn't going to come from what what is it Facebook Amazon Apple Netflix Google like come on uh what what is what is the new Fang acronym I think there's a new one yeah I don't remember what it is but yeah I don't know I don't know what the latest one is yeah all right Corsair has ditched 80 plus they are dropping the widely recognized 80 plus power Supply certification for the newer more comprehensive cybernetics lab
certification so 80 plus actually doesn't measure much it measures the efficiency of a power supply at four different load levels 10 20 50 and 100% cybernetics applies more than "1,450 different load combinations to" devices under test and considers efficiency power factor and noise level in its ratings um oh bonus results comparison what is this oh no idea interesting we've got the same power supply evaluated by 80 plus cybernetics and LTT Labs that's kind of cool here we go okay here I'm screen
sharing uh so this is the report from 80 plus on the seic focus 750 watt uh the the GX 750 oh yeah so sorry uh gx750 from cic so basically input power output power so efficiency efficiency it's all pretty  cybernetics already looks more for real cables and connectors gauge of the wires this is actually pretty important because um I don't know if I ever never saw a Switcheroo where a manufacturer changed the gauge of the wires but we definitely saw ones back in the day where manufacturers would submit for
certification with shorter wires and then they would ship with longer ones that were better for cable management but those shorter wires would allow them to get better uh efficiency and a better 80 plus rating average  cool AC loss hold up time Vampire power ooh efficiency graph oh that's kind of cool so minor rails versus major rails versus um 12vt rail cuz if you have there were some power supplies especially back in the day where if you had absolutely no load on them outside of the 12vt rail uh they
would really struggle like they expected to be evenly loaded it's not nearly as much of an issue today but how much of an issue is it well you'll only know if you look at proper power supply testing this is great I actually uh have been very pleased to see cybernetics um start to Horn in on 0 Plus's Monopoly and sort of validating power supplies and to see Corsair come out and be supportive of this is just great let's do away with this meaningless uh this meaningless certification that doesn't really help
people properly understand the difference between a good and a bad power supply um and try to support more comprehensive testing so that people really know what they're buying and then moving on we've got LT Labs overview of the same power supply so there are things that um we are interested in that cybernetics isn't necessarily uh I don't know if we've actually got that rolled out yet but one of the things that I know we're working on is a look at the um the lengths of all of the
cables uh yeah so we don't have that rolled out yet so that's hopefully coming in the future and you're really going to have   cool good job cybernetics stay  today h what do we do next uh xwu asks would you give an LTT Labs certification stamp in the future um we've talked about that as a possibility right now that is not um right now that's not something that's on our road map I think we still have a lot of work to do to um expand our testing across more verticals to go deeper into testing in
some of the verticals that we already test um standardize some of our testing uh build up our team to have um more more backup so that we can so we can test more products in the queue at once like there's there's so much that we have to do before I think we're going to try and develop a program where we boil down the quality of a product to like a simple badge or color C or a grade or something like that that kind of make sense do that kind of align uh interim head of labs maybe I should have
let you answer that question whoops I don't think we've talked about    topic nice it's just me perfect Hardware hackers develop method for restoring software bricked first gen Apple homepods uh many users have many users of the original homod have had their units bricked due to software errors I'm not going to address that at all uh don't have USB ports only proprietary connector hid under the base um used by Apple for Diagnostics and Apple's only response to Brick homepods has been to
charge users for outof warranty repairs and Replacements leaving users with no other options until now I'm not no I see chat I'm not addressing it um repair guy Nick Fix in collaboration with TW how do I say that name David rcall rcal not sure um and thimar figured out how to open the O the homep Pod up access the port and fix the software he's published detailed instructions on how to fix it yourself or you can just ship it and pay for him to do it um the detailed instructions
are on GitHub um if you look for homepod D restore on GitHub you should be able to find it very cool  Dan hello is everyone gone sorry what is is lonus coming back who oh my goodness oh my goodness okay I can keep doing topics I'm going to keep ignoring it uh rip Game Informer after 33 years the longest the longest running us Gaming magazine is gone GameStop who acquired the magazine in 2000 has laid off all 13 staff members this comes after multiple rounds of layoffs since 2018 and as a
final slap in the face to the staff the farewell message wasn't written by anyone at Game Informer and looks like  uh apparently the next issue was about 70% complete when the layoffs were announced and a group led by former GI or game and former video producer Ben Hansen is now attempting to preserve as  possible sorry Luke I'd love to talk in more detail about what we were talking about before but I have some Welches to  wow that's that's a wow that's a lot you do like chubby bunny with  
bunny that might be a first um sorry yeah so we're saying with the lab um talking about we're talking about rip   gnarly oh  that there's a podcast that releases an episode like once a decade as far as I can tell um but I I like it a lot it's called a life well wasted and they have an episode uh their first episode ever is called the death of egm or electronic gaming monthly um and it's actually a really cool look into the closure of one of these old gaming magazines um I I
would highly recommend listening to it um it's old so you know keep that in mind it's from like 2013 or something um but yeah it sucks when these types of  and the like somewhat death of modern journalism has been unfortunate but yeah discussion question is what are some gaming magazines or websites that you and then in Brackets audience Miss and where can the people go today for news reviews and previews well some gaming news you can get from game linked other than that
there's U like game ranks is a really awesome YouTube channel for gaming stuff that I've watched over the years um those guys have always been great there's a bunch of all my game news from yatsi from yatsi zero Punk no no no no fully emblematic oh right right there was the whole Fallout with The Escapist yes um yeah I think it's genuinely like mostly YouTubers these days which is kind of weird but well I mean that's where the money is it's hard to make money in written it's not yep it's not a
secret we've talked about it so many times on the show it's not a mystery why written Publications are struggling because you can't make money with unobtrusive ads and people are going to block the obtrusive ads that you can make money with so your options are just don't make money or um yeah go under I remember like so I'm in Vegas right now for Defcon and I I remember there was one time when I was a lot younger when I was flying I had a a a layover in Vegas for like a few hours
um I didn't have a ton of money at the time but I was stuck in the airport I wasn't going to leave the airport even though I was here for like I think it was like four or five hours or something because like what was I going to do in Vegas when I'm like 16 um so I entertained Myself by buying I I think it was like a I don't know like a PC Gamer magazine or or Xbox magazine or something at the time um because that was something I used to enjoy I remember I had the I think it was the Xbox magazine article
that was the like all the pre-release information for Halo 2 I read that thing so many times oh man I I used to really like the gaming magazines I I liked having columns in them that were written by by the same people all the time so you knew like what kind of what kind of a writer that person was so you could you could almost read it in their voice all that type of stuff it was like pre-youtube for for me for gaming news content um yeah I don't know sad but the world keeps moving apparently Second
Wind group uh is in hot water now as well I have no idea um how much of I I don't know much more Beyond one of their creators just resigned following apparently a couple others who resigned good gravy all right cool well good luck  boy ah  okay next topic oh we're supposed to do sponsors uh speaking of keeping a sustainable business going the show is brought to you today by MSI are you dying to mesur the Impaler over and over because you failed to get good wow I love what a great great job

with the stagnation in consumer wired networking we've had 10 gig for decades but they invent a newer slower NBAs te and Implement that instead uh also the U7 Pro Max bottlenecked by a 2.5g link um it's really hard it's really expensive um also and this is going to be this is going to be a real bummer for people who don't feel this way and and don't agree but faster than gigabit is just not necessary for almost anyone and trust me if you're one of those people who needs 2 and a half gig
5 gig 10 gig um I hear you I'm I'm with you I I want faster I want faster networking but the vast majority of what anybody does is not going to be bottlenecked by gigabit which has been around since on consumer motherboard  like two early 2000s late 90s like I'm pretty sure socket a motherboards had  so here hold on let me see let me see okay here's uh the Retro web here we go and this is a motherboard that was like kind of popular back when um when I was getting into computers blah blah blah no
issue okay two times RJ45 Lan chips here we go yeah okay so this was um this was PCI gigabit which was kind of problematic because it used up a lot of the available pcie or PCI a lot of the available PCI bus which was shared um if you were actually transferring at full speed not that you really like could to anything meaningfully cuz your internet would be nowhere near that speed and um you know realistically unless you were I mean yeah I guess transferring off of Nas you might get close but there was
there was Windows overhead and stuff like you never really saw gigabit speeds back in those days uh but also PCI just wasn't fast enough that you could get full full gigabit speed so this wasn't even proper gigabit yet but it was already a thing like back when this board was popular so this would have been in like what 2003 or something like that like 20023 and Force 2 era but it's fine um and making interfaces go fast over long distances is still really hard I mean look at things like Thunderbolt we
can go as fast as 40 gbit per second on through with USB uh USB 4 right but those uh those interfaces are limited to uh Luke do you do you know off the top of your head is it a meter or something like that like what's the fastest what's what's the longest cable length you can do 40 gbit over for Thunderbolt 4 I don't know off the top of my head I can try to look it up uh no  already uh 2 m 2 m like yeah an Ethernet standard that can't handle 100 m is not a useful ethernet standard and so the complexity
that you're adding in signaling on both ends in order to transmit at and and receive at much higher data rates over much greater distances you've got to have a man you've got to have a really good reason to make that kind of investment in in both R&amp;D veloping these chips and in just the cost of putting these chipsets into your devices I would make the argument that even 2 and 1/2 gig the vast majority of devices that are shipping with a 2 and 1/2 gig interface on them are not taking advantage of it
almost ever the way that most people are using them like I'm thrilled that consumer motherboards have 2 and a half gig land on them now because I happen to have a two and a half gig internet connection and even then the only time it really comes up is when I'm downloading games and even then the only reason it matters for me is because my computer is fast enough that I can actually unpack those games at 250 megabytes a second because if if I didn't have a fast enough processor I
wouldn't even be able to take advantage  system so why not more like why we just we haven't been incentivized and it's really really really hard over great distances there Luke did you have anything to add to that did I miss anything no I don't think so yeah hey lonus I saw you mentioned Power Rangers in a vid recently which one of them was your favorite oh which power well it's got to be Tommy right you don't do it by color well I mean well Tommy was multiple colors though oh but I I liked
him cuz he was like you know the the Ranger the Green Ranger um and green was just like my favorite color and also like he was cool and um and then he was the White Ranger later but then I didn't really care anymore about Power Rangers by that point so sure green ranger yeah let's go with green ranger I mean the last thing you want to  Ranger yeah that's uh little awkward y wish they'd thought of that back then really yeah really do oops all right last one I got for you
here why is it not okay for me to spend $8 to look like Jack Sparrow in fortnite but fine for myo to spend $50 to get her nails done or for people to dye their hair it's all just Cosmetics well for one thing um I would ask both of you guys who you're trying to press like it might not be okay for youro to spend 50 bucks to get her nails done who's she trying to attract no I'm kidding I'm kidding I'm sure you guys are doing great somebody that plays a better video game look I don't think
either Luke or I have ever said don't support um content that you love what we don't like is the predatory practices that companies like epic games are engaging in um personally I'm really not that into spending money on either of those things I you know I think you're I think you're probably right that I wouldn't judge someone for having their nails painted as much as I would sort of disap or if it was my kids I wouldn't disapprove as much of them buying an $8 um bottle of nail polish uh
compared to an 8 skin in fortnite um honestly speaking it's not something that I've thought about much and it's a really good question what is the difference I would say that one difference for me especially if you are doing it yourself like if you're painting your own Nails um you know putting on your own little stickers putting on your own clear coats or whatever I would say that that's an activity I'd say that's a hobby however you could make a similar argument for fortnite if playing fortnite is your is
your activity if it's if it's your hobby if that's your form of self-expression then I think you could make an argument there um I wouldn't do either I I definitely have dyed my hair at points in my life I was a lot younger um and you know why I did it was the last time I dyed my hair before the debrand sponsorship for the the the bleach this time which by the way didn't cost me anything I actually made money on it so yeah that yeah that's that that this this was not this was not me
painting my nails or buying a fortnite skin uh the last time I did it was when I had started dating Ivonne but hadn't met her parents yet and for LS I dyed my hair bleach blonde right before she introduced me to her parents to troll y Von  jerk can you can you believe she married me sometimes I don't know oh jez KD talk says Lina spent money on a facial treatment so he'll spend money on Cosmetics actually that is totally that is totally true um again though you know I do consider Luke and I talked about
this on the show I do consider maintaining my appearance to be an investment in my career at this point like um not looking like my body's falling apart is is an advantage when you are an on camera personality we can we canot like that you know we can think that's stupid or whatever but there is no arguing with it like if you if you want to argue that um you know not looking presentable doesn't matter um for an on cam as a media personality you're just wrong like you're just  works no bro
talkx uh I forget what it's called morpheus8 it's like a it's like a micro micro needling micr puncturing treatment uh that's it so far Elijah's like yeah that's why I got the buttlift O um anyway I think a lot of it's like people's habits and stuff too  lonus mentioned the whole predatory nature of it it can hit people really hard uh like gambling is is one of the things that I look at gambling has ruined countless lives at the same time I know of one person who has a very
healthy relationship with gambling they know that they really like gambling they find it very entertaining and they will take the money that it would cost to take thems and their partner out to a movie um and like get dinner and they'll they'll leave all the rest of their methods of getting money at home and they'll take that money to the casino and they get dinner at the casino and they Gamble and when they're out of money or when they feel like going home they go home and that's like well all
right if you find that Justice entertaining as going to go watch a movie or more so and you're spending the same amount of money that seems like a relatively healthy relationship with it but in saying that the vast majority of people don't treat gambling that way when they gamble so like it's it's not gambling can still be bad but here's the thing coming back to Hugo's question here like what's the difference the Cosmetic the Cosmetics industry has probably done more damage to people's
mental health than oh fortnite skin honestly um and not just not just mental health I mean we want to talk about you know testing on animals or you know any other any other harm that the Cosmetics industry has created or perpetuated it's it's not an industry that I'm looking at going like oh yeah well that's like a perfectly reasonable thing to support um I don't know maybe it's just maybe it's that that was already normalized when I was in my formative years personally man I hate I hate to get into
this kind of thing because I'm not I'm not judging or anything but personally I find um super um done up Nails unattractive uh not I'm not neutral on it um I find it I find it unattractive um to me it looks like uh it looks like um not just not wanting to like work with your hands if it came to that it looks like actively avoiding successfully avoiding doing anything that would that would break a nail or or or damage a damage a glue on or or damage the finish of the ends of your fingers um it's not
a trait that I find attractive  um so cool I don't know if that really means anything um well what it what it means well they were asking why why do you have this double standard lonus why do you think it's why do you think it's not cool to spend eight bucks to be Jack Spar on fortnite but it is tangible for my to spend 50 bucks for your nails I am not into your so spending 50 bucks on nails I think it's stupid so yeah but I think there's very tangible social and professional ramifications for not
keeping up a certain level of appearance um which you have already pointed out and I don't really think that exists with gaming skins I think it's a a different thing I think if you show up looking disheveled all the time um people don't take you as seriously yeah but you show up without gaming skins I I don't think anyone cares or rather I mean back to my original question is who are you trying to impress uh maybe someone cares about you not having the coolest gaming skin but you know what them why are you
trying to oppress them yeah yeah 06 lives says lonus is kind of judgy look I was talking about what what personally I find attractive personally I I knew that Ivon and I were headed for a long-term relationship when she was over at my parents' place when we were quite a bit younger and my parents asked for help mucking out the horse dolls and Ivonne offered to help and shoveled horse manure with me so that I could be done faster so we could spend more time together if she
had said okay I'll see you in a bit I can't do that because I might damage the finish on my paint on my fingers I'd have been like cool because to me um you know that's I'm just not into it I'm not into it I'm sorry and that works for some people like and you can be and that's totally fine yeah and that's totally cool but I'm I'm just not into that  all yeah hit meus oh topics right uh oh I got signed out perfect good timing luk you got any topics yeah Luke are you fidgeting with
something yeah stop it I was I'm sorry I stopped minus still has his phone on lcas fidget my phone's been muted forever it was mut already I was switching between the free Spin and the and the not free Spin oh my God sorry shake your leg like a normal person probably doing that too oh yeah are you sure you don't have ADHD as well there no way he do PR sure that I do and I'm just fine there's no way he doesn't have you considered meth did you just say  meth going to get us demonetized with
that sorry you're not sorry if you were sorry you wouldn't have done it that's one of my favorite Evon lines yeah that's good all right Logan Paul sues coffeezilla for defamation oh Bo investigation YouTuber coffeezilla is being sued for defamation by pro wrestler and fellow YouTuber Logan Paul accurate I mean he is isn't he doesn't he fight in the WWE or whatever I guess technically anything you've been paid to do you're a professional at so sure yeah uh well Logan Paul and
coffeezilla have a tenuous relationship since coffeezilla did expose on Logan Paul's nft cryptog game called crypto Zoo this lawsuit doesn't have to do with that uh with that reporting though Paul did threaten to sue for those videos but dropped the threats instead the lawsuit is primarily focused on a tweet from crafy Zilla that reads Logan Paul really is the type of Dude to thank you when you expose his scam then block you when you remind him to pay up the Tweet is ref uh referencing no the Tweet is
referring to Paul announced buyback of crypto assets from the community that invested in crypto zoo that only promised to cover a fraction of the money invested and apparently has not yet materialized thankfully to protect from frivolous lawsuits coffeezilla has media insurance or errors and omissions insurance which is standard insurance for many media Outlets to use when being sued for things like defamation except his insurance company refuses to cover his claim meaning that coffeezilla will
have to pay expenses out of pocket yikes uh to help fund their defense coffeezilla has done a merch drop which can be found at coffeezilla store okay so there's a couple of things here um that I I feel like are necessary to talk about um his insurance company failing to cover him is due to sort of a comedy of errors where I think uh cofy zilla's existing um errors and Emissions coverage was expiring so he asked to get a new one and then they got him a new one and he was like hey but does it like
have this coverage and they're like yeah and then he didn't read it and it turns out it didn't um so who's liable for his for his insurance not covering this is probably TBD after some kind of legal process pays out but that's what I believe we know so far um the other thing is a lot of people don't seem to understand what defamation is um it's a word that I've used before it's a word that we've used before as a company and it has a really specific meaning that I think a lot of people do not understand
if you were to say something like hey don't do a defamation about me don't defame me that doesn't mean you can't say anything negative you can absolutely say something negative you just better be damn good and sure that it's true defamation is saying something about someone that damages their reputation and isn't true now the definition of Truth and who the onus is on to prove the veracity of the claims is going to vary from region to region um depending on you know how how the
laws are worded and how how everything is set up but functionally defamation slander Lial all of these things are only bad if what you're saying is not TRUE  so our discussion question here is how does one defame someone with a  Paul's um that's funny it can still obviously happen um yeah this is going to be a really tough one because as far as I can tell Logan yeah by the way not legal advice but I just want to make it really clear guys that there is nothing wrong with saying someone something
about someone that hurts their reputation that is true um and personally I I have I have never objected to someone saying something about me that hurts my reputation that is true my only objection has ever been when someone says something that damages my reputation that is not in fact true so this is where Logan Paul is going to have to is going to have I guess a a challenge ahead of him to prove that what coffeezilla said was untrue or misleading and also damaged his
reputation um if you want to deeper dive into the legal side of it cof not coffee Zilla legal eagle has a video from two  man it's wild maybe check that out in coffee zilla's line of work it is wild that he was without erors and Emissions insurance so ARs and Emissions insurance would cover if you accidentally defamed someone so it's kind of a a cya um for yeah if he did accidentally defame him looking at this tweet though that feels like it's going to be a really difficult
case for Logan Paul to prove like maybe the plan is just to bury him in legal fees as opposed to actually collect any money from him I also can't imagine that log Logan Paul really needs the money from  um give me one quick second I'll be  back yeah okay he apparently specifically chose a state that didn't have anti-s slap laws so the idea is just to bury him in legal fees um yeah so slap I forget the exact I forget what it stands for but basically it's like a it's a it's a frivolous
lawsuit that's just designed to waste someone's time and money strategic lawsuit against public participation there you go okay man this is this is wild um well good luck with that Logan Paul but especially good luck with that coffeezilla I want to go check out okay Riley's adding some stuff because apparently he's watching wow so his insurance company added specific exemptions to his agreement saying they wouldn't cover defamation and errors and Emissions it wasn't caught by coffe
zilla's team or insurance broker coffeezilla thinks they may have scammed him but cannot be sure man Insurance Brokers are one of those things like dude uh Dan have you ever used a travel agent uh no I don't think so okay um it's one of those things where they claim that they can save you money mhm but they take a cut so how does the math work on that every single time whether we're talking Insurance Brokers mortgage brokers travel agents every single time where there is an opportunity to cut out
a middle person Ivonne has been able to negotiate a better deal than through a broker and with communication breakdowns I know in some cases Insurance there's absolutely no way to get away from Brokers but man I just I hate adding extra middle persons with their extra cuts and with their extra potential for communications to break down I'm about to say something that might be pretty unpopular with some of the people that we work with professionally but agencies uh marketing
agencies are another example of that I can't think of very many I can think of some I'm not going to name any names here but I can't think of many situations where our engagement with a brand was enhanced by dealing with a creative or marketing agency It generally just adds complexity reduces um how far the budget will stretch because they always take a cut and generally reduces the amount of information that we can get it it just yeah it's it it's terrible basically terrible uh Vinnie 2K says often tribel
agents receive deals directly from hotels and tour operators that you may not have access to except Vinnie if you call that hotel and say hey my travel agent offered me this deal they will often give you a better deal because money is just money money's money um and if they have to give someone else some of it then they'd be better off negotiating with you directly that's just that's just how it is uh Kelly says I used a travel agent that may not have saved me any money but
they saved me a ton of time and that's fair enough um my problem is not talking about travel agents though I I I was I was just talking about middle middlemen my problem though is I have an Ivonne who will always do a better job than like the travel agent would do  um all right oh yeah right I wanted to check out I wanted to check out the store okay where's the where's the link where the link go oh coffeezilla store cill store yeah I just typed it have you checked anything out is it any good yeah the uh 
cool what is this I'm suing okay yeah I used to like coffeezilla until he investigated me that's awesome I want that one it's going to I I think I might actually buy that because uh hold  go coffeezilla boom investigated look at  guilty it's a it's a different guy that guy has a beard yeah yeah I know right did did he do us only once or did he do us more than once did lus dye his hair and shave his beard to escape controversy oh did he did he only do us the one time all
right okay I'm doing it 3 $38 okay all right fine fine fine fine fine fine fine fine fine uh oo there's a long sleeve okay I think I might need this one heck yeah let's go add to C actually I I haven't even looked at everything yet okay sorry I'm actually just shopping right now if you guys want to hang out and shop with me then that's cool if you want Luke to do a topic that's cool too no let's just shop just don't check it on stream please yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah just relax buddy
he's going to check out on stream just relax you would absolutely do it are they all t-shirts he should have a screwdriver we should do a coffeezilla defense screwdriver you know what I just want to shout out I want to shout out coffeezilla for posing in his own merch okay I hate that when a YouTuber thinks a drop is cool enough for you to spend money on it but doesn't think it's cool enough to take 15 minutes out of their day and put the merch on and be in the picture oh he's
gone A Step Above beyond that too this is awesome look at the backgrounds and they're like color matched it's sick this is great yeah these are cool yeah I'm I'm doing this one wait I already have cat shirt what cat one what are you talking about yeah the thank you I'm suing shirt is a cat um yeah that's cool but I I like the one that speaks directly to me I mean the cat is pretty cool yeah and it's like it's topical because it talks about how like when when Logan Paul thanked him at the
beginning and then uh kind of turned around and is now trying to sue him and all that kind of stuff yeah no I like the one I like I like the one that I can pretend  directly to be clear I never never I never stopped liking coffeezilla I think I actually wasn't even aware of his video until we were talking about coffeezilla covering someone else on the show and someone was like yo coffeezilla covered you before or something like  forget yeah M laer says was going to say lonus
isn't in the photos for the chroma te on the store but oh he's wearing it right now let's go come at me come at me I will use any product from LT store.com and if it's good enough for me it's good enough for you let's go yeah give me a sec oh this guy this guy's going away again he's probably getting hacked probably getting like de conned uh all right I guess I will have to check out later but I'm going to have to try to not forget to do this that's going to be really really really really
hard okay what do we want to talk about next Dan apparently you and I are on it together hold on hold on hold on what L Luke has the shirt he has what shirt he has the RGB one sorry the uh I was pointing out that I I I wore mine yesterday oh nice Perfect all right funding the coffeezilla defense continue to shipping blah blah blah all right what do you want to talk about next Luke why am I picking all the the topics you always pick the topics there's a new one that got added at the top I believe
ooh oh it's just ready now two investigations by 404 media expose a Facebook incentivizing AI slop spam and B Invidia scraping Netflix YouTube and AI training Jason cobbler spent months researching where Facebook's grotesque AI spam like shrimp Jesus comes from and found an ecosystem of influencers making courses on YouTube and telegram teaching people how to use Facebook's creator program bonus to make money churning out AI engagement bait the influencers primarily located in India the
Philippines and Vietnam train PE uh train people to set up an a automated systems generating prompts like poor people thin body to feed into Microsoft's free AI image generator and then post hundreds of AI generated images on Facebook per day accounts get approved for monetization after a few days of churning out AI posts one one spammer made $431 from a picture of a train made of leaves for their part Facebook does have automated spam detection but these AI spam Artisans have complicated ways to
avoid it oh dude Facebook's Creator program okay this article is crazy because you basically the I forget what it is you like make a you make a WordPress site and then you like link it to something else on the back end and then it like posts on your behalf and because you it it like turns into an ad on Facebook but it's not an ad but it like looks like a certain type of content so when people click it they think they're opening a gallery but actually they're just going to a site
like like all the ways that it's interconnected I'm I'm looking at this going like dude it's just Facebook like really but apparently people are making serious yeah serious money at this yeah Facebook's Creator program page says it incentivizes original content which does technically describe newly generated AI images Jason um or the the author's takeaways are that obviously uh don't fault the people who are making money this way yeah I mean they're a lot of them are coming from places where
they don't necessarily have a lot of opportunities um now that doesn't mean that I think it's great however if you read the article Luke I I read it before the show if you read the article it's clear that this is a systemic problem this is something that Facebook is clearly not motivated to fix and could fix if they wanted to but because yes but because everyone's making money from this just engagement bait Facebook is clearly looking the other way and not closing these loopholes
that's where Jason's coming from where don't blame the people that are using this loophole it's it's kind of like uh it's kind of like tax avoidance basically saying look don't blame be better don't blame the person who's minimizing their tax you would do the same thing blame the lawmakers who are clearly enabling this behavior and doing nothing to stop it and except for the fact that it's usually the case that the people avoiding the tax are paying the lawmakers to keep it there so you should
still blame them yes but I'm I'm trying to explain where his point is coming from and it's it's just not quite as black and white as I think it came across in the notes yeah that makes sense uh American tech companies these are these are the author's takeaways again American tech companies yet again launch things without understanding how they will be used and our convos about info Integrity plagiarism Etc are very divorc from reality okay in a separate investigation 404 media Samantha Cole obtained slack
messages and documents showing that to train an AI video model Nvidia scraped as much as 80 hours of video per day from Netflix and super high quality YouTube channels like mkb wait we talked about this before the only difference is that I think Nvidia has given a statement now saying that their AI training practices are in full compliance with the letter and spirit of copyright law um so yeah sure that's definitely not saying we didn't do that also get wck lus you weren't named uh Nvidia compiled
a list of sorry I wasn't named in what yeah they they well they said they scraped 80 hours of video per day from Netflix and super high quality YouTube channels like MKBHD but not not LTT yikes or IP uh Nvidia compiled a list of at least 38.5 million video URLs to SC scrape screenshots show a senior employee discussing downloading the whole Netflix uh when asked if they had approval for scraping the same senior employee called it an executive decision saying that we have an umbrella approval for all of the
data in a statement to 404 media Nvidia said its AI training practices are in full compliance like lonus just said um when asked for comment a Google representative linked 404 media to a Bloomberg interview in which Youtube CEO Neil Mohan said that AI open AI scraping YouTube to train its Sora video generator would be against YouTube's terms of service um so making that statement to get rid of the heat that isn't them saying that Nvidia wasn't given permission that's true which would be interesting
because back to what I was talking about man must have been two hours ago on the show or whenever it was um where I said that in general YouTube had built up credibility with me had built up trust with me in the past but has lost it in a big way um this is a perfect example of one of the kinds of things that I would have assumed YouTube would do the right thing at some point but I would no longer assume YouTube would do the right thing about the obvious right thing for them to do here if they are monetizing
my video as a member of the YouTube Partner program would be to share that Revenue but you look at some of the moves that Google has made more recently like when they opened up monetization on videos on channels that were not enabled for monetization yeah I was looking at it going hey you guys recognize that this creates a clear conflict of interest right like you guys are financially motivated to run ads at a higher rate on channels that are not enabled for YouTube Partner program
because you guys keep everything it's not like you take that and share the bucket that would have gone to the Creator it's not like you distribute that to other creators on the platform to continue to build this ecosystem you guys are just taking it whereas when you run it out on my channel you have to you have to share it with me and they're like no that's not a problem I'm like look I we're not doing anything wrong I'm like I didn't say you were I didn't say you were favoring it I said it's a
conflict of interest I said you guys are financially incentivized to favor it and basically that was the end of the conversation um so this is another this is another clear example if Google were to monetize video that's being uploaded to the in this way this is another example of something that I would have Once Upon a Time assumed that they would share with their creator community and  would  um I don't know this whole thing's going to suck someone I think tweeted it or something there was a uh Bing chat
response that they got to a question no it's on Reddit I think a Bing chat response that they got to a question which cited the LT Forum nice thanks open on there yeah yeah exactly sweet Mac OS Sequoia asks for permission a lot Apple has been trying to step up Security on the Mac in recent years making it more Awkward to run apps that require certain permissions or apps from non uh App Store store sources with seoa apple will remove the ability to control click to override gatekeeper when
opening unsigned or non-ed apps apps that are granted access to features like screen recording or location tracking will also now require the user to continue to allow the access on a weekly basis as well as after every system restart Apple has not commented publicly but apparently has confirmed to multiple developers that this is not a bug uh some articles suggest that this could be a Domestic Abuse Prevention measure While others liken it to Windows vista's UAC prompts calling it a subscription
you didn't buy but can't cancel our discussion question is where do you draw the line between keeping users safe while staying out of the way of power users that don't want you to Nanny them um I don't have answers here yeah the problem is that okay you know back to the domestic abuse argument you know if a spouse is you know screen sharing or uh screen recording everything you do should you should you find that out if you're not techsavvy uh I don't know the right answers here
but I do know that I would find those prompts annoying and I would want to get them to go away I think there's other ways to deal with that like a a like computer use awareness little like notification um it could be like I don't know I I think that's not too difficult of a thing to do you could like do a popup once a week like did you know that you're screen is like constantly being recorded this is like not normal activity for most users we're just making sure that you're aware because
there could be like issues with this something like that would be fine easy things just get okayed yeah but super annoying constant password prompts result in terrible easy to crack passwords like that that that's not a solution either yeah G1 says this is going to end up just like cookies you'll click the button and not read it yep yeah 100% exactly like it's um that's why I'm saying like try to bundle it into like a warning like non non-standard usage warning of some
form after 33 years the longest running us Gaming magazine is gone rip Game Informer you did oh all right cool YH all right let's do some merch messages and then I kind of actually need to go   Dan is Dan there Dan's not there oh uh I guess I'll I'll read some merge messages uh Tristan says am I the only one who's really impressed by Zen 5 thoughts luk Linus Dan yes it's only a marginal performance Improvement but at 30 to 40% less power and a lower MSRP hey PBO exists Tech Community Tech
Community seems cold on them I mean I think we made our position really clear in our review we were quite positive on Zen 5 we acknowledge that it's not for everything and it's not for everyone um I am super not stoked on the fact that AMD didn't give it a higher power Target out of the box and the fact that I have to Avid my warranty in order to see the generational uplift that is absolutely there if it was unlocked from the factory but it's also not the first time that we've seen this kind of very
conservative power management from AMD we've seen it before with their 5000 "series and 7,000 series x3d chips so" maybe this amount of power is just what's safe for ryzen 9000 and that's just what we're going to have to live with but overall I think a big part of the tech community's frigidness is based on the tech community's perspective of is this a great upgrade for my processor that's the latest and greatest today that world is over you guys like that's that's dead upgrading every generation
is just not a thing anymore so what we're comparing against is if it's time to buy a new computer right now how does it compete in the market and the answer is really well I figured out where that notification sound is coming from it's coming from my watch sorry you guys kept telling me to mute my notifications I was like oh I I did I'm that's why it was so loud cuz it was right next to the microphone yeah I'm not used to uh I'm not used to wearing a smartwatch anymore I'm going to be honest with you guys I
do not actually know how to adjust the volume on this I figured it out yay being uh Tech influencer or whatever all right cool sorry about that open a ticket um all right Dan you want to hit us with some merge messages yeah sure I've got a bunch here let's see um do contaminant monitoring products exist for water Loops that could have alerted you before yours failed I work with tech that could easily be pivoted to that use case if there's a market for it I'm sure it does exist but certainly not at the
kind of cost that I would want to pay for my janky stupid dump heat into my pool uh water cooling Loop I've got some I've got some plans for the longer term but that's uh yeah super cool technology and probably not applicable outside of like real data centers and supercomputers and stuff sorry Chad seems to have missed what did I miss when I was away no you're fine okay cool uh Luke it seems like you pump the brakes when discussing web Technologies I would love to see more segments related to your
expertise insights and opinions how do I pump the brakes I don't know uh you you press down on them a few times thanks lus you should probably have them bled if they're spongy like that I yeah I don't think most the audience really cares um I think I address it at a level that gets the point across but doesn't result in me talking about it for freaking ever we're not like a web developer Creator um I'm at Defcon right now hanging out with a few of them but that's not really what we do uh so
honestly if you want content on that you're probably better off just viewing someone else's uh but I don't I don't mind like trying to answer the questions that do come through that also being said I'm not a developer these days um I manage developers and I'm in the space but like yeah I don't know I do what I can and I do what makes sense hi first time merch messenger a passion project I've had in mind build a computer with the longest possible lifespan around 300 years maybe how
would you go about this Hardware  topic you wouldn't um you might be able to find data storage that would last that long I think mdisk has a lifespan in the neighborhood of hundreds or thousands of years um but every element of a modern computer is going to significantly Decay  sorry hello Dan Luke and Tech Slim Shady having both dyslexia and ADHD and had an ex tell me it annoyed her any advice on dealing with your ADHD and dyslexia in your relationship and professional life find someone who likes you for
you be apologetic own it be upfront um don't use it as an excuse um all three of those yeah try to try to find ways to I mean there are benefits to I mean not not to dyslexia but there there are benefits to things like ADHD you get that hyper Focus going on and stuff like that um so make yourself hyper useful when you can and then when it's not working out great then it's not working out great I don't know and write down everything yes to the best of your ability Yep this is technically after dark
right yeah yeah sorry about that no that's all good I had to push the buttons okay let's see just started college this week at 37 wish me luck luk and Linus if LTT hadn't taken off would you guys have wanted to go back or finish college what would you have majored in I would have needed to see someone require the degree for something that I really really really wanted to do there was no way I was going to go back just  LS I feel like I still probably would have done software engineering but but
realistically if it if it was now I wouldn't be going that route um not because like I feel like people are going to spin that not because like oh AI are GNA take the jobs or anything like that um just I've I've kind of started doing other things now it's been a long time since I made my decision to go to university I respect the decision I did make at the time but it's not the same one that I would make now where I'm  is hello W people I just found out that our tube Blazers run Windows 7 while on
the network with a port open for service not to mention that we have confidential part files thoughts you and everyone iol oh sorry needed you and everyone I mean obsolete software is a reality in the daily lives of so many technology workers and administrators um try to do  everybody yeah I feel like we're headed into kind of a Dark Age right because for things like old nuclear reactors or like um you know old really old machine shops or like like a lot of really a lot of
obsolete Windows 95 and Windows 98 stuff is like it's bad or whatever but it can it can be not on the network so it's not that bad whereas we're headed into the Vista and Windows 7 running Machines of the world um being Obsolete and probably way more connected and therefore potentially a worse attack Vector uh I think we're headed into a very dangerous period as far as like outdated it infrastructure and security goes love the podcast gives me something to listen to while I drive semi-trucks
when is the next noctua collab I don't know um we're not going to force anything right screwdriver was cool uh we made some brown screwdrivers and that was cool but I I don't think there's anything on the docket right now hi dll I'm a big fan of the adult Lego sets like Pac-Man Nintendo and Atari what Lego set would you buy instantly should it come out greetings from the Netherlands oh my goodness um Lego's really expensive someone gave plof I forget who this is uh but a viewer I believe gave
plof um a a Lego set or like like a Lego diarama of our set like the build corner set and it is so cool like the ideas they had they they did everything from like the LED strips at the bottom of the little cages to the little arm that sits on that our camera guys use to hold the camera like it oh it is so cool I would buy it that's awesome I would buy it I would want one LTT Lego collab could buy the whole building that'd be neat that'd be so cool let's see lonus what are your
thoughts on smpte 2110 the uncompressed video over IP standard do you see any advantage to be able to record directly to a Nas uh oh wait is this what we use for short circuit cuz I don't think they record to SD cards I don't think so I don't know but if this allows you to I've never I've never heard this term before at least not that I remember but if it allows you to record on a camera and then just stream out of an ethernet cable to a NZ or something like that then I love it um and I think we being
uncompressed though being uncompressed seems weird why would you even want it to be okay there are reasons to want it to be uncompressed but I could I wouldn't see us doing that I don't see why we'd want completely uncompressed video uh that sounds super cool um but I think I'd be okay with some compression ndi is absolutely nowhere near uncompressed uh sorry n exists in flo plane chat yeah and there's there's stuff other than ndi ndi is not the only option for uh video delivery over over a local
network yeah I think we found found some stuff with Labs that was absolutely not going to be good for it okay let's see we hey lonus with all the Mr Beast allegations going on I was wondering Were you invited to the big YouTuber video if so why did you not go um I I don't think Jimmy's ever invited me to be in a video um I don't know I it's weird I feel like even though I'm West Coast so I'm I'm like a 2 and a half hour flight from LA um whether I just haven't made the right
social connections or people like other creators know who we are like Luke talked about this years ago where he went to twitchcon for the first time and like thought fans were going to approach him and they totally had no idea who he was but twitch creators would be like being mobbed by people and they'd see him and be like sorry excuse me I got to go and like go to Luke people know who cool but very surprising experience but I I feel like they don't really think of us as
like I don't know like I don't know it's like I'm Tech dad or something like I'm not I I don't think I'm you're not super social when it comes to creators like you don't really go to like you don't like going to events I guess that's true sorry I know Mr be East Coast guys I'm saying like a lot of collabs happen in LA La is like The Hot Spot um I wasn't specifically talking about Jimmy there I just meant like I don't really get asked to collab on anything um like L lwi has has
collabed with us but I feel like uh he really he was really the one who drove that I I can't really take any any credit for it um like he called me recently he was he had people give him advice on his birthday I think I ended up giving a tier advice know how I did it I was at a badminton gym and they just had like some books like like motivational books and I just like read the titles off the spines of like motivational books and he was like that's pretty good that's pretty good and then I like flipped my
camera over and I showed him that I was just reading off of something it's pretty good that's that's pretty great I think I think part of it is a uh weird people over a border in the corner situation where people would have to I mean America is so huge and there's so many things to do a lot of Americans don't even have passports I know create American YouTube creators that don't have passports like they're not going to  it's it's it's not convenient when you can like drive down the street for 10
minutes and have as many other collabs as you want um in in a few different areas in the states like New York Texas La um and on top of that you don't like going to events um and I think when you do you probably don't do a ton of the socially things I don't think you go to the parties things like that so okay so basically not in the not in the mind space and then difficult because far and over a border and everything else out of sight out of mind  angle okay let's see I got a couple more
for you here hi lldd I'm a young adult with his first serious partner lion has talked about a don't go to sleep angry rule in the past where did it come from I instead find that resting helps solving conflicts it's not meant to be literal what it means is don't leave things unresolved so like don't go to sleep angry means it means don't walk away in a huff it means don't um don't just leave something and let it Fester it means talk it out work through it work together as opposed to just letting
things letting conflicts letting disagreements pile up over time until  explode and last one I got for you here hey dll question for lonus cross code dev's new game Alabaster Dawn got announced radical fish news looks really neat any thoughts or hopes for the games well I um didn't you're hearing it for  crosscode break nx's curse and guide Humanity's rebirth in this top- down 2 and a2d action RPG from the creators of cross code I can already see some similarities oh yeah there's no way I
don't buy it but um yeah planed release date to be announced uh solve intriguing puzzles explore a changing world okay this looks very closely related gameplay-wise to cross codes so uh really it's you know it's I'm not expecting to get a really different gaming experience out of it but uh what I am expecting I I really like the uh I like the way they've changed the art style a little bit to make it more clear what level things are on it the the world looks a little bit more 2 and a
half dimensional here which is going to really help with solving I think in some cases uh but for me it's going to come down to the story um like that's I I love the characters I love the story that they created with crosscode so as long as they have taken the time and care to you know write a great story for this then I'm I'm stoked yeah if you're excited don't forget to wish list it's very important can't wait oh I'm not going to need to remember that no no it's good for the
devs oh he's saying yeah yeah oh I see well I'm not signed in here oh I am signed in oh look at that okay sure fine cool added to my wish list let's go very good right good lus I'm happy I'm happy you're signed in on that laptop that's a good thing oh what I'm account gets compromised I cares Luke I've got new laptops for you guys so we'll lock them down before we distribute good you lock it down I'm just going to like take it off the table and pull my laptop out of my bag so those are your options
we'll ban your your laptop off the network You Can't Ban my laptop from the network yeah we can no you can't yeah we can I'm not and I won't be able to get any work done well you can use a work laptop that's locked down I'll just bring one from home well B that one fine I'll buy another one what are you GNA do what are you going to do what are you going to do what are you going to do smart guy Network to approved only that would suck no Luke no no you don't want to do that lus why are you doing this to
me what are you GNA do I'm kidding how many hours did I have in Cross code I'm going to  people we've got the the infr Linus team they just follow him around with like tablets just to block firewall rules of Macs and ports and uh how do you uh how do you check that uh you should be able to see on the games page go yeah oh there it is whoa okay some of this has got to be I left it on overnight I apparently have 270 hours in Cross code there's no way oh yeah cuz my son played played through as
well so it's probably like half of that uh but anyway I definitely I definitely have over 100 hours in Cross cat it's a really good game okay I think that's it for this week we'll see you again next week same bad time same bad Channel okay
