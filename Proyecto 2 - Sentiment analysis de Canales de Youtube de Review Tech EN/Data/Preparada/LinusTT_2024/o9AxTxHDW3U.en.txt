welcome to the W show we've got a great show lined up for you today the big news this week is of course that YouTube is changing for the better for the worse maybe some combination of the two uh we'll be talking about it and I was here in person at Creator Summit where they told us not just what's going on but also some of the reasoning behind it uh we're also going to be talking about ah yes of course Nintendo's long overdue lawsuit against pal world for a copyright INF no no it's not copyright
infringement it's something else entirely literally nobody saw this coming what else we got Luke Linux Gamers can no longer play GTA 5 but in other news there's changes to anti-che which is what we're talking about there which might benefit everyone also benefit people whoaaa whoa whoa whoa who whoa whoa whoa okay no no we're breaking up the format explain yourself no no I'm kidding not breaking up the format okay one more one more one more teaser pleas have me scroll away
uh the ryzen 9000 launch it's not going well it's not it's not good yeah it's not not not not good yeah you have to  me is it not in the thing do I press here I'm yeah come on come on you got it where is it it's on the top right there I thought it was in the dashboard  out the show is brought to you today by vessie Corsair and ug green and of course our chair partner secret lab and our laptop partner LG neither of whom I am using right now now unfortunately uh any who why don't we jump right into
our headline topic wait wait no you are you are it's right here I am yeah your your avatar is in front of an LG laptop and sitting in a secret La chair look at me typing look at me typing on my LG gram and sitting in my secret lab chair that you can't even see the back of because I am in front of it with this wall that is the attached to the back of my head covers everything behind me yeah problem let's jump right into our headline topic here which is YouTube is changing whether it's for the better or
the worse well we'll leave that up to you but first why don't we go through the sweet of new features that they announced on at made on YouTube several of which are AI powered first up we've got dream screen which makes still and moving backgrounds for YouTube shorts and will now use the newest version of Google deep Minds text to video generator vo vo will allow for more realistic backgrounds as well as the ability to edit and remix previously generated content in the first half of
the Year dream screen will be able to generate entire six second clips from scratch okay so why don't we why don't we unpack this one first we can we can kind of go through one by one um Luke thought generation of still in moving backgrounds for YouTube shorts uh I don't think this is necessarily super new in the still backgrounds sense is you could have done this with a variety of tools already that already exist the moving background sense is interesting I believe the
average short is about 30 seconds if I remember correctly um so you're going to need five of these to be able to actually stitch together one whole short um honestly I don't think the impact of this is going to be super extensive unless you start getting people um like fake reporting like saying they're on the scene somewhere and the background is that place and it's hard to tell if they're actually there or not um which could be problematic I personally uh am having a hard time
imagining uh why this would be good for well why don't you throw up why don't you throw up the examples why don't you throw up the the examp I've got those here your your uh big face is in front of them um but this is this is the video this is the video this is what it would be like this is what it would be like you generate the background and then you just got your face with kind of like a badly thing in front of it yeah so I guess okay this is perfect this is definitely a better
experience yeah sorry carry on the concerns that I've had are are not really I gu no the example says dreamlike so it's intentionally trying to not be realistic honestly that feels like a calculated move um yeah because they they they don't want to show it creating realistic like scenes I don't know um I'm sure we'll get these videos with text over them with an AI voice speaking some type of uh motivational junk and then that's going to get churned out 10 billion times and fill
your shorts feed with with garbage and useless content um but other than that I I really I I don't know I I have a hard time seeing this creating good content that people actually want um but you know maybe I'll well here's what I'll say talking to YouTube about this so I was at Creator Summit this week um pretty cool definitely um definitely one of the highlights of my career being able to attend this kind of event I sorry nothing you're good there I am uh definitely one of the highlights of
my career being able to attend events like this um I got to um I got to hang out with Michelle carry quite a bit this time around uh got to I was surprised to see Matt Pat there the rumors of his retirement have been greatly exaggerated um but Matt Pat was there which was really great to to be able to connect with him and staff um shoot now that I've started listing people it's going to be horrible when like I forget someone that I that I hung out with for a bit but definitely hung out with
hacksmith for a while it was awesome to see him um oh man now now I'm going to feel now  uh and many other great and fantastic people oh dude dude I finally I finally actually met Carl Jacobs the guy that we "built the $100,000 PC for i' never met" him and it turned out that we were we were on the same floor in the hotel H and I like didn't recognize him because I I don't watch YouTube it's always super awkward for me at these events because everyone else kind of seems to
know who everyone else is because it's a top Creator Summit and so these are a lot of the the like the top creators on the platform and I I don't really watch YouTube we played a game uh late last night like 2 in the morning we were all just like sitting around a picnic table outside and everyone like brought up their their YouTube account and and showed how many of the other people at the table they were subscribed to um Michelle was literally subscribed to everyone else around the table and I
pull up mine and the LT account the main LT account is subscribe to one Creator Luke do you have any guesses as to who it is if you is it is okay can I ask a question first if it was one Creator yeah yeah can tell you what you can ask free questions because you're not going to get it is it one of our own channels no is it a channel that we question previously closely affiliated with closely Affiliated I would say no no okay it's not ncx oh that's where you were going no
that's a oh that was a good guess though that was a really good guess no honestly if it's not them I have a one more so we're we're not a close not closely Affiliated no it's not our own thing no you I think you could have gotten the answers to both of those with just the one I think you could yeah I was I was fishing I was fishing too hard yeah oh dude you wasted you wasted one have we ever have we ever worked with them or collabed with them or anything like that yes so you've at least managed to narrow 
[Laughter] is it like Paul oh good guess good guess good guess but no the answer is lwig and the reason for it he wasn't there so recent I expected it to be like really old okay no the reason for it is that when I was sitting next to him literally next to him in a chair um he like guilted me a little bit that was part of it I think that happened camera but then when I was sitting next to him in the chair doing the Bro versus bro uh he was getting the stream set up and I wanted to interact with chat and I
couldn't because he has like a five minute or a 10 minute subscriber gate on interacting in his live chat so I subscribes to him and then I just like never remembered to unsubscribe or I care and I never looked at it so that was it that was the one I was subscribed to hold on my personal my personal is worse okay so after that because they asked about like what about first everyone was talking about Maine right and for pretty much everyone else on Maine would be the channel they upload
to right because they don't have uh like the the content management system that gives multiple people access to their uh to their uploading tools and their and their Channel management tools and stuff like we we have like eight active channels right now or something like that and we have multiple people that need access to all of them so we have kind of a different access system to our to our Chann channels so my uh like like my main channel is not at Linus Tech tips it's it's just at like my my Gmail
account so so get this okay once again I was not subscribed to anybody who was at the table um you ready sure Linus Tech tips okay that makes sense probably did that at some point Dave and Ava nursery rhymes and baby something so my probably mashed that in fact it was probably my son like 10 years ago when I didn't want to get up in the morning and I was like take my phone um Lulu kids nursery rhymes and children whatever Super Simple Songs kid songs so those are all probably similar
stories I am subscribed with the Bell rung to Apple Canada for some reason no idea why I'm subscribed to Last Week Tonight um don't remember when I did that love John Oliver but I don't remember subscribing to that I don't think I've ever seen a notification for it and then the last two you're going to laugh uh one of them is Killian experience he a totally totally random I know that reference though I know why yeah um and then the last one is the mom boys the the what the mom boys that's
the remember that rap song that has Tekken on my tip yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so I'm so that is the list of channels I'm subscribed I I don't know if you could come up with a more random list of channels if you just started like inputting letters and numbers with your face by mashing your face against your keyboard youtube.com/ mashy face against your keyboard and then just pressing enter like completely completely unrelated to each other channels um so I I lost the
game um I lost that game uh which is fine I guess I forget where I was going with this but uh anyway yeah so finally finally got a chance to meet Carl Jacobs seems like a super nice guy for someone so young he is surprisingly cultured when it comes to gaming my brother just just played Chrono Trigger in the last year and was like dude this is a masterpiece this is like one of the greatest games of all time and I'm just like man and you know what this is this is crazy this is crazy
his favorite final fantasy nine and I was like yeah Seven's overrated he's like I know dude dude all my controversial takes I now feel validated about so I'm that's why I was pretty excited about that um yeah anyway yeah it was it was a great show had a really good time um and right I remember what I'm supposed supposed to be talking about right now um oh wait hold on hold on okay last person last person that I actually got to hang out with a fair bit and oh this is great sorry sorry I
promise I will stop doing story time in a little bit here uh Stephen he do you know Stephen he emotional damage guy ah yes yeah yeah yeah yes dude he is he's one of those YouTubers that is exactly the same in person and yet somehow so different like kind like more unhinged and like random if that makes sense like he's he's exactly the same guy but just like um I I I I'm glad that he doesn't just upload absolutely everything he says because it's like whoa okay cool yep a good
thing love Stephen I showed him the pictures of the Badminton Center and he's like dude back in China when I was like young I was like I played like semi-professionally so we start like yeah YouTuber badminton tournament yeah like dude could we make this a thing probably I'm sure I mean lwig just did YouTuber Olympics if you can do like 15 different sports or whatever I'm sure you can do one yeah exactly I'm at least 115th as good as lwig right maybe yeah I'm sure you can do it you have the cameras set
up dude I I I'd be so excited to do it uh Jawa juice says nerd sports but competent yeah so on that note we actually we talked about the channel badminton Insight a little while ago uh Greg and Jenny reached out hearing about it on the stream uh or hearing that we were talking about them on the stream and I nothing's for sure nothing's for sure but probably sometime let's say let's give ourselves some Breathing Room sometime in the next six to n months um going to come and and my intention I have pitched
this Al I have asked the business team to try to sell a sponsorship for this they they said they think they can do it I would like to resurrect nerd Sports so Greg and Jenny they're Pro players uh but they also do YouTube as a side hustle and um I pitched them the idea so for their Channel they want to do a tour of the center and they pitched a concept that I think is brilliant I absolutely love it I'm not going to spoil it because I want them to to tell you guys what it is but BAS basically it will
involve me filming with them probably for like an entire day and it's going to be an absolute blast and that's going to go on their Channel and then I told them for our Channel I want to bring back nerd Sports I told them about the concept I linked them to the hockey one and I was like so here's the idea you're going to play against like regular Joe's on our team and we're going to come up with some with with some creative fun handicaps in order to try to level the playing field not only were they down
but they started pitching back to me like really funny handicaps um Luke would you want to do you think could be prepped could your shoulder be rehabbed enough to be in this I've I've started a new routine that's been going really well I'll I'll make it work I would love to do that nerd Sports was so much fun I can't even like explain the return of the keyboard Warriors are we doing this yeah yeah yeah of course I've always been down are we doing this dude I'm so excited I'm so excited so so just
it's going to come on channel super fun um that doesn't mean Channel super fun is coming back that just means it's allow it's allowed to have one upload every like four years that just means that Greg and Jenny are coming out here they're flying an awful long way to be here um I want to make sure that everybody is maximizing the value of this trip and I didn't think that there was anything LTT that made a ton of sense with them Channel super fun nerd Sports on the other hand though we've
got professional players in our house why how could we not do this so dude I am uh I'm super stoked I'm I'm super stoked we're gonna the thing is though okay so let's have a let's have a production meeting here because I don't think that I should play for the keyboard Warriors I don't think you can unfortunately what are your thoughts what are your thoughts on that am I do you think I'm too good because let me tell you this hold on let me tell you this first to you I'm probably some kind
of bad Adon God yeah to I a bon ant I am a little thing that they squish under their thumb and then actually no they don't even bother they don't even bother to squish me under their thumb it's not even worth their effort in their if the Gap is that big then it's probably okay actually what I was going to say though if the Gap isn't that big I think you commentating it you know how we used to have commentators oh dude yeah okay well now now I want that role you commentating it I think would
be amazing um if the Gap is that big though you could play but my my immediate reaction was that you would you would just commentate um okay what about this what about this for an idea what if I commentate the keyboard Warriors playing against Greg and Jenny and then at the end you try to step in we we take their we take their fully handicapped level um so whatever maybe they're wearing eye patches by this point and we've got we've got 5B weights on their shoes like whatever it is that we've done to
them to make it so that the game is somewhat even right yeah uh we we put like uh oh man this would be great so you know how much of the badminton stroke is in the wrist right right so we put like um like wrist guards like rollerblading skateboarding like wrist guards on their hands so they can only swing their arms or something like whatever it is we end up having to do to make them barely able to compete against to to compete head to-head against normal yeah and then at the end I walk on and
we see how many of them I can remove before they start to kick my butt Ah that's cool I like that so go all the way one way and then and then basically it's like a battle for me to try to get as many of them off as I can yeah I think that would be super cool do you have to do you have to have a uh like a buddy though would you because it's still Duos right m that's interesting so could I draft the best player from the keyboard Warriors maybe so I cuz I'm commentating I'm watching or or should I
bring in like one of my buds like I'll bring in like my mix doubles partner or um or or what's his name that you just met at the event um emotional damage guy oh like Steven yeah okay that's an idea so goes from keyboard keyboard Warrior to like YouTuber people interesting okay okay I'm going to keep that in mind might be a lot to align it might be a lot to align those trips lmg community in flpl chess says bring in jquan uh yeah yeah we could we could bring in the facility uh the facility
manager for the for the badminton uh for the badminton courts okay all right I'm going to think about it I'm going to think about it I'm going to see I'm going to see see either way this going to be sick dude I'm so excited I'm so excited nerd Sports coming back uh you know what's funny is I mentioned this to I mentioned this well in front of Ivon I hadn't actually talked to her about it uh but I was talking to Stephen about the idea and yvon was there and she was like yeah nerd Sports was fun I think
it'd be fun to do nerd Sports again so you remember when we had like maybe 4% of ivonne's attention helping with the producer side of nerd sports like literally no offense to anyone else who was on team and anyone else who's on our team now and when I say team I don't mean the keyboard Warriors like our nerd sports team I mean our like lus Media Group team no offense to everyone else but for how little time and attention Ivon put into it I don't think anyone else could have gotten us the kinds of
matchups that she did we some pretty cool teams that was that was crazy that was actually nuts if if if she was like full-time producer of nerd Sports I think not only could we bring it back but it could be awesome like 10 Milli views an episode awesome I'd be a th% down nerd Sports was one of like the coolest things I I I used to share them with so many people too because they're like I don't know it's just interesting cont it it plays into the whole concept of like I wish we
could see like just average people compared to the Olympians at the Olympics it's it's it's that but you're really pitting them against each other and really showing the Gap like everything that you need to do to like tear someone down to the level of an average person because well you know that that was a big part of the original idea behind it right like it got kind of lost in the way that we we were a really small company and there were a lot of production challenges but like it so it
kind of got lost in in everything I'm not going to I'm not going to lay the blame on anyone person's feet because it's a that's not cool and B it doesn't lie on any one person's feet um but what got kind of lost was that it was supposed to be about highlighting not professional top tier level athletes but the next down or the next down you know the people who were trying to go pro and basically really like putting in your face so that you cannot escape this how different these guys are from the
person sitting on their couch going I could have caught that you know like actually standing on the court next to the Trinity Spartans do you remember that you're even a you're a reasonable freaking sized dude but did you not feel intimidated by those women yeah they dunked us pretty hard because I did there there was I mean we definitely fielded some some players on the on the keyboard Warriors that were not athletic but despite being keyboard Warriors we've we've always had a decent
amount of people on the team that are fairly naturally athletic and we would just still get completely destroyed in every single sport I was like never close completely oh man yeah uh Stephen Chu Community manager says how I feel when I see a kicker miss an extra point in the NFL yeah exactly but like if you if you literally stood on that field and tried to make even the like even a below average kick you'd go up there you'd kick it and it'd be like because you are not a world class
athlete while there's like some dude running at you that can tackle you with the force of like an F-150 it's just like slightly nerve-wracking yeah exactly um and then you know obviously the the slight twist compared to Joe's versus Pros or regular people at the Olympics or other people have done this concept before and since is is the leveling of the playing field yeah the Nerfs illustrating just how ridiculous it has to get I mean by the time we were competitive with that hockey team dude they and I was I
was telling the story at at at Creator Summit um they had their skates in little hula hoops so they couldn't and they had to keep the hula hoops on their skates so they couldn't lift them up they were holding pineapples in one hand they had to link arms with the player next to them so there were effectively only three of them on the ice compared to our six and they had to use little plastic toy sticks and it was still really close when we called Next Point wins with us with five skaters plus a
plus a goalie that's not Tethered to someone fullsize sticks saying skaters is maybe a little much yeah that's a little generous five people that happen to be on Ice yeah I um I had scars from that for for years and now you can't normally see them but when I get really cold you can still see the lines from where the laces were oh no oh man that was rough uh yeah yeah blundetto says if I were out on the ice instead of Conor McDavid the Oilers would have won the Stanley Cup exactly
but the thing is you're meing obviously right but so many people some people aren't yeah seem to actually think that when I was in my Prime I could have no you could no you couldn't have man no you couldn't have these guys are otherworldly talented um so anyway yeah nerd Sports I'm super excited and I think there's a document I'm supposed to be reading from to talk about stuff so right right right we hav made it through the first topic I'm so sorry talking to YouTube in person one
of the big things that they emphasized with these new AI features because as you can imagine in a room full of people whose job it is to create audio and backgrounds and video for a living right um there's going to be a pretty high degree of sensitivity around AI creation tools right so one of the things that they said kind of over and over and over again was hey this is not meant to be a replacement for human creativity these are meant to be tools to enhance human creativity and I feel
like I feel like I both agree with YouTube and I also I wouldn't say disagree but have serious concerns about it so the way that they the way that they explained it was that there's like a a creative Loop right in your your ideation and your execution and your promotion and your publishing and your ideation your whatever right so you know theoretically you know if a perfect AI would just replace the human element of all of it it would ideate execute promote and publish and it would
be just a perpetual motion machine that consumes fresh water and electricity right the way that they've explained how AI tools will be rolled out on YouTube is that they will they will not be allowed to function like that because they will keep the human Creator in that creation loop at every stage there will have to be human input or human validation verification or human tuning but here's my issue this vo background thing I'm certainly the human who's going to say stuff in front of it right
because I I can see that being an obvious thing that people might do with this they're just like kind of creating a A vibe they're creating a mood for the background of just like like a short video talking about something or whatever right but what about all the humans who worked on like background creation other than me just like rubber stamping which one I think is good or fine-tuning the text prompt that I'm giving it I feel like they they maybe were I feel like they were maybe addressing the concerns of
the people in the room right because these are the people that are running the channels that are the the front men or front lady or whatever uh the people who own the business right like they're addressing business owners if you think about it top creators yes they're they're they're people and and and and you know you connect with them and some of them some of them are business owners of like like a oneperson business and some of them are business owners of a of a of a a 50 or 100 person business right
but they're but they're effectively business owners if they're operating at the kind of scale that they're at top Creator Summit right um what well what what about the people who work on their team and I feel like they didn't really say anything to me to address any of that so that's my that's my concern but then they also said the quiet part out loud right um and they were like well AI is here and so either we're going to like enable our creative Community with it or um they're going to use it anyway with
third party tools and um or or our you know our top creators here won't be using it because you know Nar duells or using it for deep fakes or you know whatever kind of nonconsensual  so we're all we're really doing is accepting recognizing that this is the reality and arming our creative community and I was like yeah um fair enough right yeah I just don't I mean I I think this is my my problem where like the the vo stuff I just don't necessarily see it as like a a good thing um I I have a really hard
time imagining who's going to use this to really benefit much of anything other than spammed out AI generated content which is already running all over uh shorts and Instagram so they they are correct that this isn't giving people a new tool this already existed you could already make AI generated backgrounds you could already make AI generated video backgrounds you could already make AI generated audio all this type of stuff it was all already possible they're just putting on YouTube but
we've seen the impact of these tools on other platforms and I personally haven't seen it generate anything of of real significant value um other than spam so I just I don't know I I don't personally see the good benefit to it um but I I don't see it being dramatically worse than what we already have either if we make these tools less of like a like a nerdy um you know I spend my life working on tools for spamming people and more of a just I am a thing sitting in the YouTube Creator
Studio that highly creative people now have access to easily and don't need to learn about is there an argument there that maybe that would actually increase the quality of some of the the AI use outputs I seriously doubt it personally cuz what's what's the value in it like what what is the what are you bringing to the table by AI generating a background to this video for six seconds honestly I think that's like that's a big part of it for me is like what am I doing with six seconds of background other than
like but man part of it too though is like I in a lot of ways feel like a bit of an outsider at events like this because I can be pretty creative like I think if you tell me like hey lonus come up with an intro hook for the knock to a booth coverage at a trade show and you know I I I I get Jacob and I'm like okay Jacob I need you to stab me in the back with my own screwdriver and we're going to film like my death scene in your booth and like like I'm I'm kind of creative but there's a level of
creativity that um or like outside of the box thinking that I encounter every time I go to one of these meetups that I'm just like yeah if you gave me a thousand years and a thousand monkeys and a thousand typewriters and a thousand caffeine pills I would never never come up with that like I I ended up they did an aign seating lunch just to force people to mingle a little bit and I ended up seated across from I really I'm I feel terrible because I forget his name but I I ended up seated
across from someone who is predominantly a shorts Creator and who actually only even made a channel to promote his ice cream filled dut shop and so his real business is like he he even has like apparel for it but his but his real business is actually like franchising out his ice cream filled doughnut like like restaurant and he just like apparently kills it hard enough on YouTube shorts that it not only is a great promotional tool for the business but it's making money but it's is but it's making money
they're like killing it on YouTube completely by accident and I'm and I'm  like sure you know right uh they they highlighted um they highlighted this um this super cool example of like tiny fandoms and like Community remixing uh where it was it's this channel I think it's called uh two two gay grandpas who had this travel Vlog where they just went and tried stuff and were super charming and they had like 90 subscribers or something like that and and they uploaded all these videos
someone remixed it uploaded it somewhere else and was like hey we need to get these guys like some actual views because these videos are great and somebody needs to watch them and then "they immediately like 100,000" subscribers uh like I wouldn't have I would never have thought to to put together something like that like I don't know it's just it's just and it's not like these are these are completely unique ideas they're just not things that I would have ever thought of and so when
people when when YouTube releases a tool just because I have no idea what I would do with it doesn't mean that nobody's going to do anything really interesting with it and so I'm always fearful saying I don't I don't know what anyone would do with it I just don't know well I'm trying to frame it that way specifically because I don't and like I hope that someone does I just the all of these tools already exist and we've seen what the quick to arm themselves with tools especially when their free
creative Community has done with them which by and large has been create spam content um or just like you know put a quote generator onto a thing put AI voice on top of all of the quotes put random backgrounds with like Roman or um Gothic or or old school Scandinavian or sorry Nordic I should say um or whatever like religious figures put the quotes in front of it play the AI voice spam it on the internet and then get tons of views like that that type of stuff is is rampant super rampant and that's where
I'm seeing all of the AI use in short form content go to I I haven't personally seen it to go to practically anything other than that so h i maybe I'm not creative enough to find a use for 6sec AI generated Clips to go on short form content but maybe someone will I I imagine there's like uh someone's going to grab some form of instrument and sing weird random custom fun songs and have weird AI videos playing behind them CU it's like fun and artistic hopefully somebody does that
I'm sure there's like a thing or two that people can figure out um but I think by and large these tools are made to mass generate yeah to mass generate garbage and then try to play on people's um like mental things like wanting to hear quotes that agree with what they say and and stuff like that and then just Spam it out um which I don't is valuable okay YouTube will also be adding a carousel of highlighted comments and and AI comment reply suggestions to YouTube Studio which is
supposed to mimic the style and tone of the Creator I asked some more um questions about this uh and basically my understanding is that the the the tuning of this should be done based on your own replies to people's comments on your channel I I asked about the possibility of um uploading data to help train it um that's not something that they're that they're looking at right now like I I there's remember when we when we showed that really cool uh Community project where um someone made like a like an AI
searchable wow Q&amp;A like prompt yeah yeah so I kind of I asked like hey look if we had a transcription of like every question and answer we had ever done on the WAN show like is that something that we could we could provide to you to kind of help train this tool and they're like no not at this time um so this one like put like an unlisted video and make a bot that comments every single question on Wow ever into it and then have another bot that replies to each one of
those from the Creator Channel with the proper response to build it ourselves we can do this we have the technology that's interesting you don't like it Google we'll do it ourselves here's my here's my problem with this a reply from the Creator is supposed to be a reply from the Creator and I don't that's immediately why I winced yeah this is this is this feels like a falsification of that interaction like when I reply to someone's comment in the comments um I I do go out of my way to
sign it LS so you can tell it isn't another member of the team but that means I replied to you that doesn't mean that an AI replied to you and honestly and and I don't mean I don't mean any disrespect to any the channels that do this but when I go on a channel and literally every comment has a reply from the Creator that's like thank you for your comment YouTube already has a feature that suggests a quick reply it just is super rudimentary it just isn't very good it'll just say like thanks for
your comment or um you thanks so much or something like that right um I feel like that's like cringe and and crappy um but this is worse because it's it's almost like it's like misleading manipulative look you want to get parasocial let's get parasocial you know fine you know let Le let's let's imagine that we're pen pals with our with our favorite Creator or whatever because they they replied thanks for your comment right but now we're we're almost creating like a like a whole other like
like it's not even like real parasocial instead you're getting parasocial with an AI That's trained on what the Creator had said in the past like I dude I don't know it just seems pretty messed up right it it's it's like masked Creator AI because with with the Creator AIS that were made when you know gbd4 first popped off there was a bunch of like date this twitch streamer things right like I think there's an amaranth AI or something like that those ones are overt you know that you're interacting with a
fake thing this one has the masking of it being actually you um so you you can't know and you have to know that certain creators that do certain things on the platform are going to use that to try to amp up to put some jet fuel on the fire of these parasocial relationships because they benefit from it in X Y or Z way um this is another there's so many this is God it's like the most frustrating thing with AI stuff is there's so much cool things that we could be doing with these tools but
instead um we're creating fake parasocial relationships yeah we're doing just all the like worst most toxic possible things constantly it's so bad it's oh man it's almost it's almost like people are the problem Luke yeah people are the problem and you know like I mean these these tools are incredibly expensive like the the GPU cost compute cost the velopment cost of all these things yeah the power cost everything is insane for this infrastructure right now so they're trying to find ways that it
can extract as much money as possible um on that note uh this isn't in our this isn't in our notes because it wasn't something that YouTube announced at made on YouTube um but one of the things they talked about a lot you know how I've discussed with you that I felt like the days of the mega channel are kind of numbered at this point yeah and and I feel like YouTube is headed toward I show had uh 1 million live viewers on a live stream recently but okay so when I say okay I should explain what I mean by
Mega Channel I guess what I mean is more like um more like a variety Channel um and I I mean it in when when I look at the the tech space uh I'm referring to to us because we do a little bit of everything we do a review of a phone we do a tour of a factory that makes um that oh oh we do a tour of a facility that recovers gold from electronic manufacturing waste uh we do a video where we walk into someone's house and we cable manage it we do like we we do we have these kind of random formats
that don't really have a Common Thread other than the personalities right and that they're for the most part about you know tech and and mostly IT Tech um a lot of other like really high growth highly engaged channels are much smaller "100,000 or 200,000 or 500,000" subscribers but they do one thing and they do it really well like uh one that I one that I really like is HDTV test um he's up to I think somewhere in the "neighborhood of between 500,000 and and" a million subscribers or something right
now and he and he just he just talks about display technology like panel technology like really gets really gets deep into it and um one of the things that YouTube talked about a lot but in a way that I hadn't really thought about it before because I was thinking about it in terms of subject matter how people people are are searching out ways to go deep and and be and be part of a very very small in the no Community um they kind of came at it completely the other way and they kind of went
like people are people are fans of just about anything and you know one of the examples they gave was uh there's this bridge uh 11 fo 8 in or something like that I forget what it is but there's like a famous overpass or bridge that sorry nothing oh that that has like tons of videos of you know just trucks like scraping the bottom or hitting it or or what whatever else and people will like take selfies with this famous bridge okay yeah yeah yeah chat chat knows what we're talking about the days of
like Madonna you know being and okay that maybe that's a bad example because we have a current generation Madonna her name is Taylor Swift but but my my point is that the days of having like like one person you know Johnny Carson you know uh on on his late night show which I forget what it's called was it tonight show Late Show whatever whatever Johnny Carson's show was like way back in the in like the' 60s um he was like like a single dominant force and if you like watched TV you like watched that uh
these days like fandoms can be can be tiny uh like there's they showed this channel where this is a this is a "YouTuber that has over 150,000" subscribers and literally her entire Channel fans of her Channel are watching her be a fan of Taylor Swift she uploaded a featurelength film worth a video reviewing one Taylor Swift album and and right so so you're not even like so so there's I think I just muted my mic am I good hello so there's like proxy fandoms now almost and so so
so so I was thinking about it in terms of like subject matter and they're talking about it in terms of like and they didn't quite say this part but but the way that I interpret it as as wanting to be part of a community that isn't too big and almost like finding something whether it's like getting super deep into display panel Tech or whether it's getting super deep into like essentially the the online version of like a of like a boy or girl band uh fan group you know um that meets 
I forget where I was going with this I have no idea to be completely honest we're we're talking about AI stuff uh and you're talking about how how Niche creators are becoming more of a thing yeah yeah I don't know how that relates to AI stuff um are we talking about the new communities part no no yeah I forget that that's that's fine okay um you were you were about to admit lifelong Swifty oh no that dude I no I don't have to I don't have to I don't have to do I have to admit that like I I think I've been
pretty [Laughter] upfront how YouTube is pushing okay yeah yeah yeah not pushing toward smaller creators but I I think is is um is trending towards smaller creators and yeah I forget exactly what point I was trying to make but uh oh AI responses right right right right right right right right right so people crave smaller communities is what I was trying to say I think there on the internet and maybe it in society in general towards people being actually finally fatigued and
overwhelmed by gigantic communities and I think that one of the ways that that is manifesting is as people is is people craving much much smaller communities and more Niche interests whether they were naturally interested in them or not part of the interest is being one of the people who's into that band that no one else knows and that that exists again in a huge or exists now in a huge way and so so they Illustrated that with fans of this bridge or fans of a super fan of
Taylor Swift you like things that would have never occurred to you in or occurred to me in a thousand years like maybe maybe other people thought of that uh they they showed off this um this Grandma she's like in her 70s and she has a fan channel of like anime style video games she's like I didn't pick up gaming until about five years ago or a few years ago during covid or something like that I I forget exactly what they what the video that she said in the video they showed uh but I just like
love this and and people just people just come and they and and they they join in this in this fandom and um now I really forget exactly where I was driving to with that but I I think that's a big part of what's driving this and right these AI responses I got there so I haven't slept much these AI responses it feels like they're designed to create like a fake kind of intimacy and smallness of community and almost designed to pray I see where you're going on that craving that people have
for being part of something small and  intimate yeah that sucks that makes a lot of sense that's where I was heading  look as much as you know as a business person you know I look at this fandom concept it's it's something that I think you guys regular viewers of the W show will know that I'm not super into when we create a product I want you to buy it because it's a great product I don't even mind if you buy it if you love the work we do and you want to support our Channel but what I don't
want you to do is to buy it because you're a fan I don't want you to just mindlessly throw your money at us because you're a fan with no capacity for rational thought that's not that's not what I what I ask of you it's not what I want of you and I feel like I feel like an Outsider with that  there's I feel like there's a lot of people that um want to lean into fostering that kind of Paras sociality I don't know if that's a word um but that kind of uh fan like behavior and um and
I don't think it's healthy and I don't think that it is I especially don't think it's healthy when it it's fake like if I actually show up at LTX and I actually like chat with you and take a selfie and you have actually have a really great personal interaction with me or something and you're like yeah I met lonus and he seems like a nice guy at least to the extent that I was able to gauge that from chatting with him for 31 and a half seconds at a trade show right that that clarification kind of
matters but yeah I I do generally agree with where you're going that's fine that's at least sort of that at least has somewhat of the like basis in reality right in your real exp lived experiences whereas if you tell me lonus seems like a cool guy because he trained a he used he created a data set and trained an AI on how to reply to my comment what yeah yeah not great I I don't like it at  I've said your name before maybe maybe they can make this a lot better uh by flagging what things are AI
responses communicating to the user that it was an AI respon brought that up um in my opinion that would help a lot because because honestly if these are just like standard questions you get all the time and you're just like yeah whatever it typed out like a 20w thing at that point they're basically just like fancy canned responses um but even a canned responses feature I think would be useful for some people uh but yeah if they're at least communicating I don't feel like they intend to because I think
they want this to do the things that we've been talking about but if they did if they flagged it if they made it so that it was in your face and obvious for the user that this was you know lonus Ai and not lonus um then that would be good but you know what would be crazy I bet you this thing would start signing  it's trained off his comments right he's he's probably the main commenter on the channel every single one has no no because other ones are are written by other people lus isn't the only person
that has commented but I I still think it would probably do it sometimes because enough of those comments are signed by Ls I'm assuming like at least 30 40% over 90% over 90% okay okay yeah so then it's definitely going to sign with DH LS which if it isn't flagged as an i AI is immediately  um all right shall we keep talking yeah let's see if it gets better from here so far neither or none of these features have really um made me concerned about the future of content on the
platform this next one does um they're adding an inspiration tab with AI brainstorming and idea generation tools with the intention again this is the way they kind of communicated to us with the intention being that it's it's a helper you know it's an assistant um you know you're still expected to to kind of feed it I I asked like you know what are you guys looking at in terms of like data set like is this trained on uh my best videos is it trained on my videos is it trained on videos um from similar
creators that share a of over audience overlap with me is it based on the overall um what what's the word Corpus of content on YouTube like what what what's the data set for this and they they didn't really get too specific about it but um unfortunately I I did I did try to ask some tough questions I don't know why they keep inviting me to these things honestly I uh tend to be a bit of a thorn um I'm a nice Thorn I'm a nice Thorn though nice Thorn um pretty thorn uh demure so the idea is that it's it's a
Helper but the the problem with any AI is the second you start training it on something that was AI generated it starts to it starts to Decay it starts to become a photocopy of a photocopy and and the actual creativity starts to disappear and I guess what my concern is is that on the surface I look at this and I go yeah that could be kind of helpful I have a couple of ideas I spitball them into the inspiration tab it craps out a couple of other you know ideas that are rift off
of yeah maybe some videos that were really successful okay I go and make that do we start doing that enough that the videos that are being uploaded to the platform while not entirely AI generated are at least influenced Enough by AI that we start training our AI on AI inspired ideas and start just like start losing some of that humanness and some of that creativity across the platform to your point earlier I totally get that these are not new tools I could totally just do this in chat GPT right now yeah but
but this is specifically trained off of YouTube exactly in what capacity not sure but it's trained off of YouTube and if it continues to be trained off of YouTube are are we going to be like the snake eating its own tail a little bit here and just consume ourselves consume everything that's that's good about it that's  it yeah that kind of says it all doesn't it I I feel like basically everything I said about the vo 6sec Clips just yeah again it applies to here um I'm not
surprised that they're doing it this also feels to me like it's trying to compete with Mr Beast new tool um Mr Beast H what would you even call it how would I find this Mr Beast YouTube and I forget surprisingly surprisingly we actually don't really subscribe to a ton of like Creator tools yeah view stats Pro um is a is a Mr Beast tool um I think this is the one is this the right one I'm pretty sure I whatever some Mr Beast tool I'm not 100% sure but I think this is it um
is it it does things like what you're talking about it tries to show like if you're like oh thumb thumbnail with a golden controller um I I I believe it can do things like try to find that for you I I haven't used this in a while I looked at it at one point in time so I hope I'm not saying stuff that's wrong um get to no Pro yeah organize and brainstorm your next upload uh make better decisions with different with more data blah blah blah blah blah I think they're trying to bring these
tools onto YouTube natively uh track long and short outlier videos in each category that one's actually pretty interesting um search thumbnails by URL and image so you can if I remember correctly with that tool you can search for like thumbnails basically by giving topics and then it'll try to find you thumbnails for inspiration so you can like fall in line with a type of theme that's happening on the platform which again just contributes to more seism um which I don't know again the tools already exist
they're just trying to bring more eyeballs directly onto YouTube and have them leave less I think in non-ai features YouTube has also added communities which are similar to Creator control Discord servers or subreddits where both the Creator and their subscribers can post text links and images this one believe it or not I actually like um there's a lot of friction moving people off platform to be clear I don't see this as a substitute for off-platform engagement I think that off-platform engagement is
important but you know how we have both float plane uh where we have like "37,000 paying subscribers right now so" we've got our float plane platform but we also turned on YouTube memberships which has like I think another 500 or something like that members there's certain people did we hit 38 we're not quite but "we're 37,9 31 I know that's why I said" "37,000 I didn't want to I didn't want to" I didn't want to exaggerate you can Round Up by by 69 I think 69 is an acceptable round number to round up on
I'll tell you what Luke I'll tell you what why don't you screen share some of the great exclusives we have on float plan right now go ahead do it real quick let's try to add the 69 wow let's get it let's get it done and then "I can say we have 38,000 subscribers on" play okay wow so you you go ahead get get get some get some uh get some cool exclusives people might want to check out up there and in the meantime I I will keep talking um so we have about 500 members on YouTube as well I'm not
going to say no to people who are willing they they pay they pay extra the last time I looked at it they pay extra we're transparent about that because YouTube takes a very significant cut there that does not go toward the salaries of our developers who develop flow plane um but they just don't want to leave the platform and a lot of people are like that they they just are not interested in engaging off of the YouTube platform and I think that there should be features that allow us to be
there for them um and engage with them like I I like Community posts um there's actually a Fair bit of pretty solid engagement there um solid interaction I just wish that it was uh I wish that community members could interact with each other more easily they've they've significantly tamped down on the number of like sexbot comments and stuff like that it's not perfect there there's still oh it still happens but dude you compare it to what it was like a year ago arms race yeah it
it'll always happen to a certain degree I think um they've improved a lot can do give credit where it's due and I think you and I have talked a lot over the years about how underinvested YouTube comments and Community is so is this exactly the right way for them to do it I don't know maybe maybe not but is it something I think my biggest problem with this is a complete non-confidence that I have with Google these days um to the point where there's like serious conversations about ripping out
um workplace solutions that we have at at the company from Google right now because there's a big question on like what of this is even going to exist in a year uh because they keep rug pulling every single thing that they have uh and then extremely core features that other platforms and other companies are providing these days YouTube is or sorry Google is not providing so they're not expanding in the way that other companies are and they're just killing products that people actually do really
like constantly so if they're going to create this communities feature and creators are going to invest into because it is an investment if creators are going to invest into making these communities vibrant and trying to encourage people to come over here very likely cannibalizing their own already created Discord communities um that have been uh you know cultivated and grown over the years have moderators built into it have likely tools made for moderation all this other type of stuff
that they've custom built for that or custom tuned for that and then YouTube rug PS this new community feature it will be incredibly frustrating for genuinely everyone involved and at this point in time I have no trust in Google that they will actually keep this around because they've proven that that would be misplaced trust um so there it would be unwise for me to do so I think it's also as much as I do like things like Community posts um this feels like it's creating yet another thing that has to
have moderation from it um from your team or from your community this creates  this problem where so many YouTubers are doing weird creepy things with kids and now this is another thing that parents are going to have to be aware of in regards to ways that there could be bad communication um because I think it I mean it took years for parents to be properly aware of Discord um which like even it's barely seem to be now barely okay yeah I don't know in our parent teacher conferences this year the
teachers brought up Discord for the first time okay yeah so give some idea of how long it takes for things to make it to the mainstream something like this is going to take forever um so there's like H I want to like it if this was honestly like eight years ago I think I would have been super stoked um but now especially in light with everything else that's coming out I'm just a little sketched out let me  it's G to be hard but I'm going to try um I believe in you Google you're right
kills a lot of stuff they kill a lot of good stuff they kill a lot of beloved stuff um they create a bunch of kind of half-baked stuff and then they kill that and that's probably for the best the YouTube team do they really create and kill that much compared to compared to Google could we could we have a bit more trust in the YouTube Team specifically and I I'm just I'm just asking questions uh do you want to jump on that or you so they they did actually they killed paid channels um they did bring I think I
think it's called is memberships now YouTube memberships they they brought that back but it wasn't right away so they got creators into the paid Channel cycle and then dropped all of them while they were developing the new ones they they didn't develop the new one and then convert everybody over they just dropped everyone for at least a couple years I think it was to the point where again so this is this is actually a community building thing right they had creators build communities on these paid private
channels um or whatever exactly it was called or however it worked it's we we didn't use it and it's been a long time um but they they had us included right like we might have actually used that at that time if it existed and was good um but it it didn't um so they they got creators like uh awesome sauce bitwit Kyle um creators like that bought into this ecosystem brought their users in got people to subscribe built these communities were were talking more active all that type of stuff in that
Community trying to incentivize uh people to actually enjoy their time there right um and then all of those creators just got completely dropped and now they have to bring all of their audience again to some other type of platform all of their all of their committing a Pat patreon or or whatever else um and then they incre they start YouTube membership and now it's like oh my God so do I bring everyone back or do I split and do both or what so like the they have done that before I will say
however that I do generally agree that the YouTube Team doesn't seem as rug pulley as Google as a whole uh most of the things that YouTube has introduced there's there's some some semblance of it still around I think you know what came up in one of my breakouts at the summit it's one of my favorite features that they killed I never got into uh stories on like Snapchat or any other platform because I don't use those platforms I actually really liked them on YouTube and they never really fully
implemented the feature it literally never worked on my folding phone um even though that's Android you know and like kind of a Google product and stuff and then they just like quietly got rid of it when they introduced shorts and I uh and it came up in one of the that people loved stories and were like hey can you guys bring it back and YouTube's YouTube's argument for why they got rid of it and didn't bring it back we conveniently had the person who spearheaded stories right there in our
breakout these these Summits are really amazing because we really do get access to top level people at YouTube and get to have these conversations um the reason was apparently even though creators really liked it user engagement with it was super low and so I don't know maybe you guys you guys can tell me um you know did you do you miss stories at all like or do you just not care and and I maybe just um kind of out of touch and like feeling like you guys were engaging with
it um I we didn't really post that many because my daily driver phone didn't support it but uh yeah never used them nope didn't care at all yeah so didn't care didn't use so there you go I don't remember it we got like one person who missed them and cared that's about it they're apparently kind of hard to use I mean it was a half-baked implementation so that's probably part of the problem yeah but other than people have brought up dislikes I I don't really see that as taking away a feature so much as as
changing the functionality of the site so I'm not sure I fully agree with that one they definitely did get rid of annotations I think feature uh the ability to view dislikes on a video yeah I think so well I think I think that you could say the ability to gauge sentiment on a video they've made it worse but they didn't take it away you can see they took away your ability to to yeah that doesn't mean anything when there's no dislikes Luke I'm not a fan of the change I'm just
saying I don't think it's the removal of a feature so much as it is the changing of the functionality of a feature to make it worse which is not a good thing I just don't think it's quite the same thing that's all I'm saying they removed stories if it ex if if it was an overall Karma counter I think I would agree with you but because you could separately see like and dislike I think dislike is its own feature at that point like and dislike are separate features if it was a combined total and they took
away your ability to see the combined total or something that's that's modifying it but uh yeah I don't know I I think if it's dislike and with its own counter they removing a feature which is dislike um agree to disagree all right fair enough there you go um YouTube is also testing a new hype feature which they actually didn't talk about really at the um at the summit where viewers can choose to promote a recent video posted within the last 7 days from a creator with fewer than
"500,000 subscribers highly promoted" videos will appear in a special leaderboard and will be marked as fan favorites viewers can hype up to three videos a week for free or pay for more pay for man so this is back to I guess actually I I actually wasn't aware of this one I didn't carefully go through the made on you um thing after we were like in person showing a lot of it so I I didn't know about this one uh this just feels like monetizing superate communities again yeah and and small creators cuz cuz what
you're if if you really want to make it you're not going to pay for your own channel to get hyped oh about it that way yeah no immediately that's that's what this is for sure there are also you're also going to have super fans that that do that for sure I think they're mostly going to use their free ones and then you're GNA have some hyper super fans that will actually use the paid version and then I guarantee you small creators that are really hellbent on making it as a Creator whether this feature really
works or not are going to invest money into hyping their own content um with their own actual account or if it shows whose account did it they'll just make fake ones and do it that way ready for a little bit more uh Devil's Advocate sure wonky donkey in float plane chat asks is this feature because there are so many massive incumbents that no one can rise up is this potentially a clumsy um flawed tool that could benefit somebody I think if that was true YouTube could just do it organically
which I think YouTube does extremely successfully um I think YouTube is one of if not the best platforms on the internet for organic growth of a Creator um I think something like twitch you know is going to naturally based on how twitch Works be a lot worse at that uh but I see I see new creators on YouTube uh you know if I if I was on it every day I'd probably see new creators on YouTube every day I think that's fair I was I was Devil's advocating I was Devil's advocating advocating advocating
extremely strong discoverability mechanics already like it's it's honestly really really good almost to the point where it if anything it's like pulling down its most successful creators because it's kind of so obsessed with showing you new stuff all the time um all right let's get through the rest of the YouTube stuff and talk about some more let's let's let's move on but there's a couple more things um YouTube has confirmed they are rolling out pause screen ads more widely so I'm
sure I know how you guys feel about that um who cares yeah cool YouTube is also expanding its creator takeover program where advertisers can pay a premium to take over all the ads on a particular channel for some period of time uh just so you guys know we were sent an email from YouTube inviting us to join this program and we have confirmed with them that we do have the ability to opt out of takeovers that are from advertisers that we have a strong objection to cool so we actually recently um reconfirmed
uh because they brought it up with us again um that we have continued to be opted out of any gambling and alcohol related ads so you guys will not see those on our Channel if everything is running correctly and we will apply our typical um our typical sponsor um restrictions guidelines our typical sponsor guidelines uh to these takeovers as well the only exception you might see is if we miss an email or something like that like it it will it if something bad happens it will be it will be an
accident um that's not me priming you guys for that we're going to accident on purpose I'm just saying we are not perfect as you guys well know we are very human and accidents do happen um so that would be that would be why that would happen uh we actually have we have published our our sponsor like our our sponsor guidelines uh Luke do you have any idea where that is it's on the Forum somewhere isn't it uh it is it is on the Forum somewhere  where yeah I don't I don't see it right
now and I yeah sorry if someone if someone has the link post it in the float plane chat uh but it's somewhere on the Forum where we outline all of the things that uh we are we are not okay with at this present time all  lmg spons do not work with list discussions yeah there we go there it is uh we don't do drugs and alcohol we do not believe this is responsible for us to promote at this time we I love that at this time you know we leave the door open but not at this time uh crypto nfts
icos um this is not a field we want to get mixed up in at this time uh credit loans um we want to avoid promoting these things directly we've worked with banks and Financial in stions in the past that offer these services but we want to avoid promoting them directly uh Drop Shipping as a service um after our initial fact finding we worked with one of these companies last year but based on community feedback we do not plan to again gaming chairs that do not prioritize ergonomics um mental health
therapy we are pro therapy we advise anyone reading this to prioritize their mental health uh but we do not intend to promote any companies who profit from these services at this time online sports betting um gambl more broadly we do not believe this is responsible for us to promote at this time pay to win games so our bar for games is that we do actually have someone internally play the game if it can be enjoyed without the need to syn money into it we know this is a fine line but we're okay with
it um if it is absolutely not enjoyable without uh paying money then we do not um feel it is appropriate to promote at this time and finally unproven Kickstarter indogo campaign we will work with companies that have a long history of launching products um and that basically just use these platforms as a marketing vehicle but just complete nobody's we just don't want people to get burned and we've accidentally promoted things that we were uh really unhappy that we ultimately put
mostly back in like kickstarters Heyday yeah yeah y so that's our that's our guidelines and speaking of sponsors why don't we tell you about our sponsors for the show today I'm sorry I know we only did one topic but it was a boy was it ever a meaty one I didn't realize how long we've been talking uh I have a play to be at in an hour it's almost three she was a the whole show she was a talking about this for an hour and a half well the problem is I'm not there in person to see Dan's piece of paper no

insignificant amount of people watching right now that were born after the release of that movie by the way I think some of them might work here yeah okay okay I'm going to explain the joke I'm going to explain the joke okay so in the movie Anchor Man which is like one of those kind of funny movies from the early to mid 2000s um the character is sort of a a blowhard anchor man played by Will frell who was much younger then um sorry this is horrible uh basically he just reads anything on the prompter
so at some point to mess with him for some reason or another somebody puts go f yourself San Diego on the prompter and he just reads it so it's a quote it's a reference okay just anyway oh my God Sammy our social like float plane guy says oh he was a meme back in the early 2010 Tammy he's not a meme he's an actor speaking of Sammy though see speaking of Sammy though Luke you never highlighted uh you never highlighted any like uh specials or exclusives or anything that should compel people to subscribe we've

cute it is as cute Asing back to oh you can see it there never mind cute all right uh I guess we should probably do another topic like I don't even know if we're going to get to merch messages but like we have a really good deal have to many so yeah go for it okay well we've got a really good deal to announce um it is 50% off our remaining water bottle and spout lid inventory so uh the link here is to the 40 oz bottle but I think this applies to every bottle on the site while supplies last water
bottles featuring the old spout lid as well as individual purchases of the old spout lid which many of you have noticed is compatible with many other water bottles are 50% off due to the discount these productss are considered final sale they are not eligible for return but this is a really good deal you guys are going to want to check it out the reason we're clearing them out is we finally have inventory of our new in-house design spout lid and Luke is not a huge fan I'm going to talk you
through why I think it's great and then Luke can talk you through what he thinks about it and you can decide for yourself if you want to stock up on old water bottles and spout Lids at the discount or if you want to wait for the new one so uh luk do you have the lid there yes it features easier cleaning so there's two O-rings there's the one between the lid and the water bottle and then there's the one between the spout top and the lid both of those have pull tabs on them now which make them much easier
to take out for cleaning the threading for the spout top is on the outside now rather than the inside we know that some people are not going to like the feel of the spout top thread against their lips we went back and forth on this over and over and over and over again and what it kept coming down to is that our major concerns with the old SP top lid were two one was that the clip would break pretty easily um too easily for us not that easily like to be clear if you buy
one it's probably going to last okay as long as you don't drop it but they did break too easily and the new one is much much harder to break and then the other concern we had is that it's not the easiest to clean and when it came down to what our design goals were for this product easy cleaning was a major one and we decided to keep the threads on the outside so that it's much much easier to clean the hinge has been reinforced to prevent it oh wait I already said that it is not yet released but it will be
included on the new restock of water bottles um Luke has some concerns yeah I think the the inre the increased um you know cleanliness features are genuinely super cool and probably make the whole thing worth it regardless um concerns Luke there are some downsides that come with it like one thing that I noticed is very commonly with the old lid you could do this um if you notice I didn't really do much to it and it immediately went down to this I'm trying to show but there's
it's black on a dark background um it went on this downward angle with the new lid if you if you whip it open even with a bunch of force it just stays there which makes it so that with that much force it actually held position but when you go to drink it it hits you in the face um so you actually have to like kind of click it down um that results in some wear that I suspect the support team will get messages about on the little nubbins that hold it in place but I've been
informed that those are designed to do that uh so they're fine I just I think the support team is going to get some messages cuz they wear quite quickly um or they first bit of wear yeah the first bit of wear looks like a lot and then and then it doesn't do much more I'm assuming and then it doesn't do much more yeah that that is something that I'm actually not very concerned about yeah sure and worst case scenario hey we got you bro so yeah exactly and then the the last one is the the threads on the
outside again genuinely a really big bump for cleanliness and makes it worth it but on the old one it's incredibly easy to close I I use our water bottles literally every single day extensively I drink at least 64 ounces of water out of our water bottles every single day usually more than that so I'm using Enthusiast constantly Luke has made Gins of pee with our water bottle oh yeah all of them um so I have I have feelings about this okay that's all um the old ones opening and closing you you you can just
do that 100% accurate every single time you I I know now that this is closed um with the new ones that is not the case because the threads on the outside are less reliable um so like did that work no um and I can tell because the whole lid kind of rocks back and forth but if you just like grab it and turn it it will work like it's fine it's not that it doesn't close it's just that like this old maneuver that I used to do to like flick it off and flick it back on instantly every single time no longer
works with 100% reliability so if you're coming from the old lid just don't trust a a random spin because yeah again it didn't it didn't actually happen but if you just twist it closed um it does go and will hold so I don't know just something to be aware of there's a few questions Matt man asks um would you sell the O-rings with the tabs separately I would buy them but I don't like the outside threads uh they are not compatible with the old Lids unfortunately again to improve the
sanitation sanitar uh to improve the ease of cleaning uh we did redesign the lid even though it cosmetically looks an awful lot like the old one similar yeah it's not the same y um the new what do you mean I'm not happy with Luke's complaints Luke brought these up before the show and I was like you should talk about them like where we believe in transparency I don't know how many times I have to prove that do you need me to cut open a lid is it I'll go to 105 L lid L I'll go
to 105 oh we got a band saw I'll do it I haven't broken something in a while I like I said I use these every day I know I know some people say that uh they've broken a bunch of the hinge arm things I've never broken one of them I don't necessarily know what's causing that to happen I throw them around all the time oh maybe I just don't drop them that makes sense and not all of them are weak it's like it's a it's a it's a plastic flow issue it's not obvious looking at it why it would be weak but sometimes
the way the plastic it's so ours isn't actually that much like bigger but the way the plastic flows and cools um it will be it will be much stronger it looks a yeah you can you can tell it's bigger but it's not it's more to a water bottle there's so much more to a water bottle lid than I think most people would probably think about this one was very thoughtful I promise you that yeah um I I would I would The more I've thought about it I should probably get these even though I I don't love the
threads on the outside um just because it's going to be cleaner I clean mine all the time but still this is very simple to clean which makes me believe that it's going to become more clean uh because some topics Luke oh okay yeah sorry all right as much as I'd love to keep talking about our merch we got to do some topics uh Linux Gamers can no longer play GTA 5 Rockstar has updated GTA 5 with battle eyee anti-che breaking Linux compatibility and rendering steam deck players unable to play the games
online multiplayer notably GT 5 was one of the top 10 most popular games played on the platform last week and has been in the top 20 for the past two years it is not entirely clear why Rockstar did this the company has blamed valve for the issue and directed all questions to them however according to a 2021 comment from valve battle eye is fully compatible with their proton compatibility layer and developers simply have to email battleye to enable it in fact there are already many games
using battle eye that are supported by proton nice as a potential Silver Lining to the recent Cloud strike sorry Crow strike you mean is this a is this a typo uh Cloud strike yeah it's a typo okay I was like what's Cloud strike um Microsoft appears to be preparing to push security software outside of the windows kernel which would likely possibly include anti-che yeah May in turn allow for more games to work on Linux yeah oh is that the good news that you were referring to before yes yeah
that's pretty cool that's actually enormous like I don't know I I know a very significant amount of people that only don't want to switch to Linux at this point because of multiplayer games that they wouldn't be able to play because of anti-che um this is so cool this is this is actually massive it's it's in my opinion maybe cuz I don't play GTA that's probably accurate uh a bigger story than the GTA 5 thing if it actually happens if they pull anti-che out of the kernel and then we're able to get
more of the games that were previously kind of locked to Windows onto Linux that will be enormous um yeah regarding um your game that doesn't work anymore in at least one case it seems a player was able to get a refund for GTA 5 on Steam but another person on Reddit apparently had the request rejected uh a message from Steam support seems to suggest that valve is working with Rockstar to fix the issue uh we do need to get through a few more topics here just because I have a play to go to
hey hey V what are we seeing again we're seeing the Great Gatsby I'm very excited um Nintendo has finally sued calor but in a kind of surprising way um Nintendo and the Pokemon company of which Nintendo is part owner announced they have filed a lawsuit in Tokyo district court against pocket pair the developer of the Indie Smash Hit pal World while Pokemon fans have expected this to happen for some time like basically from the moment that game came out the nature of the lawsuit is not at
all what anyone expected when pal world came out Twitter threads like the one Luke is about to show you guys purported to show Pals from pal World whose designs plagiarized the designs of Pokémon essentially accusing pocket parir of copyright infringement so many people made complaints uh to the Pokemon so many people made complaints to the Pokemon company that they released a statement saying they didn't Grant permission of Pokemon IP or assets but Nintendo isn't suing over copyri right
so like Art and Design at least not yet they are suing over the infringement of multiple patents meaning that they're arguing that palor a survival crafting third person shooter with indentured servitude as a core feature is  Pokemon okay the patents that Nintendo fields are being infringed have not been revealed but one good guess is a patent found by PC Gamer it broadly covers a game system that allows switching between two modes where the first mode is aiming and throwing an item that
imparts an effect on a character in an Overworld and the second mode is aiming and throwing a fighting character in an Overworld to perform an action such as fighting another character to be clear this patent does not cover a game program that allows a player character to catch a character only during a fight what okay okay hold on hold on an example of what Falls within this patent is contained in Pokemon Legends archus the first mode would be how players can throw items at Wild po outside of combat
the second mode would be how you can throw a Pokeball containing a tamed Pokemon at a wild Pokemon to initiate a fight or at something like a tree to collect  that a lot of gaming patents are really stupid the directional Arrow from Like Crazy tacki Taxi who they sue Simpsons Hit and Run the pointy directional Arrow uh mini games and loading screens that's what there's like hundreds of these EX  crazy dude yeah that's trash and I don't like it yep are you here good news the good
news here okay is pocket pair made enough bucket loads of money and must have known that this was coming that they will maybe be able to defend themselves maybe we'll see uh Japanese Court not American court for people that are trying to be loal right now oo Japanese Court that's going to be rough yeah um not that I'm saying it will be biased I'm just saying this is clearly Nintendo's home turf where they are going to have more experience also a bunch of people are pointing out
that apparently the Microsoft moving antivirus out of the kernel thing won't stop uh anti-che maybe something maybe I don't know I haven't read super deeply into it was just hoping that would be the case and I know some other people were echoing that as well um so we'll see what happens um I wonder if the excitement from everyone of that happening might incentivize anti-che companies to look at Linux a little bit more even even that I don't know just pocket pair is also hold on sorry pocket
pair also Japanese but what I suspect is they have far less experience navigating the court system there Nintendo does yeah when I say home turf sorry my intention was not to say Japan my intention was to say specifically Japanese Court yeah yeah yeah oh boy well good luck pocket pair um how much time do you have uh Hey Von how long's the walk how long's the walk I'm finding out uh oh quick clarification from our degoogle your life part two video uh we discussed next cloud and we said next cloud is more
home user whereas own cloud is more Enterprise uh we had a chat with nexcloud about this and they said hey that's kind of outdated information and they actually according to them have significantly larger customers than owncloud with some installations in the many millions um so I just wanted to clarify that cool uh okay I need to go fairly soon should we smash some merch messages before you go and then save these topics for next week because we haven't done any merch messages uh sure let me just
see if there's anything extremely important yeah Asus refused to repair a service center damaged laptop by Reddit user Matrix who works as aior effects technical director recently alleged that an authorized as service center that he asked to repair his "$12,000 Pro art laptop instead seriously" damaged the device damages included a screen that was cracked from corner to corner as well as having at least one corner shattered this kind of sounds like shipping damage but hold on let's
keep going the internal frame was allegedly deformed and the display surface peeled off at the edges according to animatrix the service center initially denied responsibility then confirmed that the staff had damaged the laptop after anim Matrix called their head office animatrix claims that Asus refused to replace the laptop with an equivalent because it is out of warranty despite the fact that this would be a matter of liability not warranty it nonetheless took over two
months to get Asus to repair most of the damage animatrix further says that the original problem with the laptop which the authorized service center incorrectly said would require the motherboard to be replaced was later fixed by a smaller service center without replacing the motherboard the laptop was originally provided by Asus to animatrix in exchange for promoting their proart line using their work in feature film visual effects that last bit complicates this a lot when   why does that change
things well I don't think that changes things at all to be honest this was an outof warranty repair that he did at an authorized service center that they broke his computer at so it's it's a it's I don't think it really has anything to do with how he got it included internet frame they confirmed if I took my car which is hold on it was it did they know it was out of warranty I'm just checking yeah no this is out of Warrant okay no you're right you're right then it nothing do with how we got it yeah yeah
okay cuz if it was a sample and this was a warranty conversation then that gets a little bit hairier because there can be an understanding that like yeah well you know here it is but like whatever it is what it is if this is if this is a service center and an outof warranty situation if they damaged it man they they've just got to figure out what their escalation workflow needs to be because i' I've talked about this at the very highest level the willingness to make these things right is there they
just have such a a broken broken process that like now I'm the one who has to raise this the media is the one who has to talk about this instead of just getting the customer message through to the people who can make this decision and make it right yeah cuz like if you read the Reddit threat honestly this this Skips a lot of steps um if you read the Reddit thread if I remember correctly at one point in time they tried to offer him like "uh some like this is $112,000 laptop"
right this is a professional laptop probably with like a Quadro card in it stuff like that like there's this is not a normal laptop um if if I remember correctly they tried to offer him some like 8 gig whatever random standard Normie laptop um in response to it which he was fairly obviously like no which is why it took so long to actually get solved this is really frustrating they they just need to get it together they need to have like a global escalation line they need to staff it with people
who are empowered to make these decisions and they just need to deal with this like I'm so I'm so tired of seeing this they've got to be tired of seeing this you know yeah um the last thing we said we would talk about is the ryzen 9000 launch um according to uh mind Factory a large German e retailer specializing in electronics um they have publicly available sales numbers that show they've only sold a couple hundred units "of 9,000 Series chips since their La" since their launch however this doesn't
reflect how well AMD is doing in the pre-built Market which seems to be significantly larger that's uh wow that's a bummer I guess it turns out that  I guess it turns out that when you've got x3d anything other than x3d is going to kind of not matter um all right why don't we do a couple merch messages uh watch we can explain how they work real quick uh the way to interact with the show which I guess is I mean are Luke and Dan are you guys going to stick around a little while
longer you're not obligated to but like prob try get through the merch messes I sent you a message on teams L but yeah we we can we stay for a bit but yeah I I think just to speak on the ryzen topic for a quick second I totally agree everyone's waiting for x3d I think that's what basically every reviewer told people to do I think the the the coolness of 99000 Series in in the areas that it does matter is extremely minor and no one really cares and the the sales that have gone to it have probably
been non gamer just people building a new computer and it's just the thing that happens to be out and that's it I think that's all the sales dude if I if I was doing like the the trunk computer for my like car gaming setup again I'd "probably put 9,000 Series in it sure" just cuz like extra well you know right right it's niche but like the extra heat really matters there yeah but again x3d chips are so efficient too I I would just be waiting for the next x3d series 9000 x3d is going to
be oh I hate making predictions these days I think 9000 x3d is going to be really good though I'm I'm actually kind of stoked I hope I I hope I get to be right because like I I just want cooltech to talk about that if I'm biased by anything it's that I'm biased to like have something cool to talk about and like play with um all right merch messages all you got to do is throw something in your card on LTD store.com send us a merch message we don't really do super chats or quick
twitch bits oh that close or twitch bits or or any of that stuff it's better if you're going to throw many at your screen that you're going to get some highquality merchandise in the one of our 50% off water bottles that we're running for the next little bit while we clear out the ones with the old lid design um you can also um back order a Precision screwdriver um and Dan if you want to show people how merch messages work they go into the queue to be responded to later Dan will reply to them now or he
will throw them to the show for to respond to in real time Dan hit me sure I got a bit of a juicy one here we're not going to do too many hey lld any thoughts on the threemile island nuclear plant coming back online with an exclusive delivery deal with Microsoft dystopian or green power for power hungry AI That's face I made I got it I actually I actually hadn't heard about this and I was so on board because nuclear power has this like bad rap that just needs to stop um like it's not perfect nothing is
perfect but good Lord compared to just like burning fraking coal like it's the Industrial Revolution like are you kidding me Bas we at war or not I was like this sounds I was like this sounds fair enough I was like this sounds great um until you said the last part and then I thought back to that Hydro power plant in BC that apparently is dedicated to  really like really yeah yeah yeah yeah I don't know I hadn't heard about this uh I don't know really it's better than burning
coal unless there's an act of War yeah yeah but like this isn't replacing any of the dirty power that like we're producing for things people actually need this is just oh yeah yep well wait is this for is this for Microsoft yeah so I mean they were going to do something so it's either build a coal plant or do this because there there's there's all these projections right now of the power generation that the states is going to have and how it's going to change over the next coming
years and how it's going to massively outpace um previous Productions and y y y so this power increase is going to come from somewhere um so I understand what you're saying where like we're not we're not replacing like heating people's water with coal um but they were going to make it somehow um all right so it's either more coal plants new ones or this or something else I don't know right there's there's all different options how about we oh okay well okay you know what fine if this is
a if this is a thawing of The Frigid enthusiasm that there's been around nuclear power for a while then then I then I'm happy there yeah okay Dan hit me sure oh geez let's see lonus I thanked my wife for make uh for doing my laundry as you said any news about the moist pocket thank you for solving my problems greeting from Belgium and my wife I forget what the moist pocket even is I think it was in a pair of pants you designed like an internal pocket the I dude I say random stuff all
time I do remember this there was like a a zippered internal pocket a pair of sweatpants or something like that water resist moist pocket oh it was like s just like cuz if you just have like a sweaty ass then I guess like your stuff won't get wet um it might be a typo they are from Belgian and there's Samar yeah I I think I was eting guys I don't think we're going to have a moist pocket any pocket can be a moist pocket yeah I mean nothing's impossible but not today not
today I am oh I am wearing the new cargo pants though if you if you do have one see me right now don't call it that um yeah yeah there cargo pants all totally normal Pockets yeah lots of them though lots of moist Pockets lonus how are you doing for timing you have five minutes over now I believe you still okay uh I need to go in like 5 minutes okay can do uh question for lus with your tyan what's your opinion on Porsche's new EVS updated tyan Manan EV 718 EV will you buy a new Porsche EV in
the future why or why not it's funny my nickname for my car is the taant because it like has issues with it sometimes um it's been recalled like four times or something like that overall though I love driving my car uh like Luke has heard me talk about it a fair bit like outside of wow uh that is a that is a happy purchase the acceleration is you know not the most important thing for killing it at the track and whatever but I I um I like driving around in something that literally accelerates the way the
incred coaster does at California Adventure Park um my kids love it they're always like do launch control do launch control you know like it's I I enjoy it I like my car um I do want to test drive the Maan just because I'm like kind of curious I uh I have no interest in the 718 I don't even I don't even really understand Porsche's lineup like it it doesn't really makes sense to me like the whole 911 91 something like I I don't understand like the different generation nomenclature I'm not really a
car guy I just I just like my car um but yeah I want to test drive the Maan I'm curious about it uh the new tyan the main benefit that would affect me because it's all like oh it has better driving Dynamics I'm like sure yeah I'm I'm not going to take this thing to the track so the main benefit to me would be the better range but the range doesn't bother me on mine I don't road trip in it who would road trip well okay someone might it's actually very very daily drivable um but I don't I don't road
trip so it doesn't bother me there that's all I have to say about that okay sort of two more for you he L's excited to get my hoodie but I noticed I can only buy mystery color anyways I was wondering if you had any advice what would you give to a high schooler in grade nine thank you for all you do n take every course you can for free because Education costs a fraking ton of money the second you graduate from high school yeah but not just academics I took like metal art and jewelry and it
was like hugely you never know when something is going to come in handy like we my my wife and I did a did a like a make your own earrings class on a weekend and we made her a pair of earrings that's like you know special and Handmade by us we each made one and they kind of match but kind of don't so they're you know very handcrafted like that and taking metal art and jewelry was really useful for me being more decent at it you like I don't know you never know just like broaden your
horizons keep your horizons Broad do all of it hey have you considered doing a follow-up on EXT extreme Tech upgrades to see what people regretted or would have done differently thanks we have thought about that as a float plane exclusive um but we should definitely note it Dan if you don't mind forwarding that to as a reminder to Sammy um it'd be great to to get that series rolling speaking of float plane "exclusives Luke we have 37,000" subscribers on Flo plane nice we did not
make it oh we didn't make it never mind "37,9 68 sorry brother oh when we get one" more it'll be cool that's a sub goal that's a sub goal that I like a lot if we get one more I'm happy sorry we got we got about half of the way there all right cly goal um no it's not did did you say oh yeah I'm going to forward that to Sammy that's all I've really got for you lonus I do have one message here that I got privately um apparently it's map's wedding day today yes oh wow yeah yeah congrats M uh long time
long time um member of our community especially over on the Forum uh congratulations I really hope you aren't  now I've got a so we'll see you in the  buddy congratulations we apparently got one more by the way on float plane Luke oh ni we are at 37 969 so something thank that's something for you thank you whoever did that I appreciate it thank you uh the rest of these are probably good for Luke if you want to uh leave us alone get out of here I'm going to a play I'll see you guys in person
next Friday right okay have fun enjoy it okay um okay and I'm just going to do this in advance I'll see you again next time uh next week same bad time same bad Channel and then Luke you can just have a super delayed uh that thing you do don't say bye cuz I'm contract obligated to immediately end the outro if you do that yeah don't do it Luke don't do it do it don't I know not even a j stop it stop it you can't do it I know it's a reflex oh okay keep everyone on seat all right let's do it we're not going to
we're not going to do this forever but I got a couple more we yeah we'll fire through the rest of the merch messages and then probably get out of here I don't think we're going to do any topics we'll just move those to next week there's some really good topics there's some really juicy ones yeah um so we'll we'll talk about that next week but yeah we'll we'll get the rest of the merch messages and then and I can actually send Sammy a message and he's still at work it's not 10 p.m. yeah followups FP
exclusives okay uh let's see hi Luke who have you recommended cyber security con uh who are your recommended cyber security content creators I haven't found many that aren't purely educational besides darket Diaries purely educational uh like I I think he wants like LTT but cyber security we broke into a bank and stole on their money uh I I think my my the there's a bunch that I I watch kind of on and off I'm not very good at remembering names so that this isn't going to be awesome for that uh but
low-l learning and John Hammond are ones that I frequently go back to I got to remember I'm looking over here now right yeah there yeah there we go uh lowle learning and John Hammond are are ones that I will I will frequently go back to um there's other people that you know talk about it like even even Thor or um pirate software will will talk about cyber security stuff sometimes um there are a bunch of other cyber security creators that I watch outside of those two as well but
um yeah I don't know yeah I'll go with that yeah without like bringing up my YouTube and finding them uh those are the ones that I'm remembering off top of my head  so that are now LTT Stables uh I don't know how many still are um kick farted was uh a thing of mine which kind of died alongside Kickstarter um it's not not as popular anymore so that oh Dan was muted Dan say it again do it again gosh darn it hey LDL gavon from the Netherlands Luke in a previous W show you'd mentioned that scrapyard Wars was
rally pitched by you did you pitch any other Concepts that are now ldt Staples yeah quite a few of them have died off is essentially what I'm saying so we had Tech showed down um which I thought was amazing I thought the content was fantastic um but people didn't really watch it so we had Tech Showdown one which was candy battle um we had candy battle part two which got even less views candy battle went all the way to part four that might be part of the reason why cuz that was a one-day shoot
that we moved into four videos and all the thumbnails were literally identical except for the part number changing that might have impacted it to a certain degree Tech Showdown the pixel PC thing was fantastic but they in general just um didn't get a ton of views um Tech shown and scrapyard wars were the two that were like very much me most the rest of them were collaborative think tanks if that makes sense um like even Tech quickie um I had something to do with the original
ideation of that that because I remember I remember going to Best Buy and taking pictures of all the labels trying to get inspiration for for some of the really early episodes um I don't know yeah a lot of a lot of the the things that have been on the channel for a really long time recurring themes um I might have been a part of ones that I know I wasn't was like the ultimate Tech upgrades the Intel or AMD ones I had nothing to do with any of that uh um I don't know secret shopper I had
nothing to do with yeah a lot a lot of the old school stuff um I would have at least been a part of pitching it um I don't know that's a long rambly answer but yeah Tech Showdown and scrap red wars were the main ones that were just like only really me at the beginning like when it was pitched for the first one and then from there it it usually moved on to other people like the most recent scrap Wars I I didn't do anything to plan it literally at all I didn't even know what the theme was I didn't
know anything going into it um that was all other people so they've they've kind of passed on from my hands now but yeah hey D I am uh working cyber security professional for a similar sized company as yours how do you manage people's expectations when going through the transition of being ad hoc startup to corporate Luke just implodes yeah um [Laughter] Li isn't here you you're you're okay it's a it's a problem for a bunch of reasons it's a problem internally and it's a problem externally um I don't
know how many companies have as much light on them externally as we do um but um cough cough let's look at the lab for a second um people seemed to assume that you know almost in instantaneously upon the lab existing our our testing was going to be at um some new level just overnight um and I I think that created a lot of pressures which those pressures were a little bit antithetical to some of the ideas of of how the lab should have worked which created the cyclical problem where they
just anyways uh that created a bunch of issues both internally and externally um I think I I love the like when when like the YouTube channel gets hacked back in the day uh and people are like what channel that got hacked as if as if that has anything to do like as if we're cyber Security Professionals for one and then for two as if everyone in the company is like what are you talking we set a fire a computer on fire the other week to like make it cool down we don't do cyber security yeah there's there's a
lot a lot of like really weird expectations come from people that have often no idea what they're talking about um I had them before I started here I was super intimidated that everybody here was going to be a computer expert and you have me coming in doing tech support and it's like hi my computer's broken and I'm like oh God here we go like over the monitor was turned off they're just all like experts at their like it's a joke right like actually happen here oh yeah I think it was
unplugged slightly like the power cable was half unplugged which is fine but like you know they're all experts at doing their thing yeah not necessarily experts do so much stuff dude we're we so many companies stuffed into one straight jacket 11 or straight jacket uh straight jacket feels accurate we are in separate coat coffin no yeah we I don't know want to suck your tips we do we do so many things we we not only is there a merch company but they actually like engineer and develop
their own stuff and tools and crazy things like that that's an entire massive company potentially by itself this video platform thing uh we have the the content creation arm we have our own business team sad of farming it out we have our own editors instead of farming it out we have our own accountants instead of farming it out we do so much stuff we have the lab we have Logistics we have procurement we have like I I'm sure I'm missing uh the half the company somehow there's there's there's stuff you you
handle everybody's like backline stuff right the teams and the Google and the oh infrastructure yeah that either we've got Global infrastructure and local infrastructure yeah that's true we have cloud and local we do we do so many things it's ridiculous we got Enterprise data storage collections people are like you have 100 employees we're in a company of 100 jobs this thing must be perfect and it's like well no we don't have 100 employees working on that we have one yeah and then 100 other jobs yeah cuz
we're 11 companies which is awesome like I think it's one of the of the things that people really like about working here is there's so much going on all the time and there's so much potential for you to do different things within the company like it's it's all cool things but it creates sometimes I think a misconception of from from certain other people about how things work around here um how how could they make this one small mistake they have a hundred people to prevent it it's like no we we don't
we do a lot of different things also we release an incredible amount of content and are human so maybe chill out for for a second speak for yourself um I am a robot um I a meat popsicle but  um one of the best things you can do and I I'll word it this way because it usually gathers more people's attention but one of the best things that you can do is lie about timelines what I really mean is one of the best things you can do is be realistic about timelines but everyone involved whether
it's software developers whether it's building contractors whatever they all think that everything's going to go perfectly and that they're going to get it done at this optimistic and and realistic looking timeline and then not everything goes perfectly and it takes twice as long and this happens every time so just get the timeline suggestion from whoever you're working with and just double it and then it's probably accurate it's not you're you're lying about the timeline but you're actually
not you're being being realistic understanding that things are going to go wrong that when you're building bespoke things when you're when you're working on new stuff when you're not just turning up the same thing over and over and over and over again in a very practiced and measured way then stuff happens things don't fit to schedule so you need your schedule to be malleable so you can deal with that the best way to manage expectations in my experience is uh the extremely old saying of under
promise and overd deliver don't set the expectations too high and if people have expect expectations that are too high despite that meet with them and try to bring those expectations back down to reality because um it'll just be better for everyone so yeah anyways okay what else we got hey lonus Luke and the talent and old W talked about whale tier float plane Subs with free merch have you considered a tier that gives store credit monthly Luke would it be easier to have one bird or nine Birds
are these the same question there's two questions okay I think one of them I don't know answer both of them I don't I don't care all right pick pick one your birds a float plane subscription that gives you store credit sounds super   money I don't know maybe people would like that it would be like you buy a float plane subscription and you get a gift card yeah yeah essentially but like   store I don't know we've got some plans there's some cool plans coming up for for flow plane LTT store collaboration
um eventually I kind of want it to go the other way around I have this idea we are not close to this we are not currently working on this do not ask me in 3 weeks when is this feature coming it might never happen Okay no I'm setting expectations I'm doing what I just talked about Leave Me Alone um but I think it would be cool if maybe eventually we thought about potentially working on a system where when you buy merch on LTT store you get float plane subscription time and if you currently have a float plane
subscription it essentially just like buffers back your renew date so like uh say you're you're you know you're super into the mer mer and you really like the content on Flow plane and you buy a bunch of stuff in LTD store and you're actively subscribed with a credit card on Flow plane well buying stuff on LTG store would like push back when you have to get build again on Flo plane if that makes sense um or would just every time you buy something on Flo plane store uh
on LTD store maybe you just get a little bit of Flo plane time for free and you you weren't previously subscribed I think both of those are pretty interesting use cases we are far from that being a thing I don't know if that'll ever be a thing etc etc etc stop please leave me alone um there are many other things are working on before then but I think Bridging the two in a variety of ways is cool um I think a lot of the people that like things from LTT store are probably similar people to the
people that like Flo plane um so I like the idea of somewhat of a collaboration between the two platforms um but uh for a variety of reasons you know both of them not originally being built with that in mind uh it's not necessarily the easiest thing ever but would be cool for people and is something that we are definitely interested in doing um someday sometime not soon go away uh and then is it easier to have one bird or nine uh it's definitely easier to have one bird but I would highly suggest that
you have two um not nine and not one birds are flock animals and if you are not literally home all the time um then they're going to feel abandoned by their flock which is bad so you want to give them a little buddy and then nine Birds sounds like an incredible amount of work to deal with um one bird or nine Birds is a yard reference I think oh well I haven't been keeping up with my my yard listening so maybe I don't know the reference but yeah there we go is there any more I got two more for you  think 
what I see I don't play Pokemon go the way a lot of people play it so I I don't I don't play as much in in like I don't pay as much attention to the updates and stuff I was muted again God somebody asked me what I think about the new update to Pokémon go what do you think I don't really know what they're talking about if they're talking about the Dynamax thing yeah I think so uh it seems kind of neat actually because I like that the Dynamax locations are not super far apart I do think most Min Maxi
gamers are going to interpret this as oh I should get in my car and drive to all of these um which sucks a lot but I would hope that people notice that there's a limited amount that you can do every day so as long as you have the time you might as well just go walk to them and then they're close enough that it's fairly reasonable to walk from point to point um so I'm using it as a walking thing if that's the update that they're talking about uh then yeah I think it's generally a good thing it
incentivizes getting out there and getting new stuff because your old catalog of Pokemon are useless in that Arena um and hopefully it gets people out walking if it does not result in you walking I think it is a bad feature that you should ignore in regards to playing Pokemon go because I will yet again say that I think Pokémon go itself the game is actually terrible um but as mechanism to get you outside and walking it is god tier it is it is both of those at the same time all right next up okay Luke as
a man who drives cars until I get in as a man who drives cars until I get the best tradein value by pushing it to the scrapyard I understand your love of the current car have you thought about what comes after The Magic Smoke not really um pretty much All My Hope has gone into uh Acura releasing a um a plug-in hybrid version of the like what are they on right now TLX or whatever um that's been a hope I hope they do it soon so that by the time I want to buy it I can get a used one that's a few 
um yeah I don't know I haven't put a ton of thought process into it I don't love straight EVS um at these days I don't love straight ice cars either I really like the idea of plug-in hybrids I I have driven my my girlfriend's uh Prius Prime plug-in hybrid a few times and the main problems that I have with it are that it's just like I don't know I don't fit in that car as well as I do in mine which is what brings me back to wanting an Acura because I have never been in a car that feels too as like naturally
comfortable to me as my car does um so I like the idea of hopefully they still feel that way and I can get a new one um not brand new you know a new to me um and then better not I'm leaving right now if you yeah yeah don't worry dead to me you have permission to take me out um yeah I but but having the the power and efficiency of a plug-in hybrid cuz like the power dude when you put it on like use both trains mode dang most supercars are hybrid now yeah and and there's a
new one that came out which is like the first 30 km an hour 30 m an hour full electric until the engine's Peak torque comes in and then it's like unlimited power so sick forever so sick and then the ability you still have infinite range CU you can fill up at pumps whenever you want but you have that efficiency of if you're just commuting to working back you can probably just plug it in like plug-in hybrids are peak in my opinion so both if I am able to get a plug-in high if if I could just
take my current car and assume the frame is in perfect condition and stuff which I'm sure it's not if I can assume all that stuff is fine if I could just literally have the shell of my car but it was a modern plug-in hybrid engine that was in the performance category that my car is in I would be super stoked which is why I'm just hoping that they Acura eventually does that so that I can get the closest possible thing to what I currently have but with a modern plug-in hybrid
you pay me for that I'll do it find the engine we got a rusted out one we got a rusted out one I'll I'll do that that sounds like a fun car project oh man we get salmon over here we'll drift it be sick so that's all I got yeah okay uh thanks for watching thanks for watching the extended period uh we'll see you next week all those fun exciting things um bye
