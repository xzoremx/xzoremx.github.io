this is the million dooll PC a very expensive collection of servers that are linked together with an incredible piece of software called WCA that allows them to act like one giant storage server with the ability to reach speeds measured in the 100s of gigabytes per second watch this and damn boy wa a second that's a little faster than it used to be that's because the million dooll PC has glowed up a little bit we've scaled from six to nine storage machines giving us a whopping 2.2 pedabytes of raw kokia
powered pcie Gen 4 storage it's almost as much storage as we have on hard drives in our mother Vault but orders of magnitude faster which means it's also really power hungry which means it's also really hot even with 3 tons of air conditioning in here it's still 40 flipping de which is terrible for hardware and terrible for any humans who need to work in here now we could add more air conditioning but that would be even more expensive than this already is you know what's not expensive the not
one but six APC Tower coolers that we inherited for free from a local data center that's right folks we are doing whole server room water cooling and this time I swear we are going to do it right so where are the plumbers well we're not we're not really doing it right today we'll do it right later that's fine right we're just going to DIY that is not what I had in mind when I sold this to our sponsor build Redux they make it easy to get into the world of PC gaming just pick your games see the performance
and the pros at build Redux will build the PC for you visit build Redux at the link down below now under normal circumstances you would run chilled water in the unit in your data center and use that chilled water to cool the air but chilling the water costs money and that's what we're trying to avoid right so since we also spend money heating our warehouse and we have so many of these things kicking around anyway we were thinking why not cool the server room and heat the warehouse in
the winter turning this one into less of a cooling tower and more of a heating Tower yeah it was designed for that right I mean this should work great like in theory this is a mint plan in practice well I guess we're about to find out yeah in practice we have a giant cooling tower on a forklift on a not storage rated uh mezzanine water's not heavy 3 2 1 oh okay yeah that feels great where do we want it exactly in theory it blows hot out that side mhm so probably pointing that way sure that
might not be intuitive because this is obviously the front of the unit so you would think that's where it draws air in but in a data center deployment these cooling towers sit in between the servers and servers will typically pull cold air in from the cold aisle in front of them and then heat up the air and blow it out the back so by having these towers in between your servers what happens is that hot air comes out gets sucked into the cooling tower and then gets blown through this Radiator in the
middle blown out the front and sucked back into the server let's put it in the corner pointing that way Hey Jake yeah what I figured out what one of the things we thought might be a temp probe before is what it must have gotten jostled loose at some point but these guys right here they have little floats on them oh they're the like the water level they're for an excess condensation meter yeah when you're running chilled water through them they can start to condensate pretty aggressively we're not
doing that so it should be fine yeah I saw the drip trays before and I also saw that there was rust everywhere in the bottom of the units but I didn't realize that that was by Design as cool as it is is though that this unit is more intact it also means that we haven't modified the fittings yet so well you did such a great job last time so uh you want to have a chance to try to do such a great job too oh okay boom Uno reverse see you later before we solder on those fittings I want to give you
guys a bit of a background the tubing inside the unit is 1 in which is a pretty standard size which is nice um except what I found out getting 1in tubing it's not that common and also all of the fittings are very expensive and since this is like our DIY approach even though my original plan was to use garden hoses uh I found out garden hoses are really expensive so we might as well use the stuff we're going to use in the long term and since we're going to have to take it down anyways we're going to
use shark bites and shark bites are really cool they're basically like you push the tubing in and that's all you do it's now a fixed it's warrantied for 25 years it's it's sick they're just really really expensive that's smells delicious it was  long one and a two you got to make sure it's clean before you solder otherwise the solder doesn't stick at least that's what Plumbing tick Tok told me naturally this is going to be what you'd call a closed loop system meaning it's filled
with a certain amount of water and closed off but only to a point when you have Radiant Heating in your house for instance there is some amount of evaporative loss so you fill the coolant up and over time slowly you lose some of it the way that they get around that is by using a check valve that's basically just hooked up to your House's water pressure which automatically as some evaporates a little bit comes into fill I didn't really want to do that because I want to do it today and I'm not a
plumber but fortunately our mechanical room is right below us and it has a hose bib so we were like why don't we just hook the hose bib up to the tank but then if you just turn it on the Tank's going to overflow and explode and whatever it's like how can we fill a tank I could like design a custom system or I could just buy a toilet fill valve we have this tank from McMaster Car which we're going to add fittings to with these fancy bulkhead fittings but in the meantime this has got to come out
the bottom which means we need to drill  hole it just knew the job was done I bet you this stuff is tasty there's Supply sparingly oh oops we're putting the threaded ones on here we'll solder those and then twist the female shark bites on and then the tubing can just go like that in theory a she's mint Bud it occurs to me we never tested this thing I mean we have spare parts it would probably be faster just to pull another one up here right Jamie oh yeah absolutely luckily there just so happens
to be the exact plug we need right here 20 amp 120 volt we got some adapters and extension cords from infinite cables thanks guys pluggy plug hey you hear that that's the condensation pump running at the start that's not too loud right sounds great it's actually not that heavy when there's nothing in it as he struggles to move it what's the worst that could  thing mint let's go over this one more time pump right below the reservoir that way it gets fed directly we had a problem trying to Prime in at Linus's
house with the pool trying to avoid that then it will go down to the cooler come all the way back up blah blah blah into our heater what I'm calling it and then out the heater into a filter before the reservoir so we catch all the gunk before the reservoir reservoir back to the pump and the Vicious Cycle continues cool are we expecting a lot of Gunk no I feel like we should have also filtered the water coming in we'll put a valve down here so that when the water comes in well at the
start we can close this and the water will go into the reservoir which will make it easier to bleed then once the system is running we just open this valve and most of the water will just go directly into the pump and kind of ignore the reservoir when it's coming back up here that way we don't have like the full force of the pump just like gushing into the reservoir constantly making a bunch of noise I wish we had like straps this Mak this much easier unless we use the LT Cable Management
things to this metal pipe oh hell yeah the reason that we're putting valves here and actually at every piece is a so we can service a piece individually you shut off the valves and then we can take it out and swap it or change it or replace it whatever we're doing and B because it's like like I said before this is all going to get redone properly and I want it to be easy for him to just take apart whoa it's like it's designed for dude it's mint male a te and a valve and a valve yeah this isn't going to
leak no it's going to be great they're shark bites sick before we had this Grand idea of water cooling the server room we tried to mitigate this problem by adding a duct and a fan which was pretty easy to do because right where we are right here is about 10 ft from the server room and there's just a hallway so we added like this insulated duct between and a big fan and it did help but ultimately  enough hey it's through oh that wasn't even that hard huh huh mint we forgot about the filter I realized Alex is
putting this all together I'm like oh yeah where are we putting the filter  working oh no brother brother did they sell me the mother oh my God why  is since a long-term plan is to rip the RADS out of these giant units and just stick it right on the back of the rack so it captures the heat directly uh I don't care that much about where this goes since it's probably only going to be here for a couple months later so we're thinking we just leave it up against the back here that way the hot
air comes out get get sucked in on the back and shoots out cool air in the front and because of that we're thinking we just leave the back door off and then I can just pull this tubing kind of right in there beautiful look at that that's mint good job Alex I'm excited to see if it leaks or not the great thing is we won't know until it's far too late on the bottom side yeah oh shut it off here's the problem we're running into this tank is thick down the middle Middle where the seam is and when this
is sitting in here it looks good like that except when you tighten it down that extra material pushes it out on an angle and now the seals can't seal I walk back into this project and I'm immediately told well it leaked um oh who whoa whoa be careful there's fittings on the bottom but we have a fix for the leak and it's glue no not that not that it's the the ooo this stuff is like $40 a tube it does not leak it's a nice non hardening so it stays kind of plasticky and goopy
solution silicone yeah I wasn't able to do it exactly how I was hoping because it's still kind of cockeyed but I don't think it's going to leak I put I put a lot in there but I have a job for you cool I uh spent some of your money and got the wrong thing so we have to do it again if I had a dollar for every time he said that wasn't I would be able to afford all these mistakes what are we building uh a filter housing they sold me the wrong size of PVC even though I was like I just need to connect these
two things and they were like okay we're going to give you one inch PVC because it's one inch well it's supposed to be inch and a quarter cool uh so I have 20t of 1in PVC that I have no use for and then we went to the store they were like okay we could we can tell you this it'll probably be long enough so you have to cut the threads off and then cut it in half and hopefully that is like enough oh man that's going to be uh you have one shot at this don't screw it up and this is my
saw yeah look this is what the professionals told us to buy they might have told us the wrong thing last time but here we are again surely that  clamps not really what this is for but it's working I cut off part of the threads I sanded down the little nubbins now they fit in here which is why I was doing that by the way really uh oh wait oh balls we have to cut this down the middle too okay well um I have to go do a conference call so what I mean you only got one thing done and so you
didn't even get it done I don't know if you're getting your minutely bonus minutely bonus look at that worky oh nice yeah I didn't know that this glue set up in 10 minutes there's your filter perfect um damn it I looked in the manual for the cooling tower things and I did randomly stumble upon uh them mentioning a filter and they said a 20 mesh and I think this is 100 so it's a lot finer should be fine as long as our pump has enough power for it it doesn't really matter it I mean it's not that fine yeah
also it's still it's still like a mint for 1in tubing so it should be fine now we just have to find out where we can put it now we just have to pose with it like not everyone's a poser don't worry can you walk me through what's going on here a little bit because I missed the part where you guys drilled holes in the building we've got the cooling tower over there we've got the tubes coming off of that and we already have the tubes in the server room already hooked up we had previously cut
a hole for our ducting solution so we just stuffed the tubes down the duct that goes through the like hallway there into the Ser oh wow and these awesome Cable Management things the magnet is so strong that it just it's kind of perfect in terms of pump this is not our end game this is like a cast iron pump and we're using oxyard tubing which it limits the amount of oxygen it's probably f look your house is probably the same cast iron pump in it for like 20 years and it's fine but it isn't the
end game I picked up a stainless version of the one step up from this pump this one I think does around 20 gallons per minute and the big boy that we're getting does around 40 wow which is a lot of gallons a lot of gallons per minute okay are we ready to hook this up in theory yeah I mean let's do it we tried before so let's try again hold on before you do that that tube is plugged into the wrong thing on the top of that oh did you guys anything right on the first attempt or that is a excellent
question and we decided to not Mount the filter up there he always chirps me for doing things like kind of the easy way and then fixing it later and he's literally just like purposely doing that right now well we're just not going to fix it later it's fine I'm going to fix it later what no don't waste time on that it's fine well you I'm not the one that wasted time don't move it it doesn't matter you told me it doesn't matter I'm going to send you a video of me moving it later no that is going to be a huge
waste of time cuz you'll have to disconnect the tubes in order to you could have just fixed it right now let's put the tubes in come on I'm coming back here with a rotary tool I'm actually going to shave off the tops of these screws let's give ourselves a little bit of breathing a lot of breathing room that's fine I like to breathe a lot we we know I plan to keep doing it easy peasy by the way I found an easier way to do this just take the white thing out first oh okay okay this
is bothering me do you hear that now is everyone hearing that I don't know what you're talking about every just said it's bothering me editor's note cut out this entire story line okay it's on the wall filtered what I dropped one of the little shark bite white thingies and it fell down the hole hey lonus no you suck oh my God Jake did you turn the water on no why is it wet I don't know where's the water shut off is this valve broken I I was dumping water down the hole oh
my God you suck do you want me to turn the water on okay that actually does pour down into an electrical box so you really shouldn't do that oh what really uh yeah I I honestly have no idea where  taada what oh she's on no it's in it's in somebody needs to go in the server room and watch okay in case that leaks because if that starts leaking it's going to be a while before it all stops leaking  dick ah a dick I get it no stop you a his first is my loging in high school was a. dick okay and then you want it
one click apparently right 7/8 inch ballcock let's turn this thing on yeah go for it see you later okay it's on I I got water coming that's good do it full send let's go I can't believe this tank is not leak are you ready Mr Dick I ready it's coming whoa it sell fills how's it looking why didn't we do this at my house this is awesome no idea it's actually great you know V2 right is it fine yeah like everything's fine down there Jake we have a leak oh God uh where uh on on the uh the return
fitting no we got it we got it I got it I tell you guys standing right at the back of the air output of these servers  exhausting Alex Alex Alex he may be a dick but he's our dick this is the world's slowest leak at this point ready one more and nice note that every fitting I did is not leaking this is the one you did I didn't do that one yeah you did you stuck the tote I don't know what you're talking about we managed to fix our leaks I replaced the fittings down here on both sides I think we just
used Too Much Teflon tape uh the first time we hooked it up and it kind of just like bunged up the threads and then upstairs I just cut the PEX sanded it down stuck it back in and everything's good no more leaks now I've got the million dollar PC hooked up and running again and I want to test something before Linus gets here uh one of the big things you want to do in a setup like this especially if you were doing this in a data center is contain the hot air so we're going to make ourselves a
little bit of a hot aisle with some cardboard right now it says 31 is De on the intake maybe it's 31.1 31.2 let's see if it goes up any Higher by just adding the cardboard I want to just kind of proof of concept before I spend the time doing a better job of this obviously still a giant Gap here but let's see if it makes a difference oh 31.3 31.4 it's going up5 6 okay maybe it's only like half a degree but half a degree is important because the whole game here is temperature differential the larger we
can make the difference in temperature on this side to the temperature out in the warehouse the better this system  bad we have our hot aisle which is going through the cooler and the rest of the server room is our cold aisle it's not a perfect science but it's better than when it was open oh oh god look I wanted optimal circumstances for our very scientific test it's definitely hot how do you like it I have so many questions that's great it's hot in here hey it's really hot hot
in here but would you believe me if I told you the air conditioning's off really it's 32° in here don't get me wrong it is hot but the AC is off off and this has been running for like hours that's actually kind of cool so look at the UPS we're drawing 4.95 Kow except no we're not half of these servers are hooked up to the Main's power so we're probably drawing more like probably like 8 to 10 Kow however the can we turn the AC on yes aren't we going to be taking cold air that's been heated up a little
and running it through our heat exchanger potentially cooling the warehouse look I don't know if it's going to get that cold uh I don't know if you've stood Behind these things at all they're hot it's quite hot the exit temperature of these servers is probably like 40° even with air condition air coming through it but you are right it will be colder that being said before when these actually running with just the air conditioning it was 40° in here I think we should turn that off and see
how hot it gets in here okay cuz it's been 32 for over an hour this is a cool software called check MK it's a monitoring tool that's open source very awesome we've hooked up the systems with SNMP which is a monitoring protocol and you can see the coolant coming in is 28° from coming from the warehouse yes after it's been cooled with air that's around 21° and then and leaving here it's 32° that's a 4° difference that's a lot of heat it doesn't sound like a crazy number but at the fluid flow rate that
we've got that's a freak ton of heat yeah clearly we have a problem of it not quite getting cooled over there as much but I had a brilliant idea we have six of the bloody things let's just put another up there we could why not or hear me out we bury a coil in the parking lot oh I'm totally down for that give me the approval I will find a contractor today that is not that's above my pay grade these days oh I got to ask paren yes hi Money free cooling lus said it was a good idea anyway yeah
we could throw another one up there for sure like pretty easily we just actually need two T's that's it interestingly too the return versus Supply Air is a 3° difference right now so the air coming into the back is almost 40° 37 and then the air coming out of the front is 33.6 they are still going up a bit but like I said it's been at 30 2 for an hour uh I imagine if we left this overnight we probably come back and it might be like 34 or 35 in here but considering we're
not air conditioning this at all let's see what happens if we turn it off oh God I don't think the air conditioning is going to make that much of a difference in terms of the air coming out of here the metal on the back of this rack is up to 46° the air coming out of the back of this power supply is as high as 60° oh 76 it's uh 33 .2 now this may not be safe for this hardware for much longer it's 33.3 now it's gone up a full degree in like 3 minutes it's getting warmer 34.1 I'm getting quite uncomfortable I
think what I want to see now is if the air conditioner can actually work cooperatively with the heat exchanger to get it down to like normal temperature in here yeah okay all right let's do it so our Baseline is when we started this project it was hitting about 40° in here with just the air conditioner running if we can beat that it means that somehow through the magic of thermodynamics they are working together 34 and2 plug the goddamn thing back in a sweet relief so our Peak was
42 with the AC off and now it's come down to 37 37.8 and up here is equally as mint you like my sound ding yeah I mean it'll do something not much in this config that's what I was going for is something something long term we get sheet of plywood and attach the rock wall on the inside of it to kind of make a baffle if I stand here it's pretty loud but if I go behind this thing it's a pretty substantial difference we just have to create kind of a a sound blocking maze that air can
move through but um block sound from reaching people below us and it's also at like 80% fan right now if we put a second one up here and run them like half the speed should be tolerable all right wait we should look at the filter oh is there shoo in there not too bad and we're back so not as good as it was before no it says 1.8 th000 Watts on the readout which oh no which is a lot given the amount of power that we're putting into it what one pump in some fans huh 22° in here right now Supply versus
return air is still like a Delta of more than 2° that's solid and interestingly the cooling temperature is lower but what I realized look at this the fan speed is lower oh what I also realized after looking at this is that there's a valve I remember when you guys did the thread R cooling there's a manual valve right that's like the bypass valve and you guys were like oh you're supposed to close it so it doesn't bypass actually you're supposed to leave it open because there's a
mixing valve in the unit for your application actually probably just shut it doesn't matter but the thing can dynamically adjust how much water goes through the radiator and how much gets bypassed I think to maintain to maintain a Delta ideal temperature yeah it's totally fine in here now it's working I'm surprised it works this well well the ducting was key but the other big thing is I think that we were just on the edge of this air conditioning unit's capacity so just taking the edge off
taking another thousand couple thousand Watts out of here and what's cool is because we've got it hooked up direct directly to the exhaust from this rack adding more to this rack is going to increase that Inlet air temperature which increases the efficiency of the thermal transfer of our heat exchanger mission accomplished yeah I'm actually kind of shocked I mean 2° cut off the exhaust temp doesn't sound like a lot but that's like already outside of the server and we're talking 2° and a lot of
air oh I can't wait for part two it's going be so much better when this is directly on the rack I'm thinking we put two on the mezzanine for like winter time but we could also put one like outside somewhere we could have valves and we could decide where we want to dump heat from this room we could automate them pretty easily too we got have electric Valves and a couple temp sensors and a Ras pie so we can send the heat outside when it's hot in the warehouse and send it inside when we
want to heat the warehouse yeah and interestingly we could put it in that mechanical room and just like cut a hole in the one put a big thing yep it's our mechanical one yeah what's the landlord going to do about it screw that guy and screw the segue to our sponsor Squarespace creating your own website doesn't have to be difficult and luckily with Squarespace it isn't they're all in one platform makes it easy to get your website up and running quickly and designing with their fluid engine site
