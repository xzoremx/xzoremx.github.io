I have a small problem do you guys remember the ultimate gaming minivan well ever since MSI repossessed the laptops that we used to build it it's more of an ultimate minivan I also have a big problem I promised my kids that over the long weekend they would have a gaming minivan for our trip to greatwolf Lodge the long weekend's tomorrow and there's so much more wrong with it than just the missing computers the screens fell off the cables broke we don't have any way for the middle child
poor middle child to even see the screens we had in there there's no time to lose sponsor segue War Thunder you got to admit it would be pretty cool to fly a jet or drive a tank well War Thunder's gameplay is about as close as you can get from the comfort of your own home sounds cool play free at the link below in the event of a crash the last thing we would want is a giant monitor mount designed by Alex hey for the kids to come flying into so we ended up sourcing this retrofitted incar display that we're
going to put here so that uh that one doesn't end up with a syndrome wait but Dad will we still be able to play games together absolutely you'll be able to play games together in fact you will only be able to play games together instead of having three separate computers we're going to have one computer and it's all going to be wired up to this so you guys will pick what game you're going to play together and you will all play but you'll have your own screens to look at if I want to play
by myself if you want to play by yourself then you have to convince the girls that you're the only one who's allowed to use it for a bit second computer a twers computer and a oneperson computer you guys are the choosiest little Beggars no you get one computer for now second computer Alex you're not helping this feels like a hostage negotiation anyway this display is from a company called Extron it's TN but it's one of the better tn's that I've seen so we're going to say
it's good enough as long as we can get it mounted in kind of a reasonable spot so what's a good kind of location for you like are you thinking kind of there right there why do I even ask children things the good location's right here oh so it's dictated by where the plate to mount it to is under here yeah uh it's getting attached to the B pillar that goes up and across and stuff got it so before we do this one thing attaching this requires cutting a hole in the liner up here what are we waiting for
who wants to do it me please please me oh I think we got a volunteer unfortunately unlike the DJI units that we put in Emily's camper van this ecoflow unit uses some proprietary adapter for its AC input so I don't have it um I guess is there any reason that we couldn't work on this out in the driveway no that seems fine okay let's get the the solar panels going do you have sunscreen uh theoretically the second I pull out into the sun here my input's going to hey look at that okay
we're charging boys now that we've got power worked out you guys wanted to help with this today right yeah so we need to get you guys assignments who wants to help build and install the computer me okay get out of here who wants to help install the screen me okay see you later who wants to be my big helper my moral support animal me wonderful now for the fun one who wants my daughter's help I'll take it all right so Justin you're on getting the computer installed in the back and Alex
you get my son and let's get the screen started all right heck yeah as for us we're going to work on cable management you remember those cables that broke off on the old screens those were poopy cables they were bad so we're going to use type- C instead but using type c out of a desktop is a little bit more challenging than you might think because while these monitors support display port over USB type-c they use display port alt mode which means that if you just output from a regular graphics card
he no working and so that's why we went with a 20 series card because it supports VR length through this type-c connector here perfect native output just type-c to type-c Cable of course that only handles one one of our displays and two of them are still going to use these type-c inputs so we chose a motherboard with a type-c output cloning the display across your dedicated GPU and your integrated GPU can have a slight performance penalty but realistically they're going to be
playing what like Castle Crashers yeah Ultimate Chicken horse it should be okay as for the final display it does have fulls sizee HDMI which is fantastic not so fantastic it also has power because no USB type-c so we have to figure out how to run that through here somehow I guess these come off I don't know it's sorry what those come off yeah oh to to put power through it yeah um okay and are they going to go back on these will go back on great what happens up here we will see
no okay darling so you see where we've got these cables from last time yeah these are all poo poo so what we're going to do instead is we're going to run these cables down the same spots okay okay can you handle that yeah so we got to take all of this off and then so you got to find those down there and pull them out oh you know what it be really smart though hold on hold on if we were really smart you know what we would do is we would tape the new cable to the old cable and then when we
pull it out we're going to feed our new cable right in think you can do that are you that smart yeah okay let's get you some tape and D doop good enough ah okay now go find the bottom of this one and  it nice perfect now you just got to take that tape off good job or wait you know what no we can use it to keep pulling let's go all the way to the back and see if we can find it here this is the one we want so you got to pull this here and I'm going to help feed it through okay
oh wo hold on wait did we get it the end yet oh that is not quite long enough hey Alex yeah are these cables intended to be long enough to reach up to the headrests uh which ones uh the type C's I think so Justin says he doesn't have longer type c's for the front seats my solution to that oh no was to have this just kind of exist somewhere in the middle oh oh so you can go from traditional display port to display port alt mode but what you need is an active adapter and this is one of the little VR Port
boxes that comes with vario varo highend really nice professional VR headsets it's a little less clean than the direct USBC run that we had intended and it means there was no reason to use a 20 series Nvidia card anymore but hey at least it means we're not up the creek without a paddle right kids what since we're going to be playing around where some side curtain airbags are we're just not going to take any risks so battery is getting disconnected right here and then we don't have to worry about uh those
airbags exploding in our faces you're welcome fortunately the built-in cables just barely reach where our front cable gets to and just barely reach the back of the computer so what we need to do now is get this cable managed so that it doesn't move all right do you want to break your parents van yeah most of car interior work is just pulling on things and hoping that the little plastic Clips on the inside don't break so uh do you want to just pull on this as hard as you can and it'll probably come
off yeah there we go come there we go oh that escalated quickly yeah he pulled it off oh okay all right we've got our two boxes now we just need to decide where the optimal place is to mount them so that we can reach them with our cables from the front let's go figure out where those cables are going to land why can't we just drill a big Square over here oh we will but we need to get the water up and in so it's nice and tidy are you guys thinking like we can just fish it through yeah oh well that'll be fine
then right yeah oh well why were you freaking me out about the fabric at the top because we just need to take it out a little bit here and it's Headliners just never go back in the same oh I see yeah okay why don't we run another one of these cables okay okay you got it yeah keep going keep going okay that's good okay let's see how much slack we've got got once again we have just barely enough room we're going to mount this I don't know here or something and then these are just going to make their way
around to the back of the PC perfect just like we planned what are those these are the brackets that hold it down so that way when you guys are driving and hitting bumps and stuff like that the computer doesn't go flying around so these here are 3D printed brackets they are printed at 100% fill in ptg so it should be nice and strong shouldn't go anywhere while she's installing the computer sort of uh let's talk about the specs we went with something pretty mid-range it's a ryzen
5 5600 so this is last gen ryzen 16 gigs of T Force memory a P5 SSD and okay the motherboard's a little high-end it's an x570 board from Asus but that's just cuz we had that kicking around the reality of it is we don't want anything that's going to draw a ton of power or kick out a ton of heat because once we have the top cover on here it's a pretty confined space that was one of the justifications for laptops last time this is a cool addition though this was actually
created by a viewer it's from markz from cosmic goo.com and it's a little IR receiver that can be used with pretty much any programmable IR remote to turn a PC on and off so we're going to be giving it a try wait IR how's that going to be that useful inside the trunk of a car well we're going to have to have it running outside the car um it does come with some pretty long wires as it is but we might have to go a little bit longer and maybe stick it to the roof or something on the inside of the car not
the outside I see okay I do wonder if at that point it might have been easier for us to just press the button but okay sure you know what we're shouting out Mark Z and if the solution is a little weird then blame Mark Z this is the mounting plate for the middle Monitor and it is sharp as heck you will actually cut yourself if you touch it the wrong way so uh deburing tool Linus's kid gets to learn how to use one he he didn't give consent one thing you might think would be smart would be wearing gloves while
doing this that's a really bad idea if you touch your hand against it maybe you have a bit of a bad hour you have to put on a Band-Aid if a glove gets caught in it and gets pulled off you're you're having a bad month or so why is that there that is there so that we can take this little adapter box and stick it there so it won't go anywhere what's this this is a wireless router what does it do well it does a couple of things in our application it's going to take the 4G Puck that we have
and it's going to distribute networking to everything what's the 4G Puck that's going to give us internet when we're in the car we had wanted to put starlink on the roof of the car what starlink it's um like satellite internet that you can have anywhere but they didn't have the new like really small one that they have now back when we built this so we didn't get starlink oh so we're just going to use a 4G Pock what does that do that does oh it apparently is a button I have
I have no idea maybe we're breaking it good gravy this is the chunkiest puck I think I've ever seen we're not going to need that MSI thing in there anymore we could just run a little switch off of this thing okay perfect never mind uh that's going to go so we can take that out if I'm honest I don't know how I feel about having a kid just put an Ula knife through the roof of a car um that's okay but that's what line is said to do so how you feel yeah I just like poke it yeah 
nice oh there we go heck yeah I did it we can see the B pillar right there we are golden I scratched this part that's fine no one's going to see it oh wow what a mostly even hole you've cut it's okay it's going to get much bigger that was just to see what's on the go Mr Justin I may have a task that you're uniquely qualified for this doesn't use Keyhole mounts like our magnetic Cable Management would like for it to use but it does have these little slide in feet things I see how hard would it
be to make them out for that it's not okay I'll get on her may I has mhm let's do it okay okay I'll just hold on to this 104 perfect this looks great but is there a reason we used double-sided tape rather than the slides uh yes because if I went with the right thickness of material that would allow it to slide the little feet stick out and then you got a big bump and right AC it would be so flimsy anyway all right let's screw it in I'm going to put this kind up right here cuz I'm thinking the
closer I can get these antennas to at least a window rather than the metal chassis of the vehicle the better so I'm kind of I'm kind of feeling this Vibe they are antennas okay keep going a little more little more okay yeah that's good good job all right awesome this is my favorite technique for getting stuff through confined little areas you just zip tie a zip tie to the end of it and then add some Tesa tape so it gets through kind of easily it'll probably work just fine
all right I'm going to try and fish this through can you try and grab it in there when it starts showing up assuming it does heck yeah there we go pretty big moment now I've got the power adapter for our second VR box so I'm just going to go ahead and get this Plugged In which means all we've got to do is flip the switch on our computer oh sure you have an IR emitter on your phone red magic 9 has one brand new phone still has it wow okay and what I just press the power button yep T that is awesome
computer's powered up which means you two girls can go plug those monitors into the front and let's see if we get a signal to them go for it as cool as our programmable IR button is though I think that what I'm leaning toward is just extending these two wires that are coming off of the power button on the computer and just putting it power button in the front I uh I don't have a blaster on my phone and I don't have any obvious way to hit this unless we like install an array of mirrors to yeah
Zelda Zelda dungeon it um Okay cool so can we do that yeah yeah quick and easy problem okay perfect it turned on yay wait do you guys see an out from the computer it said it says 12% 12% oh no yeah yeah yeah but there's a Windows background that's all we care about it just turned off yeah it's at 0% oh okay's power this on okay it's powered on Republic of Gamers yeah I know it's hey look at that we've got both of them now excellent we definitely should have done all of the cutting before throwing the
cables through that was an oversight look how bad of a job you did last time perfect than his writing it's going to look so good it's Perfecter than his drawing he sticking out we just rip it there we go yay hey all right put the blade away there's holes in the slots that I wanted for there to be not holes so we can observation getting griefed by children how are we feeling about right there do we have any way of telling if it wait Alex that's not centered you know that right Alex we can move it over a
bit okay right there okay you want to hold it I'm going to try okay going to do one R oh this is going to be so tough Oh I thought you said it was great and super fantastic Alex Alex you're saying that it's not right now I mean I'm not saying anything do you want to do the honors Len oh yeah perfect where do I drill it you are determining right now whether this will be centered or not and you can't even put your glasses on upside right this is the right way  all right we didn't go through roof that's
great time to pick where you want it oh okay well let's go find a spot I'm going to regret it if it isn't somewhere where the kids can reach it yep okay let's just put it up here on the floor okay fil so whatever you do don't fart Alex Oh I really wish I had one so it's very important that this goes in straight here I'll do the one that's I'll do this one so that if we still have this one it's finer yeah uh three was already kind of the minimum my son what could go wrong we've got a
12-year-old tapping uh the tap could break why is it called he could strip it rhetorical question he could go in sideways rhetorical question I think he might have done it he didn't do it he did do it oh okay sure great he did it of course something went wrong power button test is it off Justin it is off okay then it works all right it's just going to hang here shouldn't we use a screwdriver for that uh yes oh what did Alex oh it's both of you now the safety glasses on wrong
unbelievable okay here we go so the HDMI input is just on the side yeah why so if I don't misunderstand this then all this crap just sits up there yep okay no one's going to see it yeah we'll just kind of stuff it in here I feel like that's the gold ones this is going to be really hard to line up gold ones I believe in you Alex is it long enough I think it's long enough it's just going to be hard to hit wait did we nail it say let go no no not even oh wow know we were super close
might be right there oh that's under promising yeah I'm I'm Letting Go it's not coming down I think we got it I think we got it how's that looking I mean good enough it's as good as it's going to be because it's into a plate that's in a fixed position well but we can like lightly move the plate oh I see check this out big moment guys peels coming off who pro professional buddy only took two tries all right not bad not bad that looks sick you can't even tell there's a big
ugly HDMI cable sticking out of the side that is legitimately kind of cool though because it means that at a moment's notice you could just plug anything you want into it yeah kind of Handy kind of cool like if someone's sitting there with a a switch OLED or something and they want to just share their screen connect another controller for a second player boom you just keep playing on your handheld and there you go get the whole van playing like six kids all playing smash BRS you totally could
all right let's put the car back together yeah I should test if that internet Puck works I'm going to do that okay we got internet let's check googly Chrome uh sure Web Store hey nice okay we've got internet and one display progress yay Andrew what do you think are the odds this just works uh 80 80 oh come on man doing a quick test run with them just Twisted together here we go is that screen going to turn on let's find out and ah uh-oh that is not powered oh there's a remote I mean the light's not
on though oh the light's not on uh-huh uh hold on maybe I did it wrong no you did that right uh-oh Alex did you tie the accessory in to the voltage okay time for some probation volts that's bad that is really bad okay if I support this yeah I got it do you want to have see if you can grab the cable harness stuff yeah do you think we just didn't get the wios on properly that's my vote I'm voting for that Justin says power supply I say wos you got any guesses I can see the problem already
what accessory wire isn't wired into the positive there's no wi going to the  ACC yeah so you need both uh yeah BCC and accessory H oh okay well that's good yeah that was a relatively Quick Fix oh Von come around the other side what do you think of the center monitor yeah she just told me what what do you mean she just told you look at her drawing her puzzle drawing yeah I didn't know that you guys were putting one in but well we are yeah oh wait you're upset about the hole in the
roof oh well you'll never see it cuz this will be there last time when you guys worked on the car I was driving and the car just stopped working there was no more power yeah very dangerous yes are we going to have the same issue no oh no are you sure oh yeah okay that wasn't me also that was someone a BMW Enthusiast in all honesty if you weren't trying to make a video and have your three kids help you you could probably do an install of one of these in couple hours I'd say maybe an
hour really okay but I'm I'm buffering Alex yeah I came up with how long I thought thought it would take and then I doubled it yeah two hours I mean you've read the YouTube comments I no offense some of you are could probably do it in an hour just fine but a lot more probably think they could do it in an hour yeah oh yeah hey y look at that it has no apps uh that's okay we can fix that wow that image quality is not great sorry middle child she has the bigger screen though
that's what you get for being the middle but it's farther away also I don't think it's bigger it's smaller if anything okay let's put the third screen on shall we yeah all right oh here's the remains of that micro HDMI cable there it goes like everything else in this car hey hey hey come on we're doing great here can you not triplicate a display is that not a thing okay so uh how are you supposed to do this again uh you click set up multiple displays yeah and then you right click on the display
you want to duplicate and then select clone with and then choose the displays you want to duplicate uh-huh that was UN necessarily complicated agreed but yes we got it heck yeah all right you guys want to try a game yeah yeah all right let's do it Alex do you want to help me guide this bad boy in for the last dish time for a wildish look at that it looks all proper professional sort of yeah wow this whole setup is actually drawing less power than this late afternoon sun is
inputting we're around 170 watts output and we're at around 200 Watts input for all the trials and tribulations the end result is actually oh yeah really good I mean it looks sick it legitimately does and it has way more flexibility than we're even taking advantage of now second computer okay we do have the ability now that we have those little adapter boxes to display port alt mode in the back to put up to three computers in without any difficulties but hey they can play games
together it wouldn't kill them they're siblings right you guys love each other  won and I love telling you about our sponsor War Thunder now you too can blow a tank to Smither in a video game War Thunder features immersive player versus player combat with an emphasis on the "realistic details of over 2,000 vehicles" to the point where every single war machine is modeled after its real world counterpart pilot some of the most famous tanks planes and ships from multiple eras of warfare and if the
