previously on lineus car tips we've made great strides modernizing ploof vehicle with Android auto power windows and this sick ass paint job but unfortunately the engine has been having some problems it overheats leaks oil and most recently developed an Australian accent good day mate that's right we are here to modernize this Honda Civic with some nice fancy bits like new wiring looms a dash a htech and the train SPS know what this is K Ser K series engine that's right and the best part is all of
this modernization is going to come without modern car nonsense like selling your data to the highest bidder we've also got a brand new DSP to bring the audio into the 2020s and frankly this project has gotten out of control lers has literally no idea what is on the go you just say you're working on a crappy Civic and everyone shows up what I do have a clue about is how we paid for it massive thanks to the ridge for sponsoring this video without them this project would not have been possible
flights from Australia to Canada not cheap so make sure you support the people that support cool projects what's even better is you can get a free air tag money clip with any wallet order over $69 by going to ridge.com Linus upgrade Ridge have also started their early bird sale with some big markdowns on popular wallets like tobacco brown leather and lavender find out more at  I have to say I feel like this has gotten a little bit out of control when we first discussed this project we were
going to be performing a couple of tasteful modifications but can someone please tell me what the plan is love to this engine out in the bin yeah K24 Honda's best engine arguably in so we just take this piece out yes uh that in the transmission everything you can see is coming out in the next hour or so and then we have all of that and a pallet of stuff and another pallet of stuff and as a bonus we're going to pull everything else out of the car as well that's underneath it
exhaust suspension breaks the whole lot and change all that Alex you were responsible for controlling the scope of this I said multiple times to him is that going to add scope and he was like it's fine what's scope just two more questions you guys have seen the car now is is this really worth the effort I can't answer that but we know that it we we know that it leaks oil we know that it knocks do you know how much power it made 89 horsepower to the wheels not bad that's bad we know it's
automatic we should change we can change all this engine just needs to go are you turning it into a manual yeah oh yeah oh yeah we're also doing a sound system is that scope no why are we changing it to a manual transmission what is that even a question this guy's only got two years he doesn't understand anymore now tell me this was this engine ever designed for this chassis like was there a version of this car that had this better engine in it not in the US now there was
a hatchback that came with a K20 and this is essentially the same as the Acura RSX or they call it the Integra in Japan so that chassis is almost identical to this the difference being that on the K series the engine sits over here transmission sits over here yeah so there's some stuff welded onto the frame rails that prevent you from just just bolting it in so that's why we make a mount kit so that you can then bolt in what used to not bolt in and that's your business that's my business
Godfather of K swaps very cool so we're going from 1.7 L to 2.4 so we're well to me not a car person I hear that is we are going from a sedan engine to an SUV engine not really we're going to the TSX Type S engine that's actually the engine that's going oh okay I thought you said it was the same one you have in the CRV I did cuz I put a TSX engine in my CRV I don't expect you to remember but there will be a test later TSX RSX SI but it's my brain is swimming with Honda stuff
but also the engine that's actually going in is from an odyssey it is but it's the equivalent of the American one thing I do feel like car people underestimate though sometimes is the complexity of something as simple as what you're doing right now because I don't know you know where the proper point is no but other people don't know how to bond 10 gig fiber to make 25 GBS and what kind of whether they should use a aggregation switch or a normal switch like this is all stuff that you oh yeah
fine it's the same you know what I love though there's a real DIY sense that I feel like tech people and car people all share it's like they just love hacking stuff building things like building a ped building a car it's all in the same wheelhouse oh oh someone put something under it while we were talking like  everything in here is going to get replaced so we're going to change suspension we're going to change the brakes we're going to change the calipers we're going to put new drive
shafts in it I don't know these calipers look pretty good to me they look good but they're not big enough cuz we're going to make it real fast it has to stop as well it's like a safety thing apparently this is the stock shock absorber it does what it says it absorbs shocks that's the spring that's the damper um these often get very very worn out over time so if you're modifying a car like we are it's a good time to upgrade them which we are doing and that is a fully adjustable one meaning we can
adjust the height of the car and we have some control over how the car handles as well the suspension that's a complete replacement unit so you put the original one completely in the bin you put that in your car and you have a great time  better this is the back end of the car the rear suspension it's independent meaning that that side can go up and down independent of this the sway bar kind of joins it together to make it handle a bit better all this is going away we've got new suspension to go in
and also new arms and new brakes it's kind of another game I want to play it's going to be called which part on the table is worth more than the entire car I'm going to go with this one it looks pretty but no he'll probably trade it if you had one of these you might get a whole car is this aluminum though uh yeah it is cast aluminium and then it's got all like breathers and stuff so all that collects all the oily air and yeah it's it's cool how about this one headers this has got to be worth more
than the car this is great cuz this makes power we like this cuz it gets the exhaust out of the engine um definitely worth more than the car um a really nice piece all mandrel Bandon welded and stuff in there I wouldn't even be surprised if this cable harness is worth more than the car this this is one of my favorite things cuz you can spend 2 or 3 days wiring this from scratch or you can buy one of these that has all the plugs and connectors and you just maybe change a couple of things here to get it to do
what you want depending on what computer you're using that's super cool there's a lot of folks that make that kind of thing yeah there are all over there's a huge aftermarket for these sort of parts and um yeah just saves time we're taking the dash out yeah we're going to take the dash out we're going to replace it oh oh I guess we need to put like a Teter in it cuz it's manual now like no not like the Fast and Furious big taco thing no no no no we're going to put an LCD screen in it we're oh we're oh we're
going to put a screen in we're going to put a full HCK Dash in it what yeah oh my God this seems so unnecessary custom colors miles man an adapter for this particular car how good is that so that will read all the information from the htech ECU directly up on here and we can have different settings different alarms different colors this piece alone is worth probably 3 to 4X the value of this entire car but wait till you see it is going to be worth every penny when you see this sort of riding on apart it's
come from a wre up so this has been replaced at some point in this car's life oh hilarious lower miles so we have no idea how many kilometers are on this engine then Alex asked me to be a screwdriver fery and just kind of come around and get you guys all an LTT screwdriver than you it turns out we already have one of these cuz we bought one oh cuz we made a little surprise for you you bought you know you don't have you didn't have to yeah I know but but then it wouldn't be a surprise oh I see
so this is the new shifter that's going to make it manual wow that looks like it's also another thing that's worth more than the entire car yeah but we got one of your thingo and we actually adapted it that's going to be the shifter are you kidding me how cool and it's going to be usable so you can pull it out fix your computer and then put it back in your get shifter yeah thought you might like that all right so that is a subframe that holds the engine in the engine's still being
kept in by those two mounts are on the top but all our brakes and all this stuff can go away next step is to pull the engine out the top okay so final stages now this is we're getting there coming out it is it goes from rust bucket to to empty rust bucket yeah Alex this is Ariana's yeah what what is this called like engine engine crane engine hoist yeah that's Ariana's hoist she had The Misfortune of owning a rotary imagine if it was like this at your dentist up a bit come on come on
what your dentist isn't like that which way do I twist it uh counter any clockwise down so did you just say any clockwise anti anticlockwise anticlock what I've gleaned is that they've actually never done this before like they've done this but every other time they had proper equipment and they dropped it out the bottom yeah and so the engine she's stuck basically it kind of seems like it uh-huh just a bit okay worst case we know friends right over there that have a proper lift oh yeah
would we have to put the wheels back on it to drag it on there drag it over there or oh nice what made you guys decide that this was worth all the effort power what's why are you overclock stuff no no I mean you guys comeing all the way up here to work on this piece of cuz we like you guys cuz we know that there's a lot of fans here that like what we do and also we get to hang out with all our mates yeah okay all right this is fun  beautiful where it belongs not in the car so the problem we're having is um
all the parts that we shipped about a week ago from the US are stuck in customs uh so we're getting on our phones and we're just trying to work out a backup plan in case uh that stuff never arrived cuz we' only got like I think 72 hours to get this done DED finished driving everything finished so if we don't have that stuff in the next 24 hours we're in trouble so the backup plan is to get either an RSX or a TSX um we can use those parts and then then get some of Brian's Parts like shipped
overnight or maybe shipped to Washington and do a midnight run to go pick them up yeah that might be what happens we'll see did I just hear you correctly the engine that we're putting in here is not here not here Washington's a different country right yeah it is yeah that's where the engine is in Washington wait we don't have it yet no we have other stuff to do but at some point we're going to run out of stuff to do when we have no engine when were you guys going to tell me this yeah there's cars in the
car park with engines yeah actually I think your camera guy's got the same engine in his car and he actually he said we can have his engine so we're going to pull his car apart exactly what we just did and put his engine in this and then when the one from Washington eventually makes it then you guys can put that back in cuz you'll see how to do you know how to do it now yeah why does everyone look so worried what are you worried about there no it's in a different country it's fine we don't
have different countries next door like you do oh I see where we stashed the original door openers you just hucked them in here just in case he ever needs them yeah all of the crap from the projects was just in the back of loof's car which he never removed correct but maybe he will now that we have vastly improved it you see this I do this trunk panel yeah that's a trunk panel right complete garbage yeah so what we're going to do okay so this can go in here barely but then you see this hole rate
here yeah Sebastian just finished what's going there oh it's little LTDs it's the same pattern that's on the uh bomber jacket on the inside oh cool so that's going to be over the sub and it's going to be just filled with RGB it's going to be amazing oh my god let's talk car audio and how to make your car sound extra sick the first thing you have to do is just completely blow apart your interior that is mandatory but the second thing that you can do and that doesn't require a large investment is to
put in sound ending this stuff right here is fantastic and even if you don't want to be removing your speakers and stuff like that sound ending in your car will make a very noticeable difference the next step is get power we are going to have all of our amplifiers in the rear of the car which means that we need power in the rear of the car this right here is some 4 gauge wire from New Concepts they sent over all of our RCA cables Terminals and all of that stuff just make sure to do your math because
if you don't have the right size wires they will set on fire there's really easy Guides Online on how to do that so just look it up don't bring your car to the ground speaking of not lighting your car on fire make sure to have fuses right beside the battery this right here is 100 amp one from New Concepts as well and this cable is running through the firewall and will eventually be attached to the battery once that is actually inside of the car next you need the audio signal from your head unit we were
able to run RCA cables up here because we have an aftermarket head unit but if you want to maintain your factory oem1 you might have to use something like the lc2i this will convert your speaker outputs into usable low-level stuff on the RCA that you can throw in the back of your trunk also make sure to get the pro model I have the normal one right here took it out of my car sounds way better with the pro the signal coming from the front is going to be going into our DSP right here this is the mini DSP
8x12 DL this is really the star of the show there's absolutely no way to make a car a good Listening Room like think about it like in a home theater you can add sound eny you can move around your speakers in a car that is just not possible you need Windows which are hard and they are very reflective for sound so we're going to try and compensate for that by using room correction software it can do second order impulse filter ing what that means I don't know but I can make the computer make this make it
sound incredible in there everything's going be in Phase it's going to sound sick from the DSP we go into our amps we're going to be running what's called a fully active setup which means that we do the crossovers in the DSP that is going from like the woofer in your door to the Tweeter up top normally you'd have a little box that takes care of that but instead we are doing that with computers that also means that we need a dedicated channel on the amp for each individual speaker which is why we have
big amp for the fronts and the sub and little amp for the rears because frankly they don't really matter don't upgrade your rear speakers we're going to because Pioneer sent over stuff but you don't need to it's really fun to hold this oh yeah wow that felt lovely uh-huh do you want to pause there for a sec uh yeah hey Mar you want to come back here great timing Alex nice hat feels great that's good that's going to give you lots of protection from the Canadian sunshine are we leaving it up no we need
to take it off because we have a wing to put on have you seen this do you this this at all no I want to see it the guys over at aerofab they make custom VW spoilers and stuff for the most part they don't do Hondas but here we have  stuck we went bought another trunk lid because they're super cheap and it's way easier to 3D scan with it off do you want to do it's made for this car specifically it's made specifically for this car oh that's so cool can I open it yeah let go oh my God what the hell is this this
better be for a Porsche no this is for a Civic that's really lot oh yeah it's carbon fiber a nice way to tell if a Wing's legit is if it has an actual Arrow foil shape to it so if you look here it legitimately looks like a planes Wing oh my God this is huge put it on yeah go all right have fun Jake oh bloody hell I'm going to put it on backwards you have instructions just follow them it's not that hard Jesus Christ actually it is pretty hard I looked at them it's this is like a race
car part it's not the most simplest naturally a wing of this magnitude magnificence one might even say needs to be mounted pretty securely I was kind of worried about it but they actually kind of reused the stock mounting points for the trunk which is great but this bracket it doesn't sit on top and bolt through up here it needs to go through the entire trunk kind of like that I'm going to have to do a lot of cutting I think this is going to be noisy oh there's nothing in
there why why am I doing all of this hello you're not going to hear it not going to hear it at all sorry Alex hello Jake oh was it muffled no not really sometimes cars fight back a little bit they don't want to be modified it's starting to fight us just a little bit now it knows it's nearly time to start it our customs agent took the day off so uh we just traveled 3 hours but look at this' got a Brian we've got a K24 in the  yeah yes you did it the cas swap can  So the plan is our engine has arrived we
going to get that into that we can't do that without these things which Brian happens to make these are the mounts we make on our CNC at work and this is the kit for this particular Engine with this particular transmission so this unlocks being able to put that engine into that car which never was supposed to be in here this bolts on like that we lift it in we drop it in we mount it up and   working this is exciting bit that engine is not supposed to be in there and it's
going to make this car so much better so  faster this is an electronic throttle body in a car this age you've normally got a cable but we are going to upgrade to an electronic throttle body that means you've got a pedal inside the car that sends a signal to the ECU to the htech in this case and then the htech sends the signal here and tells this how far to open now why you want to do that you get a smooth idle you also get the option of cruise control and it all happens in that yet unit which bolts
onto our intake manifold speaking of cruise control if we're adding all of that new stuff we need some way to control it which is why we have this nice little keypad here we made up a little aluminum piece that we're going to just epoxy onto the stock thing and we also have the controller for our DSP for the sound so all that goes in there it's going to be beautiful so L us we're about halfway through what do you think I am honestly blown away like hearing you talk about how the throttle is no
longer cable controlled like now it's all electronic and we can like add cruise control to it and I saw you guys goofing around with the RGB controller over there and you're putting underglow on it which by the way is not legal here it's legal to park right you just can't drive with it sure this wasn't even in the country this morning this barely fits dude well just we're going to have to cut the Bonnet a bit cuz it's going to hit here are you kidding me to cut bits out of the Bonnet but this engine
in like this fixes everything that was ever wrong with this car the gearbox is in the special mounts are in to hold W those M mounts look beautiful that is some gorgeous Machining work Brian made him and brought them up and so have a look inside it's all starting to come together in there although it's also looks a bit messy no way you guys this oh am I allowed to no you're good you're good that's actually the first time it's been used it just got put in I don't know if I'm going to like you know
break anything or whatever right but like wait oh yeah obviously you'll put in a clutch pedal I suppose well yeah we kind of haven't done that yet but it's like we call this we call this forbidden spaghetti over there like that wiring but all that will be gone and it will look a bit neater dude this is so stupid and it still functions you can remove it and you can use it as a screwdriver still fully functional that's fun oh cool never be bored in traffic ever again original
rocker cover awesome Red Rocker cover with red wrinkle paint H so good hey look at that that is beautiful it looks mostly yeah it goes the other way doesn't it you know what listen here you two yeah that mostly mint oh I can't wait for this to leak down right onto the audio that I'm putting in right now yeah now that we have power for our speakers we need to physically put them in for the fronts we just made up these little adapters we 3D printed it out and once we put the
speaker in we're going to be adding in these fast Rings this is just some foam that goes around your speaker so that it mates up properly to the door because if you have any gaps there the audio can interfere with itself and it's a bad time for our tweeters we got a little bit fancy we took our a pillars out 3D scanned it you can see our targets right here and then made a little jig that is going to mount them just really nice and great something like that now I just need to spend the next now I just need
to spend the next several hours wiring everything up it's going to be not very fun but as long as you're methodical and do things like marking down where all  her oh my God bit of a Moment of Truth here does the wing smash the rear window let's find out mother oh dude actually oh no way is it going to clear you got lots of space dude no way oh my God it doesn't it doesn't hit of course once again huge shout out to the ridge for sponsoring this as you can tell we have spent many
a dollar on all of this and without them none of it would have happened this has been awesome so thank you guys let's get these banners on we've got our Wheels here from super speed they're a Canadian company and these are flow formed which means they're both light and kind of cheap we also got Michelin Pilot Sport all seon fours which is fantastic because for one great tires for this weather and two I just like having Michelin all of my friends back home were employed by them I actually could
not show my face back home if uh we put something else on it and they look so good we've also got a tire pressure monitoring system so these little remote things they screw into the valve stem here and then that will communicate back to our engine computer and to our Dash so be able to see if our tire pressure goes up or down we can set alarms and also log it if you're racing you could see your tire pressures as you go in the track so we just unscrew this we install these on each tire and we put them on
the car and the bronze it's going to look sick it's going to look so good all right we are 4 minutes until our wheel alignment we still haven't started it but we're going to get it in the air push it out the door turn the key and  works it's alive sounds good kind of first drive let's go get a wheel alignment where we go works it the alignment's not great the scrubbing you can hear is the wheels like fighting each other but we're going to go straight to the alignment shop get
that sorted out and then hit the dyno the radiator is like stone cold at the top but there's a lot of heat in the engine and that's why sensor is like telling us the engine's hot cuz it's not actually using the radiator properly there's like an air lock stopping it from cycling I'm sure you guys with water cooled PCS know exactly what this is about off upside down all right so we spoke to Brad and we spoke to Patrick the guys are fans of blus and mighty carod so they promised
to smash it out before lunchtime so we're on we're on a good thing and hopefully we'll make our Dino  booking are you excited yes yeah hey my hands are cold okay know we're here at stratified Automotive they're going to dyo it originally it made 89 horsepower which means we need 178 to double head 170s I reckon comfortably in the 170s maybe even higher I won in the 190s it's been it's been a busy couple of days but  it's so loud my God Honda VTEC mate woo  going you're close  man
177 ah so close 177 horsepower we need one more to double it one more horsepower to double it we got to make I can do it oh yeah we need one more horsepower to double the power one just one we need 178   no you look no no we're good I think  good yes we did it yeah there we go excellent work success we made the power we did it 180 horsepower and is confirmed that the lights will come on when they hit VTEC if you want it this thing is hilarious oh my God so uh it's a bit loud right I thought that's what
you people like uh there's loud there's yeah there's loud and then there's lock all right interrupt the shoot every time  loud oh my God nice huh massive 4-in exhaust okay okay okay okay Jee it also doesn't knock anymore no look if your whole thing was that when you rev your car you want to draw a crowd um is this carbon fiber act it's nice this is real carbon fiber this is real carbon fiber this is probably worth more than the car oh for sure about twice this is a one of one custom made just
for this you can log into your ECU that's controlling the whole car via Wi-Fi on an app or your laptop tune it from outside the car if you want to increase horsepower decrease horsepower do a whole bunch of things there's a couple other little surprises in there that that all runs but it's like the all that that runs the car is absolutely worth multiple times the value of the car did we figure out the multiplier total yeah no we probably should I have to think about it it's a
lot though yeah it's a lot no idea no clue you're not really supposed to think about that stuff when you do cars now I don't know anything about car engines and what they're supposed to look like but what I do know is what it used to look like the mounting kit works great it sits in a really good spot aside from that you don't have to change that much other stuff nothing else really been cut up and like that motor is huge for this car 2.4 L used to be 1.7 big intake like
powerwise we've we're over double yeah the inside looks a little different since we last saw it yeah this is amazing I don't even know what all these buttons do okay cabin lights I fig oh no no no that's that's the party lights we go oh my God inside and outside and they respond so Honda's engines have this thing called VTEC right basically it happens because unicorns fart rainbows and they fart that's what happens when VCH comes on so the car now rainbows when it's on VTE uh We've also got
cruise control which it never had which is cool bring it to the future we have traction control it's page up do I mean I know what it does on a computer in cars it's page up for power with a htech page up for power so you can you can make it faster if you want to I can't think of any modern car feature that like I'm missing here anymore like there's luxury feature shirt heated seats or whatever right I can't think of anything that's missing yeah well we've we have brought into the
future I mean you got power steering cruise control you got all the kind of those good things he peeking he's peeking I'm not I've been waiting like 15 minutes I would have peaked already Sammy told me to tell you to just keep rolling for float plan there's C and D plans too it's fine this is still plan a c and d means cease and desist here I remember when this was first suggested it was like the summer okay I'm just walking forward I don't think you need to do that what
this oh my God Ridge sponsor that's what this happened I think there's more new stuff on it than original stuff that makes a lot of sense this is what matters though yeah I kind of think yeah this is the bit that matters I've heard bits and Pie throughout the so went from 1.7 L single overhead cam to a 2.4 L what we start with 89 horsepower something9 yeah so now it's going exactly double that come on around this is super cool this is great oh my God there's a spoiler you guys spoil
"I bought this uh for like 1,500 bucks" like three years ago and I told myself I'll drive it till it dies or three years whatever comes first and then I just didn't get rid of it yet cuz it's amazing holy what oh my God it looks so clean there's a little access panel if you want to look down in there Alex holy Alex has spent over a week on this with some of the other guys like getting this to work I believe oh man you can control everything you plug in a laptop you can f tune it I'll be I'll be a guy with a
laptop and oh you'll need two laptops one for the engine one for these on the out side we got 17in wheels there's new Wheels in we've got Michelin Pilot All Season ties brand new my God we got a big brake K you used to have drum brakes on the back now you got discs all around plus a huge break upgrade on the front big ones this big um so all new Co you've got coilovers suspension as well fully adjustable it needs a bit of tweaking what have you guys done like no we did everything seats I think there
was just word they keep throwing called scope they're like oh what about the scope I'm I don't actually know what scope means so I'm just like yeah we're just going to do everything I hope you enjoy it this is thanks for having us oh my God thank you for this is very fun for us I hope you're still driving it any year time and you can report back yeah it's even better and Alex did say he's happy to turbocharge it for you if you find it's not making enough power oh yeah if it's not enough you want to go
for triple or quadruple oh my God you   she's fine it's a week later and we have been hard at work just tidying everything up it has a proper alignment now it could be a little bit higher but it does look sick as is the exhaust has a catalytic converter and a resonator so Captain Planet is happy and pl's no pl's neighbors are still not very happy but it's better at least the sound system also rocks we went from a frequency roll off about 70 HZ which is like high base to 45 htz which is a massive Improvement
it sounds really good in there there's one final thing that we have to do plof has not yet hit VTEC all right plof we fixed a lot of stuff all right it turns out that we  before yeah I can feel it  wow oh my god do I ever get it now there's just one thing left and that's for you guys to go and check out the ridge like we said before there is no way we could have afforded to make this video without their help they are absolute Legends and they are the reason that all of this happened we have a
bunch of new friends you should also go and check out their channels Mighty Car Mods VTech Academy and stratified all are going to have videos on this the amount of work that went to it is in insane go check them out and check out the ridge down below I can't wait to watch this video and see pl's reaction in the meantime I think I need to go do W show but uh was an absolute pleasure actually all of you guys uh thank you very much you guys absolutely incredible to meet you all and this is mindblowing
considering what you guys did in such a short amount of time this is like a whole new car which was our goal when we set out to modernize this thing this is about as modernized as you're going to get an old Civic absolutely incredible pretty cool thanks for having us it was fun
