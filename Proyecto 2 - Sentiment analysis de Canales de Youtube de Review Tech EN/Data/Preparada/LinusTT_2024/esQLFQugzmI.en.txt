I've seen a lot of weird controllers but this really it even animates yeah I have got to stop using eBay to treat my insomnia oh oh I look really dumb but if I'm a   dumb I can't believe I did that in front of my sponsor Ridge claims that their luggage can keep your clothes dry in even the stormiest of situations the only catch is you kind  first the future is at hand 6Â° of motion control what what is this this is the power of five controller from essential reality from 2002 caution choking hazard
Six Degrees of tracking ensures realistic movement the first widely available virtual 3D controller that offers total intuitive interaction this is the sensor yeah well this you really can use it anywhere this thing was in almost brand new condition how much should we pay for this well you want to guess it came with two games plus a demo I'm I'm going to say it was $90 when it was new and we paid $250 it was $149 new we paid 30 wow comfortable who would want a regular mouse and keyboard if they can

complete piece of or like oh okay that's why I said don't use this one how are you supposed to do any of this object I can't even get through the tutorial Mission what is happening right now use your intuition b b see oh hey change the view nice I can't turn you're turn tur look at the wheel no I'm trying to turn right oh no it doesn't do that try turning with your hand what oh oh oh okay so that's how I control the camera and that's the wheels who the hell thought this was a good idea I can only twist so

controller I really hope this is the worst one bowling There You Go sir no way yeah man more realistic gameplay better accuracy everything you need to take bowling to the next level good gravy it's an entire we controller look at that it's got a it's got a stretched out round d-pad on it it or wait you're going to need this oh no what you actually have to put the controller inside it it's not even a controller no so when they advertise it as having wi motion plus they just mean
it supports it you can put a wi Motion Plus weote inside it yeah even though holding and bowling the ball is so lifelike to the actual sport never ever release the ball thanks CTA digital this is from 2009 MSRP was 25 bucks what do you think we paid for it 25 bucks 20 yeah oh my God so you you really do just put a wi mode in it that's it that's it that's all it's just so convenient I'm going to suggest you put the wrist strap on I guess I look most like that one I made the special for you a thank you
best of five overtaken on Matt with a  go oh yeah buddy still got my  oops my wrist hates me right now like absolutely hates me it's still better than the glove though come on that's TRUE all right let's Bowl enough of this I sincerely doubt that this is going to  experience wow nice throw maybe it works after all that could have been a fluke try it  ball we're going to curve this  way can I nail this 46 split nope no no no no chance how dare you doubt my wee bowling prowess balls no it's too much it's too
much that was good yeah yeah yeah yeah all right here we go turkey in the final  watching boom  go here it is Jordan oh oh come on oh denied okay legitimately kind of cool accessory for 25 bucks all right 20 20 bucks yeah yeah all all right I am surprised at how at least not damaging to the gameplay experience it was that's a very generous way to put that the warnings about this thing are for real no joke though guys with the controller in it like like she's got some   this is the Namco neon H
1995 is there a particular game that it's designed for it is designed for racing games primarily as a steering mechanism interesting patents pending wait what is this button layout are we on a PlayStation we are on a PlayStation I don't understand it's an alternate layout one 12 a start yep this is this is a licensed PlayStation product they got the logo on it yeah man oh wow these are the longest travel face buttons I think I have ever seen look at that look at that travel it even goes
within the housing analog shut up these are analog analog throttle and break these are analog this is analog this is not for some reason and then this obviously is oh okay this one I'm legitimately excited for it might suck I can't tell you how much it cost unfortunately you can't tell me how much it cost not MSRP oh couldn't find it interesting if you know leave a comment let us know it ended up there's about 100 games that supported it mostly racing games obviously so like your grter is M like
everybody supported it and they even like have special art for it in the menus and everything like if you go into the config go into your options here key config noes it's a little preview how cool is that all right give her Ridge Racer Revolution right oh oh hi oh you're in do it what does p have  know we will actually have game sense captured you know this is not very good uh try leaving one hand still and just moving the other one uh and move less than you think you might need to
okay that's a little better now it reminds me of operating an RC car kind of yeah yeah with the little sideways um uh steering wheel you know what I'm talking about yep I totally do no no no no no no no okay I'm I got this i got this two right behind you no shoot ah I keep going the opposite way some that's funny it's the same thing Glen was doing also this is a lot of strain to keep this accelerator pushed down a little bit yeah yeah it's not good it's it's bad it's really bad it's too analog yeah
blue shell blue shell wrong game no you get F I'm going to be top five breaking hard oh shoot it broke too hard top seven wow these breaks though incredible technology they had back in 2002 or whatever uh 95 it's older than Elijah so was this launch year this thing came out launch year or the year after it was really quick wow all right this seems like a late in the cycle accessory you know they made three versions of it actually this is the first one really there's a second version which is a little bit
more refined uh a little bit less travel on the controls and the third version only came out in Japan top five baby I don't see a top five anywhere I mean I was in fifth okay um what do you think of it I can see if you kind of got used to it yeah but the dead zone is pretty big it's heavy think back to what your Alternatives would have been back then I mean this would have absolutely crushed anything that du shock yeah no dual shock there was no you had a d-pad and buttons yeah this would have crushed a
d-pad and buttons at the time though like you actually have some finess to the control I think this one's pretty cool  yes you seem confused I'm super confused it's something to do with is it a train yeah no it isn't don't lie it's for operating a train yeah no way what is this game it's a denta to go or denta to go sorry this is train simulator before train simulator yep oh wait how much did we pay for that Namco one uh we paid what do you want to guess uh I'm going to say that's somewhat
collectible 100 bucks 55 bucks okay there's actually tons of them out there all between like 40 and 60 all right uh okay Tio got start and select that's an improvement over the Namco controller ABC and we're missing a button here so that's not very PlayStation of you this I assume is a throttle and this I assume is some kind of gear thing you're pretty close this is your throttle oh this is your brake is this my cup holder that is for your stop watch no way it comes with an adorable no we made that oh but
you're supposed to put a stopwatch that's what it's for it's for no way ah so cool wait do we have a props Department where'd this come from I made it oh that's cute thanks okay start uh just do the top thing yeah no I want to do material Hall of train all right so basically each of these games there's a series of the these uhhuh and they'll each one will be three or four different train routes in Japan the most recent one came out in 2020 really and they've had special
controllers for like every platform you can name basically so do the first one I would say no you're going to lose no matter what so like okay so the goal is yes you need to stop your train within 30 cm of the target line within a half a second of when you're supposed to get there that's the easy mode okay so your speed's here you have your starting station you're going to pass through a station and your stopping station okay you want to pass through that station at 5740 and once the green light comes on
on the side here you'll turn off your brake and put on the throttle okay uh should we reload it we should probably reload that I mean this is pretty funny but hey it's working I think where we left off you were explaining the different levels of breaking and calling out today's LTT store shout out classic shirts nice back in stock LTT store.com you can release your brake now that's okay all the way off and now you can go all right so that I'm going I'm going I'm going so you have obviously 1.7 km
to your next uh station yeah you're not going to stop at that station though okay you're going to have to Blow Your Horn when you go through it that's the C button okay sure uh your speed limit is 55 right now oh okay you're good you're doing 49 yeah yeah yeah yeah no but yeah oh jeez okay I found like going and Coast kind of toy well I got this i got this but wait I got to go past it at 92325 that's when you're trying to go past that station okay oh shoot down oh shoot shoot shoot shoot oh shoot I'm
screwed I'm not going to make it you'll be okay you'll be okay no no Full Speed Ahead you got this here we go kicking the nitrous I got 15 seconds to get there oh we're going now boys I think it'll be okay cuz this is a station you're just going to blow through CH so you should be okay  beautiful um oh ball so I'm late going through there yeah you you'll make up the time cuz you're going real fast right now okay okay I got to blow the horn hit the horn yeah man did I die oh yeah you died you
were too late to blow the horn no to get through the station it looks like oh you can be within like 15 seconds 15 seconds late I'm dead yeah you've been fired oh my God continue okay I can do this this time and is there a benefit to gearing up no you know like being in first no no oh just go for it the tutorial even says just go to Five 54 km an hour it'll bump up to like 80 yep what's up it up oh it's 80 now Crank It Up oh I didn't notice that before and then it'll go
away entirely after that okay that's why it took so long for me to yeah okay so now I all right I've seen recommends like 80 to 90 is kind of your top okay I got this okay we are totally going to make it we're preparing you for your second career as a Japanese training conductor oh we're going to nail it we're going to nail it we're speeding up a little bit beautiful oh yeah okay all right so now you got a kilometer to your next station oh jeez I got to go pretty fast dude yeah man no
80 to 90 is not the right speed here I don't think they're not messing around whoa whoa wo there's a speed limit 90 speed limit 90 balls break a little bit not crazy though okay you're good you're good this is dude this is really really stressful this is serious business man they're not they're not kiding around he's not a game brother no no this is life holy I've got 10 seconds I'm not going to make it you got it only a couple hundred meters it's right there oh but I got a break hit the
horn oh we're still going yeah yeah yeah horn horn horn until that becomes the symbol for stop you don't have to stop Jus okay I'll know it when I see it okay just keep going just keep going we're flying boys we're fly 90 slow it down whoa whoa whoa w g creepers creepers okay level three breaking level three breaking more slower more slower I'm working on it oh you lost dang it so what do you think this is a really stressful game this isn't Fun is it better than the glove though well yeah
it's way better than the glove so if you had to pick one of these controllers to bring home what's it going to be oh hands down this guy right here all right this is cool that one's awesome super cool and which one should be buried in the desert with ET oh I think you all know the answer to that in fact I'm going to give it a personal Head Start good riddens to bad rubbish see you later buddy hey Dennis where you going it's the middle of the day get back here so we could segue to
