our editor Emily just picked up this sick camper van but she's got one small problem not a single gaming PC in sight but fear not for DJI have sponsored our effort to transform her mobile grass touching machine into the greatest RGB ified rage tracing Corner camping camper van that has ever existed of course it's not going to be easy you see computers constantly get destroyed in transit and the PCS here are going to be permanently in transit meaning we're going to have
to get very creative if we want to build a setup that is still going to work after thousands of kilometers down only sometimes paved Canadian logging roads like any self-respecting gamer couple Emily and hero expect to be able to play at the same time which means that our systems are going to have to be extremely efficient without putting out too much heat given the relative space constraints which by the way aside from power and heat space is clearly at a premium Now an obvious solution to this would be to
use laptops but come on guys this is lonus Tech tips damn it so we're going to need some full fat PCS and maybe a projector setup for some casual moving watching huh yes our original plan was to take advantage of both of these chairs right here so they can just swivel around we've got a table right here and it should be very great for space only problem is not only does this one kind of struggle with clearance issues both with this table arm mount and the door but if I
could get it turned all the way around I would have nowhere to put my feet other than here because of the fridge that's under this bench moving that not the easiest but that's no problem we've got lots of Gaming Chairs kicking around we're just going to put one of these in here and uh I think I have a better idea when we first looked at this this bed was just a bed but now it  is come on also a couch now all we need is a table hey look at that now we just need somewhere to put the PCS okay now my
understanding is you guys have actually designed something in solid works right yes can we take a look y very cool so what I'm looking at is intakes on the front two machines side by side almost desk PC like and then we've got what appears to be some kind of vent or shroud at the back that's for the power supplies and on the bottom we have vibration dampers do you know what the best part is though W it'll be all locked up right in here and here it is that looks great did we
do that on the Avid CNC oh yeah looks beautiful all right all we got to do is put some computers on it divide and conquer you do one I do the other I can't believe the kind of Hardware we went with for these we're going 7800 x3ds we're talking eight of the fastest gaming cores on the planet we've got these super cute mini ITX b650 boards from ASRock speaking of do these have EDP out is that what I'm looking at on the back here Graphics output one HDMI one EDP that is so cool so you can output to
like a like a laptop monitor that doesn't have its own built-in scaler just go straight to it also got an m.2 slot back here for a total of two we've gone with 32 gigs of Corsair Vengeance DDR 56000 which has probably got you guys thinking gee lonus that's a pretty normal gaming PC so far what exactly is it that makes this thing camping ah well aside from going with the 3D vcash version of our ryzen 7 CPU which is lower TDP and is therefore going to consume less power and kick out
less heat we've also gone with this Cooler Master 1100 wat 80 plus Platinum power supply small and efficient and we've gone with okay I know it's controversial but an RTX 4060 TI is it the best bang for the buck no but is it the best efficiency for the buck if not as close it's efficient it's very close let's not put in the buck bit hold on a second Alex you told me to mount my IO facing this way but you mounted your I/O facing the other way well the gpus have to go here and here
that makes sense reasons here's an idea I found some 632 thumb screws and we could kind of go his and hers with it now it's time for our GPU but I have to assume the the fans go up right correct good so how is that going to work cuz the slots like that so if you look at these holes they correspond to the ones in our back plate ooh so it's getting hard mounted straight to this not going anywhere it was actually super easy to do this we used our 3D scanner to just 3D scan this
boom Chuck and solid work done thank you wine scan wait you're screwing right into the cooler of the GPU through the back plate yes what about the pcie Riser oh it goes through here yeah so it goes up down around and then in I'd ask if you have a better idea but it's way too late for that uh maybe not the spring loaded boy I think those ones are fine but the ones in the center around the die we are not touching you're stressing me out Alex you do realize why are you stressed because you are stressing me
out I'm sorry was I not explicit enough this is a Flawless plan that we're going to execute flawlessly just like that line you hear that little GPU you're about to get excluded are these washers just to stack up so they're not too long what no I don't think you know what you're doing how are we supposed to screw these in oh and you didn't do the thermal pad oh right sorry my bad that's the problem the thermal pad is not really serving a thermal purpose it's more just an anti vibration pad not that
it really matters in this case I do have to say I am incredibly impressed by how well this lines up what I've only got two hands well it's not going anywhere and like I've seen so many times like this is attached to a bracket and this is attached to something else and next thing you know your gpus on the side of the road out of the FedEx truck sure yeah anyway not going to happen here I have to tape my pcie extension we're going to be taping kind of all of our cables we don't want over a long
amount of time the vibrations of the truck rubbing that thing against this that goes a little something like that there we go do we want to test it here or do we want to just throw it in the van and hope for the best oh we throw it in the van we hope for the best all right let's do that okay I can see why the futon conversion doesn't go that smoothly this hole looks like they cut it with their teeth you know Emily there's a such thing as a as a ruler look at this cool power supply
bracket this is awesome how is this made is this just 3D printed yeah just 3D printed 2200 watts in what is I mean basically about the size of a regular ATX power supply oh God this is really cramped dude go left a bit yeah I see that power switches okay all right I I got you I got you okay well we've got dual 120 mm aiio from Corsair chalk full of RGB this is going to look sick it's going to look ridiculous y sick ridiculous wait I noticed Emily inherited more things that were supposed
to be from my minivan these expensive cables that Alex ordered these are trippy I asked for more of those for your Minivan and you're like I don't need them oh display port USB and then their USBC on the other side kind of thing super cool so it allows you to run a USBC so like a display port alt mode display off of a regular display port GPU so we're going to have just one cable going to our monitors it's awesome my badminton grip wrapping skills are coming in handy here we really could
have done this more easily I don't know about you guys but I think this is going great same LT where Jank meets you know that's kind of awesome not bad now all we got to do is St it down I guess before we do that uhhuh should we put on the coolers and just like make sure it works sure why are aios a good idea in a space like this they're an okay idea in this space you can definitely get more cooling for the amount of height that we've got above the CPU socket here right like you can
see if this was down flat in order for us to have our countertop on top of it we've only got about this 120 mm fan which you might think okay means well sure you could have a 120 mm cooler but not really right cuz you got to have heat pipes and stuff sticking out of there so this allows us to get way more cooling surface area on the CPU socket than we could otherwise have there's that but also vibrations was a really big consideration uh how do we power this I noticed that this extension
cable does not do anything do you remember who our sponsor is yeah DJI ji so see oh Lordy I do see them be some lead acid batteries suckers inverter solar charger all of that junk we are going to leave it cuz some of the systems we just want to know for sure will just run and not be our fault if they stop working but this will power the computers this will be like the computers the RGB all of the fun stuff coming off of this cool so we can just turn it on then I assume yeah all right
let's let's try and fire them up oh that looks flipping awesome this is sick so legit what is a Zen screen this isn't gaming is it it isn't "technically gaming but also it's, 1600p" and 120 HZ so might as well be gaming so it's a portable monitor yep right but also you've got a stand for it yep and that's just like a/ quarter inch so you could kind of Mount this on anything yeah very cool wow okay cool it's got inputs on both sides that's legitimately really handy for a portable monitor I mean you know how
display port is it probably won't work so I'm going to reboot it just in case just just hold on just hold on it's going to work it looked like it Wasing way it's going to work if what we were trying to do was get the screen to restart over and over again hey mission accomplished wow that looks great yeah and we hot glued down the spacers so that we don't have to worry about them moving around as we put all the stuff in I guess we figured out the GPU priority output issue do you want to
know what the problem was bio setting someone didn't put the pcie riser in all  way you built that one no you built that one no you built that one oh look I definitely that's my Tesa tape job right there on this side no I built that one no I built this one right here this is without a doubt my Riser uhoh I may not have a counter to that oh yeah no this is definitely mine you didn't take off your peel yeah okay yep yep yep yep yep yep yep yep easy fix yeah that's great I've been tasked with
extending the length of the power button lead on one of the systems cuz right now he no reach um but rather than going and finding exactly these colors of wires in this gauge I found a dead power supply so I'm going to hack it together y ha all right we're good we have two computers and they both work I shouldn't have given him this side quest we have a lot of actually important things to do in that van I'm having fun not my finest work but realistically if Alex wanted my finest
work he wouldn't ask me on a Friday we are now roughly like 40% through the time that we have with lonus and we have gotten this you say that like it's a bad thing I'm having fun yeah I'm having fun can we finally have the fun of looking at the projector yeah sure that sounds great heck yeah we can't do it anywhere than this bed mechanism so I think we got this yeah look you can look at our mechanism oh yeah yeah that's suitably adequate oh oh where's it go that's why there's a leg hey oh how how
you how you doing oh oh oh hey that's pretty no way yeah we used the magnetic cable management and look how solid that is that is freaking awesome that's oh man I love it okay so this is gaming desk land [Applause] slash whoa that is not secured to anything I guess this is what we're doing yes nice ooh this is cute this is that little Ben Q projector right yeah 1080p small Auto Keystone autofocus and I love this 3D printed mount for it did you guys use the 3D scanner for this
again we did it's like perfect though yeah it has no right to be this perfect so basically it's just going to go up here we bolt that in and we're g tog is this plugged into the DJI is it ready to power on yep oh hi yeah she's she's doing great she's doing great yeah it's uh it's not laser which is good but it is bright oo it comes with a little Streaming Stick so about that the first thing you have to do when you open this up is take the side off and just Jam the Streaming Stick inside of it and that's
how you get a smart projector please don't make me hold this while you log into Google oh yeah oh yeah bud oh yeah bud oh she's in there she's great hold on   on she's great like you were saying yeah yeah yeah that's what I was saying that was the demo I was doing it's it's  it's actually not that bad in a perfect world what you would do in a situation like this is you would either use an ultra short throw projector but we couldn't really do that cuz it would have to be here or what you would do is
you would use a mirror so you use a higher end projector you'd Bounce It Off the one side and then you we're not doing that so that's the size of their screen this is cool though because I guess the idea here is that when we want the gaming setups we just pop the monitor arm on onto it yeah and it just what uh locks into place somehow and there's a little screw the screw is kind of annoying perfect okay and then when we don't want it we just put the little cover on and I guess we would do that
whenever we want to fold the table up yeah so we just actually took the bottom of this stand yep and just screwed it in right there oh it's not the dumbest thing well that's the goal right yeah you don't want to build the dumbest thing unless that's what you set out to do that's on there and he adjusts oo PIV oh uh are you mangling it it doesn't pivot it does not pivot no but it tilts I mean anything pivots if you push it hard enough realistically 99% of the time they're probably just going to use
the little built-in flippy stand but hey at least we thought of this this is really starting to come together isn't it yeah it's not too bad is there a plan to keep this up here uh there's a couple of different things we could do so that's a long way of saying no yes these things are legitimately extremely flexible you can use them for on-site power which is obviously what we're doing with them but if you only need something like that very occasionally they can also operate in
UPS mode which is as simple as just plugging it in and leaving it plugged in with all of your devices running off of the DJI power 1000 in the event of a power outage it switches fast enough that even something like a connected computer won't experience a loss of power and it also has quiet charging and dual 140 W type c ports that can charge two 16-in MacBook Pros to 50% in just 30 minutes pretty cool so you're really not going to like the plan for mounting these we're just going to screw these
into the floor and then strap them down well I was planning on going into these 2x4s but uh okay so what we're doing this by hand then we probably should pre-drill it I hate you so much I don't hate you actually that's good I genuinely like you not right now is that secured that thing up there what thing that thing on the thing oh okay cool yeah if it falls it'll probably hurt okay no no I'll have my feet here to catch it how's it going two of these will run their gaming rigs for over 3
hours one of them will run their gaming rigs for about 2 and 1/2 hours really so 5 hours with two of them that's freaking awesome and in the future if they ever wanted to add like solar p PS on the roof of the van or something like that I know oh wait they have them already oh sick so they can charge these off solar during the day game all night correct that's the life baby all right awesome man I can't believe these take the place of these gigantic batteries all of this crap over here and it's all just
self-contained dang lithium you cool hey I remembered how they work go team well that's not going anywhere ah oh yeah butd sick man when you're not gaming you can run off these things for a long freaking time we've been using this to power everything in the van for the entire shoot and we're still at 51% do I need a special cable to daisy chain these things together no just that oh I oh wow so it really is as simple as just a standard C13 power connection on the one so you just plug that into the
charging port and then you just go to the AC out put on the other one yep oh all right well that's pretty simple then cool it's also super nice that these get charged just using a standard C13 cable some other battery Banks you have to use like a power brick and a special adapter and crap all that's integrated into this so just boom use this you're done before we get to tidying everything up to reveal to Emily we got to try out the passenger seat gaming setup though hold
on let me just see if I can ah get in here it's not really meant to be climbed into from the outside I don't think this is not bad do we have a mouse pad for this though we do oh yes the stealth mouse pad from LTD store.com if you don't like any unsightly branding this is the mouse pad for you it's the same high quality mouse pad you've come to know and love with absolutely no branding on it okay this oh oh it's oh it's quite adjustable oh that's not bad all right this is kind of an awesome little
display dude oh yeah like like it kind of rocks 1600p and 120 HZ pretty sick oh yeah we don't even have the top on it yet and it's really quiet that's pretty freaking good just putting some little finishing touches on it so it's nice and ready for the big reveal I'm just scared about [Laughter] trying he's so sketchy oh bud I'm I got lots of room room bud I got lots of room all right here we go this is scary yeah scary I don't know what it's going to be all right he made
it out that's fine it's not broken so we're good your gaming dream machine has pulled into the station come come come come come come come come come come come come first of all I would like you guys to notice that Alex is not just sitting backwards in the front seat go go go look he is gaming oh backwards in the front seat hell yeah oo all right okay that's pretty cool so far I like that what we got we got curtains you got curtains got a gaming Alex did you just say curtains because I think you mean
RGB look at the fans though those wait what look at the fan that's so cool wait that's awesome y it's so cool so there's two full PCS in here well what we're just going to put one no it just it looks cooler than I thought I thought it would look way more Jank than Alex are you going to take that are you going to sit there and take that like it's fair enough but wait there's more once we stash this away obviously you've got to be wondering where's the second system at well we don't want just one of you to
be able to game remember you guys talked about how this bed is also a futon yeah well now this bed is also a foo a desk that's sick let's go oh my God I'm going to have you guys try it okay so up here you're going to find your gaming peripherals did you guys notice the RGB the RGB is so much better than it was so you got to grab your USBC cable it's a one cable solution it does build power and display port to your monitor sick there you go love that it's on the side where is it nice and convenient let's
see some gamer  that's the Crosshair I got that thank you you you should see her play OverWatch no not everyone has played these two levels of Doom Eternal a thousand times like I have hell yeah pretty smooth though right this is running amazing and honestly this monitor is fantastic it's small but yeah another word for small is compact but wait there's more W this is you put a game in front of a gameer just sorry my brain cannot just zone out okay okay we've got another
trick that's awesome movie night okay so the projector is not Ultra short throw oh so don't be disappointed when it's not quite the whole size but look it's bigger than the screen you had before okay this is true this is true so you just open up this bad boy it's better than an iPad that's what we're up against we're up against an iPad would you believe that none of this is feigned these guys actually sight on scene just allowed us to do whatever to their van it was kind of scary it was very
scary this is fantastic like I would game on this this versus IAD ah okay big bezels but we didn't have a hydraulic press to put it in so there was no way to make it smaller of course you know you're not necessarily going to game when it's you know time to spend quality time on the couch watching a movie for sure so go ahead and shut her down and we can watch our favorite movie crab R the I'm actually so surprised by the speakers on that projector that's sick not too bad and when you don't want to
look at it boom there you go of course we haven't even shown you guys the best part yet under where you guys are sitting you now have up to 2200 watts of output the ability to tap into your existing solar system in order to charge them we didn't want to mess with what you kind of had here currently so that's something that you guys are going to kind of want to figure out in the future and simple just C13 plug-in charging whenever you guys are at home nice they're a little on the heavy side and
the mounting system for them is in there oh yeah there you but that's a lot of power you guys got sitting under here and what's great is they're pretty much exactly the same form factor as your existing batteries so if you guys ever decide to ditch these you can just put those right where those are and you can get all your storage space back cool that's really cool so cool oh is there an even bester part what is this this looks awesome what is this well you know you don't want just RGB fans right there
so someone can be like what the heck is that and go and steal your gaming computer so we have a privacy panel here you go oh oh my God's it what is this oh my gosh it's the what of course you had to bring the worst part about rocket leag you got your rocket League this is amazing we had to cut out the fans so we got some holes out of that and they were  coasters oh no no what no why you guys can game on these systems just off of battery for about 5 hours continuously although we found out
the RGB draws like close to 150 watts so maybe turn those off oh go RGB gaming massive thanks for real to DJI for sponsoring this Tech makeover by the way you can fast charge drones on it I don't know if you hit that talking point super cool we couldn't have done it without them if you guys enjoyed this video you might enjoy the time that we checked out a boat
