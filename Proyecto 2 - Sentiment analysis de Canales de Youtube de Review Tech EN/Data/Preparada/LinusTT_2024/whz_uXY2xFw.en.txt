Sheen's reputation is well established at this point they've made a multi-billion Dollar business out of selling clothing that looks good in a fake photo and then maybe after a wash or two but that is ultimately designed to end up in the landfill before the next big fad reaches critical mass what you probably didn't know is that you can buy computer parts there I'm not saying you should Sheen's business practices are as controversial as their clothing is bad and Sheen's price faing on
computer hardware makes wish.com look good I mean look at this AMD 5600 G CPU $185 us this gives Americans a taste of what it's like to be Canadian or Australian I mean guys if I could have gotten away with saying we bought this and just grabbing one from the warehouse I would have but so much of the experience of buying from these marketplaces is the packaging and the delivery so welcome to the all Sheen setup it's going to be dumb but even more importantly it's going to be filled
with surprises I have no idea what's in store for us all I see a soyo graphics card though that's a name I haven't seen in a long time you know who else I haven't seen in a long time our sponsor ODU their all-in-one business software can help you focus on running and improving your business instead of wasting time jumping between different apps click the link below or watch till the end of this video to learn more Shen "famously adds up to 10,000 new items to" their website every day and that doesn't
include their recent push into becoming a thirdparty e-commerce Marketplace by selling products they don't manufacture like this on the b550 plus ITX motherboard it has features like 2.5g network card that's pretty cool dual m.2 slots all English packaging and it can be equipped with Wi-Fi can be it's like a motherboard Loop box I didn't get Wi-Fi but what I did get is compatibility for my six core 12 thread 5600 G processor so I guess I'll call that good enough it's $140 140 bucks for this and if you buy
it from AliExpress it would have been $86 yeah that sounds more like it sorry I was just noticing how crooked some of these surface mount components are next up we've got this beautiful ddr4 16 gig  don't you ever talk about Kyle's mom like that again oh no I have so many questions here who is why is there a badminton player on the front of the box that is the most anime girl Ram that I have ever seen what is up with ram every single time we do a Marketplace build we find a new Ram brand that I have never
heard of before can you do me a favor I don't want to be the only one who gets  me all right it's going to be just me thanks Andy this kit is 3200 megat transfers per second which is just below the sweet spot for this generation of chip but when we saw how these looked we had to have them how much did we pay for these we paid $51 oo well they look cool but that is over 50% more than buying the exact same thing from AliExpress and still more expensive than buying a better product from a more reputable
brand on Amazon so we'll have some of that stuff linked below starting to sense a bit of a pattern here uh next up we've got our storage and this comes from someone you might not have heard from for a while Kodak okay it's not from Kodak the real Kodak went bankrupt and now they mostly just leased their branding to cheap e-way manufacturers but this this is definitely different this 120 gig X300 has got advertised blazing speeds of 500 megabytes per second wres 550 meab byes per second
reads oh my that's not blazing oh wow there's nothing on this PCB not only are there practically no nand chips I'm willing to bet money this does not have a dam cash look at this it's just it's just blank yeah I don't even think I care about the pricing of this one this is a strong d do not recommend dless drives can be okay these days but that's mostly applicable to the latest drives that support host memory buffer in order to use your system memory in that role this this is not one
of them in fact the packaging for this is an outright lie it says that it is PCI Express but in fact you can see it is keyed for SATA operation and as we saw from the maximum read and write speeds it's SATA it's not PCI Express at all oh my God it's so flimsy that if I just oh wow go like this it holds its shape for our next item we had to game the system a little just like Sheen allegedly games the system on import taxes am I right when we were ordering Sheen didn't have any cases for sale or
power supplies for that matter so we looked at their history and we found one that they had at some point that would work for us sounds fast meet the vetru m03 matx case it's got a mesh front a tempered glass side panel and it fits up to 8 120 mm fans and two 240 mil radiators oh I mean that's kind of impressive for its size I like the case for our power supply unfortunately we had no Sheen history to draw from so we grabbed this Sego te GM 750 W fully modular power supply off of
the to be tested very low priority shelf over at the lab you know that doesn't look like the official 80 plus gold badge you you can cross reference it right do you want to go on 80 plus and see if the GM 750 watt is actually 80 plus gold certified everything else on here looks pretty official they've got California warning everything causes cancer stickers and all that good stuff while we waitting for that let's take a look at our cooler is this even going to fit in
"here oh boy meet the johnb cr1 1,000 Evo" it is for your real needs not your fake ones which is why it has so much RGB on it I mean realistically it's probably fine jbow has a line of really good value cases that are honestly quite well manufactured so I'm sure this is going to be great just needs to fit oh yeah that'll be fine and look at that that's a pretty flat direct heat pipe contact base I've got high hopes for this one Higher hopes than I do for this thermal compound I mean the packaging leaves
nothing to be desired Lano thermal grease you know what you're getting wait these application instructions though I'm going to follow them get ready seal it after use and store in an airtight container to keep it from drying you're not going to reuse this grease wipe are you it's not like it's big or anything you know that's it I think it's onetime use is what I would say but I promised to follow all the instructions for this  David check this out this is great this is how they tell you to apply it what
you put it at the one end and then spread it over why why not at the center and spread it both ways because that's the Lano way any word on the power supply uh it is not on the 80 plus website so uh this is probably not true five bucks for the two things of thermal pce I mean that's a good deal at least assuming that it's anywhere near decent what did we pay for the cooler 30 bucks that seems it's $23 on AliExpress I want to shoot this before we get to the part in the script based
on this box lannis Intel AMD Nvidia Nvidia obviously you think so oh speaking of ripping off packaging Styles Corsair no made in China do we even have a brand for these Pap those are about 650 each M the packing picture is for reference only that's good cuz it doesn't look anything like this is it just me or those fins really uneven on the packaging oh my God they are they're not even close is this hand drawn look how wide this Gap is here and look how narrow this one is yeah I mean there's
lots of other problems here I mean this would seem to indicate that this is supposed to be RGB but I don't see a header oh you'll see some lights though are they one red one green and one blue one they were actually pretty nice looking you'll have to wait and see audience all right they were yeah they weren't too bad I guess I should actually build this computer at some point kind of fine looking build so far hey guys let's go ahead and throw this little fan filter on here throw our front back
on oh yeah now it's time for our GPU this is oh I see why you wanted to ask me what vendor makes it the radon RX 6600 m m oh my goodness I have so many questions the last time I saw the name soyo on a product they had recently exited the motherboard business but we still had some dead stock in the warehouse at NC so it was kind of a curiosity even back then I had no idea these guys still existed the most interesting thing about it is that this is a 6600m for mobile with 256 fewer stream processors and the
lower power limit we should expect about 10% less performance for more money be cool Sheen we're almost ready to fire this thing up now but we have a bit of a problem this does not close anymore I'm so confused I swear this closed before it definitely did it's not even close dude I don't know I just I popped it off like this and then I put it back on and he no fit that aside though this is a really clean looking build now all we need is some peripherals here's your monitor I see
another problem we faced is that Sheen doesn't sell full-sized gaming monitors but what they do have is quite the array of portable monitors like this 16-in relatch 1600p ooh 144 HZ display it's got two USBC ports a mini HDMI and a folding stand that we are going to replace oh with this arm yes uh how is this a monitor stand it's not it's a it's for iPads oh good I'm not gonna lie I'm kind of into this it's low profile it's lightweight easy to move around how's the price though
$22 ah okay not great I found the catch "but I mean hey, 1600p 144 Herz yeah for" $200 that seems like not unreasonable it's not  I love it I mean it holds it pretty good to their credit at least they include a crappy mini HDMI cable it's not really long enough to pick it down I have adapters you can okay it's just going to go here no David this is the all Sheen PC so we are using our parts from Sheen there beautiful there's your keyboard oh good the he gaming keyboard 61 Keys RGB
light mode type c wired keyboard ABS plastic and that's all the information we got hey yep well there's how it's wired up now we know that if this cost more than $18 we got ripped is $29 oh okay that's not as bad as I might have thought switch life 10 million times 10  0.1 uh and then Mouse this looks like a camel's toe which makes me a little uncomfortable thanks YH Consulting  favorite Mouse brand it's the m6 pink oh it's a bunny oh you didn't actually see that I thought it was just supposed to
be ergonomic or something oh no no no it's a bunny oh and it comes with stickers and here's your beautiful desk pad oh no Esports girl what the hell is Esports girl you guys will see it before I do I forgot what I ordered this is great wow the face on this Orca is a little oh w wow dude this keyboard is so light it weighs nothing oh man how did you manage to make such a small keyboard that flexes so very much that's actually impressive all right here we go it's time oh wow those fans look pretty good
they are not RGB hey they're exactly what I said but they look pretty okay they're red green and blue we paid way too much for it but it at least it looks pretty cool it was around $880 for the computer that is way too much money for the computer we got there's more isn't there let me show you the  that wow uh is this a is this supposed to be a webcam no it's security camera oh oh you know why it doesn't look good is we haven't turned on all the lights yet oh that makes oh oh oh good the security
part is where they can never spy on you because their camera is not good enough for anyone to see what the heck is going on I guess more light did not help before we take a closer look at this monstrosity that David has set up I just want to say before we shot this video I didn't realize how big of a deal Sheen really is in 22 one of every 25 women surveyed said that Shen was their primary source of clothing the next year Shen was the second most downloaded app in the US falling only
behind teamu and if the rumors are true and it gets listed on the public stock exchanges analysts predict that it would be worth more than H&amp;M and Zara combined but why do people buy from there if they know about the allegations well price thanks to stolen and AI generated designs and questionable labor practices they can offer their products at exceptionally low prices like this outfit David has handpicked for me oh boy langang Jang L black what is that it's a chain how much was this chain uh
like a dollar a dollar all the jewelry stuff is like exceptionally cheap I think the last time I saw a chain like this for a dollar like in a dollar store I was probably below 10 years old I probably should have let lonus unbox a septum ring septum ring what's a septum ring uh it's this oh why okay how much was this uh less than a dollar like oh oh you look so cool like a like a  bull I feel like an idiot this one is isn't quite meant to be worn it's a USB stick no way a guitar
USB stick why did you say it like that a guitar like Forest oh I see I see do you want this on your body or in your computer I genuinely kind of like it oh no you're falling for it oh crap why are you so determined to make me look like a douchebag Hey That's My Style it's okay these white Slack are  day how much was that these were 25 bucks oh that's not even that cheap is it this is not for cheap is that or Canan well $32 Canadian those look really cheap though they really crappy
like this material is not meant to be on pants like this is going to fall apart as soon as you put it on this shirt I mean there's no way that I need that many buttons thank you very much yeah okay put on the SL oh God oh God that it's like it's like pillowcase maybe that's actually exactly what it feels like is is a pillowcase the sizing for these is just medium whatever that means let's hope my waist and leg length is uh is medium enough I feel like those are a little too transparent we're all about
transparency here at lus Media Group well there's the pocket bag I found that for you and then uh finishing Cup oh my God there's more this was like $9 this was $9 that's too much for this check this out guys I leaned over to get my prompter remote and look what happens to the clothes can you hear that sound this is why when we build stuff for LTD store we move in the clothing cuz that's a thing that people do and we see refreshing our Styles infrequently as a feature not a bug check out the
extra comfy Dropout hoodie for example at LTD store.com no fast fashion here the second reason reason that people buy from Sheen is that it's a Slickers smarter wish.com with sophisticated AI algorithms and Tech that helps push exactly the kind of products that you probably want honestly speaking our shopping experience was as smooth as butter and the delivery was professional as well none of the silly reused boxes and packing materials that we saw with the all wish PC with that said when we
tried to check out while the product pages of Many Items indicated that they would ship to us we would get a popup during checkout that let us know the items would not ship to us and then we had some issues with our orders being cancelled due to fraud protection maybe our company name on the order scared them thankfully for the couple of items that we really wanted to see we were able to find the same product cheaper elsewhere like this bm800 microphone and streamer full setup she ended up saving
us like 15 bucks by sucking it comes with the shock mount the boom arm a pop filter cables and even a neat little interface that has real time monitoring of levels hello hello okay that's legitimately kind of cool it even wow it wait oh what it's an XLR mic but it comes with an XLR to 3 and half mil adapter I'm sure it sounds great though why don't we give it a try though do we have any headon we have beautiful flesh tone elf ear headphones we your wonderful I know I've talked to you about this before but
every time I see a product like this I think think with what I know about manufacturing and molding costs and minimum order quantities thousands of these must exist which means thousands of people must have bought elf ear inear headphones but really though who are you describe the comfort of Elf years they seem reasonably comfortable actually I'm actually a fan of over thee headphones so this seems you know right up my alley yeah I have the alier out yeah you're enjoying this too much David I
know I'm not supposed to okay that's a lot of background hiss oh wow this mic sounds like absolute ass Have you listened to it yet uh I only listened to it through the monitoring and it was yeah not not great oh this is my first time using this keyboard it is truly awful but it looks so cute it does look cute but it's awful um wow it's real RGB for that price though did you I'm pretty impressed with that normally you just have LEDs in a bunch of different color oh my goodness this
listening to myself through this microphone is horrible here we go record all right check check check check check check check check check check check check check test test test test I was hoping that turning down the levels would improve the recording quality a little bit but it's pretty clear that that's not going to happen wow even getting in close to it it just oh this sounds really bad before we game there's a couple things we haven't talked about yet what is this yeah I got
a couple of these uh Cloud kits that come with RGB light how much do you pay then for some cheap stuffing and an RGB string it's 17 bucks it's very overpriced uh I'm doing these Cloud things again in a different video but all separate parts uh and they're going to be many more and much cheaper oh no I didn't even notice the pedals for this wheel oh boy I noticed the batteries for these ring lights died already yeah that's uh pretty bad here we go boys how is the dead zone that big did
you have you used this I did it it it was very terrible how is this so bad is it even analog or is it just it might just be a digital yeah it might just be and it wasn't particularly cheap it was about 50 bucks no yeah let me oh my God this is unusable why do people manufacture this garbage I would be so much better off with even this keyboard what what what is oh my God it's an arm that just goes around you yeah and it's a not quite the size of a man torso so you know it's a muscle boy
torso what is the point of this how much is this it's for Comfort normally it would be in a chair we don't have a chair cuz I don't sell chairs on Sheen um but it's it's for um moral support you know okay everybody needs a buddy how much is my friend here uh it's $44 you get it for uh like 20 bucks on AliExpress though I thought you'd want to know that make you feel better time to play some Fashion Police Squad which I have never played it's pretty darn fun cool you know this mouse
is not nearly as bad as I expected we've had way worse joky Mouse before and the monitor too yeah fine yep no complaints yeah if I had to bring this traveling with me I'd be pretty satisfied yeah this computer is not very fast though it seems not fast enough for what's in it you would think it would be better yeah so when things are glowing you're going to have to right click that sucks the color out of those people uh but for these gray ones you need to shoot color on them cuz they're so boring oh yeah
they're boring oh yeah now they have tan  worst your frame rates are fine for a game that's not challenging at all yeah 130 like that's very playable but this is not a challenging game for a computer I got to say this system doesn't seem as Snappy as I might have expected it to be yeah I think the SSD is probably actually the biggest problem in here we're almost at the capacity and it's a crappy SS to begin with and so anytime things are going on and off of the SSD it just the whole system seizes and
power world will really give you a look at performance all right let's check out pal World W performance actually better than it was when I was playing it before yeah this is very playable it's not good time playable no but it's fine we're hovering around 30 to 40 we're not being Divas about it this is definitely playable nothing intense has happened right but still I think when the guns come out I have a feeling that 30 is going to be dude look at me my guns are already
out I can take him we're about to find out I just want to see what happens if he hits you once ah oh no oh you had more survivability than I expected that's fine I can take this one I don't think you who I don't think you can over the other one why they're going to fight each other oh that was a Pro Gamer move but I think that deer oh balls is there anything else for us to look at we have some beautiful aesthetic pieces we have this beautiful sunset lamp that I've seen advertised on every social media
ever turns out just like I expected it really sucks it's an RGB LED with a lens yeah it's like a slightly more powerful than what's on a strip LED how much was it it was about $6 okay that's realistically probably and this was about $35 and I love this one okay so that's the one thing you'd recommend oh 100% I might try and take this home wait I just figured out that this creepy awful camera is a light bulb ew is this for like Airbnb creeps yeah and like keeping an eye on your Nanny cuz you don't trust
her it's gross yeah good thing the quality sucks yeah I don't even think you'd be able to tell anything thing oh no my nanny is tearing in half in summary computer parts are computer parts and if they're there you can assemble them and you can get a functioning computer but you shouldn't the pricing sucks the selection sucks and you're supporting a company that engages in very questionable business practices so if you're not comfortable with any of that why not check out our
