My Neighbor's Pool is nasty rotting leaves and sediment all over the bottom a whole ecosystem of undiscovered microorganisms floating around beneath the surface entire plants stretching out and making themselves at home I think I might have seen a shark at the deep end but just as I was about to bravely dive in and Destroy another phone beatbot saved the day offering to sponsor this video to show off their aquisense Pro all-in-one smart pool cleaning robot thank goodness I promised my that with
this little guy's help we'd have the mess sorted out in no time of course that was before our pool contractor came and had a look at it and said sir you realize that there are roots on the plants growing out of this pool right it's a robot not a miracle worker but hey we're going to give it a crack at it maybe the miracle was inside  let's take a closer look at the aquisense pro before touching it comes with the risk of Colora comes with a quick start guide and user manual which
is uh chalk full of certifications including ip68 water resistance the robot itself which is full of fun little gadgets and tricks batbot says the aquasense pro is the world's first 5 in1 intelligent pool cleaning robot it'll do the floor the walls the waterline and surface cleaning plus optional water clarification with these little cartridges although you don't have to do that what you definitely will need or at least we will is this debris collection slot that helps it skim anything along
the surface and deposit it in the Dual layer basket right here as well and this one's really cool as this second debris collection slot that both sucks up debris from the bottom and helps the robot cling to the side of the pool as it uses its scrubby toilet brushes here sorry pool brushes scrubby pool brushes to clean the surface rounding out the accessory package we've got the charging dock this will go in your garage or in your pool house and it'll give the beatbot enough juice for anywhere from
two to three runs depending on whether it needs to go all the way down to the bottom and hang out down there or if it can just float around on the surface and last but not least the hooker sometimes stuff goes wrong and if you ever need to retrieve the bot this will be very helpful it's also good for fishing but enough chitchat it's time to take her for a test drive there is an app but you're not obligated to use it there's physical buttons on the front for bottom bottom and walls complete
clean and Eco clean as well as a power button now taking bets what's going to clog up first the basket or the propulsion Jets I'm going to say propulsion Jets all right then I'm going to do a floor clean cuz it'll be using the Treads all right you cheater cheating is the best way to win good luck buddy you did press the go button right uh what go button have you tried it hey there we go it's spitting water out the top so I guess that's just to maintain its buoyancy yeah cool we had wanted to put
a GoPro on it for this but they warned us that uh it's a pretty delicate Balancing Act having it at exactly the right level for the skimmers to work so theoretically it should map first yeah so it made it to the bottom but my question is does it have a sensor to know when the basket is full or is it just going to like try and pick up all of this it has 20 sensors but I don't actually know what they do sick hey it pick stuff up though or at least shuffled it around moved it look there a
clean spot yeah look at this plume it's just spewing green on the back beautiful plumage I checked this footage from before and you can't hear it up here but the microphone picked it up the beat pot's like I hate my life I hate my life I hate my it's like Colin it doesn't complain it's a robot you know if it kicks up enough sediment we may not be able to find it that's a good point is she surfacing I thought it was but oh she's doing something oh no she's she's cruising man
it's going along the edge oh okay I can see the little brushies going okay I'd like to make it clear that everyone involved understands that this is not what this robot is for we just wanted to see how it handled a worst case scenario before it goes all the way into the deep end and we lose visual contact should we hook it out and see if it's full all right okay come here little buddy oh shoot I lost it oh no come back little buddy oh no and now I've kicked up all the this pool pole broke in half it's
somewhere in this vague area can Colin swim I'm not sure all I do know is I'm really glad I have the LT hat Pro with water resistant treatment LTT store.com our problem is that water blocks any RF communication so there's no hope of using the app to summon it back and cloudy water blocks visual communication so we have no idea where it is now I mean it's still doing stuff but there's no way it would have enough capacity to keep picking things up at this point it'll do its thing and come
up eventually right well if it gets trapped in the weeds though oh true that and there's a truck down there still I can see maybe the top third of the pole Jordan spotted it guys we got it we got it okay yeah we got it oh God she mad wow I think this stuff is too thick too much it's just too much it can't even cuz it's completely gummed up yeah it was probably like that in like a minute yeah that right realistically we expected all of that though the aqua sense Pro is a maintenance robot it's
not going to be able to do anything for your busted up pool equipment so while we wait for the pros to turn this Titanic into a treasure courtesy of beatbot who's going to be helping with the restoration let's take the aqua sense Pro over to my place and look at a more realistic reasonable scenario only problem is it's kind of too clean mess it up boys and don't tell Ivon we did this oh God uh oh okay that's probably it really well now my hand covered in glass you you threw glass in the pool that's
the pool guy gave me what the hell didn't they just service this today too a little bit while Jordan gets the chisin clarifying agent kit installed I'm just going to poke around in the app a little bit and see what we can do here and I guess we're not going to do quick mode Let's go ahead and do floor wall and waterline we got Le on the surface too we should do surface as well okay right thanks honestly there's not really that much to configure well no once it's done it'll give you a report on there as well
about what it's done cool theoretically that's it we're good to go pro lights on you want to do the honors this feels so wrong that oh we didn't even talk about what it's supposed to do when it's done it's supposed to come back to kind of where it started and then park at the side so you can just grab it out I guess we'll see this is cool obviously it's going to disconnect if it goes below the surface but right now it's got a Wi-Fi signal it's telling me exactly what it's
doing that's awesome it's definitely doing stuff this time we can see that it is picking up leaves which is kind of cool I mean it might have been doing something last time we just couldn't see it I don't know if I can find the rhyme reason to its cleaning pattern right now apparently it uses their clever nav navigation system with Sonic scent sensors and intelligent path optimization whatever that means we're testing the obstacle avoidance by hucking that frisbee in there so we'll
see what happens there and it has a different mode powered by a quad core arm CPU that handles irregular shapes and difficult transitions it's got nine Motors to run things and uses an S pattern for the floor with an N pattern for the walls and waterline and an S pattern for the surface all of that is in theory so far though let's see how it does so I think this means it wants to  full take a look at that oh wow once it came to the surface it reconnected to the phone app and it told us that it
wanted the basket cleaned so we've got that done we're going to put it back in  happens looks like I want attenion again so it's telling us to clean the basket again still at half battery that's pretty good so it tells us it spent whatever amount of time on the floor cleaning was interrupted due to clogged filter basket it we're back on the surface again after another 44 minutes so now we're uh right about 2 hours of cleaning time yep that's gross again we got a good pile going there we're starting to
lose some daylight and we're not quite done so I think we're just going to put this thing back on the charger and come back another day to finish up we're also down to about 30% of our battery life so this guy could use a little snack before we put him back in the pool we're back it's a much nicer day today so we're going to throw the bot back in the pool cool and see what happens beat butt told us it won't clean stairs but they didn't mention that it just seems to have trouble with the
entire concept of stairs is getting hung up here batbot does have a new multis Zone mode in testing that they say should enable the aquisense pro to handle big sets of stairs like these but unfortunately it wasn't made available   it looks like it's just stopped on us here uh as far as we can tell the light's flashing red so we're going fishing it's giving another battery warning uh but let's just look at the cleaning record here 123 on the floor 44 on the walls hasn't managed to make the Surface
yet I don't know how they're claiming 9 and 1/2 hours of battery life in any mode here oh wow I think that's the fullest we've seen it there's actually a lot of leaves I will give it that we've giving the aquisense some time to recharge and throwing it back in the pool unfortunately it's gone back to floor mode so at this rate we might get the surface of the pool clean sometime next year I should make it clear we have updated the firmware followed all the directions properly it does its own
thing when you put it back in the water beat butt support gave us a little help with the app so we're going to get this thing going on just the surface this time what we have to do is unselect the ones we don't want and that's it there we go at the end of the day or I guess days wow we've put the aquisense pro through quite the ringer and it picked up a ton of debris from the pool far more than I would have really expected given its intended light pool maintenance every few weeks use
case and as the bot gets more exposure to North American Pools and beatbot pushes out updated firmware and apps we expect to see the aquisense pro to continue to improve over time so if you want to be along for the ride we're going to have links and who knows maybe a promo code down in the video description in the meantime a big thanks to beatbot and the pros at Mr pool who have finally completed this incredible transformation of My Neighbor's Pool can you believe Jordan that there's a tile
mosaic bottom on this pool I had no idea I didn't even know it was blue this thing's gone from terrifying to honestly kind of tempting all that's left is to put a bow on the aqua sense Pro and hope that it enjoys its new home fingers crossed if you guys liked this video maybe you'll like the one where we tried a lawn mowing robot that was actually one of Jordan's first videos how do you get stuck with all these just lucky
