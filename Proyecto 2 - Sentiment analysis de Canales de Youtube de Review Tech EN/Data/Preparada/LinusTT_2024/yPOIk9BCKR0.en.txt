of the desk that's rare which is very rare who's that cutie oh hello were you watching setup doctor on both setups hold on so you're watching setup doctor here and you didn't think that was sing hard enough so you had to watch it on this computer too uh this is really great for ventilation on the PlayStation 4 put on top of a bunch of underwear um it's also just a bad spot to have your underwear yeah ew ew is that underwear pick your socks up that's a those are scrunchies

big this gu was at LTX 2023 represent I like that we got like a retro area with the old IM oh I love those beautiful I like this CD art too CRT of some sort that's an iMac cut that cut that for the love of God cut that what is he making why is he doing this why are you making lus smile I don't like it what are you doing what are you doing in projecting lonus in 3D space somehow uh this is It's just somebody's room they it work yeah Nate good setup good room yeah great great 
damn yeah like that is a nice desk I like the plywood a man after lonus his own heart playing ano 1800 drinking a Twisted Tea single Twisted with the with the graphing calculator hell yeah yeah this guy this guy lives a life of some sort big basement energy yeah absolutely but making the most out of it I love the uh the ethernet going through the ceiling it's still okay that's not that bad come on you made you put the point of the other cables you could put that one up put the Twisted DT down for a second

when they have more stuff going on this is why there's nothing going on so you can't have your four messy cables or whatever it is because that's all that looks at immediately what we see I like how you have uh you're nice carpet protector sadly it did not protect this stain from happening grow weed no it's not weed look like weed I'm joking I don't grow it myself neither do I but why why do you think well it's it's green editor cut all of this let's just move on what your dog looks absolutely
Terri terrified your dog looks like he's going to die you've cornered him got the lotion on the bed yeah like glad you moved it off your desk and he was me wow okay man it doesn't matter you just don't worry about it okay like you it's the moment you get over it the moment you realize that it it didn't mean anything in the past okay trust me I've been there wow okay so he's got this diagram that I don't care about I okay I was going to say I don't care about your network diagram but then Luke
was very excited so I'll let you go KVM setup yeah this is legit and it's a desktop and laptop KVM setup this is sick this is very cool this is cool that's not cool that's way way why does that always happen every time it's always the next the next picture this guy has a server rack but couldn't afford a table to put his printer on it just sits on the floor what why is the soundar just there by a table listen you can find furniture for free really easily anywhere it's just not that hard
you have no excuse to have both of your printers on the ground just put you have a rack I don't know rack about just put a table there this monitor arm is crying it's like oh God I'm trying so hard get old the waight of it please yeah this person needs to spend all of the money that they very clearly have on a nicer desk yeah and maybe some artwork I don't know like a single art cool setup technically on the on that side  mag is what kind of splooge stain is that yeah what is that this is taken on
my 2004 Canon personal handheld camera see this person has an excuse for not having a table cuz they they haven't wasted their money on a fancy camera or like a nice monitor couldn't hold still for your image Star Wars Lego I feel like the investment is interesting here looking at the desk that they have versus the probably like $800 worth of Star Wars Lego I like how they got again priorities the cheapest AliExpress desk plus the largest Lego set I have seen in my damn life look at that box they
clearly bought the like death star that's like $800 yeah and they're just using it as a stand they're not even like oh yeah it's an investment because like Lego goes up in value no they're just like they just don't understand how good it could be to have a real table that's one of those like calm you down Bowl things whatever they're called oh are you  yeah yeah this is nice we got we got we got a stack we got a wireless charger oh they got pke audio this is like kind of a nice setup yep and big
Fen but they take care of it yeah got some nice little figurines this seems like a really good setup are you happy now hi Barry this is your this satisfies you no cuz it's not in my room don't include that editor wipe your walls what are you doing  clean you can tell that this guy has like really dry feet cuz it's like scraping the side like the paint off of it it's just oh my God don't zoom in wash your feet stop change it wash your feet how much how much would it take for you to lick it h five bucks but
besides the dirty feet this is a really nice spot like yeah this is a good basement I like how you have a vent instead of a window that's pretty chill you know overall like it's a nice setup why did you submit it to get fixed  it this person loves wasting money hell yeah this is my type of set up we're figurine maxing woo sorry sorry you okay over there I got to stop looking copious amounts of manga copious amounts of figurines look at the size of that one in the bottom right of
that case that is not cheap okay I am not at all surprised at the Final Fantasy n Walker background given um all of this stuff uh all of this stuff uh I like it this stuff uh pretty much everything around here and uh the mouse pad and everything else the N Walker background just totally it fits in makes sense I like it this person does not know what savings are this person has never heard of a tax shelter this person has the impulse control of a three-year-old boy okay oh my God so much money is there two
computers as well and a screen on the front of their computer oh my God so they have also met someone that is equally irresponsible wow they're enabling each other I do love the neon curvy that's not lit up oh and they even  grass I like the honey I'm going to buy something I'm going to buy it I'm going to buy it babe babe look babe the grass is right there touch grass it's just to remind you every so often that is cheating by the way you do not get credit for touching grass if you touch your wall I
like this setup buddy here probably makes an obscene amount of money yeah sis admin on the left sis admin for sure if he decides to quit it the entire infrastructure of a company is just completely leaving well Kevin I hope you  decisions overall this is really nice though like I appreciate the art in the background I like how we've murdered grou for crimes against humanity looks like he's hang baby Yoda holy sorry to hear that maybe you don't murder children aliens down here the
desk has taken damage yeah what are you doing when what are you doing they're playing the brain teaser game they're like those damn sandpaper shirts you know yeah the whole every why did they send us two photos that's it there's only these two I'm mad that that makes me more mad than any set up so stupid why why would you submit two photos the exact same rough moving on I'm you deserve no more and if you want to watch more roasts like this you can see extras for this very video on flow.com you need 
right this is a real living at my desk kind of scenario we got the metal Chopsticks we got the lotion we got the hand sany we got is it a 3D printed top part of a mug is it 3D printed mug for pacing yourself the lube the lube that's the lube baby certified goon these pictures are so close what is it ah thank you this look is that's a that's a foot input that's like a foot pad oh my God that thing that is the most sweatiest that's like a sweaty 2008 csgo player whoa wow this immediately became the maximalist
of maximalist setups buddy's got a lot of stuff like a lot of stuff like a whole lot of stuff I hope this person doesn't live anywhere near where earthquakes happen cuz they are dead the moment an earthquake hits we've got a headphone holder here which is not being used at all and we've got like a dozen turkey trays this person literally this is this is definitely I live here what is this are they trying to tell us something oh that's the submission for the nice nice yeah it was okay you made the best of
what set some of these May me angry I'm not angry I'm not angry now on to Matt who has a 3D printer apparently yeah and he doesn't use it had a 3D printer now he has a mass this is horrible this sucks yeah please go home what is what is anything here yeah the stack of hard drive holy crap that's a lot of hard drives yeah that's a lot of hard drives how big are they twoo only two terabytes so that's not too insane I don't even know if I want to say I think I want them to fall over I think I think they
need to learn from this and it's it's not going to be that bad of a lesson cuz they're 2 ter hard drives this man pirates for sure I think it needs to there needs to be something that happens from I'm so mad at this someone needs to bump this desk this person needs to learn to never do this again he got another hard dve another hard drive somebody tell this man about ssds please what is the fan taped to the top of his power supply that is so good these are our viewers meaning they've probably watched
us build a computer and know what to not do and what to do I have mounted drives in weird sketchy ways out of almost necessity before I think this is just laziness I think this could have fit in the computer this person's like it works 100% well I mean clearly that's what they would say uh I I really hate this I also like how not stereo the speaker setup is it's not oh I think that's a nice part about mov movable pairs if you want the mono experience you're tired of The Beatles having the drums all the way
in one ear you can just go here and then you feel great this man this man eating his Skittles with a fork oh LT water bottle so there's more hard drives that we didn't originally see on the other side of the stack and the hard Drive Bays that are in the computer are empty I'm fuming I'm really mad I just don't get it overall like decent setup but could definitely use just a little bit of a tidy not a big tidy no I could use a big tidy this needs a big tidy this guy needs to prioritize he also needs a 
pad oh that's beautiful the window you got that a brown this is amazing what holy crap this is incredible oh separate numpad after my own heart a separate numpad on the right side be on their Mouse this is a person of absolute culture they deserve no reduction in points for anything right now let's go to the next photo there's got to be more I don't know okay there was this is rough it wasn't worth trying to get some free cable management to to to you know when you could have just
claimed this and then now everyone knows  well I like the like full desk desk pad that's kind of cool it can be it can be a little bit more complicated find a desk pad that actually matches your whole desk cables are big oof Omega R those are going to be right by your feet you're probably like you're probably just like playing with it they did this this needs some help why you made it worse by tying whatever to it you've made it so much worse the cables that are stretched around just to touch that
thing cut off the end of your zip ties please I don't think the table leg is the right move here I appreciate that you all the way at the bottom of the table for like 17 seconds thought about doing cable management and then abandon it but you should come back to the topic ew it's so hairy why is it so hairy I really hope that they have a dog that legitimately looks like dead like Daddy Long Legs yeah that's pretty gross dude also like look at the CPU Cooler yuck yeah that's
see better days you should take that off you should just get a different CPU Cooler if you're running a 3080 I don't know what CPU you have but it probably wants more cooling than thaty oh the computer's dented do you see it the very top did you drop your computer D that may be why the side panel's not on nice little console setup here we got when you get the green Xbox they even have their verification can there this corner is like presistin that's really nice this is really out of nowhere this is
super nice dude that Xbox looks so good that is incredibly sick I really wish I had this Halo 3 helmet I have one of those this is super sick this is a really cool area I I I Vibe I do as well wa whoo look at that Pikachu N64 damn okay that's actually sick that's so cool that totally makes up for the copious amount of Funko Pops you up honestly disappointed yeah I'm pretty mad that this as our audience could have done better we need to take some amount of responsibility for this I think yeah
